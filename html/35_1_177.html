	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should immediately make 
an official public apology, accompanied by financial compensation, to the 
hundreds of citizens of Quebec who were victims of arbitrary arrest and 
unjustified detention during the enforcement of the War Measures Act in the 
early '70s.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is with some emotion, not to say very 
strong emotion, that I rise in this House today to recall tragic 
events in the memories of Quebecers, involving individuals and 
the exercise of democracy in the 1970s. I will also be referring, 
in the course of this motion, to actions and events that continue 
today.
<P>
	You have just read, Mr. Speaker, the motion that I tabled on 
October 5, 1994 in this House, which, in brief, has two 
objectives: to put the record straight with regard to the October 
events, in particular the imposition of war measures, and to 
recognize the victims of the imposition of the War Measures 
Act, on the one hand, and on the other, to disassociate the 
sovereignist movement from the unfortunate events of the time 
initiated by members of the FLQ. I refer, naturally to the death 
of Pierre Laporte in 1970.
<P>
	Why are we making this motion in the House today? First, I 
repeat that it was tabled in October 1994, at the time of the 
release of the movie ``Octobre'' by director Pierre Falardeau, 
depicting the days leading up to the death of Pierre Laporte. This 
film was subsidized in part by the National Film Board, if I am 
not mistaken, and aroused the indignation and ire of some of my 
hon. colleagues in the Reform Party and in the Liberal Party in 
this House.
<P>
	What did my hon. colleagues say? I refer simply to the 
remarks of the Reform member for Calgary Southeast, who, in 
her criticism of the funding of Mr. Falardeau's film, linked 
separatists, members of the FLQ and the cause of sovereignty in 
Quebec. They implied-and so  did several members of the 
Liberal Party, this being the argument of our federalist 
opponents-that such organizations were part of the same camp 
as all the pro-sovereignty groups and individuals who have been 
supporting the cause using democratic means for over 25 years; 
I am referring naturally to the Parti Quebecois and its 
predecessors, the RIN and RN, and to the Bloc Quebecois, which 
has only been on the scene for the past few years.
<P>
	I would first like to state loud and clear that no sovereignist, 
no official spokesperson of the democratic sovereignist 
movement, has never even considered supporting, in any way 
whatsoever, the criminal acts committed by certain individual 
members of the FLQ. On the contrary, in 1970, just days after 
the assassination of Pierre Laporte and the imposition of war 
measures, representatives from all sectors of Quebec society 
denounced these actions, especially the late René Lévesque, 
leader of the Parti Quebecois at the time. Making this distinction 
is important because the individuals who perpetrated the crimes 
assumed the consequences, were judged, sentenced and have 
paid their dues to society.
<P>
	I would first like to demonstrate the impact these incidents, in 
particular the enforcement of war measures, have had on the 
lives of many fellow Quebecers and on our collective 
democracy in general.
<P>
	In 1970, I was a member of the Parti Quebecois, and still am, 
and back then, I was garnering support in the riding of 
Frontenac, a rural riding in which Lac-Mégantic was the biggest 
town at the time. I was working for the Parti Quebecois. We had 
just been through our first election, on April 29, 1970. Please 
bear in mind that back then being a member of the Parti 
Quebecois was not easy in that kind of a community, a 
community that I respect and which was adamantly against all 
``ists'': communists, separatists, socialists, péquistes. It was not 
easy garnering support democratically for the sovereignty cause 
in such a context.
<P>
	When Mr. Pierre Laporte was assassinated, it struck a 
dissonant chord within me, I was bowled over, indignant, 
frightened.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	In my heart of hearts, I did not feel that the cause I was 
fighting for justified killing a man in order to achieve our goal. 
Like hundreds of thousands of my fellow citizens, I was and still 
am convinced that this should be accomplished in a democratic 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11030"> 11030 </A></B>
<P>
fashion. That is why we,  sovereignists, will not allow anyone to 
question our desire to act democratically.
<P>
	Second, I wish to point out that I was even more staggered and 
even sickened when, a few years after the October 1970 events 
and the imposition of the War Measures Act, I realized-like all 
of Quebec-that the federal government of the day, of which the 
current Prime Minister was a member, used the unconscionable 
acts of a few individuals to plan what can be called a political 
coup intended to destabilize the sovereignist movement.
<P>
	I hear my colleague from the Reform Party groaning. I would 
ask him to show a little respect and forbearance. He will be able 
to speak after I have concluded. I am expressing what thousands 
of Quebecers felt at the time. They were mistreated and felt 
betrayed by the federal government, when they realized that it 
was all just a political plot. In 1969, long before the October 
1970 events, discussions about these groups of individuals 
acting illegally in Quebec were held at the highest level of 
government, also known as the cabinet. They knew that these 
groups existed and surely knew who their members were, but 
were careful not to intervene. They waited for the right moment 
to impose the War Measures Act.
<P>
	After this act was imposed, hundreds of people were arrested 
and detained illegally, without any charges being laid against 
them. I would like to quote a few figures and I would ask all my 
colleagues to pay attention. It is not only two or three people 
who were arrested, but more than 500. Five hundred people were 
arrested and detained, in some cases for a few weeks, without 
any charges being laid against them either during the October 
events or afterwards.
<P>
	There were 4,600 cases of search and seizure were carried out 
throughout Quebec. The police entered private homes for all 
kinds of reasons, conducting searches and frightening ordinary 
people. Some 31,700 searches were carried out. These figures, 
in my opinion, demonstrate the significant consequences of 
imposing the War Measures Act. This act was enforced twice in 
Canada, the first time in 1918 and the second time during the 
October events.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	I would just like to come back to another point, namely the 
fact that this is still going on today. Our friends from the Reform 
Party should pay particular attention to what I am about to say. 
Let us think back to the Grant Bristow affair, a few months ago. 
Bristow, a Heritage Front militant and known agitator infiltrated 
the Reform Party and moved in circles close to the leader of this 
party. We must realize that this is still happening today. And on 
the eve of the referendum debate, I ask the federal government, 
our Liberal friends and our Reform friends to respect the wishes 
of Quebecers. I ask that the federal government give the people 
of Quebec the assurance that every effort will be made to ensure 
that a democratic debate can take place, without the  secret 
services or CSIS attempting to manipulate public opinion in 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier:</B> I would like to take the few minutes remaining 
to emphasize that such activities went on after the War Measures 
Act was repealed, activities of the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Agency (CSIS) which, I repeat, are known, having 
been brought to light by a number of inquiries, such as the 
Keable Commission in Quebec, which uncovered a whole string 
of illegal acts committed by various individuals linked to the 
Canadian secret service. The Macdonald Commission of Inquiry 
also uncovered many illegal activities by RCMP officers.
<P>
	I would also like to show how such activities affected the lives 
of these citizens. Just take the case of this man, a respectable 
Montreal lawyer by the name of Pierre Cloutier, who was 
investigated by the RCMP without his knowledge. Mr. Cloutier 
was under RCMP supervision for 11 years. What does Mr. 
Cloutier do for a living? This gentleman is a respected lawyer 
who was never accused of any wrongdoing and who acts as 
arbitrator in Quebec labour conflicts. For some ten years, 
employers and unions have called on him to settle their disputes. 
His credibility therefore is unimpeachable. Again, because Mr. 
Cloutier was somehow connected with individuals who were 
involved in the FLQ, or because he is still active in the 
sovereignty movement, the RCMP secretly followed him for 11 
years, from 1970 to 1981.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> This is a shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier: </B>When Mr. Cloutier asked to see his file, what 
did he find? First, he found a file which is 1,500 pages thick.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	Just imagine: fifteen hundred pages on a single individual 
who never ran into any trouble with the law. Moreover, 1,000 of 
these pages are censored. This is the work of institutions which 
monitor the activity of sovereignists who want to act in full 
compliance with the democratic process. We all remember the 
case of an individual arrested in 1970, and his wife too. I am 
referring to Mr. Gérald Godin and Mrs. Pauline Julien. We all 
know about the illegal and criminal activities of Mr. Godin: he 
was a member of Quebec's National Assembly, and a Quebec 
minister for some ten years.
<P>
	There is no doubt that this suspicious individual was under 
close surveillance by our federal institutions. Mr. Godin was 
illegally imprisoned in 1970. He was detained without any 
charges laid against him. What conclusion did he draw from 
those days? Let me read you a poem written by Mr. Godin after 
the October 1970 events. The poem is entitled ``October''. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11031"> 11031 </A></B>
<P>
apologize for my English pronunciation, but I must read this 
poem in the language in which it was written by its author. In 
reference to those events, including his arrest, Mr. Godin wrote:

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is what Mr. Godin wrote following the October 1970 
events, and I think we should all reflect on these words. Again, 
the purpose of this motion is to ask the federal government to 
apologize to the victims of illegal arrests, and provide financial 
compensation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has 
been suggested that the House of Commons make an official 
apology to those who were incarcerated during the enforcement 
of the War Measures Act in the early seventies and that these 
people receive financial compensation. According to section 2 
of the War Measures Act, the governor in council may issue a 
proclamation that real or apprehended insurrection exists, and 
this proclamation shall be conclusive evidence that apprehended 
insurrection has existed.
<P>
	Once the proclamation was issued, the governor in council 
had the power to make orders and regulations to deal with the 
situation. As a number of members will recall, the provisions of 
the War Measures Act were invoked in October 1970, with the 
announcement that a state of apprehended insurrection existed 
in the Province of Quebec, in response to serious concerns 
expressed at the time by the Quebec Premier, Robert Bourassa, 
and the authorities of the city of Montreal.
<P>
	In a letter to the Prime Minister of Canada, the Premier of 
Quebec used clear and direct language to describe the dangerous 
situation facing the provincial government. As he said: ``The 
Quebec Government is convinced that such powers are 
necessary to meet the present emergency. Not only are two 
completely innocent men threatened with death, but we are also 
faced with an attempt by a minority to destroy social order 
through criminal action''.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	According to commentator Denis Smith, in referring to the 
events of the fall of 1970: ``During an interview televised on the 
CBC network, Robert Bourassa mentioned a five-step 
revolutionary program: demonstrations, explosions, 
kidnappings, selective assassinations and urban guerilla 
warfare. The first three having apparently been carried out, Mr. 
Bourassa was sufficiently convinced, on October 16, that the 
``program'' was being systematically implemented to believe 
that exceptional measures was necessary. We may question the 
nature and the reliability of the evidence available to Mr. 
Bourassa, but there is no doubt that at the time, Mr. Bourassa felt 
it was conclusive''.
<P>
	Mr. Bourassa and the Montreal authorities felt the evidence 
was conclusive and, on that basis, the federal government 
proclaimed the existence of a state of apprehended insurrection, 
pursuant to section 2 of the War Measures Act. On the basis of 
that proclamation, the government passed the Public Order 
Regulations, 1970.
<P>
	On October 16, 1970, during the debate following the tabling 
of the regulations in the House, the then Minister of Justice, the 
Right Hon. John Turner, gave his colleagues the following 
assurances: ``The procedure by way of proclamation is found 
within the War Measures Act. This is a completely 
constitutional technique. Let me point out more particularly that 
the regulations were issued under powers granted to the 
Governor in Council by Parliament; so that the constitutional 
source of this enactment was, and is, Parliament itself''.
<P>
	The constitutionality of the procedure and of the War 
Measures Act was subsequently also recognized by the courts. 
In <I>Gagnon and Vallières vs. Regina</I>, the Quebec Court of Appeal 
found, as had all court decisions up to then, that, under the War 
Measures Act and the constitution as it existed at the time, no 
judicial control could be exercised over the evidence in support 
of the decision by the governor in council to declare that a state 
of insurrection was feared. This decision was the exclusive 
jurisdiction of the governor in council.
<P>
	The Quebec Court of Appeal also implicitly recognized the 
considerable precedents confirming the constitutionality of the 
War Measures Act. The courts have always held that the law is a 
valid exercice of Parliament's authority to adopt legislation for 
peace, order and good government in Canada.
<P>
	The government of the time made a value judgment, which it 
was legally and constitutionally entitled to make on the basis of 
information available at the time.
<P>
	It must also be pointed out that the federal government got 
involved in the Quebec crisis at the express request of the 
Government of Quebec. Following the crisis, the Quebec 
ombudsman investigated complaints of unfair treatment made 
by a number of people involved in the matter. Some of the 
complainants were compensated. Others had their claims 
dismissed. In 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11032"> 11032 </A></B>
<P>
his annual report for 1971, the ombudsman noted that he  felt 
obliged to investigate each complaint submitted to him. He said 
that he investigated the facts and reconstructed them insofar as 
possible. He tried to understand each person's situation and was 
able to consult files that seemed relevant.
<P>
	The matter was settled provincially, and it is not up to this 
government or to Parliament to re-examine it.
<P>
	Almost 25 years have passed since the events of October 
1970. In this period, the legislative and political climate in 
Canada has changed considerably. We have witnessed the 
emergence of a strong tendency to protect individual rights, 
expressed more specifically in the enshrinement of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the constitution. Canadians' 
changing attitude is also reflected in the broad interpretation the 
courts have given to the charter.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Not only has the constitutional landscape of Canadian society 
changed since 1970, but also the legislation itself. The 
Government and Parliament of Canada have replaced the War 
Measures Act with the Emergencies Act, which limits the 
amount of force which can be used to deal with an emergency. 
The government would not be able to tap the wide-ranging 
powers it did in 1970 as easily today. This is also a reflection of 
how societal attitudes have evolved.
<P>
	Judged within today's legislative, judicial and philosophical 
framework, some people would question the government's 
response to the events of 1970. Nevertheless, the fact remains 
that, at the time, the government did what it judged was 
necessary and what the constitutional and legislative framework 
in place then legally entitled it to do.
<P>
	During the November 4, 1970 debate in the House on the 
legislation introduced to replace the regulations, Mr. Turner 
said the following: ``And to suggest, as some members of the 
opposition have, that because an insurrection did not occur, 
therefore it could not have been apprehended, is an exercice in 
false logic''.
<P>
	This statement is more revealing 25 years after the fact than it 
was immediately following it. In 1970, the Government of 
Quebec apprehended an insurrection. The federal government 
acted, and its actions were driven by that apprehension. The 
measures it took were approved by tribunals and deemed to be in 
step with the powers which the law conferred to the government 
at that time.
<P>
	We can and must learn from the past. The question begging an 
answer is whether we should review the past or invest in the 
future. We believe that the best choice is to use the government's 
limited resources to secure a brighter future for generations to 
come.
<P>
	Any residents of Quebec who had been unjustly or arbitrarily 
targeted by the measures have been compensated by the 
Province of Quebec. In my opinion, it would be futile to rehash 
yet again this rocky period in Canada's history.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to read the motion to make it clear. Motion 
No. 332 reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should immediately make 
an official public apology, accompanied by financial compensation, to the 
hundreds of citizens of Quebec who were the victims of arbitrary arrest and 
unjustified detention during the enforcement of the War Measures Act in the 
early '70s.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Should the War Measures Act have been invoked? The answer 
is very debatable.
<P>
	It might serve the purpose of the House to go through a bit of 
the history of the time. In late 1969 some bombs were detonated 
in Montreal at the Board of Trade and le Club Canadien. In 
February 1970 Charles Gagnon, the FLQ leader, was freed on 
bail. In May 1970 Pierre Vallières was freed on bail. In June 
1970 the justice minister of Quebec, Jérôme Choquette, 
announced a $50,000 reward for information on activities 
leading to the arrest of key members of the FLQ. The reward led 
to tips which allowed the various police forces, the Quebec 
Provincial Police, the Montreal police and the RCMP, to make 
arrests.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	It is helpful to realize all those forces were at work. It allowed 
them to make a series of arrests and uncover information which 
cited the FLQ's intent to kidnap the Israeli and American 
consuls as a sign of protest against American imperialism and 
the FLQ's solidarity with the Palestine liberation movement.
<P>
	On October 5, 1970, James Cross, the senior trade 
commissioner at the British Trade Commission was abducted by 
the FLQ. On October 10, Pierre Laporte, the minister of labour 
in the Bourassa cabinet, was kidnapped. On October 15 the 
federal cabinet agreed to use the War Measures Act if the 
situation deteriorated. On October 16 the cabinet made the 
decision and implemented it. On October 18, two days after the 
implementation of the War Measures Act, the body of Pierre 
Laporte was discovered. On October 19, one day later, the House 
voted to support the government's decision.
<P>
	On November 2 a bill called Public Order Temporary 
Measures Act was introduced to replace the War Measures Act. 
That bill correctly was limited to the FLQ. On December 1 the 
bill was passed in the House, 174 to 31.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11033"> 11033 </A></B>
<P>
	Meanwhile, earlier in November the famous Montreal five: 
Lemieux, Vallieres, Gagnon, Chartrand and Larue-Langlois, 
were charged with seditious conspiracy and membership in the 
FLQ. On December 3 Mr. Cross was freed. Finally in January 
the troops were removed.
<P>
	I would like to run that measure of events against my own 
memory of the incidents. In 1964 I was a staff officer at the 
headquarters of the eastern Quebec area when the Queen was 
about to visit. The FLQ at that time was making a lot of noise. In 
fact, the Queen's life was threatened. The general officer 
command in Quebec command at that time went to Quebec City 
and talked to me, among others, asking if the Queen's visit 
should be cancelled. My counsel to that general at the time was 
that we should not because we did not know the extent of the 
FLQ presence. Surely this would be taking too reactionary a step 
against an enemy that was supposedly very small and turned out 
to be quite small. I think the counsel was correct at the time. It 
was saying, do not over-react.
<P>
	In 1970 I found myself as the commanding officer of the 
Cinquième battalion de services à Valcartier. I was living 
through all of these events. I was kept fairly busy because I was 
first of all told to provide some of my troops to help the infantry. 
I had to establish an advance base in Montreal and take part in 
the security of base Valcartier.
<P>
	My personal conclusion from all of these events was that the 
invocation of the War Measures Act was not justified. The same 
conclusion can be reached by others. If we look at the ``Queen's 
Quarterly'' the Commissioner of the RCMP at the time, William 
Higgitt, was even more blunt.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	He made it clear that he had never been asked for his opinion 
on the efficacy of invoking the act but only on the mechanics of 
implementing it. He added that if it conferred certain advantages 
to the police, there were many disadvantages, not the least of 
which were the excessive powers granted the Quebec police and 
the misuse of these powers that went on unchecked.
<P>
	The commission pressed for documentation of the 
apprehended insurrection. Higgitt said that there was none. He 
went further to insist that he would have stopped somewhat 
short of using the words ``rebellion'' or ``open rebellion''. I had 
greater faith in the people concerned than that.
<P>
	From all these things I would conclude that the Liberal 
government of 1970 was a bit like the Liberal government of 
today. It could see this thing coming but failed to act, or it 
deliberately invoked the War Measures Act for political 
purposes.
<P>
	I can see the current Liberal government acting in the same 
way. Look at the dock strikes. Look at the stevedore strike, the 
railway strike. It is either too little, too late or it is just the 
opposite, a total over-reaction. As one critic  said at the time, it 
is like cracking a peanut with a sledgehammer.
<P>
	My conclusion on this motion is that the problem in Quebec 
was with the Quebec forces as much as with the federal forces. 
As we have seen, all the Quebec police forces; the QPP, the 
Montreal city police and the RCMP were all involved in this.
<P>
	In my judgment, the Bloc Quebecois is not wrong in making 
this motion. I cannot go along with it but it is not wrong. It is 
being used as a warning of what can happen in a democratic 
country such as ours. At the same time, nothing can excuse the 
crimes that were committed nor is the Bloc trying to excuse 
them. Crimes were committed by the FLQ and nothing can 
excuse that.
<P>
	In my view the government of today is not in a position to 
make an apology nor should it make financial compensation. 
Undoubtedly there were some innocent victims in all of this but 
we cannot prove it today. It would be of no value to try to bring it 
all to light again and find out who was innocent and who was not. 
The blame should be shared around. But I cannot condemn the 
Bloc Quebecois for bringing the motion up today. Let it act as a 
warning of what can happen in a democratic society.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
Reform colleague for his good judgment and honest approach. 
As for the hon. member for Nickel Belt, once more he did what 
the federalists have always wanted done when dealing with 
Quebec, that is getting a French Canadian to use strong arm 
tactics against other French Canadians.
<P>
	I am pleased to rise on this motion, introduced by my friend 
and colleague, the hon. member for 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead. In 1970, I was 24, I was 
married and the father of a young child, therefore old enough to 
appreciate what was going on in Canada at the time.
<P>
	Young Quebecers, troubled by inequalities, injustices and the 
lack of opportunities in Canadian businesses, had joined in the 
fight against the injustices suffered by the Quebec people. They 
used means which we still disapprove of and which were 
definitely wrong.
<P>
	The Prime Minister of the time, Mr. Pierre Elliott Trudeau, 
was in the third year of his mandate and he decided, after several 
cabinet meetings, to put Quebec back in its place. Several 
Quebec ministers sat in on those cabinet meetings, including, to 
name just a few, the present Prime Minister, then Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development; Mr. Jean-Luc Pepin, 
Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce; Mr. Gérard 
Pelletier, Secretary of State and Jean Marchand, people who 
used to be called, in Quebec, the three doves, but whose hearts 
were 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11034"> 11034 </A></B>
<P>
blacker than the blackest raven to be found along Highway 417, 
coming into Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	This small group decided at cabinet level to invoke the War 
Measures Act, an act which, previously, had only been used in 
wartime. Invoking the War Measures Act was enough in itself to 
traumatize the people of Quebec which, at the time, was 
overwhelmingly federalist and solidly disapproved of the 
actions of the Front de libération du Québec.
<P>
	The only other time this legislation was implemented was 
during the conscription riots, in Quebec, in 1918. What was 
different in the October crisis is that Canada was not at war. In 
those days, Canada had three guns; I will remind you that two of 
them were pointing at the crowd in Quebec City, while the third 
one had gone to war in Europe. This is the kind of attention that 
was paid to Quebecers in those days. And the great Canadian 
army in all this? October 16, 1970 marked the first instance of 
what was to become the army's trade-mark, namely action 
involving civilian populations.
<P>
	We saw what it led to, last year, in Mogadishu, in Somalia. We 
saw the results of such involvement. The military trained in 
Quebec City and in Montreal, and had their finest moment in 
Somalia. I remember when the soldiers arrived in Montreal. I 
was 24, I remember well. They wore helmets and battle fatigues 
with locust tree branches stuck here and there. They carried a 
canteen, their pants were dragging on the ground, and they 
jammed their loaded M-1s in the ribs of secretaries and workers 
on their way to the bus. What a show our great beautiful military 
gave. During the Gulf War, it cost us $300 million to send our 
soldiers to keep watch over latrines and tanker-trucks. This was 
the same army which had practised on Quebec civilians. There is 
nothing to be proud of. At any rate, I am not.
<P>
	The War Measures Act gave certain powers to the governor in 
council in case of war, invasion or insurrection. It stripped 
citizens of their democratic and civil rights. The executive 
reigned supreme and could act unchecked. The state of 
insurrection only existed in the mind of the then Prime Minister, 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and of the members of his Cabinet, 
including the current Prime Minister who was there then.
<P>
	Things had been on the move in Quebec from the early 1960s. 
Instruments of democracy were sprouting left and right. The 
Caisse de placement et de dépôt du Québec, the nationalization 
of electricity and the health insurance plan threatened the very 
existence of powerful economic interests owned by the English 
Canadian and British establishment. This situation had gone on 
for too long, and it was time to end any idea of Quebec 
autonomy.
<P>
	The then prime minister attacked Quebec nationalism, just as 
the military commanders of ancient times tried to batter down 
the main gate of towns under siege, for once this gate was 
breached, the towns were sure to fall. On closer examination, 
this was not the first time the military  machine had gone to the 
aid of the political arm when the latter had exhausted its means 
of persuasion.
<P>
	In addition to the episode in 1918 that I mentioned earlier, 
there were also the incidents involving native peoples and Métis 
in western Canada between 1870 and 1884. A truly magnificent 
army.
<P>
	In 1837-38, there were not only francophone Patriotes, there 
were also anglophone Reformers, and they were simply asking 
for the establishment of responsible government and the 
application in their jurisdiction of the principles of justice, 
fairness and freedom.
<P>
	Terrorism, from whatever sector of society, is no less an 
attack on the basic principles of human existence, and Central 
Canada and several English-speaking provinces have resorted 
to it too often. I would remind the brilliant senator, who in his 
time, sympathized with the Parti national social chrétien-the 
famous blue shirts of Adrien Arcand-and who recently 
expressed his concerns about Quebec nationalism, that the 
Governor General drew a comparison between the deportation 
of the Acadians and an all-expenses-paid Club Med vacation.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Manitoba's language laws, which were declared ultra vires by 
the Supreme Court of Canada nearly 100 years after they 
produced their perverse effect; and the unilateral abolition of 
powers at the Privy Council in London, which deserves a closer 
look. It is a little like divorce. Both spouses would like to go 
before the court to settle their differences but the wife could say, 
for example: ``No, my mother will decide which one of us is 
right''. That is about what the abolition of powers at the Privy 
Council in London amounts to. Imagine the kind of justice that 
can come out of this. It was then the only body still able to look 
at both sides and to occasionally restore a semblance of justice 
for Canada's francophones.
<P>
	There was also Ontario's famous Regulation 17 prohibiting 
French-language schools on its territory. That is an act of 
terrorism. The Indian Act-back when the legislation referred 
to them as savages-was aimed at confining this country's first 
inhabitants to well defined areas. I would remind this brilliant 
senator that his art would never have taken him to the pinnacle 
of his career in the other place where he now sits, if he had 
worked in Sault Ste. Marie or Queen's Park. The Minister of 
Canadian Heritage summed up my thoughts the other day in this 
House when he started talking about sheep; you can imagine the 
rest.
<P>
	Do this brilliant senator and the Minister of Industry know 
that the first Jew to be elected to public office in Canada was 
Ezechiel Hart, who became the member for Trois-Rivières in 
Quebec's Legislative Assembly in 1908, and that he was 
dismissed by order of the British government? He did not have 
the right to sit in Parliament because he was Jewish. Catholics 
were only recognized by the government in London in 1828. 
Senator 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11035"> 11035 </A></B>
<P>
Roux and the anglophones who claim that  Quebec nationalism 
is unhealthy should be reminded of that.
<P>
	Everyone agrees now that the War Measures Act denied the 
most fundamental rights to hundreds of Quebecers. Take for 
example the arbitrary arrest of these individuals by police 
bursting into their homes, arresting them without a warrant and 
detaining them for several days, and even weeks in some cases, 
without even allowing their families to be informed.
<P>
	I am not denying that this was an extremely volatile situation, 
but the measures taken were far too extreme. Did our so-called 
civilized society not assume, for a short while, the likeness of a 
dictatorship? I would have so much to say, but I know that a 
strict count of time is kept. Let me just say that, for these 32,000 
searches, Quebecers are entitled if not to financial 
compensation, at least to an apology. It is the least once can 
expect.
<P>
	Apologies have been made to the Italians, the Japanese, the 
Chinese. It seems to me that apologies should also be made to 
every francophone in Canada, and more particularly to those in 
Quebec, for blunders such as the one made in 1970.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to discuss this motion asking the 
federal government to make an apology to those who, let us not 
forget, were the victims of arbitrary arrest and unjustified 
detention. No charges were ever laid against these people. The 
government ordered that these people be arrested and long 
searches were conducted to see if there were any grounds to lay 
charges. No charges were laid because no such grounds existed. 
People were arrested based on claims, without any regard for the 
habeas corpus procedure.
<P>
	Let me tell you an anecdote. In 1970, I was a student at the 
Saint-Augustin seminary, in Cap-Rouge. I was a member of the 
Parti Quebecois, and so was my roommate. The evening that Mr. 
Laporte died, my roommate tore up his PQ membership card. I 
kept mine, and we debated an issue which is still topical today, 
namely that the federal government of the time used the 
reprehensible actions of the FLQ to kill the sovereignist 
movement. The real aim of the operation was to kill the 
sovereignist movement.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	Because of adverse propaganda, membership in the Parti 
Quebecois dropped significantly. However, Quebecers also 
learned a lesson from this episode, a lesson which they will 
remember for a long time: Quebecers opted for democracy. In 
fact, that choice had been made long before, since Quebec has 
the oldest parliamentary institution in North America, as well as 
an appropriate motto which says ``Je me souviens''. We are 
patient; we are prepared to wait, but we will reach our ultimate 
objective, which is Quebec's sovereignty.
<P>
	In all its efforts to kill that project, the federal government 
only succeeded in attacking the will of Quebecers to reach their 
objective not by resorting to violence, but through democratic 
means, and they will succeed.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead 
referred to Mr. Gérald Godin, who was arrested in 1970. The 
best proof that Quebecers did learn their lesson is that, in the 
1976 election, the same person beat Robert Bourassa, who was 
then the federalist on duty. Quebec's long march toward 
sovereignty is based on respect for democracy. The events of 
those days had consequences which can still be felt. The federal 
government's constant attempts to instill fear in Quebecers have 
their roots in the actions taken then, and perhaps also in the 
events which occurred with the patriots, back in 1837. They are 
always trying to rekindle this fear.
<P>
	No one among the federalists in Quebec is selling Canada as 
an option for the future. They are only attacking the other 
option, as if it was always necessary to come back to the same 
arguments: ``Things will not go well, because the sovereignists 
do not want a bright future for Quebec.'' This is in line with the 
oath taken by Pierre Elliott Trudeau in 1970 to rekindle fear, to 
ensure that one can, in a roundabout way, either as Minister of 
Justice or as prime minister, achieve the same results.
<P>
	During the October crisis, when Mr. Trudeau went on national 
television to make a statement on the kidnappings, he said: 
``Next time it could be the manager of a credit union.'' This was 
a demagogic way to say that the FLQ was such a well-organized 
group that it could strike almost anywhere in Quebec, but now 
we know that some of the FLQ cells were backed by the RCMP. 
This makes it a planned strategy to kill the sovereignist 
movement.
<P>
	What we can say today is that the sovereignist movement will 
not die, it is here to stay. We have been using all the democratic 
tools at our disposal since then. We have elected the Parti 
Quebecois, as well as the newest offspring of our movement, the 
Bloc Quebecois, which is here to represent a very strong and 
very clear movement in Canada. It is obvious that as long as the 
Constitutional crisis in Canada is not settled, we will remain 
here, because we have a good memory and we will keep on using 
existing democratic tools. This is how we have decided to carve 
out a place in the sun for ourselves, and this is what we will do in 
the future.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to say that it would be nice for 
those who were illegally arrested and who were never sent to 
trial to get an apology, because their rights were indeed violated. 
The purpose of the motion before us is also to send a message to 
Quebecers and Canadians of the future, to my children, to your 
children, to all young people who are growing up in our society, 
that when errors are made in the system, when the system forgets 
<P>

<B><A NAME="11036"> 11036 </A></B>
<P>
that it is supposed to be democratic, we must have the courage to 
rectify this situation. We must be able to tell  all these young 
people that, in Quebec and in Canada, things are done 
democratically and that it is possible to achieve our goals that 
way.
<P>
	If this motion were adopted by the House, it would show 
people not only that the federal government made mistakes in 
the seventies, that it deliberately took actions that were 
unacceptable, but also that these actions will no longer be 
tolerated.
<P>
	In any case, I think that Quebec will always respond through a 
democratic vote. It will do so again in 1995, or whenever it is 
deemed appropriate, so that Quebec can become sovereign at 
last and not encounter obstacles like those that the federal 
system put in its way in the seventies.
<P>
	I urge the government to think about that. I believe that the 
Reform Party must also think about the appropriateness of the 
federal government making the official apology that the motion 
calls for and to ensure that all those who were illegally arrested 
are informed that the present federal government regrets the 
actions taken by the government of the seventies.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	It would be an indication that members on both sides of the 
House really want to promote democracy as the sole foundation 
of political debates like the one that is going on right now in 
Quebec and in Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 96, the order is dropped from the

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> moved that Bill C-72, an act to 
amend the Criminal Code (self-induced intoxication), be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.
<P>
	I think you will find there is an understanding in the House 
that in respect of this bill the minister will be the one speaker for 
the government. For the official opposition there will be two 
speakers who will divide the 40-minute period allotted to the 
second speaker in this debate without questions or comments. 
For the third party in the House there will be a similar 
arrangement in respect of the 40-minute period they would 
otherwise have. Then there will be a 20-minute speech from a 
member of the New Democratic Party. That should conclude the 
debate.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Just to make this very 
clear, the government will present one speaker, the Bloc 
Quebecois will have two speakers, the Reform Party will have 
two or three speakers, two speakers will also divide the 40 
minutes, and finally I understand the New Democratic Party will 
have a spokesperson for 20 minutes. Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Speaker, on September 30, 1994 the Supreme 
Court of Canada released its reasons for judgment in a case 
called Daviault. The effect of that judgment was to change the 
common law rules concerning criminal liability in cases where 
the accused is extremely intoxicated at the time of the alleged 
offence. The nature of that change, its effect in subsequent cases 
and the concern it caused about the principle of accountability in 
the criminal law lie behind the government's decision to 
introduce Bill C-72 which we are debating today at second 
reading.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	With this bill, Parliament would abolish self-induced 
intoxication as a defence in the case of general intent offences 
involving violence, where basic intent is the only criminal intent 
required. Parliament would thus recognize a standard of care, 
any departure from which would make an unlawful act a 
criminal one.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In leading off second reading debate today, I propose to 
develop the principles underlying the bill and to explain why the 
government believes that Bill C-72 represents a prudent, 
necessary and valid amendment to our Criminal Code.
<P>
	May I first touch upon the state of the law before Daviault. 
There has never been a formal defence of intoxication in the 
Criminal Code. Judges in the facts of specific cases have been 
left to formulate those rules by themselves.
<P>
	Over the decades past, courts have approached this issue by 
creating two categories of intent in the criminal law: general and 
specific.
<P>
	General intent has been taken to mean the basic intention to 
commit a criminal act in a broad category, such as assaulting 
someone or committing a sexual assault on someone.
<P>
	The courts held that by way of distinction, a specific intent 
involves a special purpose in addition to the basic intent. The 
crime of murder, for example, requires the proof of a specific 
intent. It must be established that someone intended to cause a 
death. In theft it must be proven that the specific intent was there 
to achieve the special fraudulent purpose of depriving someone 
of specific property. With respect to the crime of breaking and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11037"> 11037 </A></B>
<P>
entering with intention to commit an indictable offence, again 
the crown had to prove that there was a special purpose in the 
mind of the accused.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Over the decades, the common law courts developed the rule 
that intoxication could be a defence to crimes of specific intent 
but were never a defence to crimes of general intent. As a result, 
if someone was acquitted of a crime of specific intent by reason 
of intoxication, they were almost invariably convicted of an 
included general intent offence. Therefore someone who might 
not be convicted of murder because of intoxication would be 
convicted of manslaughter which required a general intent. A 
person who was acquitted of robbery because of the lack of 
specific intent might be convicted of assault.
<P>
	This approach to intent and the effect of intoxication upon 
criminal liability was one of the topics identified in the review 
of the general part of the Criminal Code launched by the 
Department of Justice last fall. It has been felt for many years 
that it is about time Parliament became involved in clarifying 
the rules with respect to defences and intention rather than 
leaving it to the courts to fashion their own approaches. It was in 
the course of that review of the general part that the Daviault 
judgment was released and its effect became known.
<P>
	As to the judgment in Daviault itself, the effect of that 
judgment was to uphold the traditional distinction between 
crimes of general and specific intent. Another effect was to hold 
that extreme intoxication in some circumstances could be a 
defence even to a crime of general intent.
<P>
	The underlying analysis was that extreme intoxication can 
cause a form of automatism. In the case of Daviault the evidence 
related to the ingestion of alcohol. The court held that in that 
automatic state, the state of automatism, a person would be 
unable to appreciate the nature of the consequence of their 
actions and would be unable to form the intention to commit the 
offence in issue. The court also held that it would be a question 
of fact in each case to determine whether that was so. The onus 
would be upon the accused person to establish that it was so and 
that scientific evidence would almost always be required to 
establish those facts.
<P>
	The majority of the court also held in Daviault that under the 
current common law where self-induced intoxication was not 
held to be a sufficient basis for criminal fault, it would be 
contrary to the principles of the charter of rights and freedoms to 
hold someone criminally responsible for their conduct when 
they are intoxicated to the point of automatism.
<P>
	I observe in passing that although the charter principles were 
touched upon in the facta filed by counsel in Daviault and 
although there was some reference to them in argument, the 
charter principles were not argued extensively or developed in 
detail. Furthermore, I observe that there was no section 1 
evidence tendered by either party in the Daviault case. I also 
observe that the Attorney General of Canada was not invited to 
intervene in that case.
<P>
	The Daviault judgment raised obvious concerns for members 
of Parliament and indeed for all Canadians. The whole question 
of accountability under the criminal law was brought into sharp 
focus.
<P>
	Specific concerns related to crimes of violence against 
women and children. Indeed the Daviault case itself involved an 
allegation of sexual assault against a woman. In the weeks that 
followed the release of the Daviault case, there were other cases 
in various parts of Canada applying its principle, each case 
involving allegations of violence against women.
<P>
	Concern grew that a person might be charged with murder and 
defend on the basis of intoxication. If the extent of intoxication 
was established to be sufficiently extreme, that person might 
walk out of the courtroom entirely free because they were 
incapable of performing a specific intent involving murder and 
because the intoxication was such that they were exculpated 
from the general intent crime of manslaughter. The result would 
be that they would face no sanction at all.
<P>
	Concerns were also expressed that people might manipulate 
the legal principles so as to intoxicate themselves to some extent 
for the purpose of committing a crime. They would then 
intoxicate themselves further afterward before apprehension 
and rely upon the degree of intoxication overall to escape 
liability for the crime.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	Following the release of Daviault and recognizing that change 
was needed, the government examined a variety of options. It 
looked at the prospect of legislating criminal intoxication as an 
offence under the law. Indeed, this suggestion was made almost 
10 years ago by the Law Reform Commission. It suggested that 
we might approach the matter in that fashion. We rejected that 
option for a variety of reasons.
<P>
	The first reason was the penalty. Clearly, it was the view of the 
government that if there was to be accountability in the criminal 
law, then the maximum penalty for any new offence of criminal 
intoxication would have to be the same as the maximum penalty 
for the original offence. Otherwise, we have the spectre of 
having created a drunkenness discount which would give people 
who intoxicate themselves an option to have a lesser penalty for 
the same crime. That obviously is unacceptable. If the maximum 
penalty for the new offence of criminal intoxication was to be 
the same as for the original offence, this would essentially be a 
long and complicated way of saying that intoxication is no 
defence.
<P>
	The second reason for not pursuing the option of creating the 
criminal intoxication offence related to the labelling of the 
offence. The criminal intoxication option rests on the person 
being found not guilty of the original offence and instead found 
guilty of the new offence of criminal intoxication. The govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11038"> 11038 </A></B>
<P>
ment believes that a person who becomes voluntarily 
intoxicated to the point of losing conscious control or awareness 
and in that state causes violence to another person is at fault for 
the  assault and should be held criminally accountable for that 
offence and for nothing less.
<P>
	To acquit the person of the assault and convict them instead of 
a new offence of criminal intoxication would send the message 
that they were not criminally responsible for the assault itself. 
This would feed into the syndrome of blaming the alcohol 
instead of the man for the act of violence.
<P>
	Third, a detailed examination of the criminal intoxication 
option in its various forms established that many of the charter 
and legal theory problems identified by the Supreme Court in 
relation to the common law rule as it applies to basic intent 
would apply with almost as much force to any such new offence.
<P>
	If the new offence were required to be charged, there would be 
no opportunity to do so until trial, when the accused person 
invariably raises the intoxication as a defence and the crown 
becomes aware of it for the first time.
<P>
	If the new offence were to operate as an included offence with 
conviction to follow automatically from acquittal on the main 
offence, a successful defence to that main charge which needs to 
be proven by the accused only on a balance of probabilities 
would be taken as proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the new 
offence of criminal intoxication. That anomaly might itself raise 
serious charter concerns.
<P>
	If conviction for an included offence of criminal intoxication 
were to be not automatic but at the discretion of the judge or 
jury, the question arises whether the simple fact of the acquittal 
would be sufficient to form the foundation for liability for 
criminal intoxication. Would the crown be required to adduce 
additional evidence? If so, how?
<P>
	The question arose of whether the offence of criminal 
intoxication would include an element of causation to prove for 
example that intoxication caused or led to the harm complained 
of.
<P>
	Last, the prospect of the charge of criminal intoxication raised 
the spectre of the prosecuting crown attorney being required to 
argue contradictory positions at trial. One position would be that 
the person was not so intoxicated as to escape responsibility but 
in the alternative the person was intoxicated and therefore 
should be convicted of criminal intoxication.
<P>
	The government also examined the prospect of a charge of 
criminal negligence as a separate offence, criminal negligence 
causing the harm contemplated by the crime in the code based 
upon self-induced intoxication.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	Once again we rejected that approach. It avoided 
accountability for the central misconduct and provided a lesser 
label for the underlying harm which we believe should be 
addressed directly.
<P>
	Having rejected those alternatives, we settled on the approach 
disclosed in Bill C-72. Fundamental to that approach is the 
principle of accountability. We are saying in substance that it is 
no defence to violent crime that you have intoxicated yourself.
<P>
	For Canadians this is not just an issue in common law. This is 
a matter of common sense. I believe it is common sense which is 
reflected in this legislation. The bill applies to the basic intent 
element in all crimes of violence, including sexual violence and 
domestic assault which are of particular concern in relation to 
women and children.
<P>
	This is not a course of mere technicality. The bill addresses an 
important point of principle. People cannot be permitted to hide 
behind drunkenness or other forms of intoxication to escape 
responsibility for their criminal conduct. What the government 
has said in this bill quite plainly, and as a principle of law, is that 
those who make themselves intoxicated and while in that state 
do harm to others cannot rely on their intoxication to escape the 
consequences in law.
<P>
	The government also believes the approach of Bill C-72 
avoids the conceptual and procedural problems I have identified 
in relation to criminal intoxication. I can report that in January 
when I met with the provincial and territorial ministers of 
justice and attorneys general it was this approach in Bill C-72 
that was favoured by all present.
<P>
	The question of the validity of Bill C-72, the constitutional 
validity, has also been carefully considered by the government 
in formulating this legislation. I observe at the outset that in the 
course of the Daviault judgment the Supreme Court of Canada in 
the majority ruling observed it was dealing not with a statute of 
Parliament but with judge-made common law rules and 
therefore did not feel obligated to show the deference it usually 
pays to a statute in determining the validity of the rule to which 
it created an exception in that case.
<P>
	In Daviault the court expressly invited Parliament to 
legislate, to fill the gap created by its analysis of the common 
law. In essence the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in 
the Daviault judgment said that while there is some fault in 
becoming intoxicated, the legal logic of the common law did not 
allow the court to relate that fault to the criminal fault 
underlying the charge.
<P>
	Bill C-72 provides for the link between the fault in 
self-induced intoxication and the harm or fault in the criminal 
conduct which forms the basis of the charge. Bill C-72 creates a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11039"> 11039 </A></B>
<P>
legislative standard of care. It says expressly that if you 
intoxicate yourself to the point at which you lose conscious 
control and do harm to another, you have departed from a 
standard of care we are entitled to expect from each other.
<P>
	With that criminally blameworthy misconduct you are not 
entitled to rely on your self-induced intoxication as a defence in 
law. That is the link that was missing when the court analysed 
the common law rule in Daviault. By this bill we are inviting 
Parliament to provide that link and to demonstrate that 
self-induced intoxication will not be a response.
<P>
	While we are creating a legislative standard of care it is not 
the case that the crown attorney will have to prove in each case 
that there was a departure from the standard. It is not the case 
that standard is open to different interpretations depending on 
who is prosecuting, who is judging and where the case is being 
tried. We are stating in Bill C-72 conclusively that intoxicating 
yourself to the point at which you lose conscious control and 
harm others is a departure from the standard of care.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	That is not going to be an issue at a future trial. It is a 
conclusive assertion by the House of Commons and the 
Parliament of Canada as the starting point for determining 
criminal liabilities.
<P>
	Another important feature from a constitutional perspective 
is that the Daviault judgment was in relation to all crimes in the 
Criminal Code. The analysis of the Supreme Court of Canada 
was in relation to the criminal law generally.
<P>
	Bill C-72 has been crafted so that it is relevant to crimes of 
violence. Having narrowed the ambit of the principle for the 
purposes that we have identified in this statute, we have 
demonstrated this parliamentary response is proportionate to 
the threat of violence and association with intoxication. It is a 
reasonable response from the legislature in that regard.
<P>
	While there was no section 1 evidence before the court in 
Daviault, I hope when the bill is heard by committee there will 
be evidence to establish the facts referred to in the preamble, the 
close association between violence and intoxication, the 
disproportionate effect of such violence on women and children, 
and the extent to which that violence deprives women and 
children of the equality rights to which they are entitled under 
the charter so that a firm foundation will be laid for 
demonstrating the valid purpose and power of Parliament in 
enacting this legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must not underestimate the value and scope of the 
preamble to the bill. It is an expression of the reasons and 
considerations that have led Parliament to legislate in this way. 
These reasons and considerations have been written down and 
may usefully guide the courts in applying these amendments to 
cases that come before them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It was suggested during the consultation process leading to 
the bill that as a matter of perception if we left Daviault alone 
and did not legislate, the perception would be clearly given that 
self-induced intoxication could excuse criminal behaviour with 
the result of a decrease in the reporting of crime, including in 
particular crimes of violence by men against women.
<P>
	The feeling is if in the end result in any event the man were to 
be held not accountable, what is the purpose of going through 
the reporting of the prosecution. The preamble recognizes 
violence and the threat of violence have a disadvantaging effect 
and play a significant role in placing women and children at risk 
and denying them the right of security of the person and equal 
protection of the law guaranteed by the charter.
<P>
	The new standard of care requires all members of society to 
take responsibility for not harming others. It would thereby 
assist in protecting the rights of all Canadians to the security of 
the person and the equal benefit and protection of the law.
<P>
	The 1993 violence against women survey demonstrated that 
alcohol played a prominent role in violence against women. In 
more than 40 per cent of violent incidents the abusers had been 
drinking. The rate of assault for women living with men who 
drank heavily was six times higher than for those whose partners 
did not drink at all.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The preamble recognizes the close association between 
violence and intoxication. A number of studies have suggested 
that without necessarily being the cause, intoxication creates an 
environment that is conducive to violence. The new standard of 
care will reinforce among Canadians the obligation we all have 
not to do violence to others, whether we are sober or in a state of 
extreme intoxication.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is important that the bill go to committee so that a 
parliamentary committee can hear evidence on these important 
factual points to provide a foundation for establishing the need 
for this legislation. I have already identified as an option which 
the government is considering the prospect of referring the 
legislation, after its enactment and before its proclamation, to 
the Supreme Court of Canada to establish its validity before it is 
proclaimed in force. That judgment will be exercised once we 
have the opinions of Canadians on the issue of validity. If we 
feel there are significant questions which require reference we 
will keep that option in mind.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11040"> 11040 </A></B>
<P>
	Above all, we are anxious to have this law in place to restore 
certainty and particularly accountability to criminal law.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to acknowledge the government's 
indebtedness to the initiatives shown by Senator Philippe 
Gigantès in the other place. Senator Gigantès presented Bill S-6 
in the Senate shortly after the release of the Daviault judgment. 
Bill S-6 proposed the offence of criminal intoxication. There 
was an outstanding effort by Senator Gigantès to address the 
underlying public concern arising from this judgment. In the 
final analysis the government did not favour the precise 
approach he described in that bill. However, we are indebted to 
him for his initiative. In examining both his bill and his 
assessment of the issues we were better prepared to address 
those issues in Bill C-72.
<P>
	I also acknowledge that the co-operation and collaboration of 
the other parties today is making it possible for us to deal with 
second reading on this one occasion. The bill will thereafter go 
to committee for the consideration needed. I am indebted to hon. 
members opposite for their collaboration in that regard.
<P>
	I commend this legislation to the House for approval in 
principle at second reading. It will improve and strengthen the 
criminal law of the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first, I would like to remind you that I will be sharing my time 
with the hon. member for Québec.
<P>
	As the Minister of Justice mentioned earlier, it is in response 
to the Supreme Court ruling in the Daviault case, among others, 
that the minister finally tabled Bill C-72 on February 24, 1995.
<P>
	As he said, that bill amends the Criminal Code and prohibits 
self-induced intoxication as a defence in the case of violent 
crimes.
<P>
	Persons who become intoxicated to a degree where they are 
unable to control their behaviour shall assume criminal liability 
for their actions. Later on, I will examine in detail the criminal 
acts affected by this bill, because it does not apply to all criminal 
acts.
<P>
	We are still a long way from a comprehensive reform of the 
Criminal Code sections which set forth the fundamental 
principles of criminal liability and the grounds for defence in 
case of accusation.
<P>
	This is still the stone age as far as criminal legislation is 
concerned. The rules of criminal law have not really been 
modified over the last 100 years. It was the Supreme Court that 
urged the minister to take action. Without that ruling by the 
highest court in the country, would the Minister of Justice still 
be consulting the population and the various stakeholders?
<P>
	Let us review the facts of the Henri Daviault case. Mr. 
Daviault knew the victim, since she is one his wife's friends .She 
was 65 years old at the time. She is partially paralysed and 
confined to a wheelchair.
<P>
	One evening, around 6 o'clock, she asked Mr. Daviault to 
bring her a quart of brandy.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	The victim, that is the lady, drank less than a glass and fell 
asleep in her wheelchair. When she woke up during the night to 
go to the bathroom, Mr. Daviault grabbed her wheelchair, 
pushed her into the bedroom, made her lie on the bed and 
sexually assaulted her. He left the apartment around 4 o'clock in 
the morning. Henri Daviault is now 73 years old; when the 
accusations were laid against him, he was 70.
<P>
	At the first trial, he said that he had spent that day in a bar 
where he had drunk seven or eight bottles of beer. He 
remembered drinking a glass of brandy when he arrived at the 
victim's apartment, but did not remember what had happened 
between that time and the moment where he woke up naked in 
his victim's bed.
<P>
	Mr. Justice Bernard Grenier acquitted him because he was not 
absolutely sure that Mr. Daviault was conscious enough to form 
the guilty intention, that is the intention to commit the sexual 
assault.
<P>
	The Quebec Court of Appeal quashed Mr. Justice Grenier's 
decision and found Mr. Daviault guilty. On September 30, the 
Supreme Court of Canada decided that an intoxication defence 
could be made in this particular case and ordered a new trial.
<P>
	So, time is short. The Bloc Quebecois has always asked that 
people who voluntarily intoxicate themselves and then commit 
violent acts be held more accountable for these acts. It is time 
that legislators take their responsibilities and alleviate the 
increasing concerns of the public as the result of the Supreme 
Court decision in the Daviault case. We should not delude 
ourselves: the Daviault case is only one example among many, 
all equally revolting.
<P>
	The results of a national survey on assaults against female 
spouses, in which more than 12,300 women participated, were 
released in March 1994. This survey reveals troubling facts on 
spousal abuse. I use the word ``troubling'', but ``revolting'' 
would be equally appropriate. But no matter what words are 
used, the majority in this House will not listen.
<P>
	Violence against women is disturbing, so certain people 
prefer to ignore it instead of looking at it. As long as it happens 
to someone else, people do not feel that concerned. It is absurd 
to think that just saying that violence is everyone's business has 
become a cliché, something that everybody is tired of hearing.
<P>
	I am not referring only to physical violence but to 
psychological violence as well, which has effects just as harmful 
and lasting. Disparaging remarks, abusive language and insults 
can 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11041"> 11041 </A></B>
<P>
be just as harmful as a slap in  the face or a punch. They leave 
deep scars that almost never disappear.
<P>
	When a woman is told by her husband that she is good for 
nothing, that she is too stupid to understand, that she is not a 
good mother and spends too much time with friends and not 
enough time at home, when her husband tells her that he should 
have left her long ago, she gradually loses all self-esteem.
<P>
	Life is a nightmare. Fear replaces the feeling of well-being 
that every human being needs. Isolation prevents victims from 
blowing the whistle on their abusers and it becomes very 
difficult for anyone to guess that a shy smile may hide terrible 
secrets. Injuries to the soul are the most painful, but they are the 
most difficult to see.
<P>
	The national survey done last year by Statistic Canada on 
violence against women attempted to verify the theories on the 
existence of a link between physical and psychological 
violence. About one third of the women who are, or have been, 
married reported that their spouse or estranged spouse had been 
psychologically violent against them. Former spouses are 
considered more violent psychologically speaking than present 
spouses in a proportion of 59 per cent. Although psychological 
violence can occur without physical violence, the two types of 
violence occur together in a majority of cases.
<P>
	Three-quarters of the women who said they were victims of 
physical or sexual violence reported having also been victims of 
psychological violence.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	Eighteen per cent of the women who are not subjected to 
physical abuse at the hands of their partner have said that they 
experience psychological abuse. Physical abuse can take many 
forms. The main types that are described in the survey are 
pushing, grabbing or shoving around one's partner. The next 
type is threatening to hit, slapping, throwing objects at, kicking, 
biting and punching one's partner. Many women have been 
battered, sexually assaulted, choked, struck with an object, or 
threatened with a firearm or a knife. Mr. Speaker, could you ask 
my colleague behind me to listen quietly during my remarks? I 
will do the same when he takes the floor.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The member for 
Saint-Hubert is asking that the House co-operate in terms of 
any ongoing discussions, that possibly they could take place 
behind the curtains. I ask for the co-operation of the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I will continue with my 
remarks. I was just saying that many women have been battered, 
sexually assaulted, choked, struck with an object, or threatened 
with a firearm or a knife. Very few cases are reported where only 
one form of abuse is involved. The most frequent injuries, in 90 
per  cent of all cases, are bruises. Then we have cuts, scratches, 
burns, hairline fractures or broken bones. Almost 10 per cent of 
injured women said they had suffered internal injuries or had 
had miscarriages.
<P>
	The worst part of it all is that the victim of such abuse finds 
excuses for the abuser. Victims seldom lay charges. On average, 
the police are notified in only one-quarter of all of the cases of 
spousal abuse. When charges are laid, the victims withdraw 
their complaints or decline to testify. Those victims are afraid 
and, by that very fact, sanction the actions of the aggressors. 
How often have the courts heard victims say that they have 
decided on reconciliations, that the husband's actions were not 
that bad, that he had problems at work or because he had no 
work, that the children were annoying that day, that he was tired 
and that he had been drinking?
<P>
	Precisely, he had been drinking. As if it were an excuse. It is 
not; it is an aggravating circumstance. The survey in question 
shows beyond a shadow of a doubt the relationship between 
alcohol and violence. It reveals that alcohol is a prime factor in 
spousal assaults. The aggressor had been drinking in half of all 
the reported incidents. More specifically, the rate of assault on 
women living with men who drank regularly, that is at least four 
times a week, was three times higher than for abstinent 
husbands.
<P>
	Women whose husbands drink often-five drinks or more at 
one time-were six times more exposed to assault than women 
whose husbands do not drink. In 1993, fifty-five per cent of the 
men who killed their partners had consumed alcohol. Native 
women are particularly at risk when alcohol is present. It was a 
determinant factor in nearly every case of sexual assault on 
native women. Alcohol also played a part in every other offense 
against native women.
<P>
	The Criminal Code contains no provisions dealing 
specifically with intoxication. Bill C-72 will change all that by 
adding to the Criminal Code section 33.1, which will prohibit 
the accused from using intoxication as a defence for violent acts.
<P>
	Before specifically speaking of the use of intoxication as a 
defence, I must stress that it is important to understand the 
elements of a criminal offence and the types of offences for 
which the drunk defence can be invoked.
<P>
	The concept of criminal responsibility requires that all 
material and mental facts, the elements of fault, be proven 
beyond any reasonable doubt for there to have been a criminal 
offence.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11042"> 11042 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	So, on the one hand, self-induced intoxication can diminish 
moral responsibility for normally criminal behaviour. But, on 
the other hand, the person who has committed a criminal offence 
while in a state of self-induced intoxication should not absolved 
of his or her responsibility.
<P>
	Since the drunk defence does not exist in the Criminal Code, it 
must be drawn from case law. Where intoxication was not the 
result of a deliberate act, the accused could always plead the 
drunk defence.
<P>
	Involuntary intoxication may come about through fraud or the 
actions of another person or through the bona fide use of a drug 
prescribed by a doctor, the effects of which were not known to 
the user.
<P>
	So Common Law recognizes involuntary intoxication as a 
defence. By maintaining this defence, Bill C-72 codifies the 
jurisprudence. The new section 33.1 will still allow the 
involuntary intoxication defence, as is now the case.
<P>
	Before Daviault, the question was whether the intoxication 
was self-induced, whether it resulted from the fault of the 
accused; it could not always be used as a defence.
<P>
	However, in the case of offences requiring specific intent, 
such as manslaughter or robbery, intoxication can be used as a 
defence. Courts went to great pains to distinguish between the 
two categories. Even today, many legal scholars are hard put to 
understand the distinction between the two. Yet, this distinction 
is very important when the defence is based on the intoxication 
of the accused.
<P>
	In the grey area of criminal law, there is no clear dividing line 
between specific intent offences and general intent offences. I 
will give an example. According to the Criminal Code, a murder 
is first degree murder when, and I quote the code: ``it is planned 
and deliberate''. This is a specific intent offence. The homicide 
must be premeditated, the accused must have planned the 
ultimate consequence of his action, that is the death of the 
victim.
<P>
	Under section 322 of the Criminal Code, for a theft to be 
considered a theft, it must be committed, and I quote: ``with the 
intent'' to deprive, temporarily or absolutely, the owner of the 
object which has been taken. Here again, one could plead 
intoxication as a defence because it is also a specific intent 
offence.
<P>
	We must remember that Bill C-72 does not change in any way 
the distinction between a general intent offence and a specific 
intent offence. In other words, a person accused of severe 
offences such as murder, theft, robbery, extortion, breaking and 
entering, and torture, will still be able to plead self-induced 
intoxication as a defence.
<P>
	Sexual assault becomes murder when it results in the death of 
the victim. In this case, murder being a specific intent offence, 
the offender will be able to use the intoxication defence. He 
could not have presented such a defence if his victim had not 
died, since the offence he would have charged with would been 
sexual assault causing bodily harm, which is a general intent 
offence.
<P>
	Which leads to the following nonsense. If the aggressor hits 
his victim hard enough to cause her death, he can plead that he 
was too intoxicated to know what he was doing. If his victim 
recovers from her injuries, he will no longer be able to use this 
defence. We must eliminate the arbitrary distinction between 
crimes of general intent and crimes of specific intent.
<P>
	This legal fiction was created solely for the purpose of 
allowing drunkenness or intoxication as a defence. Criminal 
intent should include specific moral elements for each offence. 
Offences should no longer be divided into two distinct 
categories, but classified on a gradual basis according to their 
seriousness.
<P>
	Bill C-72 is a step in the right direction, and I am convinced 
that it is constitutionally valid. The preamble to the bill will 
make it possible for judges to interpret section 33.1 in a way 
consistent with the principles of a free and democratic society. It 
will stand the test of section 1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	However, the justice minister should amend the general part 
of the Criminal Code without delay. The rules of criminal law 
are archaic and many of its fundamental principles are not 
included in the general part, as they were elaborated by the 
courts.
<P>
	Precedents shape the law, and lawmakers are always lagging 
behind the judiciary. The time has come to reverse the roles, and 
for lawmakers to act responsibly. Thus, the justice minister will 
be able to stop trying to play catch up, and Parliament will be 
able to decide in which direction criminal law will be heading in 
the coming years.
<P>
	Stopping violence against women will have to be part of this 
new direction. I urge the justice minister not to wait for another 
Daviault case to happen before he finally acts.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise on this debate regarding Bill C-72, introduced in 
the House by the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	This bill is of particular interest to women and is part of the 
legislative process aimed at curbing violence against women 
and children. I will therefore analyze it in this context.
<P>
	First of all I will try to resume the historical background of 
legislation regarding the defence of self-induced intoxication, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11043"> 11043 </A></B>
<P>
since it is the topic of this bill. Then I will establish the 
relationship between violence against women and the 
aggressor's intoxication. I will  then look at the bill itself and I 
will conclude with its consequences for the problem of violence.
<P>
	The authors Côté-Harper, Manganas et Turgeon define 
self-induced intoxication as follows: ``There is self-induced 
intoxication when a person over-estimates his or her resistance 
to alcohol or drugs, with the result that, then, his or her actions 
cannot be considered intentional''.
<P>
	Therefore, if I consume more alcohol that my body can take I 
will be responsible for my actions. Self-induced intoxication 
was accepted as a defence by the courts in 1920, in the decision 
<I>Director of Public Prosecutions vs. Beard</I>. In that case, the court 
decided that a person whose self-induced state of intoxication 
was such that he could not form the intention of committing a 
crime could not be found guilty.
<P>
	Therefore in the case of murder, the Crown must prove that 
the accused was seeking to cause the death of the victim. If the 
accused was intoxicated to such a degree that he could not gauge 
the consequences of his actions, he cannot be found guilty of 
murder. He will, however, be charged with manslaughter, with 
an included offence, because his intoxication did not prevent 
him from forming the desire to carry out the action which led to 
the death.
<P>
	It is understandable that the courts have developed, uniquely 
for the defence of self-induced intoxication, two types of 
offences: those requiring specific intent-to cause death, in our 
example-and those requiring general intent-such as to beat a 
person, who then dies. In <I>R. v. George</I>, 1960, Mr. Justice 
Fauteux of the Supreme Court of Canada explained the 
distinction as follows: ``A distinction must be made between the 
intention to commit an act in terms of the intended purpose and 
the intention to commit an act independently of the intended 
purpose. In certain cases, the intention to commit an act is 
sufficient for there to have been an offence, while in other cases 
there must be, in addition to the general intention, a specific 
intention to commit the act''.
<P>
	The courts had always maintained this distinction, when 
allowing the accused to use the defence of self-induced 
intoxication. It was reserved for crimes of specific intent.
<P>
	On September 30, 1994, the Supreme Court of Canada set off 
in a new direction when it handed down its decision in the 
Daviault case. Very briefly, it allowed the accused, who had 
been charged with sexual assault, therefore general intent, to 
plead self-induced intoxication.
<P>
	The court relied on the interpretation of sections 7 and 11(d) 
of the Canadian Charter in concluding that it was unjust not to 
allow a seriously intoxicated accused the right to use this 
defence because a crime of general intent was involved. In an 
<I>obiter dictum</I>, the court recommended that Parliament resolve 
the issue through legislation. The decision raised a general 
outcry, both  from groups defending women's rights and from 
police forces and some members of the legal profession.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	I will not go into the details, but rather move on to certain 
aspects of the wife abuse problem and then come back to the 
Supreme Court decision.
<P>
	Studies have shown time and time again the link between 
violence and intoxication, whether produced by alcohol or by 
drugs. This link is common in spousal abuse.
<P>
	A Statistics Canada study conducted in March 1994 on 
spousal homicide revealed that, in 1991-92, thirty-seven per 
cent of the wives and 82 per cent of the husbands who were 
killed had been drinking. Based on statistics on murderers 
reported by police, 55 per cent of the men and 79 per cent of the 
women were under the influence of alcohol, and 18 per cent of 
the men and 13 per cent of the women were on other drugs.
<P>
	A previous investigation by the same organization had 
revealed that alcohol played a major part, i.e. 40 per cent of 
abusing spouses were under the influence of alcohol.
<P>
	It also indicated that the risk of becoming victims of violence 
was three times higher for women living with a man who drank 
regularly than for other women.
<P>
	Alcohol is therefore a factor that should be considered when 
dealing with violence against women. We need to ask ourselves 
what impact a decision like the one rendered in the Daviault 
case, which allows a man who assaults a woman while under the 
influence of alcohol to plead drunkenness in defence, will have 
on the spousal abuse issue.
<P>
	Let us start by looking at the general effect on the abusing 
spouse. Officials who work with violent men agree that the key 
to eliminating violent behaviour in men is to make them aware 
of their responsibilities by punishing them and making them 
aware of the fact that they could benefit from therapy.
<P>
	Ginette Larouche is a social worker who has written three 
books on domestic violence. She also participated in the soon to 
be defunct Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women. 
In her opinion, by not sending abusers to jail or by doing so only 
for a ridiculously short time, which is often the case, society is 
trivializing the criminal act they have committed. Then, by 
having them join support groups, we are telling them they only 
have a little behaviour problem to deal with.
<P>
	This analysis is supported by Steven Bélanger, a psychologist 
heading Pro-Gam, the first therapy group for violent men in 
Quebec, which was founded in 1982. Listen to what he says. ``A 
long term solution must be sought at a more comprehensive 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11044"> 11044 </A></B>
<P>
level. We must stop thinking that violence concerns only those 
who batter their spouse. Everybody is concerned. Having said 
that, I believe that the immediate solution lies in both court 
action and psychological assistance.''
<P>
	As we can see, both of these experts consider referral to the 
court as both a deterrent and a cure.
<P>
	Women, even those not subjected to spousal abuse, live in 
fear. Why? Two professors at the School of Social Work of the 
University of Montreal published, in the <I>International Review of 
Community Action</I>, the results of a study on women's fear of 
crime and the various forms of violence to which they are 
subjected.
<P>
	First of all, their report is a reminder that our published 
statistics on crimes committed against women are distorted. 
One of the reasons is that many women feel guilty for being 
assaulted, particularly if it happens while they are under the 
influence of alcohol or drugs or when they are in places that are 
``not nice''.
<P>
	I also mentioned previously the statistics on drinking in cases 
where one spouse murders the other, which is the ultimate form 
of spousal assault.
<P>
	The authors also establish a link between spousal assault and 
society's attitudes in general. They blame the psycho-social 
approach used until very recently to deal with the issue.
<P>
	The family being considered as a dynamic unit, responsibility 
for violent crimes committed within it had to be shared by all 
members. At that time, the expression ``dysfunctional family'' 
was used instead of referring to victims and assaults, in order to 
trivialize and decriminalize aggressions.
<P>
	The authors also maintain that their study shows that women 
in general live in fear of being assaulted, that victimized women 
are also afraid of denouncing their assailants and finally that the 
women who have the courage to go to court must deal with the 
confrontational nature of our legal system. The traditional 
attitudes in our society are of no help to these women, especially 
since they are conveyed by men who do not have to face the 
same reality.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	How does Bill C-72 help to somewhat improve the current 
situation of victims of assault?
<P>
	First of all, it is important to remind people that this bill was 
introduced to neutralize the negative effect of the judgment 
made in the Daviault case and dealing with violent crimes. The 
bill makes it clear that a defendant will not be allowed to use 
intoxication as a defence when a crime of general intent was 
committed involving interference, or the threat to interfere, or 
any kind of assault vis-à-vis the integrity of another person.
<P>
	So, the bill covers the majority of violent crimes, the others 
falling into the specific intent category, which can lead to a 
conviction for an included offence, as I said at the beginning of 
my speech.
<P>
	To answer the question, we can say that the bill will facilitate 
the conviction of the aggressors. At the present time, a person 
charged with a general intent offence can plead voluntary 
intoxication. If this defence is allowed, the person will be 
cleared of all charges. So the bill takes us back to the situation 
that existed before the Supreme Court decision.
<P>
	Such a move will send a message to society that aggressors 
must be punished because acts of aggression are serious and 
cannot be tolerated. At the same time, victims will feel 
encouraged to file a complaint. The cycle of spousal abuse can 
be broken only if violence is denounced, the aggressors 
punished and the victims helped.
<P>
	Furthermore, like many other pieces of legislation, this bill 
will serve both as an educational and a dissuasive tool. It clearly 
states the zero-tolerance position of this Parliament against 
violence. We find the policy position of the House in the 
preamble to the Bill. Thus, the direct link between violence and 
the violation of women's rights to security of the person and to 
the equal protection and benefit of the law is mentioned. The 
principle of criminal accountability of the person who 
deliberately becomes intoxicated is also recognized, and that is 
very important. And, in addition, the victims' right to protection 
is recognized.
<P>
	Finally, the bill refers to a standard of care defined in relation 
to the prohibition of violent behaviour towards another person.
<P>
	This legislation is a step in the right direction and it meets the 
expectations of human rights groups, particularly those who are 
involved with women who are victims of domestic violence. 
Violence is a problem that must be eliminated, and we recognize 
that this bill is part of the solution. That is why we will support 
it.
<P>
	However, other measures must be taken both in terms of 
legislation and government decisions. We have to make sure that 
groups who work with victims have all the support they need to 
reach their goals.
<P>
	We can deplore the fact that the government has been 
withdrawing part of its funding for anti-violence support 
programs. In six years, financial assistance to these 
organizations has been reduced by 23 per cent. The number of 
grants has also been reduced by 47 per cent. The best intentions 
will never be more than intentions if they are not followed up 
with financial support.
<P>
	The recommendations made by the various task forces and 
commissions will also have to be examined and implemented if 
we want to be able to say one day that gender equality really 
does exist in our society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11045"> 11045 </A></B>
<P>
	The government will also have to be consistent and adopt 
other pieces of legislation concerning other forms of violence 
towards women, including those involving genital mutilation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to speak to this very 
important bill. At the outset I remind the House that I will be 
sharing the time with my hon. colleague from Wild Rose.
<P>
	The Reform caucus supports the bill 100 per cent, without any 
question, without any equivocation whatsoever. We are solidly 
behind both the intent and the desire of the government in the 
bill.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice in his comments spoke for quite some 
time and quite well about the notions of specific intent and 
general intent. He lost me after about five minutes with the 
various intents going back and forth. I guarantee that he lost the 
vast majority of Canadians when the whole issue of intent, 
specific versus common intent, was raised. That highlights the 
problem I would like to address in my comments today.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	It took 15 minutes for the justice minister to use the words 
most associated with what should be common law in our 
country, that is common sense. Without the foundation or 
without the basis of common sense in law it does not really 
matter what happens because we lose everybody else.
<P>
	The basic test our laws must meet is the standard of common 
sense. Before I get into addressing that I point out that a week 
before the Minister of Justice introduced the bill I introduced 
Bill C-303, largely based on Senator Gigantes' bill introduced 
from the Senate.
<P>
	My bill is on dangerous intoxication which addresses the 
issue from the perspective already covered by the Minister of 
Justice. When the bill was drawn in the lottery I went before the 
committee of the House of Commons which was to make the 
decision on whether or not it would become a votable bill. My 
advice and my suggestion to the committee was that anything 
which could possibly impair the development of or hinder in any 
way the application of Bill C-72 should be withdrawn. The 
decision should be made by people in the Department of Justice 
who are far more qualified than I am to make such decisions.
<P>
	As parliamentarians we do not want anything to confuse the 
issue. Our caucus is solidly behind the Minister of Justice when 
he says that intoxication is no defence and no reason to slide out 
from under personal responsibility for the results of one's 
actions.
<P>
	The bill rests in kind of a limbo waiting to see what happens. 
If it is necessary or if there is a problem, there are other ways to 
address the issue which may not be as efficient or as good as the 
bill. The reason we have come to this point is that in the first 
place the Supreme Court  of Canada misread the intent and 
where it is relative to the Canadian population at large.
<P>
	We do not really have a problem with the common law statutes 
that existed prior to the Daviault decision. In my view we have a 
problem with the Supreme Court expanding the envelope of its 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	The Supreme Court does not have the responsibility to make 
laws. The Supreme Court has the responsibility to interpret 
laws. If this were a single instance where the Supreme Court 
were seen to lose touch with reality, we could say that perhaps it 
had a bad day or perhaps it was having tea or sherry in a club and 
thought: ``What can we do? How many angels will dance on the 
head of a pin? Why don't we get the Minister of Justice to dance 
around a bit to see how he responds to this bone headed 
decision?''
<P>
	If it were in isolation we might be able to say that but the 
reality is that it is not in isolation. This is a consistent pattern the 
Supreme Court has laid down over the last few years.
<P>
	About 10 years ago late Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, 
Bora Laskin, said: ``The Supreme Court is a quiet court in an 
unquiet land''. How things have changed as a direct result of the 
charter of rights and freedoms. The charter of rights and 
freedoms essentially says that individual rights in society are 
paramount. The Supreme Court is kind of between a rock and a 
hard place, which is why many of its decisions that seem to defy 
reality are split decisions.
<P>
	If the Supreme Court does not defend the notion of due 
process-and by due process I mean dotting the <I>i</I>'s, crossing the 
<I>t</I>'s and making sure everything is done absolutely 
correctly-decisions would be overturned based on the charter 
of rights and freedoms or other considerations.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Meanwhile Parliament and the vast majority of Canadians are 
concerned with crime control and common sense. We have the 
Supreme Court on the one hand and the population and by and 
large parliaments assembled all across the land on the other 
hand. Somewhere in the middle, I suppose, is justice.
<P>
	Recently the Supreme Court brought down a decision in 
which a woman arrested for impaired driving before she blew 
the breathalyser was allowed to go to the washroom. When she 
was in the washroom the woman alleged that she consumed 
more alcohol and that when she blew over the limit it was as a 
result of having alcohol subsequent to her arrest. Therefore they 
could not prove that she was driving impaired. The Supreme 
Court, in a move that defies logic, in a move that defies the last 
30 years of trying to get drunks off the road, chose to say that the 
woman was innocent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11046"> 11046 </A></B>
<P>
	Recently the Supreme Court decided that someone arrested 
for impaired driving has <I>x</I> amount of time to find a lawyer of 
choice. If one is nailed for impaired driving, one is nailed for 
impaired driving. The benefit of the doubt rests with the 
potential victim: the innocent bystander who gets hit by a 
drunk. We are trying to stamp out drunk driving. We are not 
trying to figure out what is legal.
<P>
	What about ordinary Canadians when laws come down from 
Parliament that are written for lawyers and not for ordinary 
people? They should not need law degrees to figure out what is 
right or wrong.
<P>
	The Supreme Court may review debate in the House when the 
time comes to review the law again because it wants to get the 
judgment of the people. We in the House represent the people of 
Canada who are upset and disgusted with a Supreme Court that 
comes out with decisions such as it has recently. I want the 
Supreme Court to be cognizant of the debate. I want the Supreme 
Court to hear me speaking about it in the House of Commons, 
saying that average Canadians have gone beyond the point of 
being filled with contempt for it. People are just dismissing it.
<P>
	If the Supreme Court continually comes out with decisions 
better suited for a faculty club, with no basis of reality, 
obviously the laws will not connect with people. It is like a 
municipal police force installing a new sign which says 60 
kilometres an when everything is designed for 100 kilometres an 
hour. People will ignore the law, get tickets and feel resentful.
<P>
	When the Supreme Court makes decisions that do not make 
sense it brings discredit and disrepute not only to the Supreme 
Court but to Parliament as well. That includes all members who 
were elected to represent the people.
<P>
	It is the righteousness of law, the essence of law that ordinary 
people instinctively understand is right, which imparts moral 
authority to law. If a law does not enjoy moral authority, if it 
does not enjoy the goodwill of the people, if ordinary people 
cannot look at it and say that it makes sense and they will obey it, 
what good is it?
<P>
	In the absence of a foundation of common sense, laws will be 
ridiculed and with them the people who write the laws and the 
people who interpret the laws. That is the bottom line. We do not 
want to bring discredit to the whole notion of jurisprudence and 
the law in the way we work as citizens and in the way we relate to 
one another. Laws keep us civilized and we must respect them.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	This brings to mind what we can do about it. We have a charter 
of rights and freedoms, which in my view would be greatly 
improved if it were the charter of rights, freedoms and 
responsibilities. We are not likely to lose the charter of rights 
and freedoms because people feel that it gives great protection.
<P>
	Perhaps it is not all bad, but it has changed the way the country 
works. It has changed our relationship as legislators to the 
process of making and interpreting laws. As parliamentarians 
we have to start looking at a new way or another way of 
confirming people appointed to the bench.
<P>
	When a person is appointed to the bench historically the 
procedure has been that the decision will have a host of 
considerations: where the person lives in the country, what 
language the person speaks, whether the person has standing in 
the community, whether the person has standing in the legal 
community, and whether the person has standing within the 
community of the political party that makes the appointment.
<P>
	That might have been okay. By and large Canadians can be 
very secure in the knowledge that over the years we have had and 
do have a court that has the most profound respect of people 
from coast to coast. We have to be careful not to throw the baby 
out with the bath water.
<P>
	There has been and is a continuing concern about the wisdom 
of decisions coming out of courts all across the land and not just 
the Supreme Court, decisions interpreted by some as decisions 
to promote or to enhance a particular lifestyle or a particular 
point of view. There seems to be tremendous inconsistency in 
the interpretation and the application of law from coast to coast 
and from court to court.
<P>
	Perhaps it would not be a bad idea to consider after a person 
has been appointed to the bench, not just the federal benches but 
all benches, holding some sort of ratification process. I do not 
think it would be advisable to have members of the bench or of 
the Supreme Court in particular fearing for their jobs or being 
recalled.
<P>
	I concur the positions should be until retirement because we 
need consistency and long range thought. We want to make 
changes slowly, not arbitrarily. We want to ensure that 
institutions of the country such as the Supreme Court do not 
reflect a bias that is here today and gone tomorrow. We need it to 
apply long range thought to decisions.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister, in consultation with the Minister of 
Justice, makes a decision to appoint someone to the bench, it 
would not be a bad idea if the appointment were further ratified, 
not turned over or dismissed, by a committee of the House, 
probably the justice committee.
<P>
	The terms of reference would have to be well defined. I do not 
think Canadians want or would put up with the confirmation 
hearings of our friends to the south that we see reported and that 
become partisan attacks. It would be an extremely important 
idea at the time of appointment that judges to all courts, 
particularly the Supreme Court, be very clearly told and 
understand that their job is to interpret laws and that our job is to 
write 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11047"> 11047 </A></B>
<P>
them. Their job is to push the envelope to ensure that  what we 
do is done correctly and that the checks and balances work.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	A confirmation of some description would have far more 
value not to the judge who has been appointed but to those who 
are making the appointment to know that if they are making an 
appointment of someone who does not bear the scrutiny of a 
carefully crafted confirmation hearing they probably should not 
be there in the first place.
<P>
	It would be a check and balance to those of us who are elected 
and make these appointments to make sure the appointments 
will stand the test of time, the test of open debate and the test of a 
little sunshine coming in so people understand these laws and 
the people who interpret them belong to the people of Canada. 
Our laws do not belong to the court. They do not belong to the 
Queen. We live together in society in a social contract because 
we have confidence and faith in our laws.
<P>
	When someone commits a crime in all of our courts it is 
always the Queen, Regina versus the defendant. Perhaps we 
should expand that and say it is the Queen representing Canada 
at large and the person affected, the family affected versus the 
defendant. It is not an abstract third party deal if one has lost a 
friend or a mother, a father, a brother, children or a spouse either 
through criminal activity like murder or through violence or 
second degree offences such as impaired driving where there 
was no necessary intent.
<P>
	We have to realize we are not talking about abstract ideas. We 
are talking about real honest to God people impacted on 
positively and negatively by the results of our actions, by the 
results of actions of others.
<P>
	I put these suggestions on the table. These are the things 
Canadians from coast to coast want. Whether in British 
Columbia, the maritimes, Ontario, Alberta, in the north or in the 
south, whether Canadians are French speaking, English 
speaking, male, female, black, white, have been here for 10 
generations or 10 days, we want security of the person. We want 
to feel secure when we leave our homes. We want to know that if 
we have been hurt or injured by someone else, the law of the land 
is here to protect us, not to protect the guilty, not to protect the 
perpetrator. The due process should belong to the innocent 
victim.
<P>
	Unless we start to put the rights of the victim ahead of the 
rights of the criminal we will never ensure that people in the 
social contract between independent citizens who have given of 
themselves to the state, given their duty and fidelity to the state, 
get a fair return in exchange.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
endorse what my colleague said at the beginning of his 
statement, with all due respect to the minister and the speaker 
from the official opposition. It is rather difficult for an ordinary 
fellow with my education to keep up with lawyer talk. I get lost 
from time to time. If we use lawyer  talk we might as well use 
doctor talk because I do not understand that either. However, I 
do understand the intent of this legislation. I commend the 
minister.
<P>
	My colleague felt we were caught between a rock and hard 
place. I am going to change that from a stone to a hard place in 
respect of our minister so there will be absolutely no confusion.
<P>
	I hope my speech will reflect the voice of ordinary Canadians, 
that which I have heard for quite a while on this issue. As we live 
from day to day we all have a habit of taking things for granted.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	When I hear of a crime being committed by someone who is 
intoxicated I immediately take it for granted that he will be 
charged and probably convicted. However, when I learned there 
is no conviction because he was drunk, I am flabbergasted. I 
never dreamed for a moment that being drunk would be a 
successful defence. I began to ask myself how this could be. 
Who would ever have imagined being drunk would be an excuse 
to commit a crime?
<P>
	My life prior to becoming a member of Parliament allowed 
me on many occasions to come to the aid of those involved in 
family problems in general and specifically in family abuse. In 
about 90 per cent of the cases liquor was a contributing factor. In 
other words, the physical abuse would probably not have 
occurred if the assailant had been sober.
<P>
	With courts now deciding drunkenness can be used as a 
defence all our efforts to stop spousal abuse and child abuse 
would be for not. One only has to be drunk to be declared 
innocent. How ridiculous can we get?
<P>
	Laws are written to protect the public. I find it unbelievable 
that normal human beings would decide that drunkenness is a 
defence. If it is because of the wording of legislation or the 
wording in the charter of rights and freedoms, for heaven's sake 
let us fix it.
<P>
	I support and commend the efforts of the justice minister in 
preparing legislation to deal with this problem. I encourage each 
member to support it to the fullest so every judge in this country 
will get the message that the law makers of this land clearly state 
that under no circumstances will drunkenness be used as a 
defence in criminal activity. The best message we can send is 
that this legislation receive 100 per cent support, and the sooner 
the better.
<P>
	As members of Parliament we are responsible for addressing 
the concerns of our constituents. As members of this House we 
are responsible for instituting legislation wanted by our 
constituents. Therefore the Supreme Court should be listening 
to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11048"> 11048 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians and parliamentarians when deciding the difference 
between what is law and what is legal.
<P>
	No member of this House can say the people of Canada agree 
with the Supreme Court decision that drunkenness can be a 
defence for violence or actions that deprive someone of their 
personal dignity. Conversely, no Canadian can understand how 
the Supreme Court can condone voluntary extreme intoxication 
or that voluntary consumption of large quantities of an 
intoxicant absolves a criminal of all blame for actions following 
drunkenness.
<P>
	It is time to force the Supreme Court to decide whether it will 
continue to be a law unto itself or whether its decisions will 
follow the wishes of the people. It is time to send the Supreme 
Court a message that making decisions not accepted by 
Parliament or the people of Canada will result in change. That 
message can be sent today. We have no need to wait or build a 
body of evidence for or against extreme intoxication as a 
defence for criminal action.
<P>
	All Canadians want those who choose extreme intoxication to 
be held accountable for their crimes. All members expressed 
outrage that voluntary extreme intoxication can be used as a 
defence for criminal action. Everyone but the Supreme Court it 
seems understands there is some responsibility that must be 
accepted for a criminal offence that follows when choice was not 
impaired.
<P>
	Let us send a message to all Canadians that parliamentarians 
acting on behalf of the citizens of Canada determine what is 
right and what is wrong, what is legal behaviour and what 
behaviour must be punished.
<P>
	The justice minister wishes to send this to committee to 
solidify the foundation to implement the bill. I believe he 
suggested something along those lines. The foundation for the 
implementation of the bill has been built by the people of 
Canada in their outcry against the recent decisions in the courts 
of Canada regarding drunkenness. This outcry was heard by 
each one of us in the House. The voice of Canadians has 
provided the strong foundation necessary to make the bill law.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, I ask unanimous consent for the following motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-72, an act to amend the Criminal Code (self-induced 
intoxication), be now not only read the second time but sent to committee of the 
whole and passed at third reading this day.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I ask this so all Canadians and parliamentarians can send a 
clear and loud message that states no one can or will accept 
voluntary extreme intoxication as abdication of responsibility 
for criminal actions, and that intent of or criminal action is 
decided by all Canadians, not by an appointed few.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I will explain 
briefly why I do not agree to the suggestion made by the hon. 
member for Wild Rose.
<P>
	The government is considering the possibility of referring 
this law to the Supreme Court of Canada for a ruling with respect 
to its constitutional validity before it is proclaimed into force. 
We may not do that but it is an option we are considering. 
Whether or not we do that, the validity of this law may be 
challenged in the fullness of time and may be considered by the 
courts, including the Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
	If this issue is to be before the court, it is terribly important 
the court have before it not only the statute but the evidence on 
which the Parliament of Canada opted for this approach to the 
issue.
<P>
	When the bill goes to committee it is our intention to call 
witnesses who can speak to the nature-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> How long will it take?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Speaker, it will not take long.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I hesitate to interrupt. Not 
to diminish in any way the importance of the subject matter to 
members on both sides of the House, but clearly I do not want 
the House to engage in debate on what was raised as a point of 
order, although it might have become more of a point of 
clarification, which would lead to debate.
<P>
	I understand there have been some negotiations between the 
parties and an agreement made. Going back to the member for 
Wild Rose, there was a motion put before the House. Unanimous 
consent was requested and has been denied.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, 
NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to support Bill C-72. I 
commend the Minister of Justice for responding quickly to the 
Supreme Court of Canada decision on this matter.
<P>
	This is a matter of concern to all Canadians. It is clearly a 
problem that has been identified in the criminal justice system. 
It is appropriate the minister respond, as he has indicated, and 
preclude a person from being able to rely on self-induced 
intoxication as a defence.
<P>
	It is also proper that the minister is considering the most 
appropriate way the proposal can be introduced into our 
criminal system. It would be irresponsible not to consider the 
constitutional ramifications of the proposal.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	As we all know, Canadians are becoming increasingly 
concerned about their safety, the safety of their families and the 
safety of their communities. Their confidence in the criminal 
justice system and its effectiveness in reducing crime rates have 
given rise to concern over the last few years. There is increasing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11049"> 11049 </A></B>
<P>
demand that the government take action to deal with this 
situation.
<P>
	I believe firmly and my party believes firmly that society 
should take stern, tough measures against violent crimes and 
those that commit them. I also believe just as strongly that we 
must balance the approach by putting in place programs to 
effectively prevent crime. We must be both tough on crime and 
tough on the causes of crime.
<P>
	It is true that Canadians need to believe that those who 
commit violent crimes for whatever reason will be properly 
dealt with in the courts. This bill will address one concern: that 
someone can use the defence of intoxication to get away with a 
crime of violence. It is appropriate that the punishment fit the 
crime.
<P>
	Unfortunately it is a knee-jerk reaction that is not good 
enough. From experience we know that simply expanding the 
incarceration system, the prison system, spending more money 
on courts and prisons, making more and more laws to punish 
more and more people has little positive effect on the overall 
sense of security and overall levels of criminal activity.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice recently pointed to this problem. He 
said that building more jails, filling them with criminals and 
throwing away the key will not solve Canada's crime problems. 
In a speech to the Empire Club of Toronto he stated: ``I believe 
we have to go beyond the slogans to the substance of the issue to 
prefer logic to rhetoric''.
<P>
	He continued: ``If crime prevention is to be successful, it has 
to be a co-operative effort by law enforcement agencies, social 
agencies, the education system, community workers and health 
professionals. The goal is preventing crime. Making the streets 
safer has as much to do with literacy as it does with laws, human 
rights and living standards''.
<P>
	``Crime prevention means recognizing the connection 
between the crime rate and the unemployment rate, between 
unsupervised access by young people to movies saturated with 
violence and the way they behave toward one another and how a 
kid behaves in a school and whether he has a hot meal''.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice is entirely right in linking the causes 
of crime to the level of criminal activity which has caused so 
many people concern.
<P>
	Before I go on to comment more about that let me talk about 
this defence. We know that the conduct of Henri Daviault, who 
consumed 40 ounces of brandy and seven or eight beer before 
raping a 64-year-old, partially paralysed woman is something 
that is reprehensible, something that every decent member of 
society finds absolutely disgusting.
<P>
	Carl Blair, drank 40 ounces of rye, 40 ounces of vodka and a 
large quantity of beer and then brutally beat his wife. This kind 
of activity cannot be tolerated. We have to do everything within 
our means to address this effectively.
<P>
	One of the things we can do, one of the things that we have the 
power to do, is ensure that drunkenness cannot be used as an 
excuse for violent behaviour, that it cannot be used to avoid a 
criminal sanction for such reprehensible acts.
<P>
	Where did this activity come from, where did this seeming 
disregard for the rights of women come from, why do people 
turn to these actions? We know from reports by the standing 
committee on justice and the solicitor general on crime 
prevention that those represented on the committee maintain 
that the identification and punishment of criminals are, on their 
own, ineffective means of reducing future risks of victimization 
and promoting community safety.
<P>
	Over the past decade we have seen the United States and some 
states in that country spending unprecedented sums of money on 
more judges and more prisons. In some states the building of 
prisons is the largest industry. Yet there, as here, citizens 
continue to report an increasing fear of crime in their 
communities. Pouring more money into punishment and 
incarceration cannot be seen as the complete answer to the 
concerns Canadians have about their justice system and safety in 
their communities. It cannot be seen as the complete answer to 
the problem of criminal activity that we experience. While the 
punishment must fit the crime, we must also act to eradicate the 
conditions that lead to individuals violating those laws. We must 
find new, effective and cost efficient ways of addressing the 
causes of crime.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	There is a growing recognition in Canada and in our 
communities that any effort to reduce crime must include 
programs targeted at its root causes, as the Minister of Justice 
indicated in his recent speech to the Empire Club. Evidence 
points to a strong connection between social and economic 
conditions and crime. The minister admitted as much. Extensive 
hearings by committees of the House have identified, among 
other things, unemployment, poverty, physical and sexual 
abuse, illiteracy, inadequate housing, social and economic 
inequality as major contributors to crime.
<P>
	The social and economic conditions that lie at the root of 
criminal behaviour are of course complex. A safer community 
strategy must look well beyond the criminal justice system to 
incorporate all levels of all governments and a variety of 
community groups to seek real answers to these real problems.
<P>
	A successful response will recognize that employment policy, 
educational policy, family policy, youth policy, health policy 
must be understood in the context of their impact on crime. We 
know there is a strong connection between poor economic 
conditions, unemployment and crime. Study after study point to 
these contributing factors and point the direction we must 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11050"> 11050 </A></B>
<P>
pursue if we are going to effectively deal with criminal activity 
in our country.
<P>
	In closing, simply reacting to crime is not the answer. 
Apprehending, prosecuting, sentencing, incarcerating and 
treating offenders cost Canadian taxpayers billions of dollars 
annually. While these measures are important, while we must be 
tough on crime and criminals, they will continue to be 
ineffective until they are coupled with long term solutions for 
prevention, until they are coupled with long term solutions to be 
tough on the causes of crime also.
<P>
	Crime prevention through social development involves 
positive interventions in the lives of the disadvantaged and 
neglected in order to bring about a reduction in deviant 
tendencies. This approach aims to reduce crime and create safe 
communities by tackling the social and economic conditions 
that breed crime.
<P>
	To approach the issue of criminal concerns in our country, the 
difficulties with our criminal justice system in the piecemeal 
way with which the government is proceeding, is simply not the 
answer. The government deals with the specific issue of the 
intoxication defence. It is only reacting because of public 
pressure which arose as a result of the Supreme Court of Canada 
decision.
<P>
	This is not a planned approach to effectively dealing with 
crime in our communities. There may be differences of opinion 
in how we address this problem, but what the government needs 
is a holistic, wide ranging, complete approach to the issue of 
criminal justice. As with all things we must focus on prevention 
rather than just picking up the pieces afterward. If ever we want 
to see a contrast we only have to look south of the border to see 
what is happening in the United States. If we do not deal with the 
causes of crime we will continue to reflect more similarly the 
tragic social, economic and criminal situations which exist 
there.
<P>
	While the Minister of Justice is proposing a few useful, 
though piecemeal, measures such as this one to deal with 
concerns with the Canadian criminal justice system, the 
government is attacking the very programs which would assist 
in getting tough on the causes of crime. The Liberal 
government's attack on social programs can only be seen to 
serve to increase the sense of insecurity in our communities and 
to increase the causes of crime.
<P>
	We have seen this over the years with the last government. 
This government is pursuing the same, even more aggressive 
attack on social programs and we will see it increasing the 
tensions in our communities and giving rise to greater stress 
which will give rise to greater criminal activity.
<P>
	What the government needs is two things. It needs a 
comprehensive criminal justice approach, not a piecemeal 
approach. Canadians deserve to see a plan, some vision, some 
effort over the long term to see where the justice system should 
go. It needs to be based on informed opinion, not on the 
reactions of the public to individual concerns. Only responding 
to public pressure on individual issues is not good enough. The 
government  needs to get tough on the causes of crime as well as 
on crime.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Second, it needs to stop eroding the very programs which 
serve to prevent crime. Its neo-conservative attack on social 
programs means Canada is bound to lose the war on crime. 
Canada and Canadians deserve better.

	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-69, an act 
to provide for the establishment of electoral boundaries 
commissions and the readjustment of electoral boundaries, as 
reported (with amendments) from the committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order with respect to the 
admissibility of the procedural acceptability of Motion No. 4 
standing in the name of the hon. member for Bellechasse which 
purports to amend clause 16 of the bill now before the House.
<P>
	I realize Your Honour is about to make a ruling in respect of 
the procedural admissibility of a number of proposed 
amendments. However, I want to speak to this particular one 
because in my submission it fails to comply with the practices of 
the House in regard to such amendments.
<P>
	The effect of the amendment, if it were accepted by the House, 
would be to change the method of calculating the number of 
seats assigned to each province under the Constitution Act. I 
have concerns about that because the Constitution Act is not up 
for a review or a revision in the amendments that are before the 
House under Bill C-69.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11051"> 11051 </A></B>
<P>
	The bill, as agreed to in principle at second reading, has 
nothing whatever to do with the calculation of the number of 
seats for each province, but is entirely confined to the 
determination of the boundaries within each province for each 
of the districts after the calculation has been done in conformity 
with section 51 of the Constitution Act, 1867. The Constitution 
Act could have been amended in the bill that was put before 
the House but it was not.
<P>
	If I may review for you, sir, the legislative history of this bill, 
Your Honour will recall that there was a motion brought before 
the House instructing the procedure and House affairs 
committee to undertake a study in relation to various matters 
outlined in the motion which included a review, if necessary, of 
section 51 of the Constitution Act in so far as the allocation of 
seats among provinces was concerned.
<P>
	The committee did this study and filed a report in the House 
with the draft bill in it. The draft bill contained no reference to 
section 51 of the Constitution Act. The bill that the government 
subsequently introduced in response to a concurrence motion on 
the committee's report is Bill C-69 and it also contains no 
reference to section 51 of the Constitution Act.
<P>
	What we have here is an opportunity, afforded by the hon. 
member in putting this motion, to make changes to other acts 
which in my view are outside the principle of the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act which is currently before the 
House. It is a whole new act but it deals with the adjustment of 
electoral boundaries, not with the assignment of seats to 
provinces. It is a different matter and is dealt with in a different 
statute and always has been dealt with in a different statute.
<P>
	The amendment proposed by the hon. member for Bellechasse 
is a backdoor attempt to amend section 51 of the Constitution 
Act. He has used the word notwithstanding but it does not get the 
proposer of the amendment off the hook. It is an attempt to 
amend another act which is in no way open for amendment by 
Bill C-69 as agreed to in principle at second reading.
<P>
	The amendment goes beyond the principle of the bill as 
agreed to at second reading and opens up an entirely different 
subject not dealt with by the bill before the House.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to quote from Beauchesne's sixth edition, 
citation 698 which says in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An amendment which is out of order on any of the following grounds cannot 
be put from the chair:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) An amendment is out of order if it is irrelevant to the bill, beyond its scope 
or governed by or dependent upon amendments already negatived.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(8)(a) An amendment may not amend a statute which is not before the 
committee.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There are various references in support of each of those 
citations.
<P>
	I suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that had this amendment been 
put in the committee after second reading of the bill, that is, not 
in its prestudy, but in its own study or in its own draft bill, in an 
amendment to the bill, as committee chair, I would have had no 
option but to rule it out of order because in my view it is beyond 
the scope of the bill.
<P>
	It should be pointed out that attempts to use the word 
notwithstanding in order to sneak in a back door amendment to a 
statute not before the House is not a new device, nor is it one that 
the House has accepted.
<P>
	In earlier years, previous governments were sometimes called 
to order for trying to legislate through estimates. This is an 
unacceptable process whereby statutes other than appropriation 
acts were amended by adding words or items in the estimates. 
One of the more frequent patterns of attempting to do this was to 
insert words in the item that notwithstanding such and such an 
act, the following shall be done or not be done, as the case may 
be.
<P>
	I checked the precedent for this. On March 10, 1971 at pages 
4126 and 4127 of <I>Hansard</I>, Mr. Speaker Lamoureux rendered a 
decision in respect of the supplementary estimates (<I>c</I>) for the 
financial year ending March 31, 1971. In a ruling on a motion 
that was brought forward by the President of the Privy Council, 
Mr. MacEachen, to refer these supplementary estimates to 
committee, Mr. Speaker Lamoureux ruled that certain of the 
supplementary estimates were not properly before the House 
because they purported to amend statutes through the estimates 
process and therefore went beyond what estimates could do.
<P>
	The words that were used in the estimates fit the description 
of the words being used in this amendment. As Mr. Speaker 
Lamoureux pointed out on page 4126:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Let us, if you will, examine the items singled out by the hon. members. The 
first one is vote 35c. It proposes to amend the Pension Act and the Civilian War 
Pensions and Allowances Act. The vote proposes to repeal schedules A and B of 
the Pension Act and substitute therefor new schedules A and B as found in vote 
35c.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I could go on but I do not need to read it all. The point is that 
the Speaker found the estimates were seeking to amend statutes 
and of course those statutes were not before the House for 
amendment. The Speaker held, I think very properly, that the 
practice of amending statutes by the estimates was out of order. 
He made that ruling on page 4127. He said that ``in view of the 
situation created by the new rules, these items are not before the 
House in proper form''. He declined to allow them to go to 
committee.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, if that was the view then, I suggest that same 
view must apply to this amendment. What the hon. member for 
Bellechasse is trying to do is amend the Constitution Act, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11052"> 11052 </A></B>
<P>
section 51, by amending this bill and by  simply saying that 
notwithstanding and it is changed so this and such happens.
<P>
	Successive Speakers have found this was an unacceptable 
device because the word notwithstanding did not disguise the 
real purpose which was to amend another act not opened by the 
estimates process. The same rule must apply in respect of this 
act.
<P>
	The provisions of the Constitution Act 1867 are in no way 
opened up by Bill C-69. The word notwithstanding does not 
disguise the fact that the only purpose of the proposed 
amendment is in fact to open those provisions of another act 
which would have not been opened by the bill and which should 
therefore not be opened up by this amendment.
<P>
	I invite Your Honour to rule that the amendment is out of order 
and not properly before the House at this time.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
thank you for recognizing me on the point of order raised by the 
hon. member for Kingston and the Islands.
<P>
	If you read Motion No. 4 in the Notice Paper, you will see it 
relates directly to clause 16 of Bill C-69. So much so that 
subsection 16 (2) says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) On receipt by the Chief Electoral Officer of a return referred to in 
subsection (1) in respect of a decennial census, the Chief Electoral Officer shall 
calculate the number of members of the House of Commons to be assigned to 
each of the provinces, subject and according to the provisions of section 51 of 
the <I>Constitution Act, 1867</I>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
The amendment I proposed, which is in the Notice Paper, would 
be added to this.
<P>
	However, when they refer to section 51 of the Constitution 
Act, 1867, in subsection 16 (2), what are they referring to? 
Certainly not the text adopted in 1867 by the Westminster 
Parliament, pursuant to the Imperial Act which created the 
federative kind of constitution we know today.
<P>
	Section 51 of the Constitution Act, 1867, referred to in 
subsection 16 (2) of Bill C-69 which is before us, refers to a 
legislation adopted by this Parliament, which received assent on 
March 4, 1986. At that time, the federal Parliament of Canada, 
acting on its own pursuant to section 44 of the Constitution Act, 
1982, did adopt the provisions of section 51 of the Constitution 
Act, 1867.
<P>
	With your permission, I will table the 1986 legislation, that is 
chapter 8 of the 1986 Statutes, to show how this new section 51 
was introduced and became part of an act entitled 
Representation Act, 1985. It is highly appropriate, when we talk 
about electoral redistribution, to establish a fundamental rule 
which will apply right at the beginning, which will govern the 
provinces, and then to say to the officer or the chief returning 
officer: before making any other distribution, you must consider 
that 25 per cent of the seats must be assigned to  Quebec. It is in 
that same spirit that the amendment has been moved today.
<P>
	To make matters clear, Representation Act, 1985, was 
challenged in our courts. It was challenged in a case called 
<I>Campbell vs. Attorney General of Canada</I>-which is reported in 
<I>1988, 49 Dominion Law Report, 4th Edition</I>, p. 321-where the 
British Columbia Court of Appeal, comprised of five judges in 
this particular case, decided: ``That the Federal Parliament had 
all the authority to vote the above-mentioned act in 1985, that it 
did not need the support of the provinces, that the 
proportionality criteria in representation should be understood 
within the Canadian dynamics of proportionality, where there 
were Senate clauses, where deviations were made, and that this 
act, even at the time, did not affect the proportionality criteria''. 
This opinion from the British Columbia Court of Appeal is most 
interesting.
<P>
	Now, what about the way we have to deal with this bill? 
Section 44 of the Constitution Act, 1982, which concerns 
amendments, reads as follows: ``Subject to sections 41 and 
42''-where the consent of the provinces is 
required-``Parliament''-which means us-``may exclusively 
make laws amending the Constitution of Canada in relation to 
the executive government of Canada or the Senate and the House 
of Commons''. As the Campbell case indicates, we are well 
within federal jurisdiction here. Section 44 does not specify a 
particular procedure. I may recall that unlike other amendments 
that may be made with the support of the provinces, in this case 
we can amend the relevant provisions through a bill.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	When I move a motion in amendment that refers to the 
Constitution Act, 1867, as Parliament was in 1985 when it 
passed the 1985 readjustment legislation, I am well within the 
scope of this debate, and I submit, with respect, that my motion 
in amendment is entirely admissible at this stage.
<P>
	We are merely establishing a basic rule, one of many basic 
rules in this kind of legislation, rules according to which the 
commissions may deviate by up to 25 per cent and special 
circumstances may be taken into consideration when 
establishing certain electoral districts. Establishing an 
additional rule that would guarantee Quebec 25 per cent of the 
seats is, I respectfully submit, Mr. Speaker, just another rule to 
add to the bill that would make it more comprehensive. I submit 
this with all due respect, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of clarification, I 
certainly agree with what the hon. member said about the 
authority of the Parliament of Canada to amend laws and to 
amend the section of the Constitution Act we have been 
discussing.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11053"> 11053 </A></B>
<P>
	However, the problem is, in my opinion, that this cannot be 
done unless the government includes a clause to that effect in 
the bill before second reading. That is the problem we have 
today. There is no amendment to the Constitution Act in Bill 
C-69. So the hon. member cannot use an amendment to make 
this kind of change in the bill. He must do so in a separate bill 
which is not now before the House.

	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief. Where the 
bill refers to section 51 of the Constitution Act, 1867, as 
amended in 1986, what we want to do is not change this 
provision but simply say that for the purposes of Bill C-69, it 
should be interpreted in such and such a way. I believe that is all 
I wanted to say.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I have listened 
carefully to the representations made by the parliamentary

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
during the recent recovery, 433,000 jobs were created in 
Canada. However a closer analysis will show that there is a 
disturbing problem underlying this.
<P>
	Young people with a university education had a 25 per cent 
increase in the number of jobs. Those who had some level of 
diploma program after high school had a 14 per cent increase in 
jobs.
<P>
	However, those who had only a high school education had a 23 
per cent decline in the number of job opportunities. Accordingly 
it is very important for all Canadians to do what they can to 
encourage our young people to pursue their education.
<P>
	The national high school dropout rate is 18 per cent. This is 
not acceptable for Canadians. I urge all members to do what they 
can to address this serious problem. As we all know, an

all Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, after 
cutting $5.5 billion on the backs of the unemployed in 1994-95, 
and at least $700 million in the latest budget, the government 
continues to hound the unemployed by hiring 600 new UI 
investigators.
<P>
	From the government's cuts to unemployment insurance, we 
learned that the Liberals' new job creation credo was to consider 
the unemployed lazy. Now the government considers them 
cheats as well.
<P>
	In the meantime, the government's measures to recover $6.6 
billion in unpaid income taxes are not enough to remedy the 
situation. With the banks reaping profits of over $5 billion, the

er of the year. It is the artistic excellence exemplified by Jan 
Arden that typifies the superior calibre of art in Canada. The 
future success for Canadian artists is boundless.
<P>
	Another group bound for success hails from Newfoundland, a 
province that has produced more than its fair share of Canadian 
stars. Artistic Fraud of Newfoundland is a theatre company 
trying to raise funds to take its production to the Fringe Festival 
in Edinburgh.
<P>
	Instead of seeking financial support from the government it 
has focused its attention on raising funds from the corporate 
sector. David Somers, a spokesperson for the company, said: ``I 
am not under the impression that anybody owes us anything as 
actors or theatre people. It is entirely up to the artistic 
community to ensure its own survival. Businesses have been 
funding plays since Shakespeare's time and probably before''.
<P>
	With an attitude like that we know the group will be a success. 
This is a proud day for Newfoundlanders, Calgarians and all

easy to tell the end of the fiscal year is upon us. Furniture trucks 
have been lining up at government offices all across the land as 
officials try to spend every last cent in their budgets before April 
1. In my riding of Hillsborough, as elsewhere, the furniture 
trucks arrived on the weekend to deliver the goods at various 
government offices.
<P>
	This would be all well and good if they were spending their 
own money. However, they are spending the tax dollars of every 
single Canadian. When a family is finding it difficult to make 
ends meet it cuts expenses and delays buying things. The 
government is having difficulty making ends meet and it also 
should delay the purchase of such things as furniture. Taxpayers 
have had enough of this wasting of money every year in March 
madness.
<P>
	As we saw in this morning's Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>, the National 
Capital Commission spent $3 million on new furniture and over 
$300,000 on new telephone equipment. The people of

the events of the last few days have exposed the many

the complete about face of the Liberal government on social 
programs and health care.
<P>
	Seven billion dollars less in the two years 1996-97 and 
1997-98 is deeper than stated in the budget and will mean severe 
cuts in health care, post-secondary education and social 
programs across Canada. With federal government spending 
declining soon the federal government will have no power to 
ensure accessibility to health care, post-secondary education 
and social programs to all. It is the end of medicare and, with the 
end of CAP, provinces will not have to have social programs at 
all.

on the total dismantling of Canada's social safety net and 
Canadians do not want to see the continuing Americanization of

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on March 10, the Minister of Transport announced 
that his government was granting the coveted Hong Kong route 
to Air Canada. This weekend, however, we learned that the 
minister had done an about-face and refused without any 
justification to allow Air Canada to fly to Hong Kong before late 
December 1995.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Transport explain his government's 
decision to delay until late December 1995 Air Canada's access 
to the Hong Kong market, when this airline was all set to begin 
service to Hong Kong right away?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the second designation policy which we announced is 
not limited to Air Canada and Hong Kong. The predetermined 
passenger volume levels setting off the process also apply to 
Germany, for instance.
<P>
	All these decisions were made after a long period of reflection 
and extensive negotiations, and we feel that it is in everyone's 
interest to ensure total openness in granting landing rights.
<P>
	I must say to the hon. Leader of the Opposition that I really 
appreciate the way Air Canada President Hollis Harris reacted 
by saying that he appreciated the work done by the Government 
of Canada with regard not only to the Hong Kong matter but also 
to the bilateral agreement with the U.S., and especially to Air 
Canada being given access to the Japanese market. That is 
something he had been seeking for many years.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, how could the President of Air Canada afford to 
offend the route granting minister who is holding his company's 
future in his hands? The employees themselves are not so happy.
<P>
	During his March 10 announcement, the minister bragged 
about his balanced distribution giving Air Canada a route to 
Hong Kong and Canadian access to several countries in Asia, 
not to mention the vast majority of available flights to New York 
and Chicago.
<P>
	In this context, does the minister admit that it is unfair to 
delay the launch of the Hong Kong service until December, 
when the decisions benefiting Canadian take effect right away?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I know that the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition is very interested in this matter. I share his interest 
since we have been working on this without respite since we 
came to office. These are extremely complex situations that 
have existed for a very long time.
<P>
	I wish to repeat once again that, when the announcement was 
made, it was not only a matter of granting landing rights in Hong 
Kong. It is not necessarily true that only the Hong Kong decision 
was delayed. All decisions based on national landing levels are 
at stake and that includes Canadian Airlines International's right 
to land in Germany.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	The management of both airlines, including both presidents, 
Mr. Harris and Mr. Jenkins, reacted to all our air transport policy 
announcements by saying that they were very satisfied with the 
work done by the government, the negotiators and all those 
involved. The work was extremely difficult and very complex.
<P>
	At the end of this year, both air carriers will have the 
opportunity to compete in all markets around the world, a first in 
Canadian air transport history.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, if it was so obvious that the decision would not take 
effect immediately, how come Air Canada had already taken all 
necessary steps to start flying to Hong Kong, spending money 
and getting ready to begin service right away?
<P>
	Can the minister tell us if it is true that the decision to delay 
Air Canada's landing rights was imposed by the Prime Minister 
and that this delay prevented the immediate creation of 500 jobs 
in Montreal?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I assure the hon. Leader of the Opposition that the 
decision was not imposed by the Prime Minister. It was the 
result of a great deal of work.

	I point out to my hon. friend that Air Canada, prior to the 
announcement on the second designation levels for Canadian 
carriers, had already announced that it was going to employ 
nearly 1,000 Canadians in its operations as pilots, as flight 
attendants and as ground personnel.
<P>
	The growth and future of Air Canada and Canadian Airlines 
International will be the result of a series of initiatives 
undertaken by the government after a great deal of work.
<P>
	In response to the question of the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition, I believe the attitude exhibited by Hollis Harris and 
Kevin Jenkins ushers in a new era of confidence for the 
employees of Canadian Airlines International, of Air Canada, as 
well as the shareholders of both companies and the Canadian

question is for the Prime Minister. The <I>Financial Post</I> reported 
last week that the Prime Minister's former employer, the law 
firm of Lang Michener, confirmed that a one and a half hour 
meeting had taken place in January 1990 between the Prime 
Minister and the Matthews Group, the main partner in the 
consortium that eventually secured the Pearson Airport 
privatization contract.
<P>
	In view of the fact that Mr. Matthews said he met the Prime 
Minister to discuss the privatization of Pearson International 
Airport, contrary to what the Prime Minister stated in this House 
on December 8, does the Prime Minister still maintain that the 
subject of privatization never came up during that meeting?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think it is clear: the answer is no. I even took the time 
to check with the lawyer who represented the Matthews Group 
in the office. I spoke with him and he confirmed that the Toronto 
airport was not discussed at all. At that time, I was not aware of 
the privatization plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
again according to the <I>Financial Post</I>, Mr. Matthews's 
recollection is that the Prime Minister, who was then running for 
the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada, asked for $25,000 
in support for his campaign.
<P>
	Considering how serious the allegations made in the 
<I>Financial Post</I> are, and to dispel any doubt regarding his 
personal involvement in this matter, does the Prime Minister not 
think that he should commission a public inquiry into the 
circumstances surrounding the privatization of Pearson 
Airport?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

my question for the Minister of Finance is with regard to the new 
Canada health and social transfer.
<P>
	The CHST states that health care transfers to provinces may 
be reduced or cut off whenever the Minister of Health ``is 
satisfied'' that a province is not in line with her own 
interpretation of the Canada Health Act. The cabinet then gets to 
decide how much funding is cut from the province. This sounds 
like a recipe for arbitrary command from Ottawa.
<P>
	Why is the formula of funding reductions not based on an 
impartial formula laid out in the law?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we made it very 
clear that the new social transfer would incorporate the 
principles of the Canada Health Act. Indeed, it is those 
principles and those principles alone that will govern. There is 
no discretion. It is the Canada Health Act and that is the 
covenant of this government.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
makes no sense for the government to claim that the best way to 
maintain the standards in the Canada Health Act is by cutting off 
funding every time a province tries to innovate. The Minister of 
Health will have the power to arbitrarily yank the plug on 
federal health care spending.
<P>
	Can she explain to this House how this is supposed to improve 
the quality of health care in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Canada Health Act remains as is. It has not nor is it 
meant to prevent innovation. It is meant to preserve and 
maintain those principles which have served Canadians very

preliminary stage. Canada is studying the possibility of selling 
them to a number of people who have shown interest.
<P>
	I can also confirm what I just said to the hon. member, which 
was that there is no cause for concern with regard to Turkey, 
since negotiations are at a very preliminary stage and since, at 
any rate, the government rigorously reviews sales of this kind

	Between 1990 and 1994, Quebec lost 8,054 jobs in the defence 
industry, mainly in Montreal. These lost jobs account for more 
than half the jobs in the 40 largest military equipment 
companies and indicate the urgent need to set up a real 
conversion program. However, in the last budget, no money was 
allocated for this purpose.
<P>

program for the defence industry, considering the promises the 
Liberal Party made in its red book?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member may not have had the opportunity to 
consult with corporations and business associations in Quebec 
and throughout Canada.
<P>
	Had he had the time to do so, he would have found out, as we 
did, that the corporations and all the business associations are 
against subsidies to the private sector. What they want from us is 
strategic information and help in finding foreign markets. This 
is what our government has been doing, not only through the 
measures contained in the budget, but also through Team 
Canada, which has been promoting sales overseas.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
does the minister recognize that by cutting the DIPP program by

whom such programs are in place?

two aspects: first, immediate statutory changes to the Young 
Offenders Act to strengthen it, and second, a longer term, 
critical reassessment of the youth justice system in general.
<P>
	With respect to the first matter, last February 28 the House 
passed at third reading Bill C-37 which is now before the other 
place. It represents a toughening of the statute to deal with 
violence and a recognition that for non-violent crime, jail 
should be the last resort in favour of community based 
rehabilitative programming.

pursued even during the Revenue Canada investigations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the discussions that were held on March 16 
were part of an ongoing process of consultation with the United 
States. When we have had a chance to review further the United 
States information and material given to us on March 16, we will 
again be consulting the United States.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary question is for the same minister.
<P>
	Could he indicate what approach the government is taking 
with regard to sugar? Is sugar being negotiated as one 
commodity alone, or is it a commodity being negotiated with a 
package of goods relative to the GATT?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the question of sugar is being negotiated 
alone.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human 
Resources Development.
<P>
	The federal government has just granted a subsidy to the job 
search project <I>La Relance</I> in order to help young people with no 
income find a job. Until now, the Department of Human 
Resources Development had funded only the program for young 
unemployed workers.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Human Resources Development 
explain his department's decision to give financial assistance to 
<I>La Relance</I> when it withdrew funding from <I>Carrefour 
Jeunesse-Emploi</I> because that centre dealt with young welfare 
recipients?
<P>
<B>(1455 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we did not withdraw 
funding from the Carrefour Jeunesse. In fact the department is 
supplying something like $200,000 worth of project support this 
year.
<P>
	As far as the project Relance is concerned, we are providing 
an additional $20,000 at the end of the year to make up a backlog 
of cases. I am not sure why the hon. member would be so critical 
of any attempt to help young people in the province of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, am I to understand from the minister's answer that, 
from now on, he intends to support all groups pursuing the same 
objectives, whether they deal with people on unemployment 
insurance or with people who do not receive unemployment 
insurance benefits?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I have said in the House 
before, in the spirit of the new federal philosophy of 
decentralization where we want to give far more responsibility 
to our officers at the local region who make decisions about their 
priorities, we will be responsive to those kinds of decisions.
<P>
	It indicates a new kind of federalism. We want the programs to 
be tailored to the actual needs and priorities as determined by 
people working in those communities.

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a Court of 
Queen's Bench in Alberta has found the orders in council passed 
by the past Tory government pertaining to firearms legislation to 
be invalid because section 116(2) of the Criminal Code had not 
been adhered to.
<P>
	My question is for the justice minister. Why has he followed 
the same procedure in passing orders in council before 
Christmas, a procedure that has been declared invalid by the 
courts of this land and has not worked its way through the appeal 
courts? Why did the minister choose to follow a procedure that 
has been declared invalid by the courts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the judgment that has 
been referred to is under appeal because the federal government 
believes at first instance it was simply wrong. Without meaning 
any disrespect to the court, we have every confidence in the 
validity of the order in council.
<P>
	The appeal is pending yet government must continue. The 
government has exercised an authority which it believes has 
been done validly and lawfully in the best interest of the public.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
understand the response of the justice minister. However, he 
could have followed the procedure outlined in section 116 of the 
Criminal Code. I observe that in Bill C-68 he has made that 
provision.
<P>
	Why would the minister not follow the procedure set out in 
the Criminal Code and have the orders in council passed by the 
elected representatives of the people as section 116 of the 
Criminal Code demands and as the Court of Queen's Bench in 
Alberta has indicated is a valid procedure?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is because that 
section is not relevant to this exercise.
<P>
	Two sections in the code speak of orders in council. One has to 
do with the general power on the part of government to prohibit. 
That order in council need not be placed before the House. The 
second and different kind of order in council deals with such 
matters as regulation, fees, businesses selling firearms. Those 
orders in council must be placed before the House.
<P>
	We have distinguished between the two. We are confident of 
the validity of the steps we have taken. We feel in good faith the 
judgment at first instance in Alberta was wrong. We will pursue 
the appeal with every confidence that we shall win it.

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charest:</B> Mr. Speaker, as usual I am flattered by all of the 
attention.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Industry who is responsible 
for the Canada scholarship program for science and engineering 
students. The government's main estimates in 1995-96 said the 
``program was very successful in encouraging Canadian 
students, particularly women, to enter and stay in 
post-secondary science, engineering and technology studies''.
<P>
	Given the evaluation and the success of the program with the 
private sector and the rhetoric of the government on 
post-secondary education and R and D, why did the minister cut 
the program?
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am always happy to receive a question from the leader 
of the fifth party, particularly one who will know that the 
funding for the Canada Scholarship Plan has been fulfilled to the 
extent that it was approved and put in place by the previous 
government. Nothing was cut. Rather the funding accorded by 
the previous government has run out.
<P>
	I would like him to know that we are working very hard to find 
means to supply the Canada Scholarship Program in other ways 
and perhaps with the participation of the private sector so that a 
program like this is able to continue.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
a supplementary question.
<P>
	Given the fact that the government will not continue to reward 
the excellence of students in the area of science and 
post-secondary education, my question is for the Minister of 
Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Why is it that his department has not continued a stay in 
school program that seeks to help young Canadian men and 
women to pursue their studies so that we as a society can do 
everything we can for young men and women to obtain all the 
skills they need in their lifetime to participate fully in Canadian 
society? Why has he cut that program?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we were put in the 
unfortunate position that the previous government had only 
provided limited five-year funding. I have made a special effort 
in the past year to 
<P>

<B><A NAME="11066"> 11066 </A></B>
<P>
provide an extension of the funding so that I could then use the 
time to begin to recruit the assistance and enlistment of the 
private sector.
<P>
	We have been able to obtain a number of private sector 
sponsors as part of the stay in school program. Next fall when 
the new national basketball association team opens up in 
Vancouver and Toronto the stay in school logo will be part of its 
promotion. It has become one of the major sponsors of the 
program.
<P>
	It shows we are interested in maintaining the very valuable 
necessity of keeping our young people in school.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, here we are again on Bill C-69 which started out as 
Motion No. 12 or 13 some time ago when there was a revolt on 
the Liberal backbenches because they saw some new maps 
which changed the boundaries of their ridings shortly after the 
last election.
<P>
	Now we are at the stage where we have a new readjustment act 
nearing its final stage of debate. We are at report stage. There 
will be third reading and then it will go to the Senate.
<P>
	We have proposed several amendments but they can be 
categorized in two major groups, the first being Motion No. 5 
which has implications to Motions Nos. 1 and 2. Motion No. 7 is 
the other. Motion No. 5 is related to Motion No. 7.
<P>
	These amendments are proposed to bring Bill C-69 into line 
with the principle of equality of vote. First, the population range 
within which constituencies are allowed to vary from the 
provincial quotient should be reduced from plus or minus 25 per 
cent to plus or minus 15 per cent. Second, whatever variance is 
in place should be an absolute limit.
<P>
	Our second group of amendments takes away the discretion of 
the boundary commissions to exceed the limit in exceptional 
circumstances. It relates to clause 19(2) which sets the variable 
quotient at 25 per cent. Our amendment reduces the quotient to 
15 per cent. This change is listed as our amendment No. 4.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	Our first and second amendments are consequential to this 
change and are necessary for the continuity in legislation. They 
appear earlier in this bill which is why they must be dealt with 
first, even though they are consequential.
<P>
	Let me touch on the reasons for moving to a 15 per cent 
variance in the population quotient for a province. Large 
variances in the population of constituencies are basically 
unfair. Constituencies significantly lower than the provincial 
average population are over represented in Parliament. Because 
the number of seats within a province is fixed, if one group is 
over represented another group must be under represented. This 
unfairness cannot be entirely eliminated but it must be greatly 
reduced to tighten the variance.
<P>
	Many jurisdictions would see a variance of even less than 5 
per cent. Certainly we are being most reasonable when we 
suggest the variance be limited to plus or minus 15 per cent of 
the provincial norm.
<P>
	Equality of voting power is already stretched because our 
Constitution provides more seats in certain provinces than they 
would ordinarily receive based solely on their population.
<P>
	A 25 per cent variance allows for constituencies to be 
established with up to a 67 per cent difference in population as 
of the time of census. Redistribution occurs three to four years 
later. The population variance could be even greater by the time 
redistribution is done. By contrast, a 50 per cent variance allows 
for a 35 per cent variance in population of the ridings within the 
same province.
<P>
	A 35 per cent difference in population gives enough discretion 
to the boundary commissions to allow for considerations such as 
reasonable criteria regarding community of interest, rapid 
growth and the concerns of rural areas.
<P>
	Allowing a 67 per cent difference in the population creates too 
much opportunity for drawing boundary lines around linguistic, 
cultural and ethnic communities. It is important that all aspects 
of electoral law treat all citizens equally regardless of race, 
gender, culture, religion or ethnicity. A tighter variance 
encourages the equitable treatment of all citizens by the 
boundary commissions.
<P>
	Unusually large ridings do not need significantly lower 
populations to make them workable. There are other ways to 
accommodate those members and their constituents; for 
example, slightly larger office budgets or extra staff for travel. 
Increased use of communications technology can negate the 
need for some of the travel. When interconstituency travel is 
necessary, additional travel points can be used for travel within 
extremely large constituencies.
<P>
	One complaint we heard over and over again primarily from 
Liberal backbenchers and also from a few of the Bloc Quebecois 
MPs at the committee was they were concerned about the 
unmanageability of their large rural constituencies. They 
seemed to feel that putting at risk the high standards we hold for 
the quality of voting power of Canadians was a worthwhile 
sacrifice to maintain their rural ridings at their present sizes. 
Some argued they were too large and should be made smaller.
<P>
	The House of Commons is built on the principle of 
representation by population, not representation by geography 
of region. It therefore stands to reason that if any given area 
loses population, either in absolute terms or relative terms, on 
principle the number of MPs should also decrease.
<P>
	It is important to tighten the variance used by the majority of 
constituencies because the legislation also proposes allowing 
special case ridings to exceed the population limits. A large 
variance in the exception rule is individually bad. In 
combination they weaken the concept of voter equity to the 
point at which it is almost meaningless.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11071"> 11071 </A></B>
<P>
	A number of rural MPs were concerned about the geographic 
size of the ridings they had to represent. A smaller but also a 
strongly supported argument before our committee was that the 
urban ridings were growing so quickly they also became 
unmanageable for their members. It was rather odd to see urban 
and rural members arguing for two different clauses in section 
19 of the bill which were at counter purposes to each other, both 
hoping they would be able to protect their own turf.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	What this points out more than anything else is the 
importance of members not being on the front lines of 
negotiations when boundary lines are being drawn. In many 
instances members showed a rather sad self-interest in the 
whole process. They wanted to maintain the status quo because 
they wanted to maintain their own riding boundaries so they 
would be more comfortable. This is natural but that does not 
mean it is correct.
<P>
	The other issue that we took exception to is clause 19(3), 
which allows boundary commissions to go beyond the minus 25 
per cent rule. If the plus or minus 25 per cent rule was not 
enough, this clause actually allows the commissioners to exceed 
that variance and put additional ridings under a schedule. Our 
amendment deletes this entire clause. This makes the population 
variance an absolute number. This is listed as amendment No. 7, 
and amendment No. 3 is a consequential amendment to this 
change.
<P>
	There are reasons for opposing exceptions to the rules. 
Allowing boundary commissions to exceed the population 
limits for constituencies makes whatever variance is in the act 
meaningless. If boundary commissions are permitted to exceed 
the limit any time they want, why have a limit? It would be like 
being allowed to exceed the speed limit if it were for a good 
reason.
<P>
	The increased over representation caused by exceeding the 
minimum population defined by the variance would create more 
under-representation elsewhere in the province and that would 
stretch voter equity even further.
<P>
	There are very few ridings under the schedule now. Many MPs 
were arguing there should be more. They were saying: ``My 
riding is not under the schedule at the current time. I would sure 
like it to be there. Let us make sure that we draft a piece of 
legislation that allows for my riding to be included''.
<P>
	We saw many from northern Ontario. We saw a very 
interesting amendment in the Order Paper. Fortunately it has 
been withdrawn. It stretches believability that some members 
from northern Ontario could be so protective of their turf and not 
want to lose their riding, even though the population of Ontario 
dictates that should be the case. We saw the same ridiculous 
arguments from the province of Quebec and the separatists. It is 
funny that the Liberals and the separatists should be speaking 
from the same page on this one, both trying to represent  
sparsely populated rural ridings, trying to put them on the 
schedule for partisan purposes. It is very unfortunate.
<P>
	If exceptions to the rules are included in the legislation, 
everyone with a rural or northern riding will be trying to prove 
they deserve to be exempted. This will create difficulties for the 
commissions which will be faced with many costly and time 
consuming appeals for exceptions.
<P>
	Liberal backbenchers may again demand the maps be redrawn 
to their liking if they do not get all the exempted ridings they 
want. It will be very interesting to see the response of many of 
these members when they see the new maps, yet again for the 
second time, and see their concerns were not addressed. We 
simply cannot draw the boundaries where they were the last time 
when redistributing the ridings.
<P>
	If the 25 per cent variance has already passed for ridings 
within the same province, which will already be allowed to vary 
by 67 per cent, no further allowance can in any way be justified 
as necessary to meet the unusual circumstances.
<P>
	We have in one end of the country Labrador. It is a scheduled 
riding because it is not a part of the island of Newfoundland. 
That seems to be justification for this large rural riding to be set 
apart. We see on the other coast the riding of North 
Island-Powell River. The boundaries of that riding are partly 
on the island but extend to the mainland. It is rough, wild, 
natural terrain, beautiful country. Why should there be two sets 
of rules, particularly if we have a variance of plus or minus 25 
per cent to begin with?
<P>
	If exceptions are allowed some ridings within the same 
province could be established at the time of redistribution which 
would double the population of others. In Newfoundland the 
difference between the largest and smallest riding population is 
well over 300 per cent, more than triple. Labrador has about 
30,000 people and St. John's West has 101,000. Is that kind of 
distribution of voting power fair to the people of St. John's? No, 
it is not. That needs to be looked at.
<P>
	This legislation will encourage that practice to continue, 
rather than discourage it because it has the very broad term 
extraordinary circumstances. Of course, extraordinary can be 
interpreted just about any way the commission feels reasonable. 
There is very little direction in this act as to what extraordinary 
circumstances are as far as isolation and difficulty of 
accessibility are concerned.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	In Ontario the last distribution map stayed within the plus or 
minus 25 per cent limit. However, the difference between 
Algoma and Scarborough North, the smallest and largest 
populations, is 42 per cent.
<P>
	One of the reasons the Liberals squashed those redistribution 
maps is they said the maps were unfair to the north. In other 
words, there already was an inequity of 42 per cent between the 
most populous riding and the least populous riding in the 
province of Ontario with the maps brought forth last year. 
However, that is not enough. They want a greater discrepancy 
than that. Forty-two per cent is not acceptable to either the large 
rural ridings of the north or to the urban ridings, particularly 
those close to Toronto.
<P>
	Now the Liberals want to put these ridings into the schedule. 
They want the difference to be greater; they want more than a 42 
per cent variance in the province of Ontario. That is not good 
representation for the voters of Ontario and certainly is not good 
for all Canadians.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am not sure how you are going to be ruling on 
the Bloc amendment so I will not be able to speak to it at this 
time. I hope I will be able to because there are some democratic 
principles in place.
<P>
	I hope the Liberals will come to their senses and support these 
amendments. For the betterment of the country, let us finally see 
them do the right thing, the thing they argued in committee was 
right but what they then backed away from and voted against, 
only to bring in an inferior bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Since there is no speaker on the 
governement side, I give the floor to the member for 
Bellechasse.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to the comments by the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster. I was very surprised to hear him say 
that the hon. member for Cochrane-Superior, who made a first 
rate presentation before the procedure and House affairs 
committee, had ulterior motives. He defended not only the 
interests of his riding, but a global vision of rural Canada, which 
has been slowly emptied of its population and has had to have its 
boundaries redrawn.
<P>
	It is with great pleasure that I acknowledge the presentation 
made by the member for Cochrane-Superior to the procedure 
and House affairs committee, which revealed, among other 
things, how difficult it was to work with a schedule, and showed 
that it would probably be better to include a clause in the bill 
dealing with the special circumstances resulting from 
geographical isolation. I will come back to these points in a 
moment.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster seems to 
believe that the history of Canada started on October 26, 1993, 
the day he was elected to this House. Since the beginning of 
Confederation, we have had nine constitutions, including the 
1982 Constitution. If the member had looked at the British 
North America Act, he would have found that the first schedule 
to this act deals with the electoral districts of Ontario. The 82 
electoral districts are listed in there, and what do we find?
<P>
	That, in 1867, the founding fathers had decided that electoral 
boundaries would essentially be determined by county. 
Therefore, in 1867, counties became the basis for representation 
throughout Eastern Canada, which included Ontario, Quebec, 
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. People's sense of belonging 
started with their county. Suffice it to list the constituent 
counties of 1867. I will name the first nine only. They are the 
counties of Prescott, Glengarry, Stormont, Dundas, Russell, 
Carleton, Prince Edward, Halton and Essex. The list goes on, 
because there are 82 of them. When a county had to be divided, 
because the population was too large, it was indicated. However, 
the territorial division, and people's sense of belonging found 
expression in the county, as clearly established in the British 
North America Act.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	The riding I now represent, Bellechasse, comprises four 
counties: Dorchester, Bellechasse, Montmagny and L'Islet. In 
the past, it was represented by four members in this House-one 
for each county. Nobody threw stones or threatened to blow 
things up because representation varied from one riding to 
another.
<P>
	It was in 1964, when we began to no longer use the county as 
the basis for representation in the House of Commons, that we 
upset the whole system. Now people, wherever they live in 
Canada, have a hard time identifying with their electoral 
ridings, which have changed, naturally, because of significant 
shifts in population.
<P>
	We believe in the principle of representation by population, to 
start with, but in a tempered form, which must reflect the history 
of Canada and the fact it started out as a rural country and 
remained so for a very long time. People drifted toward the 
cities, but their first loyalties had been to the rural areas in each 
of the provinces of Canada-in the Atlantic, in Quebec, in 
Ontario or in the western provinces.
<P>
	Today, of course, there are fewer people in the rural ridings 
and an adjustment must be made. However, does it have to be to 
the third decimal point to avoid there being any variation 
between provinces or between ridings? Should we work towards 
the 15 per cent proposed by the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster, or should we stick to the traditional 
way of doing things in this country, a tolerant and open-minded 
electoral system which for the fact that the number of voters in a 
riding which is made up of 50 or 60 different communities is per 
force much lower,  while at the same time allowing for the 
boundaries 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11073"> 11073 </A></B>
<P>
of a given urban riding to be modified to take in new 
constituents subsequent to an extension to one of this riding's 
main arteries into what would have been another riding and 
would have divided a natural community?
<P>
	We should decide on a case by case basis, determine whether 
the social fabric is homogenous in a given urban riding and 
whether adding a block or two would upset anything. If the 
fabric is not homogeneous in another urban riding, for example, 
if there is a variety or a mosaic of populations to be represented, 
the situation is different. Let us avoid generalizations and the 
Reformers' approach which is to generalize everything, level 
off both peaks and valleys any way they can and split hairs in 
their counts. It is an approach, an attitude which, from the point 
of view of legislation and electoral representation, we believe is 
to be condemned.
<P>
	We would much prefer living with a variation of 25 per cent 
between ridings. But the Reform Party goes much further. It 
would like to drop subclause 19(3), which would permit 
commissions to allow a variation of more than 25 per cent 
because of geography, geographic isolation or inaccessibility. 
Obviously, we cannot agree with the Reform Party's proposal.
<P>
	This would rule out a separate riding for the Magdalen 
Islands, considerably expand the riding of Manicouagan in 
Quebec, affect the riding of Cochrane-Superior, the riding of 
Nickel Belt, all of northern Ontario, as well as his own riding. 
The hon. member may have a death wish, but you can be sure 
that I will not fly in his plane.
<P>
	In our opinion, clause 19.(3) is an inadequate safeguard. What 
we proposed in committee was to maintain the current situation 
allowing the commissions to depart from the rules on the 25 per 
cent variation every time they see fit to do so for reasons related 
to a community's special characteristics or the various interests 
of people in different parts of the province. The government has 
considerably reduced the impact. The commission will now be 
able to deviate by more than 25 per cent, but only below that 
percentage. This means that it cannot go above 125 per cent. 
Therefore, this criterion is also inadequate in a homogeneous 
urban riding.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	As you can easily understand, Mr. Speaker, there is no way we 
can support either of the amendments proposed by the Reform 
Party of Canada. Could you tell me how much time I have left?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I was not in the chair this morning, and 
have been advised that we are debating Motions Nos. 1, 2 and 3; 
Motion No. 6 has been withdrawn; the Speaker will rule on the 
acceptability of Motion No. 4 momentarily. You should 
therefore have enough time to finish your speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, what are we to make of a political 
formation, namely the Reform Party of Canada, which calls for a 
triple E Senate where the provinces would each be represented 
by six senators-every one of  them, from Prince Edward Island 
to Quebec, to Ontario, to British Columbia-regardless of their 
relative population, but not when it comes to representation in 
the House of Commons? They would like to make this House as 
uniform as possible, with every member exactly the same 
height. If they could all come in a five foot eleven and 172 pound 
format, that would perfect. That is pretty well what the Reform 
Party of Canada is suggesting.
<P>
	The Reform Party had better make up its mind. How can it be 
for a triple E Senate, with six senators representing 120,000 
people in one case and the exact same number of senators 
representing Ontario, the largest province in Canada, with 30 
per cent of the total population? This does not make sense. 
Either the Reformists are for equal representation or they are 
not. Somehow they manage to be both at the same time.
<P>
	I hope that Reform members will rise on this issue and 
elaborate on their view of a tripe E Senate, while the House of 
Commons can function very well with a deviation of plus or 
minus 25 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, so far I agree with the position of the hon. member for 
Bellechasse concerning the amendments put forth by the hon. 
member for Kinderley-Lloydminster. I am pleased to speak 
after him in this debate because he has set out so clearly the 
major aspects of this issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I also want to make my own point to the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster. I know he has had lots of practice in 
making that speech.
<P>
	We considered this question in committee in the days of when 
we were deciding what to do. The House had a debate on this 
issue in referring the matter to the committee. The issue was 
first raised then. We studied it in committee and made a report to 
the House. We had a motion for concurrence at which time this 
was one of the hotly debated issues and we heard the hon. 
member for Kindersley-Lloydminster then.
<P>
	We had a bill for second reading which was passed without 
debate, but then in committee we went back into this issue as we 
studied this clause in the bill. We made some changes that the 
hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster did not like. I see 
that one of his amendments is to delete those good changes.
<P>
	Then we come back to the House and here we have it again. I 
will lay dollars to doughnuts that we are going to hear the same 
debate from the hon. member on third reading. He is persistent, I 
grant him that and he has had lots of practice giving his speech.
<P>
	I enjoyed his remarks this afternoon. I know he had hoped he 
had convinced me that we should agree to some changes in this 
part of the bill and accept his amendments. I do not agree with 
the amendments he has put forward and I want to give him, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11074"> 11074 </A></B>
<P>
House and  Canadians the reason the government is not agreeing 
with these amendments.
<P>
	I listened to the evidence. After hearing all the evidence, I 
came to my conclusion. It is a good conclusion and I invite the 
hon. member to support it.
<P>
	What he said was that as a result of the changes in this bill 
voter equity was almost meaningless. I have to disagree with 
that. The essential principle dealing with redistribution in 
Canada is set out in clause 19(1) of this bill. If he goes back to 
that basic principle, I think he will agree with me that what we 
did was right. It says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The principle that shall guide each commission in preparing a report is that 
effective representation be the paramount consideration in determining 
reasonable electoral district boundaries in the province for which the 
commission is established.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	As a person who represents a mixed rural and urban riding, 
but almost all urban, I would have expected that equality would 
require every riding in Canada to be the same size in terms of the 
number of electors.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> In 
principle.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> In principle. I recognize the principle of 
effective representation, which is the principle we are striving 
for as set out in section 19 of the act. Coincidentally it is the 
principle enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada in its 
decision with respect to redistribution in the province of 
Saskatchewan, where the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster resides and which he knows quite a 
lot about I suspect. The principle demands that in determining 
effective representation one looks at more than the number of 
electors residing in a particular geographic area.
<P>
	We looked at this. We looked at Canada as a whole. We looked 
at the maps and we heard from members of Parliament from 
across the country who came to the committee and expressed 
their views on what effective representation meant. They told us 
about the problems they have in representing electors in some of 
the remote ridings.
<P>
	Strangely, the hon. member for Labrador did not come. Yet it 
is one of the ridings that has been accepted for some time as a 
separate riding under the current redistribution rules. He did not 
come to complain to the committee that he had grave difficulty 
in representing his riding. Some of us know some of the 
problems he has.
<P>
	The hon. member for Nunatsiaq who has over one million 
square kilometres in his riding-one-third of the country is in 
his constituency-did not come to the committee to complain 
about the problems he faces. However, there is not much he can 
do. He has a small population but they are scattered over an area 
that would make most of us blush-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Tell the whole story.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I am telling the whole story. He has a special 
case. He had a special riding created. The Northwest Territories 
is assigned two ridings under the Constitution. It will keep those 
two. They are going to be small for awhile. Some day maybe 
they will not be, but for the moment they are small.
<P>
	Looking at the rest of the country we have tremendous 
diversity. The hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster in 
his speech mentioned British Columbia. There are significant 
differences in population in ridings in British Columbia. I do not 
think there were any in the last proposals put forward by the 
commission that were exceptions in that province. There may 
have been one before but I do not think so. I do not think there 
was in 1987 either. Yet still there is a fair variation.
<P>
	The commissions in the province of Saskatchewan drew the 
boundaries very close to the limit. They stayed very close to it so 
there is not a big discrepancy. I congratulate the commissions on 
their work. However, in some provinces it is hard to do that. In 
some it is harder than in others. The size of the provinces of 
Ontario and Quebec, for example, has resulted in a difference of 
view as to whether we should have a 15 per cent limit or a 25 per 
cent limit in variation. The bill proposed 25; the hon. member in 
his amendment is proposing 15.
<P>
	I suggest that his doom and gloom scenario, his suggestion 
that ``voter equity would be almost meaningless'' is not correct. 
Under the previous law where 25 per cent was the variation, in 
1987 there were five constituencies in all of Canada that were 
beyond the 25 per cent limit, either above or below. One was 
above, four were below. That is five constituencies out of 295. It 
is not something that renders voter equity almost meaningless, 
as suggested by the hon. member.
<P>
	In the 1994 redistribution proposals that the commissions 
completed that the hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster 
says were so unpopular with Liberal members and I say were 
unpopular in large part with his own-he does not like to talk 
about that-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> No. How many appeared before the 
committee?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> No, he says. Yes, I say to him. He knows 
perfectly well that many of his members were quite unhappy, 
almost weepy at the proposals that were put forward by the-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Now I hear them laughing because they do not 
like to think of them weeping, but a few months ago it was not 
quite that way.
<P>
	The fact is there were two ridings in all the 1994 proposals 
that were above or below the 25 per cent quotient.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11075"> 11075 </A></B>
<P>
	This is not a case of rendering voter equity almost 
meaningless. For the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster to engage in that kind of rhetoric is 
not something I would expect of him. I am sure he did not really 
mean what he said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> You were arguing the same thing in 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> No. I want to turn to the words of the act itself 
because I think this is important. I do not normally like to read 
statutes in the House because it is pretty tedious.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to quote from the old Electoral Boundaries 
Readjustment Act that dealt with the power of commissions to 
go beyond the 25 per cent rule. It stated as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The commission may depart from the strict application of the rules set out in 
paragraph 1(a) and (b) in any case where:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) special geographic-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Dispense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I want the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster to hear this because he said this is 
bad.
<P>
	It stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) special geographic considerations, including in particular the sparsity or 
density of the population of various regions of the province, the accessibility of 
those regions or the size or shape thereof, appear to the commission to render 
such a departure necessary or desirable, or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) any special community or diversity of interests of the inhabitants of 
various regions of the province appears to the commission to render such a 
departure necessary or desirable,</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, those were the tests that the commissions 
appointed in 1993, and that rendered their reports late last year, 
had as their guideline.
<P>
	I ask you, Mr. Speaker, to compare those words with the words 
in clause 19(3), which the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster says will render voter equity almost 
meaningless. In 19(3) it states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A commission may depart from the application of the rule set out in 
paragraph 2(a) in circumstances that are viewed by the commission as being 
extraordinary because a part of a province, the population of which is less than 
75 per cent of the electoral quota for the province calculated in the manner 
described in subparagraph 2(a)(i) or (ii), is geographically isolated from the rest 
of the province or is not readily accessible from the rest of the province.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, the test is narrowed. It is not widened, it is 
narrowed. It is harder to get a special riding under the new rules. 
It must meet one of two tests. The old rule allowed the shape, the 
density or sparsity of population and all kinds of different things 
to enter into it. That is no longer a consideration. Accessibility 
is now the test. There are two tests: geographically isolated from 
the rest of the province or not readily accessible from the rest of 
the province.
<P>
	We have narrowed the test. The hon. member is still 
complaining that voter equity is rendered almost meaningless 
by this test. I suggest to him that he should re-read the old act, 
read the new bill, and he would conclude, as I do, that his 
amendment is not well-founded. He should leave those words in 
the new bill and support this change. It is a good change and one 
that will result in the basic principle for which we are all 
striving, that is, effective representation.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member for his intervention.
<P>
	Earlier today the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands 
raised a point of order. It was before question period. It was on 
the procedural acceptability of Motion 4 in the name of the hon. 
member for Bellechasse. He argued that the motion went beyond 
the scope of clause 16.
<P>
	I have now had the opportunity to review the arguments made 
earlier this day by both hon. members and I do thank them for 
their interventions and their arguments.
<P>
	The Chair has no difficulty in finding the amendment relevant 
to the clause and the bill since the concept of the formula of 
section 51 of the Constitution Act, 1867, is clearly introduced in 
the said clause. Furthermore, it is the opinion of the Chair that 
the amendment does not seek to amend section 51 of the 
Constitution Act, 1867, but rather it seeks to add a 
supplementary consideration for the Chief Electoral Officer in 
the determination that he must make pursuant to clause 16.
<P>
	For those reasons I will allow the amendment to go forward.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on 
Bill C-69, and particularly on the amendments proposed by the 
Reform Party. I will start by making some comments on the 
speech of the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands.
<P>
	It goes without saying that, when the member for Kingston 
and the Islands rises in this House to support the Bloc 
Quebecois, it gives him additional credibility.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, BQ):</B> This 
also reflects the open-mindedness of the Liberal member. I do 
hope that this expression of intelligence will have a positive 
effect on his colleagues, but I doubt it. As my grandmother used 
to say, we have our work cut out.
<P>
	I support the views expressed by the hon. member for 
Bellechasse and I reject the amendments proposed by the 
Reform Party concerning the application of the 15 per cent rule. 
According to the arguments put forward by the Reform Party, we 
would not have to conduct an in-depth review of electoral 
boundaries and it would probably be a simple matter of feeding 
some formula into a computer which, in a matter of minutes, 
would come up with a new riding and a new electoral map for the 
whole country.
<P>
	It seems to me that the review of electoral boundaries should 
be a more fundamental and serious exercise than that. 
Provisions in the bill that would allow a difference of 25 per cent 
would seem to be entirely justified under the circumstances, for 
very obvious reasons, especially when we are talking about 
so-called rural areas, and this applies to many of our Reform 
Party friends and in fact, to most members in this House. It 
seems to me that commonality of interests should take 
precedence over nearly all the criteria that are considered when 
it is time to review electoral boundaries.
<P>
	To represent a riding is not just a matter of being here in 
Ottawa a few days a week to listen to the arguments of other 
members. It is about considering the interests of our respective 
communities and making them known to the federal 
administration, in this case, and it is also a way for us to play a 
leading role and act as a catalyst in our communities. In other 
words, commonality of interests is essential.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	When I look at my own riding, I remember the readjustment 
that had been proposed in the now defunct Bill C-18. It would 
have created a situation that people in the area would have 
considered absurd. I had an opportunity to make this point 
during the debate on Bill C-18. My riding was turned upside 
down. Overnight, communities were grouped with other 
communities, and one example was the MRC du Granite, whose 
main city is Lac Mégantic, which all of a sudden found itself in 
the same riding as Thetford Mines. Now the people of Thetford 
Mines are all very nice, and its business people are very friendly, 
including the member for the area and my colleague, Mr. 
Chrétien.
<P>
	However, the two communities have very little in common 
since they did not evolve the same way and do not have the same 
interests. Geographically, they are next door to each other. On 
the electoral map, we see that the asbestos area is next door to 
the Granite region. However, when we consider the background 
of these communities, including their economy, their 
educational facilities, where their children go to continue their 
education, their cultural facilities, we realize that these two 
communities are not developing the same way and do not have 
the same geography.
<P>
	These aspects should be considered when the time comes to 
revise electoral boundaries. We must consider commonality of 
interests and the numbers rule should be subordinate to this 
principle. We need a degree of flexibility that will let us 
consider commonality of interests. It seems to me that the 25 per 
cent rule allows for a certain degree of accommodation that 
encourages compliance with this rule. That is why it is quite 
natural that the Bloc Quebecois should reject the amendments 
proposed by our Reform Party colleagues and is in favour of 
maintaining the 25 per cent rule.
<P>
	I may add, and I am nearing the end of my speech, that we 
need provisions in this bill that will allow for setting up 
so-called special electoral districts, in other words, districts 
that may be under 25 per cent. We gave certain examples. I 
remember the case of the Magdalen Islands, which for many 
years, from 1947 to 1968, had been an autonomous electoral 
district. From 1867 to 1946, the riding was joined to Gaspé and 
now, since 1968, it is part of the riding of 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la- Madeleine. This is a case in point, 
when we consider the very special character of the Magdalen 
Islands. There are of course other examples that were raised by 
other colleagues in this House. So again, those were the reasons 
why we should maintain the 25 per cent rule.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I must say at the outset of my remarks that I was not 
prepared to speak today, but after listening to some of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11077"> 11077 </A></B>
<P>
comments from my hon. colleagues I was impelled to rise and 
add my two cents worth to the discussion.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to correct the record concerning some comments 
attributed to the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands. He 
mentioned that the Reformers were disappointed although we 
opposed Bill C-18 a year ago and I think the phrase he used was 
that we were weepy about some of the proposed changes. He 
implied that although we opposed the bill, we actually were not 
disappointed when it passed and the existing electoral 
boundaries commissions were subsequently disbanded.
<P>
	I would like to say for the record that yes, we had some 
legitimate concerns about the proposed changes. However, we 
felt and still feel that those concerns could have been adequately 
addressed through the appropriate process that was in place at 
the time.
<P>
	We saw no need to suspend the existing provincial electoral 
boundaries commissions. We felt that elected representatives in 
this House should not have any priority over the concerns of the 
average citizen and that we should make our case either orally in 
front of the commissions when they travelled around the various 
provinces or through an appropriate paper trail.
<P>
	Speaking for myself, I took leave of that opportunity and 
presented myself to the electoral boundaries commission for 
British Columbia in Prince George on June 2. I made my case 
against the proposed changes that it had communicated.
<P>
	I am pleased to represent one of the larger ridings in British 
Columbia. It encompasses about 212,000 square kilometres. As 
we have heard today from a number of members, some rural 
ridings are very difficult to represent. It is very difficult to get 
around to all the various areas in one's riding.
<P>
	I certainly consider my riding one of the more difficult ones in 
the country to get around. It is the only riding that straddles the 
Rocky Mountains. Some 60 per cent of the population of my 
riding is on the Peace River side on the east side of the Rockies 
and 40 per cent is over on the other side. I had some concerns, as 
did some other Reform Party members and members from other 
parties.
<P>
	I made my presentation at the hearing. Lo and behold, 
miraculously the commissioners did listen to my presentation. 
Subsequently, the commission was disbanded and submitted its 
final report. I was privy to that report when it came out in 
November. I found that the committee had listened and had 
responded appropriately concerning the changes it had 
previously proposed for the Prince George-Bulkley Valley and 
the Prince George-Peace River ridings. What had actually 
happened was that the committee had listened to the member for 
Prince George-Bulkley Valley and myself and left the ridings 
as they now exist.
<P>
	It is also appropriate to mention that even with the existing 
population of British Columbia which is estimated at some 3.3 
million, the number of ridings from the 1991 census will be 34 
rather than 32. As I am aware, Elections Canada pegs the 
number at some 96,531 for the average riding size for a 
population the size of British Columbia.
<P>
	The riding of Prince George-Peace River as it currently 
exists would fall under the 15 per cent variance as proposed in 
the amendment by my colleague. Therefore, even a large rural 
riding and one of the more difficult to travel around would still 
qualify under the reduced variance that Reform is proposing. 
That should be noted.
<P>
	One other point I would like to make concerns some 
comments made by the hon. Bloc members. They seem to have 
some difficulty understanding how Reform on the one hand 
supports the concept of a triple E Senate and on the other hand 
speaks against this larger variance. It is very easy for us to 
understand. I do not know why it is so difficult for them to 
understand.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	It gets back to what we believe is the fundamental principle of 
democracy in a two house system. The lower house should be 
represented as closely and as accurately as possible by 
representation by population, while the upper house should 
represent the regions in a geographical sense. I do not 
understand why the hon. members from Quebec find that so 
difficult to understand.
<P>
	I note with real concern that amendments put forward by the 
Bloc suggest that Quebec should somehow always have some 
traditional right to 25 per cent of the seats in this House. It goes 
completely contrary to the defeat of the Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	As Reformers travelled around the country and particularly in 
western Canada speaking out against the Charlottetown accord 
during the referendum campaign, one of the concerns we heard 
from Canadians was that no area should have a right to a set 
number of seats in this Chamber and that they should be set by 
population. Who knows what is going to happen in the future? 
That was the real reason a lot of people voted against the 
Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	In closing, I make note of that for the hon. Bloc members. 
They should remember their history. Remember that one of the 
reasons people voted against the Charlottetown accord was that 
they completely discount this opinion by some Quebecers, not 
all, that somehow they have an inherent right to 25 per cent of 
the seats in this House.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I will therefore talk about the amendment proposed by the 
Reform Party to narrow the deviation from the provincial 
electoral quota from 25 per cent to 15 per cent. First, I would 
like to point out that Quebec also voted against the 
Charlottetown Accord. Obviously for different reasons, but this 
is probably the only point in history where we agreed. This is 
just about the only time in the year that the Bloc Quebecois and 
the Reform Party agreed. It was, nevertheless, for a good cause, 
basically.
<P>
	In order to understand what the 25 per cent and the 15 per cent 
situations represent, we must situate ourselves both 
geographically and demographically, since our role in the House 
is not just to represent an area and not just to represent people, 
but to represent the people in a given area. From these two 
starting points, we must look at the two elements in the process. 
There are regions where it is easy to comply with the principle 
through geographic juggling or playing with certain boundaries 
and thus relatively easy to move the scale 25 per cent or 15 per 
cent higher or lower. It is a matter of mathematics.
<P>
	Clearly mathematics does enter the picture at some point. 
However, where mathematics takes a back seat is where 
geography comes into play. There are regions, not only in 
Quebec, but in Ontario and in the Yukon, where this is not 
possible. I am sorry, but our role here in the House of Commons 
is not a static role where we represent people mathematically. 
We are here to represent people according to the demographics 
of regional characteristics. Within the process, certain basic 
elements must be taken into account. I will give you a specific 
example. Naturally, I will give you the one I know best, that of 
my riding.
<P>
	My riding is the third largest riding in the country: 465,000 
square kilometres. It is a little more than half the size of Ontario, 
just to give you an idea of what 465,000 kilometres means. It is 
not the kind of vast area where people live in 10 square 
kilometres and the rest is forest. No, there are people living 
throughout it in its farthest reaches. There is even a place where 
there are fewer people-at the heart of it. So, reasonably, a 
member has to take the time to visit the people, and the people 
also are entitled to see those they voted for, those who represent 
them, whether they voted for them or not, because they are there 
to represent them.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, 465,000 square kilometres, that is over 82 times 
the size of Prince Edward Island, which has four MPs. 
Therefore, if we were to calculate the ratio, there should be 328 
MPs for the riding of Manicouagan, which is more than the 
number of members currently in the House of Commons. If you 
want to talk math, so will we.
<P>
	It makes no sense, except that there would be a lot of Bloc 
Quebecois members. We are losing in all this, but what can I 
say? It is something we must accept.
<P>
	Now, back to the debate, because we must not lose sight of any 
of these issues in the parliamentary process. And when we take 
into consideration goals that we must strive to attain and, I 
should add, never give up on, this is stricly in the interests of the 
good representation of the taxpayers who pay our salaries.
<P>
	It takes three hours by plane to get to Blanc-Sablon, in the 
eastern corner of my riding, and if I want to visit other taxpayers 
in the north end of my riding, I have to first go back to Sept-îles 
before taking another three hour flight. I have to block off 
several days, even weeks, if I want to go to Blanc-Sablon. In 
fact, I had to prepare a schedule when I appeared before the 
committee.
<P>
	To really visit everyone in my riding, not in a whirlwind tour, 
but to actually go to each location and meet an organization, for 
example the municipal authorities at city hall or the members of 
a chamber of commerce, it takes three weeks non-stop, with no 
days off, and that is if weather permits. I must honestly admit 
that over the last year and a bit, I still have not been able to do a 
complete tour of my riding because all too often the fog prevents 
us, slows us down, makes us push back our schedule by a day. 
Taxpayers nevertheless have the right to meet their elected 
representatives. And it is the duty of elected representatives to 
meet taxpayers on their own turf so that they can better 
understand certain peculiarities, because regional 
particularities do come into play.
<P>
	In the north, for example, we find native communities, where 
hunting and fishing are the main issues. In the southwest, which 
covers the area from Sept-îles and Port-Cartier up to 
Franquelin, including Havre-Saint-Pierre, we find mostly 
mining and logging companies, naturally. Fermont is another 
mining town a little further to the north.
<P>
	That is where the road ends. That is another factor to be 
considered. There is a proposal to amend the variance from 25 
per cent to 15 per cent. When the road ends, it does not matter 
whether it is 15 or 25 per cent. These people have the right to 
live, to have access to food, to health and public services.
<P>
	We are talking about quite a different set of logistics just to 
meet with them. There is no comparison. In this sector, 75 to 80 
per cent of the inhabitants live off the fishery. But there is no 
road. There is only the boat or the plane, and in winter, the 
snowmobile.
<P>
	We know what happened recently in Blanc-Sablon. There is a 
great deal of snow, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	In conclusion, we must not take our search for a mathematical 
formula to extremes. We must continue to be proud of the work 
we are doing, and proud as well that we are able to improve the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11079"> 11079 </A></B>
<P>
quality of service to these people, because they too have rights 
and obligations, as  do we, their elected representatives. We 
must not allow a mathematical formula to make a mockery of 
what we do.
<P>
	In order to bring it into line, my riding would have to be 
enlarged by almost half the area of the entire province of 
Quebec. We would be looking at more than one House of 
Commons. No. I think that, out of respect for taxpayers, we 
should stick with figures that take geography and demography 
into account.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to address two items in connection with the 
amendment proposed by the Reform Party in relation to setting 
the variance from quota that would be used for the creation of 
new riding boundaries in the forthcoming redistribution.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	I note, as my colleague from Kingston and the Islands has 
already noted, the 25 per cent maximum variance has already 
been found to be charter compliant. It is a measuring stick that 
fits within our charter. At the end of the day it is the charter 
which governs how our electoral redistributions will take place. 
That is the foundation on which our democratic rights and 
privileges are built.
<P>
	In relation to the actual population numbers I draw to the 
attention of colleagues the possibility that during this debate 
some of us are focusing on existing population numbers when 
we look at the variance from quota that existed over 10 years ago 
when the boundaries were last redistributed around 1987.
<P>
	When some members ask whether the current variance in a 
particular riding of close to 25 per cent is democratic, I point out 
that a lot of these statistics did not exist 15 years ago. When the 
boundaries were created 15 years ago many of these ridings 
were much closer to population quota. Subsequent growth has 
caused the populations to increase or decrease and depart from 
the quota. We have to be careful in discussing that because it is 
not fair to say that because a riding is 23 per cent above quota 
now that is what would be the case if the electoral boundaries 
commissions were to reshape the boundary now.
<P>
	The electoral boundaries commissions will be expected to 
follow very close to quota when they do their work. That is how 
they operate. I have been through the process once back in the 
eighties.
<P>
	The change to the statute at committee involving the deletion 
of what was called the schedule was done for some pretty 
calculated reasons. I know they were good reasons. I debated it 
at committee. By deleting the schedule we have not rid the 
ability of particular ridings to continue to exist outside the 25 
per cent variance.
<P>
	However, we have circumscribed fairly precisely the basis on 
which they could be outside the 25 per cent variance. The 
circumstance must be extraordinary. I leave the definition of 
that to the electoral boundaries commissions. The riding must 
be geographically isolated or not readily accessible to the rest of 
the province. If the electoral boundaries commission is to 
permit a riding to exist, not just varying from the quota but 
outside the 25 per cent variance, they must give cogent reasons.
<P>
	If some democrats from the Reform Party or the Liberal Party 
or the Bloc Quebecois believe that being outside the variance 
does not comply with the charter there can always be access to 
judicial interpretation.
<P>
	We have made a reasonable compromise. We have put in place 
a reasonable mechanism to address what is truly an incredible 
variety of electoral circumstances in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I already had a few opportunities to speak about the 
readjustment of electoral boundaries.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	With regard to the amendments put forward by the Reform 
Party, I should explain to the people listening to us that this is 
not a complex technical matter. The Reform Party is simply 
asking us to make ridings larger and give greater importance to 
urban communities and less importance to the other criteria, 
including territorial settlement, thus affecting our whole vision 
of Canada's development.
<P>
	Through seemingly very technical criteria, the amendments 
put forward by the Reform Party would lead to a very clear 
choice, namely ensuring that future development is based only 
on natural population migrations without considering that any 
region may experience a temporary decline in population and 
take steps to revitalize the community. The amendments 
proposed by the Reform Party would only speed up the 
community's decline and reduce its political representation. It is 
obvious at this point, I think, that we must make sure this 
amendment is rejected.
<P>
	The second amendment, which is aimed at eliminating the 
possibility of deviating by more than 25 per cent, further 
increases the imbalance with constitutionally protected ridings. 
For instance, in Prince Edward Island and a number of other 
places, certain ridings are protected, and preventing any 
variance above 25 per cent will only increase the discrepancy 
between levels of representation.
<P>
	What kind of an advantage is a riding under constitutional 
protection given over other ridings in terms of representation? 
Because this argument of representation is coming up and I 
think that the rural communities of Western Canada must be 
surprised indeed at the position the Reform Party is taking 
today, a position which would make ridings already covering  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11080"> 11080 </A></B>
<P>
huge areas extend even further. I find it very odd indeed that the 
Reform Party should take such a stand.
<P>
	It also seems to me that, beyond the mathematics of 
representation, the idea is to ensure that representation is fair 
and accurate. Fairness is not just a matter of arithmetic. 
Otherwise, this whole thing could be resolved with a calculator 
and we would save a great deal of money. But when one riding 
covers, say, six blocks in Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver while 
another one encompasses 55 or 60 municipalities, should we not 
take into account other criteria to ensure that rural and urban 
ridings are equally represented in this Parliament?
<P>
	I do not think that anyone here will deny that these 
circumstances affect how we carry out our duties and that we 
need different ways to reach out constituents, one being to 
reduce the number of constituents in all ridings. It was just 
established that the act already provides sufficient variances to 
ensure this kind of representation in the future.
<P>
	We were asked earlier how we, from the Bloc Quebecois, 
could not share the triple E Senate vision of the Reform Party. It 
is because a triple E Senate would exacerbate the problem. In a 
triple E Senate, all provinces would have the same number of 
representatives. I have nothing against the people of Prince 
Edward Island, but let us compare the size and population of this 
province to Ontario, Quebec or British Columbia.
<P>
	Quite obviously, this is not an adequate solution. In any case, 
Quebecers had at least 15 other reasons to reject the 
Charlottetown Accord and this is certainly not the only one 
which led them to reject that deal. The accord, which was bad for 
all of Canada, had been cooked up by negotiators behind close 
doors. Afterwards, we realized that the people they claimed to 
represent had no intention of agreeing on such a deal, and they 
massively rejected it, which was a good thing for Quebec and 
Canada.
<P>
	As regards the second amendment proposed by the Reform 
Party, it is important to look at its impact, for example, on the 
Magdalen Islands, in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The Magdalen Islands are a very distinct region of Quebec. 
My Bloc colleague mentioned that his riding is too large, but 
there are other specific realities which have already been 
acknowledged by the federal government, such as being 
islanders. The distinct riding is gone. However, these 
constituents can benefit from what I would call a greater 
open-mindedness, a wider vision in terms of Quebec's 
development.
<P>
	In the Quebec Election Act, the Magdalen Islands are deemed 
to be an exception to the rule of 25 per cent. In fact, they are 
currently the only exception in the Quebec legislation. Everyone 
is pleased because we provide specific representation to people 
who have very specific and distinct problems, as can be seen 
right now with the fishing debate.
<P>
	We should ask the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine to tell us about his 
experience as the member representing the Magdalen Islands, as 
well Bonaventure. How can he ensure adequate representation 
for both regions? This is almost impossible.
<P>
	The member finds himself dealing with chambers of 
commerce which are unhappy because their interests are not 
properly looked after. It is not necessarily a matter of individual 
qualifications but probably far more a question of being able to 
represent all one's constituents. How can he do his job as a 
member in Ottawa, as well as representing Bonaventure and a 
district 500 kilometres away, surrounded by the sea?
<P>
	I think that if the Government of Canada wanted to show that 
it understands the particular needs of regional development and 
especially this region, it would accept the proposal presented by 
the Bloc. At the very least we must defeat the amendments 
proposed by the Reform Party which would preclude any 
flexibility in this respect. I think we have to send a message to 
that effect.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to respond to a question I 
was asked in committee, a question I felt was particularly 
insulting to the people in my area. The hon. member from 
Kindersley-Lloydminster asked me whether it was to protect 
the electoral districts consisting of 100 per cent, ``pure laine'', 
French Canadians, as he put it, that I was telling them to protect 
the five counties in Eastern Quebec.
<P>
	At this point, I had to give him a history lesson, because he 
was unaware of the fact that in addition to francophone 
communities there were also anglophone communities that were 
established long ago, at the time the Loyalists left the United 
States to settle in the Gaspé.
<P>
	There are also aboriginal communities in these ridings which 
would like proper representation. So our intervention was not to 
protect the French Canadians in this area but to ensure that all 
citizens enjoy adequate representation.
<P>
	I think this is symptomatic of the contempt in which the 
Reform Party holds members of this House and the role they 
have to play. I do not think anyone in this House makes 
representations to ensure he will be re-elected. In any case, 
changes are so unpredictable.
<P>
	If during the last election, the Conservatives had done 
everything they could to protect themselves, instead of two 
members they might have had four or five, but basically, the 
result would have been the same. I do not think members make 
proposals to protect their ridings but to ensure that citizens are 
satisfactorily represented.
<P>
	So, I believe it is important that all groups in our society, all 
individuals, but also the type of communities that they form--
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11081"> 11081 </A></B>
<P>
Native, English, French and other communities in 
Canada-have an adequate representation, and it is certainly not 
by applying the two amendments moved by the Reform Party 
that we will achieve this result.
<P>
	So, it is important to reject these two amendments in order to 
ensure that the federal distribution map, if it needs to be used 
again in the future-I personally hope that we will never need it 
again-because, if there is a conclusion that we come to beyond 
the issue of the distribution map, it is the fact that double 
representation, with federal and provincial members of 
Parliament, is confusing to people. They do not know who is 
responsible for what any more. It would be very important to 
change this situation.
<P>
	If I were a federalist, I would say: ``Let us clarify in the 
Constitution the roles of everyone so that we do not trip over the 
same responsibilities''. But as a sovereignist, and because of my 
own experience over the past 30 years, I believe that the solution 
is obviously for Quebec to achieve sovereignty.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	But, in order to respect Quebecers' right to representation, 
and also because we were elected not only to promote the cause 
of sovereignty, but to defend Quebec's interests, I think it is 
important that we pass legislation that will allow for the best 
possible representation of all voters in Canada-in my 
particular case, those of Quebec-and therefore I hope that 
these amendments will be rejected so that we can ensure proper 
representation for all the people who deserve it, for all citizens 
of Quebec and Canada.

	The House will now proceed to consideration of Motion No.

<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 4</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-69, in Clause 16, be amended by replacing lines 41 to 44, page 8, 
with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Constitution Act, 1867 and, notwithstanding the foregoing, when by 
application of this subsection the number of members to be assigned to the 
Province of Quebec is less than 25 per cent of the total number of members in 
the House of Commons, the Chief Electoral Officer shall assign at least 25 per 
cent of the total number of members to the Province of Quebec.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2.1) The Chief Electoral Officer shall cause a notice to be published in the 
Canada Gazette forthwith setting out the results thereof.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, we are finally at the heart of the debate. 
We are nearing the point where we will know whether or not this 
House recognizes Quebec a right we have always considered 
normal, as one of the two founding peoples, the right to be 
represented according to our historical participation in 
Canadian institutions. Aside from what my friend, the hon. 
member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, was saying 
awhile ago-since we hope that this bill on electoral boundaries 
will not apply to Quebec-we must continue to live with the 
institutions where we have been called to serve and work, in the 
hope of improving them until such time when Quebec 
democratically chooses to separate.
<P>
	The Constitution Act of 1791, the first providing for elected 
representation, gave Quebec a large majority of seats. It means 
that in 1791, francophones controlled the legislative assembly. 
The Union Act of 1840 reduced Quebecers' share to half the 
seats in the House of the Province of Canada although, at the 
time, their numbers were far greater than those of the English 
speaking population.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	On the eve of the union of 1867, there were, right here in 
Ottawa, in the Parliament of the Province of Canada, 65 
members from Quebec and 65 members from Upper Canada. We 
had half the seats. What happened since then? From 65 out of 
130, or 50 per cent, as we were on June 30, 1867, we went the 
very next 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11082"> 11082 </A></B>
<P>
day to 65 out of 181, or a third, at least theoretically since the 
elections had not been called yet.
<P>
	Today, as we sit in this 35th Parliament, we are 75 out of 295 
and, should the trend continue, should we remain in this federal 
system which is relentlessly stifling us, we will have only 75 
seats out of 301 in the 36th Parliament. Then it will be out of 
310, 330, 340. This is Quebec's slow agony. Today we are called 
on to say if we accept this slow agony for Quebec, regardless of 
the referendum results. I am in good company to comment this 
situation.
<P>
	Fortunately, we have <I>Hansard</I>, the official report of the 
debates, which allows us to see how our friends in this House 
looked at this issue, in 1992. I refer especially to page 12795 of 
<I>Hansard</I> of September 9, 1992, in which the hon. member for 
Papineau-Saint-Michel, the current Canadian Minister of 
Foreign Affairs said, and I quote: ``Another demand is the 
preservation of Quebec's representation within common 
institutions to fully reflect its particular status in Canada. Item 
21 guarantees that Quebec will be assigned no fewer than 25 per 
cent of the seats in the House of Commons''.
<P>
	The hon. member for Papineau-Saint-Michel goes on to say: 
``This is in fact an extraordinary gain showing the remarkable 
generosity of our Canadian partners who thus recognize 
Quebec's distinctiveness''. The hon. member for 
Papineau-Saint-Michel, who is now a government minister, 
will surely not change his mind when the matter is voted on. He 
will surely remember a speech he made as recently as September 
9, 1992 and support the amendment tabled by the Bloc today.
<P>
	Other people not known as sovereignists have considered this 
issue. These people have expressed conflicting constitutional 
positions. A case in point is Senator Jean-Claude Rivest who, 
when he appeared before the Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs on June 21, dealt in particular with the issue of a 
minimum level of representation for Quebec, what this 
minimum level should be and why.
<P>
	In the June 21, 1994 issue, No. 18, of the Minutes of 
Proceedings of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs, Senator Rivest is quoted as saying: ``However, the 
constitutional system that the Canadian constitution imposes on 
the various provinces varies considerably from province to 
province. In particular, the constitutional obligations that were 
imposed upon Quebec in 1867, and which were maintained in 
the 1982 Act are much greater than those imposed on other 
provinces.
<P>
	One only has to recall the special language requirements 
imposed upon Quebec concerning the use of French and English 
in the legislature and in the courts, the provisions that were 
renewed concerning Quebec pursuant to section 23 of the 
Charter having to do with the language of instruction, and the 
constitutional obligation that only the government of Quebec 
has to maintain two school board systems''.
<P>
	So, says Senator Rivest: ``The principle that the various 
provinces should be constitutionally equal is contradicted by the 
very text of the Constitution, which opens the way for the 
government of Quebec to demand, strictly at the constitutional 
level, i.e. in terms of the House of Commons, the Senate and the 
Supreme Court, special constitutional status that corresponds to 
the sociological, linguistic and historical reality of Quebec 
within the Canadian federation''.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	Senator Rivest added: ``One example would be the 25 percent 
representation rule within the House of Commons, along with 
the fact that in the current Senate, Quebec has a markedly 
greater representation than do the other provinces of regions of 
Canada. A second example would be the Supreme Court. Only 
Quebec is guaranteed three seats on the Supreme Court. So when 
it came time to negotiate about the House of Commons, as I just 
said, we demanded 25 percent representation. From a federalist 
point of view, the basic problem of Quebec's society-and this 
is still Senator Rivest talking-and not the problem of the 
province of Quebec, is that it is inconceivable and no doubt 
unacceptable for Quebecers, for Quebec's society, to be part of 
the Canadian federation without the assurance and the 
constitutional and legal guarantees that the various Quebec 
governments have always sought and with which Quebec could 
retain, at the institutional level, not a majority, not equality, but 
enough of a critical mass to have influence corresponding to its 
historical, sociological and cultural reality within the Canadian 
federation. For Quebec, this is something that is not 
negotiable''.
<P>
	I am quoting Senator Rivest, who has not yet joined the Yes 
camp in the referendum debate. I asked Senator Rivest this last 
question when he appeared before us: ``If Quebecers were to 
decide to postpone their move toward sovereignty, would you 
now be in favour of including a constitutional clause that would 
guarantee them 25 per cent representation''?
<P>
	Senator Rivest replied: ``I think that no matter how the Senate 
is reformed, it will be extremely difficult for the Premier of 
Quebec, assuming that the federal system continues, to agree to 
any constitutional standard, regarding the number of members, 
that would be below a 25 per cent threshold''.
<P>
	I just quoted two staunch federalists, two people who actively 
participated in the abortive attempts to reform Canadian 
federalism.
<P>
	I see across the way some of the members who supported this 
minimum of 25 per cent, this critical mass that Quebec so badly 
needs in this House. The member for Cochrane-Superior voted 
in favour of the motion, as did the member for Saint-Maurice 
and current Prime Minister, the member for Sudbury, now 
Minister of Health, the member for Papineau-Saint-Michel, of 
course, after what he said, voted in favour of the motion and, 
oddly enough, the only two paired members, the  hon. member 
for Kingston and the Islands and the former Solicitor General, 
Mr. Lewis. I hope that he will not be paired in the vote, and that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11083"> 11083 </A></B>
<P>
he will support, as his colleagues have done, a minimum 
representation for Quebec.
<P>
	The vote that will be held in this House will send a message to 
those Quebecers who still have doubts about the willingness to 
reform federal institutions. It will tell them whether there is, 
among the Liberal members opposite, the willingness to give 
Quebec a minimum guarantee that the Liberals themselves, 
when they were in opposition, felt so strongly that Quebec 
should have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I always respect the views of the hon. member for 
Bellechasse which he expressed so well this afternoon. I think 
the problem is that he chose a subject that is not part of the bill.
<P>
	Actually, the issue he raised today by proposing this motion in 
amendment is a constitutional issue, one for a debate on the 
Constitution like we had during the debate to which he referred 
in his speech, right up to the vote. Was it on the constitutional 
question? Or was it on the Charlottetown accord? It was either 
one or the other.
<P>
	I remember that evening when I was not in the House to vote 
on this question. It was a very important question, and I 
supported the Charlottetown accord.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	I supported the accord, and the voters in Kingston and the 
Islands voted for it, but I am sure the hon. member for 
Bellechasse did not support the Charlottetown accord. I hope he 
did, but I am afraid he voted against it. I am sure that Reform 
Party members in this House voted against Charlottetown, and 
that is too bad, because it was a good accord and I supported it, 
as I said before.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Charlottetown accord died. While some of us worked 
very hard on the referendum campaign to ensure its success, as I 
did, it was rejected by the people and we must respect that 
decision and try to get on with life.
<P>
	If the hon. member wants to amend the Constitution of 
Canada to provide some minimum number of seats for another 
province, that is fine. We already have some of those in the 
Constitution, with respect to Prince Edward Island and New 
Brunswick at the moment. We can deal with amendments to the 
Constitution of Canada. However, I am not going to support 
efforts to make those changes through the back door by changing 
the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act.
<P>
	The hon. member knows this is a back door way of trying to 
achieve something that requires a front door approach. What he 
is asking us to do is ensure that another province be added to the 
list of those guaranteed protection under the act. In my view we 
have too many of them now. In addition to the two guarantees in 
favour of a Senate floor in all provinces but that are now full  
force in effect in respect of both Prince Edward Island and New 
Brunswick, we have the grandfather clause introduced into the 
Constitution by the previous government.
<P>
	The grandfather clause ensures that provinces will not drop 
below the number of seats they had in the House in I think 1979. 
That clause is protecting several other provinces which in a 
normal redistribution would lose seats to more populous 
provinces.
<P>
	Now we have the spectacle of the Reform Party urging on the 
House a reduction in the number of seats in the House. It would 
have abolished the grandfather clause and reduced the number 
of seats in many provinces. I am afraid we would have said 
goodbye to the hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminister 
because his province would have lost a very large number of 
seats. I can only imagine that when the electors got a chance to 
deal with him, having put forward such a proposition, they 
would have made short work of his political career, which I am 
sure would be a matter of considerable regret to many of us in 
the House.
<P>
	The government rejected this idea and I see it has not come 
back in amendments today. I can understand why. I suspect that 
if the members of the Reform Party pushed the reduction in seats 
in amendments with the dire consequences that we all know 
would follow for the province of Saskatchewan among others, 
they would be in difficulty today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> It is beyond the scope of the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> The hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminister from his seat said it is beyond the 
scope of the bill. I agree with him, but then so is this one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. The Chair 
has made a ruling on whether the Bloc amendment was in order 
and within the scope of the bill. I wonder if he might withdraw 
that.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. parliamentary secretary 
would know better than to do that. We must put a positive 
interpretation on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am fully aware that it has 
already been ruled to be in order. It does not mean that I do not 
have my views on what the amendment was. I made them earlier 
today. They are on the record. The hon. member may wish to 
re-read my remarks.
<P>
	Looking at this motion today, the hon. member for 
Bellechasse should also bear in mind that what we are trying do 
by this law is get a law that will survive court challenges. He 
knows as well as I do that when we were considering the bill in 
committee we looked very carefully at previous court decisions 
in respect of representation matters in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11084"> 11084 </A></B>
<P>
	We tried to come up with wording that would ensure our bill 
fell within the parameters laid down by the courts, interpreting 
the Constitution Act in ways to see that this complies in every 
respect with that act so that we will not have the electoral 
boundaries drawn up by a commission thrown out as being 
contrary either to the Constitution Act or to the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act and that will ensure the 
provisions of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act are 
not held to be inconsistent with the Constitution Act.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Section 52 of the Constitution Act, 1867, provides that the 
number of members of the House of Commons may be from time 
to time increased by the Parliament of Canada provided the 
proportionate representation of the provinces prescribed by this 
act is not thereby disturbed.
<P>
	The question is will a change provided for in this act disturb 
the proportionate representation of the provinces prescribed by 
the Constitution Act. It would or could depending on the number 
of seats added or taken away in order to achieve the result 
desired by the hon. member in his amendment.
<P>
	Therefore the amendment may be contrary to section 52 of the 
Constitution Act. If it were, it could throw out the entire 
redistribution all across the country after it was complete. What 
needs to be amended here is not the Electoral Boundaries 
Readjustment Act but the Constitution Act to attain the result 
the hon. member desires.
<P>
	Furthermore, if a guarantee of 25 per cent of the seats for 
Quebec affects the principle of proportionate representation 
then the motion could require this constitutional amendment 
under the seven provinces and 50 per cent of the population rule 
pursuant to section 42 of the Constitution Act, 1982, which 
provides as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) An amendment to the Constitution of Canada in relation to the following 
matters may be made only in accordance with subsection 38(1);</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) the principle of proportionate representation of the provinces in the House 
of Commons prescribed by the Constitution of Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Given that this kind of constitutional amendment, this kind of 
guarantee, may require the consent of seven provinces 
representing 50 per cent of the population and may not be done 
by a simple act of Parliament, again I suggest this is an 
inappropriate way to do it.
<P>
	He knows perfectly well that the Charlottetown accord 
provided such a vehicle and amended the Constitution of Canada 
in respect of certain matters but adopted the requirements 
required by the Constitution for the 50 per cent where necessary 
in unanimity in certain other cases.
<P>
	The constitutional accord was worked out on that basis. His 
amendment needs to be worked out on that kind of basis because 
it does affect the principle of proportionate representation of the 
provinces in the House.
<P>
	Accordingly, it is a matter that needs to be dealt with as an 
amendment to the Constitution of Canada, not as an amendment 
to the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act.
<P>
	For that reason in spite of the very eloquent remarks he made 
and in spite of the suggestion that members of the House have 
voted previously in support of the general principle of this 
proposition, in this case the House would do very well to reject 
the amendment he has proposed and allow it to be brought 
forward if he wishes as a private member's bill to amend the 
Constitution Act or wait until the House gets a bill before it that 
deals with the Constitution Act and the representation of the 
people in that act. We can then touch on it.
<P>
	I note that for the record in respect of the committee's own 
proceedings on this matter it recommended that a review of the 
question of the size of the House, the number of members here or 
whether there should be a reduction, should be referred to the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs in the next 
Parliament when the 1996 quinquennial census will be complete 
and in the hands of Parliament so that members can look at the 
representation of the population in the various provinces and 
make a decision as to whether we should attempt a freeze or 
reduction in the number of MPs based on the shifts in population 
reflected in the quinquennial census.
<P>
	I am optimistic that a new committee will come up with an 
answer to the hon. member's problem and look at amending the 
Constitution at that time to achieve that result. We should keep 
our socks on and be patient. Perhaps in the next Parliament we 
will be able to deal with the issue.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminister will 
probably give us an earful on that as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is with some interest and almost disbelief that I 
hear some of the arguments, particularly put forward by the Bloc 
today, suggesting Quebec should be entitled to 25 per cent of the 
seats of the House of Commons in perpetuity regardless of the 
role that history will play in the future of our country and a 
number of other reasons.
<P>
	Before I respond to that I will quickly respond to the hon. 
member for Kingston and the Islands who suggested that if 
Saskatchewan were to lose a few seats in the House along with 
other provinces somehow it would reflect badly upon those of us 
who suggest Canadians want less government rather than more 
government.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	I say to the hon. member that in the province of 
Saskatchewan, while there are many things the provincial 
government has done which I disagree with, one of the things it 
has done that I do agree with is that it has reduced the number of 
provincial seats from 66 to 58. If the current provincial 
government in Saskatchewan gets re-elected, one of the reasons 
it may win re-election is the fact that it has reduced the number 
of seats in the province. This is contrary to the wisdom of 
Liberal members in this House who seem to think we need to 
expand the number of seats in this place to please Canadians and 
to serve them better.
<P>
	With respect to the amendment proposed by the Bloc, the 
Liberals agreed with the Reform Party on most of the proposals 
which were put forward, including this one. On the others, the 
Liberals backed away from these principles. The Bloc pursued a 
very interesting strategy in that it supported the government 
even though it disagreed with the government on this issue all 
the way through the progress and development of this bill.
<P>
	It seemed rather odd that the Bloc would stand with the 
government. Liberal and Reform members did not agree at any 
point that Quebec should be guaranteed 25 per cent of the seats 
in the House. I am not too sure why, but all of a sudden the Bloc 
decided that this had become a major issue and it would have to 
reverse its position on the bill.
<P>
	Let us take a look at what would happen if we followed the 
Bloc proposal. The Bloc want to guarantee that Quebec will 
have 25 per cent of the seats in the House of Commons 
regardless of population. It claims this is Quebec's historical 
proportion of seats. The Bloc may be proposing this because it 
knows it will lose the referendum and it wants to remain in the 
House.
<P>
	In any case, it violates the principle of representation by 
population. Seats are added to provinces to account for 
population growth and proportional shifts. If all the provinces 
insisted on retaining their proportion of seats, a provincial 
redistribution would simply not occur. That would create even 
greater discrepancies in the population of provincial 
constituencies as the country continued to grow. I would like to 
give a couple of examples of this. I hope the Bloc members are 
paying attention.
<P>
	In 1925 Saskatchewan had 21 out of 245 seats in this House. If 
Saskatchewan demanded to have its historical proportion of 
seats, it would now receive 26 seats out of 301 in the next 
redistribution. That is almost double the current total of 14 
seats.
<P>
	Who would give up those seats? Certainly, Quebec could not 
because that would not guarantee its 25 per cent. I guess those 
seats would have to come from the province of Ontario. Or 
perhaps the province of British Columbia would give up a few. I 
am sure all of us would have to give a bit to make Saskatchewan 
and Quebec happy if they were guaranteed their historical 
percentage of seats. Saskatchewan would have to have 26 seats 
and  Quebec would have to have 25 per cent of the total. It would 
be a big problem.
<P>
	Let us look at an even more interesting scenario. The province 
of Nova Scotia at one time had 21 out of 213 seats in this House. 
That was at about the turn of the century. A few years later, 
Alberta and British Columbia received their representation and 
they only had seven members in this House. If we locked things 
in in that scenario, Nova Scotia would now have 30 seats in this 
House and Alberta and British Columbia would probably still be 
under 10 seats, even though their populations far surpass the 
province of Nova Scotia. What would we do about that?
<P>
	Seats are allocated on the basis of population shifts relative to 
the population of the entire country. It has to be that way because 
Canada is a nation which has always grown at different rates at 
different stages and times in its history. The government must 
adapt and pass laws to fit the reality of the day, not the reality of 
a century ago. We cannot always navel gaze into the future to 
predict exactly what is going to happen.
<P>
	Fixing seat allocations at an arbitrary moment in time is folly. 
No one can know how the country will develop in the next 
century. We must not create something which future generations 
cannot live with and cannot change which, in fact, would be 
reason to continue some of the divisive arguments we have 
heard in the past between different regions and provinces within 
the country.
<P>
	As Quebec currently has one of the slowest growing 
populations in Canada according to Elections Canada 
projections, in order for Quebec to retain 25 per cent of the seats 
in the House of Commons other provinces would have to 
surrender them. Otherwise more seats would constantly have to 
be added to the House of Commons and given to the province of 
Quebec. The House would become enormous in no time if we 
followed that practice.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	The current formula predicts a House with 318 members by 
the year 2016 AD, with 75 seats going to Quebec. If Quebec 
were to have a guaranteed 25 per cent of the seats, other 
provinces would have to surrender five seats. If the other 
provinces were not prepared to surrender five seats, then six 
seats would have to be added to the province of Quebec to bring 
it up to the 25 per cent mark. As time went on, the number of 
extra seats required in an already growing House would 
increase.
<P>
	This is clearly anti-democratic. It is typical of members of a 
party and a movement in Canada that cannot even agree on a 
question regarding the future of this country and whether or not 
Quebec will remain in Canada. They want to make sure the 
question will be carried in their favour. They cannot agree on the 
referendum question and the timing for that question because 
they want to guarantee the answer will be the one they want. 
Therefore, they will design the question to fit the  scenario. 
Certainly this is anti-democratic, just as it is anti-democratic 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11086"> 11086 </A></B>
<P>
for the Bloc to be declaring that Quebec deserves 25 per cent of 
the seats of the House of Commons regardless of its population.
<P>
	It was these types of principles and this type of reasoning 
which defeated the Charlottetown accord. I am disappointed the 
member for Kingston and the Islands was defending the 
Charlottetown accord, an accord that demanded a double 
majority in the Senate based on language and one that also 
guaranteed Quebec 25 per cent of the seats in the House of 
Commons. The member cannot have it both ways. He cannot 
speak against 25 per cent in this House now and then speak in 
favour of the Charlottetown accord which included those same 
measures.
<P>
	Also, the member for Kingston and the Islands and others in 
this House have suggested that because the Charlottetown 
accord called for an elected Senate somehow we compromised 
in our position. I remind all hon. members in this House that we 
called for a triple E Senate which was not only elected but also 
had equal representation from each province to overcome the 
concerns of the province of Quebec. Should its population 
decline it would have had that protection in the Senate with an 
equal number of representatives in the upper House, the same as 
every other province in Canada.
<P>
	It makes sense. It is the way this country needs to be governed 
and it is about time that the members in this House from the 
other parties realized it.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, to start with, I would like to respond to the Reform 
Party's contentions. Just because you neglected to come to the 
defence of your people in Saskatchewan, we do not have to 
follow suit in Quebec. We were elected to defend the interests of 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Would the hon. member please direct 
his comments through the chair?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> I will repeat, then, that if the Reform member 
raised the issue of Saskatchewan, but failed to defend the 
province as he should have, it is not my problem. We were 
elected to defend the interests of Quebec and defending the 
interests of Quebec entails ensuring that we will have a 
minimum to look forward to, in the future, in Canada.
<P>
	I have never represented Canada in the House. I represent a 
riding in Quebec which is part of Canada and I hope that it will 
cease to be a part of it in the very near future. The Parliament of 
Canada will be sending a clear message to Quebecers if it 
decides that Quebec does not deserve 25 per cent of all seats. A 
message that Canada will give us no minimum guarantees, that 
we are not one of the founding peoples and that we do not even 
deserve 25 per cent of the seats in Parliament.
<P>
	If Parliament votes against our proposal, it would mean that 
Quebec deserves less protection than Prince Edward Island, 
because Prince Edward Island has a guarantee under the 
constitution. And it does have, for its population, a very large 
guarantee indeed. And the people of Quebec will always 
remember this clearly, whether from within the current system 
or from their own sovereign state.
<P>
	I invite the Reform Party to come and just try to sell its 
opinion to Quebec that we do not deserve 25 per cent of the 
seats. Quebecers will be quite clear in their reply, particularly to 
Reformers but also to any other party which would come to 
Quebec with the message that we in Quebec, who founded this 
country, do not deserve 25 per cent of the seats. I look forward to 
seeing the day that the Liberals come to Quebec to say that they 
rejected our proposal.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands told us earlier 
that he was very concerned about the legality and 
constitutionality of this clause. I would urge him to vote on this 
amendment based on the substance of the issue and to let the 
Supreme Court determine the validity of the argument. It is not 
for us to interpret whatever decision the government makes on 
this issue.
<P>
	I would also like to remind my colleagues in this House of the 
remarks made by a true Canadian visionary, Mr. René Lévesque. 
During the 1970s, Mr. Lévesque said: ``If we stay in this system 
as it is now, we will shrink. With the ever increasing majority, 
we will always remain a minority and will never have the 
opportunity to become a nation within this country''.
<P>
	For us, the proposal on the table is the least we need to see if 
you are ready to treat us on an equal basis in this society and to 
accept a minimum number of changes.
<P>
	When the hon. member said earlier that a constitutional 
amendment might be needed, well, if this is what it takes to 
guarantee equality to francophones in Quebec and the whole 
population of Quebec, then it is up to you to introduce it. If you 
do not, you will be burying you head in the sand and giving 
Quebecers even less hope for a future within Canada than they 
have now.
<P>
	I would like to point out that the first time my grandfather 
voted in his life, he voted for Laurier. This was the first he voted. 
He would often tell me this story, and he was very proud of it. 
The prime minister, then only a candidate, used to travel by train 
and stop in every municipality on the way. From the last car, he 
gave a short speech in each municipality, and it was on the basis 
of this that people voted.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11087"> 11087 </A></B>
<P>
	It was then that my grandfather understood that the debate 
in Canada would always be about who best answered the 
question ``Will French Canadians be treated as the equals of 
English Canadians?'' This was how he saw the situation. He 
used to say that the British North America Act had been signed 
by Quebec, by Quebecers, because they felt it gave them a 
minimum of security with respect to their expectations.
<P>
	The same man, several years later, voted for what was called 
the Bloc populaire. This party was no longer talking about 
equality in Canada. This came after a very significant moment in 
history when the importance of the 25 per cent was brought 
home. It was when Quebecers voted in an overwhelming 
majority against conscription, but had it shoved down their 
throats anyway.
<P>
	Our great fear is that without this guarantee in the future, you 
will treat us more than ever like a minority, systematically 
reducing our representation to 15, 12, 10 per cent and maybe 
even achieving what some might like to see happen. But if we do 
not get this commitment from the present government-and I 
think that the proposed amendment is an amendment in 
principle-it will be a clear message, a very symbolic and 
significant sign that Canada no longer wants Quebec, no longer 
wants it to play the role it has always played since the 
introduction of the British North America Act.
<P>
	In voting on this amendment, the Liberal majority, and 
Reform members too, because we are told that it is a free vote 
for them, will be making an important statement. Furthermore, I 
have the impression that there are among the ranks of the 
Reform Party a few hon. members who will, on their own, 
decide that the amendment is very acceptable.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would say that this type of amendment is one 
of the very reasons for our presence here. The Bloc was elected 
to defend the interests of Quebec, to let Quebecers see the 
machinations of the system, because if we had not been here, 
this amendment would not have been tabled. If the Bloc 
Quebecois did not form the official opposition, if it were not a 
significant party in the House of Commons, there would never 
have been a debate on this issue. Our question to the federalists 
is this: ``Are you ready to let Quebec take its rightful place or do 
you want to put it in its place?'' I hope that you will make the 
right choice.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a few brief comments on the matter raised by 
hon. members opposite.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	I listened carefully to the remarks of the mover, a colleague 
with whom I have worked on a number of parliamentary matters. 
I have to give him great credit for working very well in the 
parliamentary committee system and making a significant 
contribution there and in the House.
<P>
	I listened carefully to the remarks of my colleague from 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup. On the issues of providing a 
minimum number of seats in Parliament to the province of 
Quebec and of capping the number of members elected in total 
to Parliament, I think members opposite would find a fair bit of 
support on the government benches, at least for the capping.
<P>
	I can only speak for myself. If the Constitution is capable of 
providing a floor for the province of Prince Edward Island for a 
particular reason-whatever it was at the time-I do not see why 
the people of Canada would not be prepared to discuss a floor for 
the province of Quebec for whatever reasons exist at a particular 
point in time. I can see what the reasons are, as can members 
opposite.
<P>
	Conceptually I do not have a problem with capping or with 
floors if that is what the political discussions yield. However, 
those discussions, those changes are constitutional as my 
colleague from Kingston and the Islands has pointed out.
<P>
	We are not going to be able to wag the dog with its tail here. 
Capping of the House of Commons and providing a floor to a 
particular province or region is a constitutional matter which we 
are incapable of addressing in this bill.
<P>
	The Speaker has already ruled that the motion is not out of 
order. We could legislate. However, given the remarks of my 
colleague from Kingston and the Islands, I am not too sure that 
adopting this provision would have the result intended. It might 
skew the interpretation of the Constitution.
<P>
	I wanted to signal to my colleagues opposite that I hear, I 
understand and I am not unsympathetic to the concept. However, 
I believe it is constitutional. It is odd and I find it odd. I know 
members opposite will understand that it is peculiar to say the 
least that members opposite would be looking for changes in a 
Constitution they have indicated they wish to abandon within a 
few months.
<P>
	That regrettably points out perhaps an Achilles' heel, perhaps 
a weakness in the perspective of the Bloc, which makes a 
contribution to the problem. We do not always agree; many 
times we do not. However, to the citizens in the province of 
Quebec, I think it is fair to say that the only way we will get 
constitutional resolutions to the many issues that may confront 
Canada is to get back into that envelope of discussion. That is in 
the hands of the Prime Minister and the premiers. It is a matter 
they do not want to address now.
<P>
	At the present time we have to deal with redistribution the 
way it is. I want the record to show those remarks.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to be able to rise this afternoon to speak on a matter that 
seems to be only a technical consideration of figures. However, 
basically, it is an opportunity to show Quebecers how the rest of 
Canada envisions Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	My hon. colleague opposite mentioned a moment ago that 
since the Bloc Quebecois sanctions Quebec's sovereignist 
agenda, we should not give too much importance to the 
readjustment of electoral boundaries since Quebec will have 
ceased to exist as a province within a few months. He is 
perfectly right. If there is something which does not motivate 
me to speak too long, it is certainly the rearrangement of an 
electoral map including Quebec, because I fervently hope that 
sovereignty will be proclaimed very soon. But it is a good 
opportunity to show Quebecers what the rest of Canada thinks of 
the role of Quebec in the Canadian confederation.
<P>
	Giving Quebec 25 per cent of the seats is more or less 
proportionate to what we pay in taxes. There is an old maxim 
that says ``No taxation without representation''. Let us go back 
in time to see how we have been treated since the conquest of 
Quebec, or New France, by England.
<P>
	It must be realized that some 250 years ago, this territory was 
totally owned by New France. We had families, we spoke 
French, and economic, social and cultural activities were all 
conducted in French. Then came the conquest. It did not simply 
transfer custody over the country from the King of France to the 
King of England. It also brought forth assimilation dynamics 
which caused the territory to be separated between Upper 
Canada and Lower Canada a hundred years later.
<P>
	We must not forget that at the time, the economic situation 
was critical in Upper Canada whereas it was very comfortable in 
Lower Canada, Quebec in other words. The Union was 
essentially a means for Quebec and its sound economy to help 
finance Upper Canada where the economic situation was rather 
on the slow. And the federal government did not stop there. To 
finance wars which were continuaaly breaking out, it introduced 
taxes to get even more money. Was that money put to good use 
for Quebec and Quebecers? Just looking at the way investments 
were made tells us that it is not the case.
<P>
	Why are decisions made the way they are? Simply because 
Quebec no longer carries any political weight. If we have only 
25 per cent of the seats, it means that we are losing 75 per cent of 
the political power. It is easy to understand that the sovereignist 
agenda would finally give back to Quebec 100 per cent of all the 
powers required to ensure its own viability, protect its economy 
and take on its role on the world scene.
<P>
	Today, we have the opportunity to show that even with 25 per 
cent, which is exactly what Quebec has been requesting all 
along, even with 25 per cent, we face opposition from the 
government.
<P>
	I ask all Quebecers: Is it worth staying within a Confederation 
when common sense requires that we get what we are entitled to 
according to historical rights, and that raises objections and 
eyebrows? I am thoroughly convinced that I could have 
explained all of this to empty benches and that the government's 
position would have been the same.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	I hope this will make Quebecers understand that there is no 
alternative to the historical decision we must make. There is 
only one solution, the one that will give us 100 per cent of our 
powers and not limit us to a mere 25 per cent or even less.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am obviously very happy to be part of this debate. 
The reason of the amendment proposed by the Bloc Quebecois is 
that Quebec be guaranteed by Canada a minimum of 25 per cent 
of the total number of members in the future. I think that many 
arguments have been put forward and I think it is very important 
to be aware that we are going through a significant moment of 
our lives.
<P>
	We have asked on several issues in the past for a sign that 
would allow Quebec to try and understand or see if Canada truly 
wants a Quebec that stands up within Canada. It is not in the 
interest of Canada to have a weak Quebec but rather a strong 
Quebec which will be able to keep its representativeness, 
because Quebec is a nation. It is a people, a founding people.
<P>
	In 1982, Canada undertook a societal project that denied 
Quebec its distinctiveness and said that henceforth there was 
only one national identity in this country. This society project 
treats all ten provinces on an equal footing. As a founding 
people, as my colleague just said so eloquently a moment ago, 
francophones were present on the whole territory and even 
further down to the south since they were even to be found in 
Louisiana, and when each of the provinces joined the 
Confederation, francophones formed a majority almost 
everywhere.
<P>
	The population in Quebec also experienced significant 
growth, but if we analyze the immigration policy of Canada we 
will see that Canada has deliberately increased Ontario's 
population by immigration and it has anglicized this country. 
This was a deliberate decision on the part of the government. We 
are asking for a concession from this country that wants to keep 
us all together. Everyone says that Canada is much better off 
with Quebec. If that is true, make some concessions. Give us the 
minimum we are asking for, which is 25 per cent of the 
representativeness. That is all we are asking.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11089"> 11089 </A></B>
<P>
	I wonder why the government would be stubborn about that. 
Earlier, when I was behind the curtains, I heard the hon. 
member from Kingston and the Islands say that he had doubts 
about the legality of the amendment. I think that is not a very 
strong argument because at this point in time, I do not see how 
we could question the decision made by the Speaker to the 
effect that this amendment was admissible. Therefore, if the 
Speaker said that the amendment was in order, I wonder how 
we could challenge that. Other arguments must be found to 
justify a vote against this amendment.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	It seems extremely important to me that we recognize that 
Quebec does bring an essential contribution to Canada. 
Confidentially speaking, between you and I, if English speaking 
Canada is not already an American state, it is because we are 
here. We make the difference. Without French speaking people, 
what makes us different from the Americans? We eat like them, 
we drink like them, we do the same things, we watch the same 
TV. Everything will reach us much more easily. As you know, 
American imperialism is expanding all around the world. It will 
cross our borders much more easily.
<P>
	What makes a Canadian a Canadian is the fact that he can say 
he lives in a bilingual country. Canadians are in a country where 
a large percentage of the population, 25 per cent, is francophone. 
It is a country with a dual culture. It has the underlying wealth of 
two cultures, the English and the French cultures.
<P>
	What other country in the world can claim such a cultural 
wealth? We are really, I believe, vital to Canada. We have said 
that, so long as we are not sovereign, we will defend the interests 
of Quebecers.
<P>
	It must look rather odd for a sovereignist to rise in this House 
and say: ``Hang on to the furniture, give us at least 25 per cent 
representation''. We have not left the country yet. We are still 
here, and our duty, what we see as our basic responsibility, is to 
say to the all of the hon. members in this House that it is their 
duty to give us 25 per cent representation. We were here first; 
you conquered us. We formed a union in 1840. We decided to 
live together. We established a sort of trade agreement. We built 
a railroad that we are in the process of demolishing. At least give 
us 25 per cent representation. It will not cost you anything. On 
the contrary, it will mean a lot for you. You must realize this 
while there is still time.
<P>
	After we go, if ever we leave, because we are basically hoping 
to, it will not have cost you a thing to give us the 25 per cent we 
are asking for as a gesture of openness and understanding toward 
a nation you claim you want to keep with you. It seems to me 
that, if the government really wants to prove conclusively that it 
cares for us, it must maintain our level of representation.

	The House resumed from March 13 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-68, an act respecting firearms and other 
weapons, be read the second time and referred to a committee; 
and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> When the bill was last before the 
House, the member for Souris-Moose Mountain had four 
minutes remaining in his time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak again to Bill C-68 
and the proposed amendment.
<P>
	An item of the bill that I really feel needs to be addressed is 
the issue of non-compliance. Many citizens of Canada would be 
put in a position of being criminals if they did not register their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11090"> 11090 </A></B>
<P>
guns. I hope as we review the bill that we will not allow this to 
fall into the Criminal Code with regard to registration.
<P>
	I have some very serious reservations about the search and 
seizure provision. It needs to be looked at thoroughly. Can it be 
put in another framework in the bill? If the police want to enter 
on to one's property, then a search warrant should be obtained. 
That document would identify the reasons why a search is 
deemed necessary.
<P>
	I have some concerns about heirlooms, those items that may 
be passed on from generation to generation. We have to make 
sure that we clear up in the minds of the people writing the bill 
what constitutes an heirloom. Do citizens have a right to pass 
them down through the family from generation to generation?
<P>
	I really feel very strongly about collectors and museum 
pieces. If expensive museum pieces have been collected and 
retained in families, and they are going to be removed through 
confiscation, then fair compensation should be paid.
<P>
	I have a tremendous problem with the five year and $60 fee 
licensing provision. I would rather see a licensing provision of 
$5 a year and $25 for five years. That way we can at least 
indicate to the public that it is not a tax grab.
<P>
	As I have said before and I reiterate, I am prepared to register 
my firearms. I believe many people are. However, I would much 
prefer to see voluntary registration with a five-year lead-in 
period. At the end of the first year of the registration period we 
should evaluate whether it is doing what we wish it to do, that it 
is efficient, affordable and enforceable for everyone involved.
<P>
	I have some difficulty with the taxpayers of Canada paying 
approximately $85 million, as suggested, to go through the 
business of registering firearms. I am not so sure that at the end 
of the day we will be able to show that the criteria are met.
<P>
	The committee was completely unified in its position that it 
would go with voluntary registration with a five-year lead-in 
period. I would like to think we could go back and look at that 
one again.
<P>
	Everyone in the House supports the minister wholeheartedly 
in those aspects of the bill that deal with the criminal element. 
We support wholeheartedly the four-year mandatory sentence 
for the use of a firearm in the commission of a crime. I would 
rather see a two-year mandatory sentence for the use of a fake 
firearm in the commission of a crime. I could support that.
<P>
	With regard to the bill overall, I feel this is the place to voice 
my concerns. I say today and I will continue to say that as the 
present bill is put forward, I am not prepared to support it.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to speak to the amendment to 
split Bill C-68.
<P>
	By creating an omnibus bill with two distinct and opposing 
objectives, the Minister of Justice has made it almost impossible 
for many members of Parliament to represent the views of their 
constituents.
<P>
	In my riding of Prince George-Peace River, the people have 
made it very clear that they support stronger crime control 
measures directed at law breakers. At the same time they are 
opposed to increased sanctions against law-abiding citizens. 
They view gun registration as an ineffective exercise which will 
not increase public safety but will waste valuable police time, 
scarce tax dollars and impose unnecessary and costly 
restrictions on the people who are already obeying the law.
<P>
	Because this is such an important issue in my riding I have 
sought the views of the constituents through a number of means, 
including small group discussions, local meetings. I have also 
requested input regarding anticipated gun legislation in two 
householders.
<P>
	Last May while the justice minister was still making 
comments such as banning all handguns in the hands of private 
citizens, and suggesting all firearms within city limits should be 
stored at a central armoury, I asked constituents whether they 
felt gun control legislation was sufficient before the 
amendments in Bill C-17 came into effect.
<P>
	I do not know if many people from my riding ever get called 
when the justice department does its gun control surveys but 
only 21 per cent thought we need more gun control.
<P>
	In November I sent another householder to the homes in my 
riding and asked if there should be a universal registration 
system for all guns, including shotguns and hunting rifles. Over 
80 per cent of the 1,000 respondents answered no. I have already 
tabled petitions with over 2,500 signatures which do not support 
the proposed gun legislation. I am assured by people in the 
riding there are many more petitions to come.
<P>
	I have also received hundreds of letters from my riding in 
opposition to gun registration and I might add thousands of 
similar letters from other parts of Canada. The focus of 99 per 
cent of these is crime control, not gun control.
<P>
	The Union of B.C. Municipalities endorsed the following 
petition put forward by my home town, the city of Fort St. John. 
It requested that the federal government ensure that legislation 
with regard to firearms be geared toward the criminal element 
and not the law-abiding, responsible gun owner. The elected 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11091"> 11091 </A></B>
<P>
representatives from our town councils would not have passed 
these resolutions without the knowledge that the majority of 
their constituents supported them.
<P>
	I would like to read a letter from the most popular radio talk 
show in the B.C. Peace. The host, Grant Mitton says: ``I 
conducted a poll on `Contact' this morning and asked the callers 
two questions: one, are you in favour or opposed to the gun 
control regulations introduced by justice minister Allan Rock; 
two, will you comply with registration requirements for your 
firearms when they come into effect? The answer as anticipated 
to both questions was a resounding no''.
<P>
	``During our 40 minutes on air, 65 people said they were 
opposed to the new measures and 51 said they would not comply 
with the registration requirements. One caller said he was in 
favour of the regulations''.
<P>
	``These people are not wild-eyed radicals. They are for the 
most part normal Canadians interested only in pursuing their 
lives in peace and enjoying the use of their firearms as they have 
in the past. Many of those who responded wondered how these 
new regulations will have any effect on the criminal element and 
suggested the focus should be on enforcing a mandatory prison 
sentence on anyone who uses a firearm in the commission of a 
felony''.
<P>
	``The really disturbing part of the survey is the large number 
of respondents that say they will defy the law. Surely Mr. Rock 
must see that his proposals will be very difficult to enforce if 
possible at all''.
<P>
	The people of Prince George-Peace River do not support the 
bill in its current form and therefore it must be divided. Aside 
from the widespread resistance to gun registration, the Minister 
of Justice knows there are a number of other serious flaws in the 
firearms act. He is trying to slip them by the Canadian 
population under the pretext of greater law and order. The bill 
represents a significant attack on the rights enjoyed by the 
Canadian people.
<P>
	We believe we live in a free and democratic society. Yet this 
bill erodes some of those fundamental rights. I am referring for 
example to sections 99 through 101 which provide police and 
other designated officers with the right to inspect any place 
where they have a reason to believe there are firearms, 
ammunition, a switch blade or even just records pertaining to 
them.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	The police can take samples of anything they find whether or 
not it is related to a firearm. If the occupant does not fully 
co-operate with the investigating officers, under section 107 
they are subject to up to two years imprisonment.
<P>
	The minister and other gun control proponents are quick to 
point out that a warrant is needed to search a dwelling house but 
that is not what the legislation says. It says either consent of the 
occupant or a warrant.
<P>
	When confronted with police at their kitchen door, how many 
Canadians know they have the right to refuse entry to the 
officers? Does a teenager home early from school constitute an 
occupant? Even if the occupant refuses the police entry, officers 
just have to demonstrate to a justice that they have a reason to 
believe firearms related records may be present and a warrant is 
issued.
<P>
	These powers of inspection are granted to authorities where 
no crime is suspected. The fact that someone has a registered 
gun can be used as a pretext to inspect a premises and take 
samples of anything found. This bill gives them the power to go 
on fishing expeditions.
<P>
	Under section 117 of part III of the Criminal Code even more 
extensive search and seizure powers are granted to police if they 
suspect a firearms offence such as a non-registration of a gun 
might be committed.
<P>
	The police I know will not be going into homes unless they 
have reason to believe there is a serious offence being 
committed. If they are not going to use them, why are they 
giving the police such extensive powers of inspection and search 
and seizure?
<P>
	If police suspect a crime they should go through the process of 
obtaining a proper search warrant. Despite government claims, I 
am not trying to increase paranoia or inflame anti-police 
sentiment. It is very important that Canadians fully understand 
all the possible ramifications of the various clauses of the bill.
<P>
	Passage of this bill will mean that at least seven million gun 
owners in Canada will have fewer rights under the charter of 
rights and freedoms than other Canadians.
<P>
	Canadians have entrusted the government with the job to 
protect the rights and freedoms that make us the envy of so many 
other people in the world. This bill seriously erodes our 
democratic rights in another area. It represents a growing trend 
to pass meaningless bills through Parliament, giving all the 
power of implementing regulations to cabinet.
<P>
	Under section 110 it takes more than four full pages just to 
describe all the areas in which the governor in council will have 
the authority to create regulations. These range from licensing 
requirements and the establishment and operations of shooting 
clubs to circumstances such as whether an individual needs a 
gun to protect their family-clause 110(c).
<P>
	In section 110(t) the governor in council can make regulations 
respecting the manner in which any provision of this act or 
regulation applies to any of the aboriginal peoples in Canada and 
adapting any such provision for the purposes of that application.
<P>
	When will the government realize that all Canadians should 
be treated equally and we should not be entrenching 
mechanisms and laws for creating different Criminal Code 
penalties or rights based on race?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11092"> 11092 </A></B>
<P>
	Most of section 112 lets the minister bypass the House 
entirely without laying certain regulations before the House for 
review if in his opinion the changes are so immaterial or 
insubstantial or the need is so urgent that section 111 should 
not be applicable.
<P>
	Section 112(6) reads: ``For greater certainty a regulation may 
be made under part III of the Criminal Code without being laid 
before either House of Parliament''. This means that through 
order in council a cabinet can make regulations that put 
Canadian citizens behind bars-no accountability, no review, no 
appeal.
<P>
	Is this how a democratic society functions? How can the 
justice minister justify this extreme abuse of democratic 
authority? Do not deny Canadians the right to have their voices 
heard when it comes to laws that affect them.
<P>
	This bill is fundamentally flawed and the principles of justice 
and democracy on which our nation is founded are under attack. 
I can support many of the changes to part III of the Criminal 
Code with some amendments but I cannot support the erosion of 
our democratic rights under the guise of a harmless gun 
registration bill.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	I urge all members to support the amendment to split Bill 
C-68 into its two very distinct components.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for his statement.
<P>
	Approximately one week ago 82-year old Oscar Noll was 
working in his jewellery store. Oscar Noll is five feet tall and 
weighs about 100 pounds. He goes to work at three o'clock in the 
morning to work on watches. He heard a crash from the window 
and two thugs came into his store. Remember, he is 82 years old, 
weighs about 100 pounds and is very frail. He reached under the 
counter, removed a revolver, fired some shots and scared away 
the perpetrators. Does the hon. member believe that the 
individual has the right to protect his life and his property in that 
manner?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, in my 
opinion Canadians do have a right to protect themselves and 
their families and to use a firearm to help them in protecting 
themselves. That is not the view shared by hon. members across 
the floor. A large percentage of them are opposed to that. 
However, I firmly believe that Canadian citizens do have that 
right.
<P>
	I have spoken about this before. The police, no matter how 
well intentioned, if we look at the statistics, simply cannot 
respond quickly enough, even in cities, to intervene when the 
crime is being committed. Canadians have to take responsibility 
for protecting themselves. Unfortunately the police cannot. 
Usually when the police respond it is after the crime has been 
committed and their job is to apprehend the criminal and bring 
him or her to justice, not to protect the citizens of this country.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
you would think this bill was about guns. To me it is not. It is 
about matters of life and death. It is about what kind of society 
we want to live in and it is about what kind of society we want to 
leave our children. It is about progress as a civilized nation. That 
is what it is about.
<P>
	I have seen in the campaign against this legislation the kind of 
lobbying I usually associate with the United States, the kind of 
lobbying done by the National Rifle Association, based on 
misinformation, half truths and out and out lies.
<P>
	I keep hearing about law-abiding gun owners and yet I keep 
hearing about law-abiding gun owners who intend to defy the 
law. There is something contradictory in that. I keep asking gun 
owners who come to see me to talk about this legislation what 
will diminish their pleasure in partridge shooting because their 
gun is registered. I have not heard a good answer to that. I do not 
think there is one.
<P>
	Reform members keep telling us they want to support 
grassroots democracy, that they want people to have more say 
about how their elected representatives vote in the House.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	They know perfectly well that 90 per cent of their constituents 
support this legislation and support the very aspect of it they 
make the most noise against, the registration of guns.
<P>
	The NDP has sat in the House for the time I have been here, 
since 1988. It has had a party policy in support of stronger gun 
control. I sat in the House, as did the member for Halifax and 
numerous members who are here, listening to the NDP, 
including its leader who now intends to vote against gun control 
legislation. We listened to those members accuse the previous 
government of legislation that was not tough enough, not strong 
enough. Now they have tougher and stronger legislation and 
they intend to vote against it.
<P>
	I have to talk about the kind of feedback I have had from 
meetings of those who are against this legislation and against 
gun control. I have heard out and out misrepresentation of this 
legislation. I have heard over and over again: ``This legislation 
means a police officer can come into my house at any time 
without a warrant, inspect my home and seize my guns''. No it 
does not. Let us get the facts out if we are going to debate a bill. 
The bill gives the police no right to come into anybody's home 
and take anything without a warrant unless they believe there is 
an illegal gun in there.
<P>
	Let me talk about the contradictory messages I am getting. 
The Ontario Association of Anglers and Hunters is opposed to 
registration. Its members wrote a very impassioned plea to our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11093"> 11093 </A></B>
<P>
local newspaper asking for the support of another organization 
in their campaign for the universal registration of hunting dogs 
for the protection of the dogs. Is that not a contradictory 
message?
<P>
	Let me remind people out there why we are doing this, why 
guns make our society violent, less compassionate, less safe. 
The vast majority of gun related deaths and injuries are not the 
result of shootings at the corner store, the drug deal gone bad, or 
the bar. The vast majority of deaths and injuries by guns are in 
the home. It is a greater problem than the criminal misuse of 
guns in the streets.
<P>
	The largest proportion of homicides occurs in the home. Of 
the 1,400 deaths per year caused by guns, fully 1,100 are 
suicides; over 200 are homicides and the remainder are 
accidents. The greatest threat of homicide is not at the hands of 
strangers on the street, in the corner store or even in the break-in 
at home. The majority of gun homicides-86 per cent-is 
caused by family members, friends or acquaintances.
<P>
	Guns are a particularly serious threat to women. If I take this 
bill seriously there is very good reason. Some members have 
already said that a woman is killed every six days. She is killed 
in her home 67 per cent of the time. From 1981 to 1990 almost 
one-half of women killed were killed by spouses or ex-spouses. 
A further 27 per cent were killed by acquaintances. Almost 
one-half of women killed by their partners are shot with a gun. 
Yet the members from the Reform Party can sit there when we 
talk about a serious issue like the deaths of well over 1,000 
people a year and say: ``Pow, pow'' as if it is a little game.
<P>
	Seventy-eight per cent of the guns used in these killings of 
women are legally owned. Police are likely to have intervened in 
domestic violence before it comes to the point of homicide. 
However, right now without a registration system they have no 
way of knowing before they go into a violent situation in the 
home whether there is a gun there. That is one reason police 
associations and the Association of Chiefs of Police support this 
legislation.
<P>
	Domestic and other intimate assaults are 12 times more likely 
to result in death if a gun is used. Yet members on the opposite 
side of the House think this is not a serious problem for our 
country.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	We also know that young people contemplating suicide 
sometimes act impulsively. If firearms are not readily available, 
lives can be saved.
<P>
	I want to talk about a 15-year old teenager who attended a 
meeting with the justice minister. He said that he had gone home 
from school one Friday afternoon determined to kill himself. 
Not too long after a friend of his who was worried about him 
decided to check on him. By doing this, his friend prevented him 
from killing himself.
<P>
	The young man told the justice minister and other members at 
the meeting that if there had been a gun in the house, he would 
have been dead before his friend had arrived. As it is, he is a 
15-year old who is still in high school, doing well and has a 
great future ahead of him.
<P>
	This legislation, if it prevents one death like that of this 
15-year old boy, will be worth it. We cannot forget our children. 
Since 1970, 470 children have died in accidents with firearms in 
their own homes. These are largely guns owned by their own 
families.
<P>
	I am also particularly supportive of the measure to include 
handguns in the prohibited weapons category. Let me give a 
ridiculous example.
<P>
	Recently, the city of Chicago banned the sale of spray paint 
because the cost of cleaning the graffiti on buildings is 
exorbitant. For us as a society, the cost of death by firearms is 
exorbitant. A similar ban on handguns will help prevent some of 
those deaths.
<P>
	This bill is about what kind of a society we want. Frankly, I 
want to move forward into a future where violence, power and 
physical control are not the things that determine how we govern 
ourselves and how we live. This bill is a progressive step 
forward to that better future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if ever evidence was needed that this debate is very 
highly polarized and charged probably with misinformation on 
all sides, it is in this debate today.
<P>
	When I became embroiled in the whole gun control issue it 
was evident to me that the position a person would take on the 
debate depended at which end of the barrel that person was 
going to find themselves. We can see this in the House today not 
just on this side but on the government side and perhaps on the 
Bloc side, if they would speak on this.
<P>
	Very clearly this is a debate on the bill which is charged 
emotionally and divides the country, as if we needed one more 
reason to be divided. This divides us on rural-urban issues 
rather than language issues, cultural issues or some other issue. 
Anyone who would suggest this is not a rural-urban issue has 
not been following it because very clearly it is.
<P>
	Our country, as everyone knows, is thousands of miles across. 
All areas of the country are different. One rule of law on guns 
may not make sense in downtown Toronto but perhaps it makes 
sense somewhere else, either the maritimes or the prairies.
<P>
	There is wisdom in splitting this bill and I urge the Minister of 
Justice to carefully consider this. It would be an opportunity for 
people from both sides of the House and from all over the 
country to come together on that part of the bill about which 
everyone agrees, namely those issues aimed directly at crime 
control, such as mandatory sentencing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11094"> 11094 </A></B>
<P>
	There are other aspects of this bill which concern most 
Canadians from that part of the country which is less 
enamoured with the whole notion of gun control. For example, 
there is the registration of handguns, which is already a fait 
accompli. We are supposed to be registering them now.
<P>
	If anyone were to purchase a rifle or a shotgun today, it would 
be registered. There is nothing wrong with the notion of 
centralizing the registry of these weapons. Your name and 
address would be taken. There is no problem with that. It is the 
notion of a universal registration.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Before I get into the heart of what I want to talk about, I want 
to say that I am going to be voting against this bill despite the 
results of a survey I commissioned and which I believe to be 
accurate. Residents in my constituency, a majority of 69 per 
cent, would prefer to see universal registration. However, I am 
prepared to go against that in the full knowledge that this is 
causing me some grief.
<P>
	Before I get into that, I would like to spend a couple of 
minutes to pay a particular vote of respect to two people for 
whom members may not expect to hear many kind words from 
this side of the House. They are Wendy Cukier and Heidi 
Rathjen from the Coalition for Gun Control.
<P>
	When Heidi's friends and associates she went to school with 
were killed at the École polytechnique in Montreal, it caused her 
to do something. She wanted to rid our country of the kinds of 
weapons that caused that outrage and terrible massacre. We do 
not need automatic weapons in our country; we just do not need 
them. Many years ago she set upon this long journey to rid our 
country of these weapons. She enlisted the aid of Wendy Cukier 
and between them they formed the Coalition for Gun Control.
<P>
	I would bet that they did not think they would ever have the 
sun, the moon and the stars all line up to find themselves with 
the Liberals in government wanting to address the issues of the 
people in the vote rich areas of downtown Toronto or Montreal. 
This decision was made in order to get elected. In my opinion it 
was not based on what was right for the country. It was a 
decision on what they could do to get elected. They appealed to 
people who, for good reason, were afraid of guns. The idea then 
became a red book commitment.
<P>
	In some way that is unfair to the intent of Wendy and Heidi. 
They wanted to rid our country of the dangers posed by weapons 
and from the crimes involving the use of weapons. They wanted 
to focus attention on this. I do not think in their wildest dreams 
they ever expected everyone, no matter where they lived in the 
country, was going to be forced to register shotguns and rifles. 
In any event, this is the point we are at now.
<P>
	By justice department estimates, it is going to cost $85 
million to set up the national registry over a five-year period, 
plus a further $60 million if you accept the fact that there are six 
million long guns presently in the  country. If that is the case, 
over five years it is going to cost $145 million to register guns. 
That is a modest estimate. Others say it will cost upward of $500 
million or even more, but let us go with the low end at $145 
million.
<P>
	Our country is going into the hole at the rate of $110 million a 
day. We would be using money to register all of these weapons 
for which there is not one iota of evidence it will prevent one 
single, solitary illegal use or crime committed with a gun. The 
last time I checked, criminals do not get a permit nor do they 
register their guns. We will be spending $145 million so that 
some people, particularly those who wrote the Liberal red book 
can feel warm and fuzzy when they go to bed at night. That is not 
an honest or prudent way to run the country.
<P>
	If there were a shred of evidence to prove that registering long 
guns would in any way prevent crime, then I would be most 
happy to support this bill. However there is no such evidence. 
We will then go to the money markets of the world and our 
children and grandchildren will be borrowing money and paying 
interest on that money and they will have a standard of living 
depreciated by the fact that we will be raising this money to 
spend on registering long guns. Imagine if we used that same 
money, the same $140 million over five years, for breast cancer 
research. Would that be a more efficient use of the $145 million?
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	It is not easy to stand here because I am not a hunter. I do not 
have a gun. I have not had a gun for years. I originally 
commissioned a poll in my constituency to buttress my 
argument within our own caucus. In so far as this is not a moral 
or ethical issue I am not bound by the poll. It was for guidance. I 
wanted it to buttress my argument. I wanted to have that 
argument buttressed within my own caucus so that when I voted 
against our caucus position I could say clearly this is why, I am 
representing my constituents.
<P>
	In evaluating what I was doing here in Parliament over the last 
year and a half I came very clearly during the Christmas break to 
understand that I was here for three specific reasons: to restore 
fiscal responsibility to our nation; to put the rights of victims 
ahead of the rights of criminals; to restore the bonds of trust 
between the elected and the electors.
<P>
	I cannot in conscience spend $140 million to accomplish 
something clearly not accomplishable through the expenditure 
of this money, and on one hand spend the money and on the other 
hand try to save it.
<P>
	My constituents have very clearly sent me here to bring fiscal 
sanity to the spending affairs of our country. That is why I will 
regrettably vote against Bill C-68.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11095"> 11095 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, almost 
everything has been said about this very troublesome piece of 
legislation.
<P>
	I listened with concern and share the concerns of the hon. 
member for Souris-Moose Mountain. I listened to the concerns 
and share the concerns of the hon. deputy whip. I listened to the 
statistical projections of the hon. member from the Reform 
Party. I do not know whether there are many more details to add 
to the debate. I will add a few and then make a few points.
<P>
	I do not know that every concern regarding registry has been 
addressed. There is still the concern about weapons that have no 
serial number, weapons that are home-made. There are still 
some people whose hobby it is to manufacture firearms and 
ammunition. I have not seen anything in the bill which covers 
that.
<P>
	It was pointed out to me the other day by one of my 
constituents that serial numbers can overlap, that there can be 
the same serial number on more than one weapon if there are two 
licensed manufacturers of the same model of firearm. I put those 
forward as a concern.
<P>
	Other concerns about the issue of confiscation and so on, 
about the provision for firearms that have special significance 
for families to be preserved, will be addressed in the justice 
committee. Handguns in prohibited classes will be addressed in 
the justice committee. Firearms used in re-enactments and 
heritage events will be definitely addressed in the heritage 
committee.
<P>
	I have asked for time to address that committee in order to 
highlight some of those concerns.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	I also realize that registry is an issue that is larger than 
individual weapons, unless I misread the bill. The registry goes 
beyond individual ownership and gives the government the right 
to have other weapons in transition registered so that the law 
enforcement people will be able to calculate the shrink that 
comes from a shipment of weapons into the country.
<P>
	I will restate what many other members have pointed out. The 
bill has three legs. One leg has to do with the smuggling of guns 
and the attack on smugglers. I think everyone agrees with that. 
Regardless of whether we are Reform members, rural members 
or urban members we all very much agree. We all appreciate 
some of the stepped up activity of the police, especially around 
the area where I live. Recently they have been able to seize large 
quantities of weapons.
<P>
	The second leg is the question of sentencing, the imposition of 
a four-year mandatory sentence. With the imposition and with 
the moves the Minister of Justice will make on the issue, I 
sincerely hope the offence will not be plea bargained away in the 
future as has been done in the past. I find the plea bargain aspect 
offensive in itself.
<P>
	The third leg concerns registry and the other aspects of 
firearms ownership. I have concerns. It has been painful to go 
through the exercise, but I point out to those who are opposed to 
registry that every law made in the country is in one way or 
another an infringement of rights.
<P>
	Laws are not made for the vast majority of law-abiding 
citizens but are made for the few. There is no dichotomy here 
with the laws regarding guns. These laws are brought into being 
for the few who have no regard for human life, who lose regard 
for human life, or who want to use a firearm to commit a crime 
and have no conscience about doing so.
<P>
	I plead with those who are opposed to consider that laws 
concerning robbery, laws concerning theft and laws concerning 
speeding are not made for the many. They are written to protect 
the many from the few. I must go on record as saying that there is 
no right to bear arms in Canada. Ownership of firearms in the 
country is a privilege and not a right. We should always 
remember that.
<P>
	With the struggle I have personally had as a member with the 
bill and my struggle with the conviction that a registry will be 
effective, I do not want to throw out the baby with the bath water.
<P>
	I want to see the legislation go to committee to be amended 
without affecting the principle of the bill necessarily but 
injecting some common sense and projections into the bill so 
that legitimate firearms owners will feel comfortable and that 
the sacrifices they are making will be made in the spirit of 
protection of the many.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this has 
certainly become a very partisan and polarized debate on gun 
control.
<P>
	I hope the Minister of Justice will listen to the argument being 
put forth by the Reform Party in favour of splitting the bill into 
two parts. Presumably the focus is on the reduction of crime and 
the enhancement of the safety of Canadians.
<P>
	With the way the Minister of Justice is proposing the bill we 
would think every gun owner in the country is a criminal. That is 
far from the truth and an insult to Canadians who own guns.
<P>
	There are approximately 2.7 million Criminal Code 
infractions in the country per annum. The number of gun related 
incidents under the Criminal Code would be about one-half of 
one per cent or even less. Yet the Minister of Justice proposes to 
spend a couple of hundred million dollars or more to try to 
reduce the one-half of one per cent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11096"> 11096 </A></B>
<P>
	This will not be money spent finding criminals. This will not 
be money spent prosecuting criminals. This will not be money 
spent keeping criminals in prison. It is a couple of hundred 
million dollars to address the fact that one-half of one per cent 
of crime is committed with firearms.
<P>
	The minister quoted statistics. He said that the majority of 
Canadians were in favour of gun control. Let us remember that a 
large segment of Canadians do not own guns. I happen to be one.
<P>
	When we ask Canadians if they are in favour of registration 
and they do not own guns, chances are good that they would say 
it does not bother them a bit so why would they be opposed?
<P>
	Last fall the Minister of Finance held his prebudget hearings 
across the country and listened to Canadians talk about the 
budget. They all said the deficit had to be addressed. They said: 
``We have to increase taxes but don't increase mine''. Or, they 
said: ``We have to cut expenditures but don't cut me''. It is the 
same rationale when we ask people if they are in favour of gun 
control. If they do not own a gun they will be in favour of gun 
control because it means absolutely nothing to them.
<P>
	Section 85, as it currently exists, is one of the few sections of 
the Criminal Code that calls for a mandatory sentence. Quite 
often it has been plea bargained away. We in the Reform Party 
have always said that if the present law is not working perhaps 
we could change it. They should demonstrate to us that the 
minister's proposals will be an improvement.
<P>
	Last fall I wrote to the Minister of Justice and I asked him how 
often section 85 was plea bargained away. Section 85 calls for a 
minimum mandatory jail sentence, no fines, for using a firearm 
in the commission of an offence. How often do we plea bargain 
that away? The minister said that he did not know. He said that 
he did not have the statistics to know how often we plea 
bargained it away.
<P>
	Therefore we do not know if what is on the books today would 
work if used properly. The Minister of Justice admitted that he 
did not know. Why is he putting forth gun registration and why 
does he think it would work?
<P>
	We also asked the Minister of Justice: ``Since you tell us that 
this will reduce crime, by what measurement would we know 
that your proposals are a success?'' He could not answer. He did 
not have any measurement by which he could tell us how many 
lives would be saved or how many crimes would not be 
committed because of registration. The minister has no facts to 
back up his arguments.
<P>
	Four points should be looked at when one proposes 
legislation. Is it relevant? Is it effective? Is it an efficient way of 
addressing the situation? Is there a better way? Let us take a look 
at them.
<P>
	Is it relevant? Yes, we have crime in the country. Every 
country has crime. Yes, we should be tough on crime.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Justice is proposing that we be tough on 
people who destroy their guns and do not send in a piece of paper 
to the authorities. They will get five years in jail for not sending 
in a piece of paper.
<P>
	What about somebody who does not have a proper licence? 
They will get 10 years in jail. That is what the minister is 
proposing. Yet Denis Lortie walked out as a free man after 10 
years in jail. He murdered three people in the Quebec legislature 
and injured thirteen more. After 10 years he was a free man, and 
for not having a piece of paper the Minister of Justice is 
proposing the same punishment.
<P>
	Is it relevant? Laws that will stop criminals from committing 
acts and punishing them severely for their wrongdoings will be 
supported by the Reform Party. That is relevant. Does the 
minister feel that registering all guns at a cost of $200 million or 
more will reduce crime? I am quite sure he know it will not. 
Therefore it is not relevant and the section he is proposing to 
force upon thousands of Canadians is totally absurd.
<P>
	Will the bill be effective in meeting its objectives? There is no 
evidence whatsoever the universal registration the minister is 
proposing will reduce crime. He even said so himself. He could 
not answer the question when we asked it. Since then he has not 
put forward anything to suggest he has any concrete measures by 
which it would be a success.
<P>
	The minister should look at the Reform proposal to split the 
bill into its two segments. We find registration irrelevant. 
However addressing the criminal use of guns and firearms is 
relevant and we would support it.
<P>
	I have already talked about the crime of failing to produce a 
certificate, five years in prison and so on. Let us compare using a 
gun to a drunk person driving a car. The minister of justice spoke 
eloquently about drunkenness today in the bill he introduced in 
that regard. More people are killed on the road by drunk drivers 
committing illegal acts than by Canadians using firearms 
illegally. We do not have anything nearly as draconian as he is 
proposing.
<P>
	If a person fails to renew a car registration form I understand 
in the province of Ontario the fine is $5.50 a month. If a person, 
however, fails to register a gun it is 10 years in jail. That seems a 
rather strange dichotomy: 10 years in jail for not registering a 
gun and $5 a month for not registering a car. Under illegal 
circumstances they are both every bit as lethal. That is the point.
<P>
	What about people who drive without a licence? In the 
province of Ontario the fine is $265 and in the case of a gun it is 
10 years in jail.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11097"> 11097 </A></B>
<P>
	Will the legislation be efficient in addressing the problem? 
We have said as Reformers that if it is split into the criminal 
aspect it will be efficient. If it is split into the other segment, 
registration for all Canadians is totally and absolutely 
inefficient. My colleague from Edmonton Southwest said: ``My 
goodness, we have to borrow $200 million more and pass the 
bill on to our grandchildren, just so the Liberals can say they 
are trying to do something about crime when in fact they are 
doing nothing''.
<P>
	In closing, we are saying to the Minister of Justice that 99 per 
cent of gun owners handle their firearms safely. They store them 
securely. They use them responsibly. Therefore they should be 
left alone. The other 1 per cent who are criminals and commit 
criminal acts are the ones he should be focusing on. That is what 
Canadians want and deserve. They do not want a Minister of 
Justice simply playing politics and not doing his homework to 
produce the statistics to support his argument.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FISHERIES">FISHERIES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
Dartmouth last September NAFO established a total allowable 
catch of 27,000 tonnes of turbot for 1995. In announcing the 
NAFO agreement, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans assured 
Parliament that ``Canada will have for the first time the right to 
board and inspect the vessels catching turbot and to ensure that 
the proper rules are being followed to conserve this important 
stock,'' something he has failed to do.
<P>
	On February 1 NAFO met to allocate the 27,000 tonne catch. 
The practice for such decisions is to seek consensus because 
members have the right to object to decisions and withdraw. 
Against the advice of members who would later support Canada, 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans forced a vote on a Canadian 
proposal for quota allocation. The resulting agreement gave 
Canada 60 per cent of the catch, up from about 10 per cent. The 
European Union got 12.5 per cent, down from about 75 per cent 
of the catch for the previous three years.
<P>
	The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has made every effort to 
make his dispute over the allocation with the EU into an exercise 
in eco-aggression. As the <I>Financial Times of London</I> noted:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The fact that Canada had tried to garner such a large proportion of the 
quota-some 70 per cent against 12 per cent for the Europeans-somewhat 
tarnishes the country's claim that it had to intervene to save the fish from 
impending extinction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Tony Pitcher, director of the Fisheries Centre at UBC said: 
``Canada's newly acquired 60 per cent share of turbot was a 
radical shift in allocation that came too quickly for some fishing 
nations to accept willingly''.
<P>
	In our desperate need to find a hero out of all this bumbling 
and blustering, we ignored the fact that the <I>Estai</I> had been 
boarded for inspection by Canadians 11 times since January 
1994. On each of those occasions Canadian officials could have 
and should have inspected the holds and found evidence of baby 
fish being caught. They could have and should have waited until 
the net was hauled in and discovered the liner.
<P>
	The only advantage to the bumbling and bluster has gone to 
the Spanish who can now fish without fear of inspection. With 
the arrest of the <I>Estai</I>, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans lost 
the ability to board and inspect foreign trawlers fishing in the 
NAFO regulatory area beyond our 200-mile limit.
<P>
	The size of the fish on the <I>Estai</I> should not have been a 
surprise. They were consistent with the catch reported by 
Spanish and Portuguese trawlers in 1993 and reported in NAFO 
scientific papers in 1994. Those papers report a shockingly 
steady decline in biomass from about 225,000 tons in 1984 to 
37,000 tons in 1992 and that few fish larger than 46 centimetres 
were sampled in the 1993 catches. Considering that sexually 
mature turbot will be at least 60 centimetres long, it is 
questionable whether we should have agreed to fish turbot at all 
this year, let alone try to out-manoeuvre the EU for a larger 
allocation.
<P>
	On the Flemish Cap we now have the worst of both worlds, 
neither NAFO inspection by Canada nor enforcement of the new 
regulations. On March 3, 1995 when the regulations were 
enacted we were told they were essential to deter overfishing by 
Spanish and Portuguese fishing vessels on both the nose and tail 
of the Grand Banks and the Flemish Cap.
<P>
	The 1994 NAFO Scientific Council report cautioned that 
since the turbot is a single stock, it is necessary to regulate both 
the nose and tail and the Flemish Cap. To fail to do so, in the 
words of the report, could lead to the collapse of the fishery.
<P>
	The March 3 regulation prohibited Spanish fishing on both the 
nose and tail and on the Flemish Cap. Since the regulation 
became law, the government has backed off, leaving the Flemish 
Cap exposed to unregulated fishing.
<P>
	The test of the government's action is whether it advances the 
protection of turbot stocks in the NAFO regulatory area on both 
the nose and tail of the Grand Banks and the Flemish Cap. The 
question is, why did Canadian officials fail to carry out adequate 
inspections of the <I>Estai</I> and other Spanish fishing vessels?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank the member for Delta for his question.
<P>
	The member opposite has raised two related issues, namely 
undertaking more inspections as well as the results of an 
inspection by Canadian fisheries officers of the Spanish vessel, 
<I>Estai</I> in January. Let me deal with each in turn.
<P>
	First, the question of conducting more inspections. As the 
minister told the House last Friday, given the increasing tension 
between Canadian fisheries officers and the Spanish fleet, 
unarmed fisheries officers would not be asked to conduct any 
activities which would pose a threat to their safety. I believe that 
the member would endorse the minister's position.
<P>
	Let me also provide some background on the NAFO 
inspection system. As the member should know, NAFO provides 
inspectors from contracting parties with the authority to board 
and inspect vessels in the NAFO regulatory area. However DFO 
inspections take place in less than ideal conditions. NAFO 
procedures require that the inspections be conducted in a 
manner that prevents interference and inconvenience to the 
vessel's operation.
<P>
	In the limited time provided for inspections, it is neither 
practical nor feasible to search for duplicate logs at sea. 
Searches of the hold are restricted by time, the volume of fish 
product in the hold and the inability to move product, given the 
vessel is in motion and the restricted space available in the 
freezers. It is only too easy to hide illegal catch in areas which 
would be accessible only after a comprehensive search, 
accompanied by removal of the product from the hold.
<P>
	In addition, fishing vessels know that the patrol vessels are 
operating in the area and can avoid the use of illegal gear during 
times when inspection may be likely. For example, liners in the 
nets may be removed during the day when weather permits 
boarding. Inspectors cannot verify vessel logs against the 
contents of the hold given the volume of product on board. 
While inspectors may suspect misreporting, they are often 
unable to find the proof required to issue a citation.
<P>
	Despite these limitations Canadians carried out NAFO 
inspections and issued 52 citations in 1994, 44 of them to 
European-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The parliamentary secretary only gets 
two minutes under our rules at this moment.
<P>
	Pursuant to our standing orders, the motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, the 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.38 p.m.)
