	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Restigouche-Chaleur, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the students of my riding of Restigouche-Chaleur 
have benefited from a unique partnership of the government and 
three of North America's multinational software firms.
<P>
	Organized by Industry Canada the computers for schools 
program is allocating hundreds of pieces of used government 
computer equipment to schools all over Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	My riding of Restigouche-Chaleur has already received 20 
new computers. This is recycling in the 1990s. In addition, the 
major computer companies allow old computer programs to be 
transferred in order to benefit students. This is understanding in 
the 1990s.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A partnership between the public and private sectors is 
benefiting New Brunswick students and helping nurture a 
culture of learning and innovation. I would like to congratulate 
all those involved.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, 109 years ago today, Louis David Riel, the Métis 
hero, was hanged, an event that caused turmoil and indignation 
among French Canadians. A crowd of fifty thousand gathered on 
the Champ-de-Mars, in Montreal, to hear Honoré Mercier 
speak his now famous words of tribute.

	The prime minister of the day, John A. Macdonald, was 
careful not to have Riel tried in his native province, where he 
had led the struggle to have the fundamental rights of Canadian 
Métis respected.
<P>
	In order to redress this historic injustice, the Bloc Quebecois 
is today tabling a bill to revoke the conviction of Louis Riel.
<P>
	Louis Riel was hanged because he was a Métis, because he 
was a francophone, because he went to the defence of his nation. 
His execution by hanging is one of the darkest moments in our 
history. A refusal to acknowledge it is a refusal to understand the 
present and a refusal to build a future.

	The report is very eloquent in this regard. When dealing with 
Canada's trade relations with the Asia-Pacific region, it talks 
about challenges, but on the subject of trade with the United

reflect the Liberals' mental block towards our southern

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there is a big demonstration today of students who 
are rightly concerned about the impact of social program reform 
on the funding of post-secondary education. By cutting 
transfers to the provinces, the federal government will force a 
substantial rise in tuition fees and seriously restrict access to 
university education.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. Since the students' concerns are well founded and 
given the extent of the criticism of his reform, does the minister 
promise today to reconsider his government's intention for 
financing post-secondary education?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows, 
in the green book we present several options. One is to continue 
with the existing status quo, a formula that was put in place by a 
government of which he was a member which reduced transfer 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7851"> 7851 </A></B>
<P>
payments to Quebec alone of a quarter of a billion dollars. He 
was a member of that government. I know the hon. member is 
well versed in this matter, and that is one of the options.
<P>
	Another option we are presenting is a way of finding a 
formula that would add an additional $10 billion to the funding 
of higher education, $10 billion that would go for funding 
laboratories and libraries and increased accessibility.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this is a government which definitely intends to cut 
transfers to the provinces for post-secondary education and 
thinks that it can hide behind a government which I was proud to 
quit.
<P>
	Do the minister, the government and the governing party 
realize that by cutting federal contributions to the provinces, the 
reform of social programs will add to students' indebtedness 
and transfer part of the federal debt problem onto them?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition had so much pride that he did not dare open his 
mouth or leave a government at the time when the Conservative 
government cut transfer payments to Quebec by a quarter of a 
billion dollars. That is how much pride he has. Why did he not 
speak up then if he is so strong now?
<P>
	I will simply point out one fundamental fact. There is nothing 
in our proposal that says we will cut the transfer payments to 
provinces. The provinces today receive over $6 billion in 
transfer payments. Ten years from now they will receive $6 
billion in transfer payments. All this talk about a reduction of 
$2.6 billion is pure rubbish.
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I had so many reasons to leave that government I 
did not have time to express them all when I left.
<P>
	How can the minister claim that the acquisition of knowledge 
is a primary goal of this government and the main method to 
encourage economic development when at the same time his 
reform will block access to university for thousands of 
Canadians and Quebecers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the first time I have ever 
been in a agreement with the hon. chief of the opposition is when 
he said there were so many reasons to leave the past government. 
The only question I have in return is why did he leave it so late?
<P>
	I said in my answer to the previous question that we clearly 
have stated we will continue the transfer payments based on the 
formula in place now.
<P>
	What we want to do, and this is why we are simply putting a 
proposal out for serious discussion and debate, is to find a 
formula that will add an additional $10 billion over the next 10 
years, an additional $10 billion that can be used to provide 
further access for students who cannot get there now.
<P>
	There are a quarter million Canadians in today's workforce 
who want to go back to college and university. We have to find a 
way of funding them. We have to find a way of improving the 
spaces, the facilities and the services.
<P>
	That is the reason we have to find more money for the system 
and we want to do it on the basis of finding a fair allocation 
between government, the private sector and the students.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
also for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The minister persists in denying the negative impact of his 
reform on Canadian students' indebtedness and on accessibility 
to post-secondary education. By cutting transfer payments to 
provinces for post-secondary education, his reform will have 
the effect of at least doubling tuition fees in the very first year, 
according to the Association of Universities and Colleges of 
Canada.
<P>
	How can the minister continue to claim that access to 
post-secondary education will not be reduced, considering the 
unprecedented increase in tuition fees triggered by his reform?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have never made those 
claims. What I have said in fact is that under the system we have 
now tuition fees have been rising at a rate of 10 per cent a year.
<P>
	I want to point out, particularly to the member of the Bloc 
Quebecois, that is not our decision. That is a decision taken by 
provincial governments. They make decisions on education, not 
the federal government. It is the federal government that 
transfers the money. Unfortunately a lot of the money we 
transfer never ends up in the hands of the universities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
says he has never made such claims, but this is what he wrote in 
his green book.
<P>
	How can the minister remain so insensitive to the current 
problem of students getting into debt? Indeed, by triggering a 
twofold increase in tuition fees, his reform will result in heavier 
debt loads, to the point where many will no longer dare to pursue 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7852"> 7852 </A></B>
<P>
the goal of a post-secondary  education, for fear of incurring an 
uncontrollable personal debt.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member claims 
that we have been insensitive to students' concerns.
<P>
	I would remind him that in this year alone we have allocated 
over $700 million for student employment strategy which is 
providing spaces for thousands upon thousands of students to 
get work experience. We are signing agreements with business 
to bring new private sector investment into our colleges and 
universities. We have increased by 20 per cent the amount of 
money going for student summer employment. We have 
provided for a youth service corps which will provide 
employment post-secondary education.
<P>
	We have substantially increased today's student loan 
program. We have doubled the loan limit. Today I announced a 
series of amendments to that program that would enable and 
allow students to get access to those funds on much easier terms.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	We listen to students, respond to them and we want to have 
debate and dialogue. We do not urge them, as the hon. member 
has done, to go with barricades and protest when what we really 
need is a serious debate about something that concerns us all.

Speaker, yesterday the minister of immigration spoke in 
glowing terms about the quality of his recent appointments to 
the immigration and refugee board.
<P>
	However, some of these appointments have been high priced 
advocates of the employees of the immigration industry, people 
with a vested interest in high immigration and refugee levels and 
complicated administrative procedures. Coupled with a 
patronage based appointment system, this creates the potential 
for continued and systemic conflict of interest.
<P>

guidelines with respect to its own board members but it also has 
the Immigration Act concerning which the chair of the board has

<P>

<P>
	I would like to follow this up. We are not concerned just about 
conflict of interest but also whether these guidelines cover 
influence peddling.

	I have a 1992 memo written for Mr. Schelew and other 
members of the refugee lawyer's association by Greg James in 
which sitting IRB members are tracked and rated on the basis of 
the percentage of refugee claims they have accepted. This is the 
type of raw material required for influence peddling and both 
Mr. James and Mr. Schelew are now on the board.
<P>
	What guidelines, if any, are in place to protect the IRB process 
from influence peddling by immigration insiders?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and

takes care of influence peddling and if you have any 
information, you should put it to the right authorities.

address your questions and answers to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister likes dealing in facts. Here are some facts 
and a question.
<P>
	The first fact is the minister appointed an illegal immigrant to 
the IRB. The second fact is the RCMP is investigating influence 
peddling in immigration. The third fact is the IRB has dissolved 
into two warring factions based on whether they were Tory 
patronage appointments or Liberal patronage appointments.
<P>
	Will the minister face the fact that the IRB is in an absolute 
mess and order a judicial inquiry into its conduct?
<P>

Minister of Human Resources Development insists on 
trivializing the negative impact his social reform will have on 
all students in Canada.
<P>
	He is cutting transfers to the provinces for post-secondary 
education, while suggesting an option that is likely to increase 
debt levels among Canadian students.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that what he is offering Canadian 
students in his reform package is the prospect of leaving 
university with an average debt of $50,000 and having to make 
monthly payments of $600 for ten years, to pay back a debt that 
thanks to the minister will have increased 100 per cent?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

me of trivializing. I would say, to counter what the hon. member 
has said, that he has certainly been guilty of seriously 
misinforming people about what the facts are, more than once. 
In fact I would say his entire question was based on a totally 
false premise.
<P>
	First, we are not cutting the transfers to the provinces. They 
are being held at the 1993-94 level of about $6.1 billion. That 
continues. That is not a cut. Because the hon. member is one of 
the great exponents in the House of provincial rights, he should 
know that increasingly the transfer is through tax revenues to the 
provinces. They make decisions about tuition. They decide what 
the increases will be. They decide what the curriculum will be. 
They decide what the universities will do.
<P>
	If the hon. member has any criticism about what is happening 
in universities, it would seem to me he should turn around and 
talk to his counterparts in the provinces and ask them why they 
do not spend the federal transfer money, which accounts for 50 
per cent of all funding for universities, effectively on behalf of 
higher education.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister knows perfectly well that the presidents of universities 
and community colleges in Canada intend to double tuition fees 
very shortly, as a result of the minister's reform package. He 
cannot deny that.
<P>
	No government in the past has hit students as hard as the 
Liberal government intends to do now. There is still time for the 
government to reverse its decision.
<P>
	Will the minister make a commitment to the thousands of 
students standing in front of Parliament that he will withdraw 
these proposals that would doom students to poverty?

Let us reform the situation. Let us examine the facts. Let us get

except the hon. member in the Bloc Quebecois knows that 
change or reform is required.

administrators to become part of the process of discussion, the

hon. member.

	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last month in the House the Minister for Human Resources 
Development said he supports a system of broader, wider grants 
for students to use as a way of replacing federal transfers to 
provinces for post-secondary education.
<P>
	Will the government adopt yet another Reform Party 
proposal, namely the advanced education voucher system which 
would transfer greater control from bureaucrats to individual 
students?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is a 
participant in the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development. That committee is now holding hearings across 
the country and receiving a wide variety of ideas.
<P>
	If the member has a particular proposal on behalf of her party, 
certainly I would welcome looking at it as part of the report of 
the committee. We have an open, democratic, parliamentary 
process able to enlist all the good ideas and even get some of the 
bad ones as well.

	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Reform has advocated an advanced education voucher system to 
shift federal transfers for post-secondary education into the 
hands of those most concerned about educational requirements, 
the students themselves. This would make educational 
institutions more responsive to students' needs.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	Will the government consider providing Canadians with the 
choices that such a voucher system would provide?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows, 
when we amended the student loans program last spring we 
brought into the formula a series of grants available for women 
to go to graduate programs, a remission of loans program, and 
the ability of students who have income needs to receive certain 
assistance.
<P>
	What we have proposed in the green paper, I want to reiterate, 
are simply proposals. They are not government policy. We 
suggest that there could be a combination of loans and grants, in 
effect a voucher system for individual students that would 
enable them to tailor their financial requirements according to 
their needs without the same kinds of complication and means 
test that now apply to student loans. There could be much easier 
funding not only for students who are presently in educational 
institutions but for the many Canadians who are in the 
workplace now and want to go back to school.
<P>
	If that is in some way complementary to what the Reform 
Party is proposing, we would certainly be glad to look at it. 
However I would suggest the hon. member should introduce 
those ideas into the committee report because the government 
will take the report very seriously.

yesterday the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
unfortunately dismissed the constructive proposal made by the 
mayor of Saint-Jean.
<P>
	According to this proposal, which is more than just a 
moratorium, the Collège de Saint-Jean would be allowed a 
period of transition, during which it would gradually be turned 
into a civilian institution. The mayor's proposal has the 
advantage of reducing the negative impact that an immediate 
shutdown of military training activities at the college would 
otherwise have, if the federal government were to proceed as 
planned.
<P>
	How can the minister be so reluctant to be more open-minded 
and flexible about considering the proposal made by the mayor 
of Saint-Jean, a proposal that would meet the objectives of all 
parties while providing for a gradual transition?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the mayor's proposal contains some very useful 
clauses which I looked at a few hours ago, and I will certainly 
give them some thought.
<P>
	However, it is wrong to say that the proposal meets the 
conditions set by the Government of Quebec and the 
Government of Canada. From the financial point of view, in 
particular, the mayor's proposal would mean that the federal 
government would have to spend an additional $23 million over 
three years to maintain the moratorium, while at the present 
time we have a compromise solution reached by the Government 
of Quebec and the federal government, a solution that ensures 
the survival of the college, maintains a military presence at the 
college and provides for the transition from a military college to 
a co-ed civilian university over the next few years.
<P>

of Quebec and the federal government, is a far more successful

expect the situation to evolve.
<P>
	As my supplementary, I would like to ask the minister how he 
and the Minister of National Defence can repeatedly maintain 
their excuse that closing the Collège militaire de Saint-Jean will 
mean a savings of $23 million, when it is public knowledge that 
the real savings will not be more than $10 million, and that only 
a few years from now, because of the reduction in the number of 
cadets?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, this is an exaggeration, to put it mildly. For months 
we have known that by closing the Collège de Saint-Jean, we 
would achieve very substantial savings, because due to military 
downsizing, we will no longer need as many cadets as we did 
before.
<P>
	We now have an agreement that provides for maintaining the 
Collège de Saint-Jean with a military and a civilian component.

question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	Military police notes from the Shidane Arone murder 
investigation indicate that the order to abuse Somali prisoners 
came from senior officers. Now Major Barry Armstrong, a 
senior medical officer with the unit, has revealed that on April 
18, 1993 there was a general order at Belet Huen and he was 
ordered to destroy evidence, specifically all pictures of Somali 
patients. Major Armstrong says that some of these pictures still 
exist.
<P>
	It has now been a year and a half since these events. Would the 
minister agree that since there are these continued allegations of 
cover-up at the highest level these allegations and this evidence 
should be turned over to a public inquiry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to remind the hon. member and members of the House that an 
inquiry was established by the previous government. However it 
was suspended once charges were laid against certain 
individuals.
<P>
	The judicial process is currently ongoing, the court martials. 
There is one to go I believe in January or February. After the 
judicial process is complete I have said publicly that there will 
be a resumption of the inquiry. The terms of reference for that 
inquiry will be broad enough to answer any concern raised by 
members of the opposition about the individual in question who 
was a military officer and was involved.
<P>
	With respect to the actual events surrounding the 
circumstances in Somalia, as I have said they are subject to 
judicial proceedings at the moment and, as I have said in the 
House before, it would be inappropriate for me to comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a supplementary question.
<P>
	There is an additional allegation on March 4, 1993. Major 
Armstrong performed an autopsy on Mr. Ahmed Affrah Aresh, 
another unarmed Somali civilian who was shot in the back and 
killed execution style. No charges were ever laid and I am told 
there is no investigation proceeding on the matter.
<P>
	Will the minister agree that this should be investigated? Will 
he also agree that the whole process of military justice in this 
case should be submitted to an investigation? We have a 
corporal alone, sitting in jail, the man who provided the initial 
evidence for the investigation.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the last 
point first, the military justice system has been upheld as 
constitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
	On the second point with respect to the allegations made in 
print this morning, there are two police investigations ongoing. 
If the individual in question has evidence which he has a duty to 
report as a member of the armed forces, he should make that 
evidence available to the police authorities undertaking the 
investigation.

Wanting to look like Robin Hood, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development pretends that his reform will attack the 
wealthy unemployed so that more can be given to the poor, by 
taking from households earning over $60,000 the right to collect 
unemployment insurance benefits while requiring them to 
continue to pay premiums.
<P>

unemployment insurance will force 2.6 million households

resources to help those who have been unemployed for long 
periods of time, to get good literacy programs, to retrain, to help 
self-employment programs, and to develop a variety of ways to 
give them a chance to get back to a job. It is a way of trying to 
turn the safety net into a springboard. It gives an awful lot more

them to unacceptable financial dependence on their husbands?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask the hon. 
member to look more carefully at the technical paper that was 
presented. I think it does explain.
<P>
	First, it points out that under the proposal for a two tier 
system, 70 per cent of those who receive unemployment 
insurance would not be affected in any kind of way, but those 
who receive basic insurance would have the same formula 
attached. It is only those who are basically using unemployment 
insurance every year.
<P>
	This is an important difference. What is really happening and 
has happened is that 40 per cent of UI users are frequent users. 
That means it is no longer an insurance program. It has become 
an income benefit program. Perhaps it is very much needed, 
perhaps it is very much necessary, but it is no longer based on 
the fundamental insurance principle. It has become an income 
benefit program. As the hon. member would know, every 
income benefit program has some test applied to ensure that 
those who are very wealthy, those who have a lot of money, do 
not use the system as it is not supposed to be used.
<P>

to respond. I will welcome the hon. member's response to that 
question.

<P>
	First of all, we do not want to cut federal assistance; we want 
to invest it. As I said earlier, if the status quo was maintained, 
$61 billion would be spent on education. But, if the federal

recall that, in 1983, the Liberal government had unilaterally 
decided to centralize fisheries management in Ottawa.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Fisheries tell us whether or not he intends

<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

several governments in Canada in recent weeks and months have 
expressed an interest in greater responsibility in the area of the 
administration of the health of the fisheries.
<P>
	Among those is the Government of Quebec, which made its 
position clear at a meeting of federal and provincial ministers in 
Victoria a few weeks ago. The Government of Newfoundland 
and Labrador expressed an interest in fisheries management in a 
proposal it calls joint management. The Government of British 
Columbia expressed an interest in seeing licensing and 
allocation boards established in the province of British 
Columbia.
<P>
	It is good to see that the new Government of Quebec, and on 
this I congratulate it sincerely, and I have congratulated the 
minister who is in tune with his fellow colleagues, understands 
the need to build efficiencies in this country given our fiscal 
restraint, to find ways to avoid duplication and overlap and to 
have better administration of fisheries policies by working

	Here is my question: Does the minister intend to reorganize 
fisheries management in Canada? Information was leaked to the

reorganizing the fishery. The bottom line is that we look after 
the resource for conservation and for enforcement. That means 
sharing greater roles and responsibilities with all of the

and willing to take a look at it.

	<B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	Yesterday I was advised by a representative of Inglis Limited 
that its parent company, Whirlpool Corporation, will be closing 
its manufacturing facility in my riding of Cambridge.
<P>
	Given that my riding has had both very good and very bad 
news in the course of one week, does the minister have any 
words of advice for those workers at Inglis who will be losing 
their jobs and of course for my people in Cambridge?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is regrettable that Inglis has decided to close its 
facility in Cambridge, Ontario. It is a loss of jobs. It represents a 
restructuring that is occurring within that corporation as it 
moves its production to its main plant.
<P>
	The good news of course is that in the last week or so Toyota 
Corporation announced that it would be investing $600 million 
in a major expansion to its facility in Cambridge, Ontario, 
creating 1,200 long term jobs in the community.
<P>
	I think that represents not only a very important endorsement 
by one of the world's major corporations of Canadian 
competitiveness but it is also a clear win for Canadian workers 
in the auto sector who have proven that they can be productive 
and competitive and that they can make automobiles as good as 
anyone else in the world.

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	After pressure was exerted by the Official Opposition, the 
review of appointments to the IRB has shown that the minister is 
continuing the same system of patronage as the former 
government. The only difference is that now the open conflict 
between the various factions is further undermining the board's 
credibility.
<P>
	Following the resignation of the executive director and the 
indefinite suspension of the vice-chairman, when will the 
minister restore some order to the board?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it would be very 
unfair to simply take the one person under question this week 
and draw the conclusion that every one of the IRB members, all 
211, are going to be painted by the same brush.
<P>
	Instead we should recognize that it is an important federal 
institution. We should be seeking reforms and modifications on 
how we can build up the institution and not seek to politically 
exploit the difficulty and tear it down.
<P>
	It would be unfair to simply say that the appointment process 
is one that was there years ago.
<P>
<B>(1500) </B>
<P>
	We have gazetted all the appointments, all of them are 
evaluated under the same standard by the IRB. I think we should 
continue to seek reforms. We have put some reform proposals 
before the agency and program review. If the hon. member has 
additional recommendations we would be more than pleased to 
entertain them.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="7859"> 7859 </A></B>
<P>
	Last week the Prime Minister announced in China his support 
for the Three Gorges dam and the sale of Candu reactors to 
China. In view of the strong opposition by this minister and 
other Liberals to Canadian involvement in Three Gorges, 
described as an economic, social and environmental disaster, 
and in view of China's continued nuclear testing and dumping of 
waste in Tibet, how can the secretary of state justify this massive 
betrayal of the Liberal government's earlier promises on Three 
Gorges and Candu reactor sales?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America 
and Africa), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, our Prime Minister was in 
China and did speak of the Three Gorges dam project with the 
president of China. China has decided to go ahead with the 
development of the Three Gorges dam project despite what any 
of our views were with regard to environmental and human 
rights issues. We will remain concerned about those issues 
whether they are in China or anywhere else we are involved.
<P>
	However, the Chinese government is asking for Canadian 
co-operation in the development and we hope that in providing 
our management and technical expertise we can have an 
influence on those potential negative impacts.
<P>
	I think it is also important to recognize that the Yangtze River 
is a very important resource to China and it poses both a threat 
and an opportunity. The river has caused thousands of deaths but 
there is great potential in that river for electrical energy 
formation and the possibility of navigating, allowing ships to 
get to interior cities, which is important.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="REVIEWOFCANADIANFOREIGNPOLICY">REVIEW OF CANADIAN FOREIGN POLICY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
point of order follows the tabling in the House yesterday of two 
documents by one of the co-chairmen of the Special Joint 
Committee reviewing Canada's foreign policy, the hon. member 
for Ottawa-Vanier.
<P>
	The first document includes the report of the committee and is 
signed by the two co-chairmen. The second document includes 
the dissenting opinions and the appendices to the report. For 
several reasons, we feel that to include dissenting opinions in a 
document separate from the report signed by the co-chairmen of 
the committee goes against the parliamentary rules governing 
the committee and this House.
<P>
	First, we want to point out that Standing Order 108.(1)(<I>a</I>) 
allows committees to report on issues submitted to them. That 
provision, which is on page 63 of the Standing Orders of the 
House of Commons, also authorizes committees, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-to print a brief appendix to any report, after the signature of the Chairman, 
containing such opinions or recommendations, dissenting from the report or 
supplementary to it, as may be proposed by committee members.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The decision to annex such a statement must be made by way 
of a motion concurred in by committee members. As confirmed 
in the minutes of the committee included in the second 
document tabled yesterday, such a motion was agreed to at the 
hearing which took place on the evening of November 2, 1994.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	The text of the motion, which is found on page 102 of the 
second document, reads as follows: ``On motion of Bill Graham, 
it was agreed,- That the Bloc Quebecois, the Reform Party and 
other members of the Committee, be authorized to append to the 
report their dissenting or supplementary opinions or 
recommendations, such opinions or recommendations shall be 
in the discretion of the dissenting members themselves relevant 
and proportionate to the length of the report''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, we respectfully submit that the documents 
tabled yesterday do not comply with the terms of Standing Order 
108(1)(<I>a</I>), since the dissenting opinions are not presented after 
the signatures of the joint chairs, which are found at the end of 
the report in the first document. On the contrary, this statement 
is in the second document, separate from the first, which 
contains the report of the committee signed by the joint chairs.
<P>
	The dissenting opinions are in no case appended to the report 
as required by Standing Order 108(1)(<I>a</I>) and the motion adopted 
by the committee on November 2, 1994. Some might be inclined 
to say that the dissenting opinions follow the joint chairs' 
signatures in the second document, which is part of the 
committee's report.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, we cannot support such a claim because we think 
that such a procedure is contrary to the spirit, if not the letter, of 
Standing Order 108(1)(<I>a</I>). Indeed, what is the point of 
appending the dissenting opinions of certain members to the 
committee report, if not to let readers of the report judge the 
validity of the opinions and recommendations that it contains by 
comparing them with those of the dissenting members?
<P>
	The most basic logic requires that these dissenting opinions 
follow in the same document. At no time should someone be 
able to refer to this report without immediately having the 
recommendations of the minority report included therein. That 
is why Standing Order 108(1)(<I>a</I>) requires appending the 
dissenting opinions to the report, following the signature of the 
two joint chairs; otherwise such a statement is quite useless.
<P>
	Economic or practical reasons cannot be invoked to justify 
tabling two separate documents in the House, since this was not 
founded on a committee decision. The committee must adopt a 
motion consistent with parliamentary rules for the committee 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7860"> 7860 </A></B>
<P>
report and the  statement of dissident opinions to be divided into 
two documents.
<P>
	According to citation 552 in Beauchesne, every matter is 
determined in the House of Commons upon a question put by the 
Speaker on a proposition submitted by a member. Since 
Standing Order 116 provides that a committee must obey House 
procedural rules, the committee should, in accordance with 
parliamentary rules, adopt a motion to publish the dissident 
report as a separate document, if it decides to do so for economic 
or practical reasons.
<P>
	The motion adopted by the committee on November 2, 1994, 
which authorizes Bloc members on the committee to append 
their dissident opinions to the report, does not provide in any 
way for the report to be split into two documents. In fact, the 
committee minutes reproduced in the second document do not 
reflect such a decision.
<P>
	Therefore, it cannot be argued that the committee had full 
discretion to include dissident opinions in a second document. 
Again, such a decision should have been the subject of a motion 
duly adopted by the committee, but the minutes do not contain 
such a motion.
<P>
	In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, we respectfully 
submit to you that tabling the report and the statement of 
dissident opinions in two separate documents, as was done 
yesterday, goes against the rules of parliamentary procedure 
governing the House of Commons and the committee.
<P>
	Parliamentary jurisprudence clearly establishes that the Chair 
is free to rule on a report's admissibility at any time after the 
report is tabled. Indeed, citation 893 in Beauchesne, on page 
244, says this: ``A committee report may be ruled out of order 
even though it has been received by the House, and a motion to 
concur therein cannot then be entertained''.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	On January 28, 1991, the Chair ruled, on page 2824 of 
<I>Hansard</I>, that part of a report previously tabled in the House was 
inadmissible and even null and void. Therefore, we urge you, 
Mr. Speaker, to exercise the powers invested in you and rule out 
of order the reports tabled yesterday in the House by one of the 
committee joint chairmen, to order that the report of the Special 
Joint Committee Reviewing Canada's Foreign Policy be 
reprinted so that the dissident opinions appear after the joint 
chairmen's signatures within a single document, in accordance 
with the parliamentary rules governing the House and the 
committee, and finally to order that the reprinted report be 
tabled as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Robert Gauthier (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as a co-chairman of the committee which has now been 
dissolved-still, I feel a responsibility-I would like to explain 
why the co-chairman from the Senate and myself decided to 
produce the report in two separate volumes. This was one single 
report which was tabled only in this House and the other place, 
and not two separate reports.
<P>
	The committee report, dissenting opinions, appendices, 
position papers, documents and summaries added up to a total of 
1,126 pages. This was rather bulky. So, some thinking was 
required. We sought advice and gave the matter some thought 
and, finally, decided to publish the report in two volumes, both 
of which were put in a white folder marked ``Committee 
Report''. This is how it was tabled in this House and distributed 
to the media.
<P>
	We would have liked the printer to tie them together with 
something like this to make things easier, but time was short and 
it would have been too costly. The point is taken, but it is not 
really fair to say that there are two reports. There is only one 
report. It was decided to produce the report in two volumes. The 
first volume is 181 pages long and contains the majority report, 
while the second volume, with 202 pages, contains the 
dissenting opinions of the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party 
as well as the appendices.
<P>
	In addition, we have put together in another volume the 250 
pages of position papers prepared by experts, experts 
recognized by the committee that is. A 483-page summary was 
also made available in loose-leaf format to limit costs. It can be 
obtained on request. Since it was impossible to tie the volumes 
with a plastic or paper tape because the printing deadlines were 
too short, the two volumes that make up the report were 
distributed yesterday, as I indicated earlier, in a specially 
designed folder marked ``Report of the Special Joint Committee 
Reviewing Canadian Foreign Policy''.
<P>
	Positions papers and summaries on the other hand are 
distributed on request. The index of Volume I indicates very 
clearly that the report has two volumes and lists the contents of 
Volume II. This is clear proof that the dissention opinions are 
part and parcel of the committee report. The Bloc should see in 
this format nothing more that an effort on the part of both 
co-chairmen to provide the readers with practical and easy to 
handle documents.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is clear that none of the parties in this House have 
tried to do anything to offend members who today, apparently, 
feel they have been treated unfairly. That was not the case, it was 
not our purpose, and that is not what happened.
<P>
	Furthermore, without wishing to get into a debate with hon. 
members opposite, it is obvious that both volumes are part of 
one and the same report.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as you know, it is perfectly clear from the 
Standing Orders that if there was only one tabling, of course 
there was only one report.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7861"> 7861 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Reading from page two of volume one it says: ``Volume two 
contains dissenting opinions, appendices, minutes of 
proceedings''. In other words, Mr. Speaker, when you read the 
first volume there is reference to the second volume, both of 
them being part of one report as the hon. member for 
Ottawa-Vanier has described.
<P>
	On behalf of my colleagues I have offered, and I wish to state 
this to Mr. Speaker, that in the event there is a reprint or printing 
of additional copies should members require additional copies 
for the House, the committee, or indeed for anyone for 
distribution purposes, I would not object to having both reports 
joined in one volume, if that is manageable for those who print 
these kinds of documents.
<P>
	I would not of course advocate that we destroy the copies that 
have been printed. As I said previously, nothing wrong was 
intended and nothing wrong was committed. Therefore there 
would be no reason to redo the present copies. However, if it 
would please members across the way I would certainly have no 
objection should further printings of the report be necessary to 
join both volumes together.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Some say it may be too late. No, it is not too late, although 
there is nothing wrong with the reports we have here. All I want 
to say to hon. members opposite is, that if it makes them feel 
better, if that would satisfy them, we are prepared to co-operate 
in the event additional copies are needed. It is not too late. There 
was no malicious intent, and there was no harm done.
<P>
	Actually, if I am not mistaken, according to informal 
discussions held yesterday, two of the three parties in this House 
agreed to keep the report as is.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, in the unlikely event there would still be someone 
who mistakenly believed these two volumes constituted two 
reports, the committee chair went out of his way over the 
weekend to have a special jacket printed. Both volumes are 
contained inside the one jacket so that no one could possibly 
even inadvertently consider these two volumes as being two 
reports.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, speaking to this point of order I concur with my 
colleague from the Bloc that this report was not handled or 
distributed properly.
<P>
	There are two volumes but there is nothing on the outside of 
either of the volumes to indicate which is number one and which 
is number two. You have to look into the contents to find that 
there is a second volume. Even at that you would have a difficult 
time knowing whether it was volume one or volume two.
<P>
	Being concerned about the cost of a complete reprinting of 
this I would suggest that those copies that have not yet been 
distributed should be clearly labelled  with a stamp or a sticker 
indicating volume one and that volume two is available with the 
dissenting reports in it.
<P>
	It is important to make it very clear to all readers of the report 
who happen to get volume one that there were two dissenting 
reports, one by the Bloc Quebecois and one by the Reform Party. 
If it is not handled properly, the Canadian public and those who 
receive volume one may never know other options were put on 
the table.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the same point of 
order. Perhaps I may provide some additional clarification. It is 
clear that the procedure was somewhat less than satisfactory. 
Considering the size of the report, the committee could have put 
everything together in a document of about 400 pages, which is 
common practice, or it could have published a complete report 
in French and complete English version. That would have been 
fair to everyone.
<P>
	It seems to me that the reasons invoked by the government 
party were entirely unacceptable and the government also failed 
to prove that the Standing Orders had been observed in this case.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	I was able to demonstrate, however, that the Standing Orders 
had been totally ignored, that the report did not meet the 
requirements of the Standing Orders and that, if the chairman of 
the committee had wanted to show he was acting in good faith, 
he could have called a meeting of his committee and put to a vote 
the requisite proposals for proceeding the way he did.
<P>
	Consequently, I would ask you to hand down a ruling on the 
matter as requested earlier.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the remarks made by the chief government whip 
and by the member for Ottawa-Vanier ought to be more than 
sufficient to put this matter to rest.
<P>
	They indicate very clearly that while there may be a complaint 
there is not any basis for a point of order or indeed a question of 
privilege arising out of the publication of a report in two 
volumes. I think it is commonplace that reports are published in 
more than one volume. Here we have a report that with the 
appendices comes to five volumes as I count them. That is what 
is available from distribution if members ask.
<P>
	There is one further technical point I invite Your Honour to 
consider in reviewing this matter. Standing Order 108(1) which 
permits dissenting opinions and which was a change in the 
standing orders made during the last Parliament largely at the 
behest of members of this party applies only to standing 
committees.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7862"> 7862 </A></B>
<P>
	This is the report of a special joint committee. The fact there 
was a dissenting opinion was thanks to the good graces of the 
hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier and the members of the 
committee who agreed to apply this rule to the special joint 
committee because it would not otherwise apply.
<P>
	The changes to the standing orders were made in respect only 
of standing committees. It has never been applied beyond that. 
This was a special benefit, if you like, conferred by the generous 
hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier and his co-chair of the special 
joint committee.
<P>
	I am surprised there would be complaints today when we have 
very lengthy dissenting opinions. I may say that the dissenting 
opinions as I see it are almost as long as the report. Here we have 
a second volume that is thicker than the report itself.
<P>
	I am not surprised that the report has been divided into two 
volumes. I think a satisfactory explanation as to why that was 
done has been given both by the chief government whip in his 
very able argument and by the hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I wish to thank the hon. member for Roberval 
for raising this matter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I also thank my hon. friend from Ottawa-Vanier, the 
government whip and of course the parliamentary secretary, as 
well as the House leader for the Reform Party. I am sure that you 
will all agree to give your Speaker some time to review 
everything that has been put in front of me. If it is deemed 
necessary I will come back to the House with a decision.
<P>
	I will review all of the information that has been supplied to 
me. I will inform myself also of the rules. With your permission 
I will get back to the House if it is necessary as soon as possible.

the honour to present, in both official languages, the fourth 
report of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 108(2), your committee has 
considered the documents entitled: ``Draft Amendments to the 
Criminal Code and the Customs Tariff, Crime Cards and Board 
Games'' and your committee has agreed to report it with three 
recommendations.
<P>
	The study was prompted by concerns about the glorification 
of violence through the format of a board game and trading cards 
depicting serial killers. Many petitions were received in the 
House.
<P>
	The committee studied draft legislation. The committee now 
recommends a broader scope dealing with the glorification or 
exploitation of horror, cruelty and violence through expanded 
obscenity provisions of the Criminal Code as a more inclusive 
legislative effort. Also suggested were the utilization of a 
preamble together with appropriate safeguards and special 
defences.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in a 
dissenting opinion to the report of the Standing Committee on

exploitation of violence cannot fail to be of concern to all of us. 
There is no doubt that trade cards and board games (black series) 
fly in the face of our fundamental values and shamefully defile 
the memory of the battered and murdered victims.

at these board games and serial killer cards until the committee 
gave them samples. The same was true of most MPs who 
opposed importing and manufacturing serial killer cards. They 
acknowledged they had never seen any.
<P>
	Therefore, one must wonder how such a marginal issue could 
keep committee members occupied for several months. 
Obviously, this is not very responsible.
<P>
	We firmly believe that this committee should deal more with 
issues related to real violence rather than hypothetical violence 
due to the action of some shady publishers.

<P>
	Today, I am tabling a bill entitled ``An Act to revoke the 
conviction of Louis David Riel''. Some facts are worth 
recalling. In order to ensure a unanimous verdict, Prime 
Minister Macdonald had Riel tried in Regina rather than in 
Winnipeg. The jury was composed exclusively of 
English-speaking Protestants. In order to justify its actions, the 
Cabinet, in a report to the House, went so far as to falsify Dr. 
Valade's report, which stated that Riel was not responsible, by 
reason of insanity.
<P>
	The trial was marred by irregularities and Riel was sacrificed 
by Macdonald to the powerful Ontario lobby. Riel was hanged 
because he was a Métis, because he was a francophone, and 
because he went to the defence of a distinct society.
<P>
	It is important to remember-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I hope that the hon. member and indeed 
all hon. members will respect the Standing Orders and keep it 
brief. Otherwise, we will be here all afternoon. One more

	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with sadness yet with serenity that we learned yesterday of the 
passing of the Hon. Eugène Marquis, who represented the riding 
of Kamouraska in this House at one time.
<P>
	Mr. Marquis was born in St. Alexandre, Kamouraska, in 1901. 
He was the son of Joseph Marquis and Eveline Michaud. Upon 
completion of his classical studies, Eugène Marquis received 
his law degree from Laval University. Upon being admitted to 
the Bar, he was appointed susbstitute to the Attorney General of 
Quebec.
<P>
	In 1931, Eugène Marquis married Véronique Chabot -who 
happens to be my aunt as she is my mother's sister- in Ste. 
Claire de Dorchester. Destined for politics, he ran in the 1945 
general elections as a candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada, 
when the Right Hon. William Lyon Mackenzie King was Prime 
Minister of the country, and the voters of Kamouraska put their 
trust in him. They did so again in the next election, in 1949, 
when the Right Hon. Louis Saint-Laurent was Prime Minister of 
Canada.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7865"> 7865 </A></B>
<P>
	On August 24, 1949, on the recommendation of the Prime 
Minister of Canada, the Hon. Eugène Marquis was appointed to 
the Superior Court of Quebec, of which he would eventually 
become the associate chief justice.
<P>
	Mr. Marquis's legal career spanned both criminal and civil 
law, and whether on the bench or in private practice, whether 
representing the State or the Attorney General, his great 
humanity was recognized by all.
<P>
	I have the honour of having four parishes in common with Mr. 
Marquis, parishes that were in his riding when he was a member 
of Parliament and have now become part of the riding of 
Bellechasse: Saint-Damase-des-Aulnaies, Tourville, 
Sainte-Perpétue and Saint-Omer. Eugène Marquis was also an 
active member of the Knights of Columbus, making a valuable 
contribution to the furtherance of this organization's social 
mission.
<P>
	To his children, Monique, Louise, Yves, Michel and Jean, I 
offer my deepest sympathy, as well as to his colleagues from the 
Barreau du Québec and all those who worked with him in the 
judicial system in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too would like to express the sorrow of members in 
our party on the death of Mr. Marquis. I do know that the hon. 
member for Bellechasse is that gentleman's nephew. I am sorry 
for him, his family and the family of the deceased that this event 
happened today. I extend to the hon. member all the respect 
which members of this House have for former members and that 
certainly applies to this member for Kamouraska who served his 
country well a long time ago. I offer the sincere condolences of 
all members on this side of the House to his family.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to rise on behalf of my colleagues in 
the Reform caucus to also express our sympathies to the family 
on the passing of a former member of the House of Commons, 
Mr. Eugene Marquis.
<P>
	Although no one from our caucus has known him, I do know 
that Mr. Marquis was a farmer and those of us who are farmers 
share a kindred spirit. We do express our sympathies on behalf 
of our caucus to the members of his family. We also know that he 
was committed to Canada, a strong united Canada, before we 
perhaps got entangled in some of the more recent concerns in 
Canadian history. We all salute the former member for his 
contribution to the country and his commitment to it.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFCANADIANHERITAGEACT">DEPARTMENT OF CANADIAN HERITAGE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from November 15 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-53, an act to establish the Department of 
Canadian Heritage and to amend and repeal certain other acts, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to resume debate on Bill C-53, an act to 
establish the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Although the proposed legislation will officially establish in 
law this new department, more than a year has gone by since the 
department was formed from the components of no less than five 
different federal departments. This exercise we are going 
through is part of this government's effort to streamline the way 
the federal system is organized.
<P>
	That interim period between the practical establishment of the 
new department and the present regulatory establishment of it 
has, to say the least, proved to be very interesting and 
challenging not only for the new department but for the 
government and for the entire country.
<P>
	The different sectors of Canadian heritage have had to get 
used to their new organizational relationships. In many cases 
this has meant breaking established links with their former 
organizations and forming new ones with the various entities 
brought together to create the new Department of Canadian 
Heritage.
<P>
	To take one example which interests me, let us look at Parks 
Canada. Formally a part of Environment Canada, Parks Canada 
is now a vital and active member of the new ministry. Parks 
Canada is the steward of our national parks and our national 
historic sites which collectively represent some of our most 
precious natural and cultural heritage resources.
<P>
	Some have questioned the move of parks to Canadian 
Heritage. In my view it makes good sense to have the program of 
Parks Canada housed in a department devoted to our heritage.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	The historic sites and national parks are tangible expressions 
of our culture and the geographical realities that have helped to 
instil in Canadians a unique perspective on the natural 
environment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7866"> 7866 </A></B>
<P>
	It seems to me there is a special relationship between 
Canadians, aboriginal Canadians and immigrant Canadians, and 
the environment. This is expressed through Parks Canada and so 
it is part of our heritage.
<P>
	In listening to various speakers regarding this bill, both those 
on the government side and colleagues in other parties, what has 
struck me is the fundamental nature of feelings that have been 
expressed. Truly this new department, the Department of 
Canadian Heritage, has responsibility for areas that strike a deep 
and resonant chord in all Canadians.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage-I must admit it is a 
new name, but a new name that I like-is a department that is 
concerned about all those things that make us what we are, those 
things that set us apart in the global community. Anyone who 
takes the time cannot fail to be impressed by the range and 
diversity of the new department's program areas.
<P>
	I do not intend to list each of these areas of endeavour, but I do 
want to note some of the major sectors for the benefit of those 
who have been following this debate. I have already mentioned 
Parks Canada. In addition the new department has responsibility 
for the arts, broadcasting, heritage conservation, cultural 
industries including film, video, sound recording and book 
publishing.
<P>
	It is also responsible for the federal programs dedicated to the 
promotion of official languages; the pursuit of excellence in 
amateur sport, Mr. Speaker, which interests you and me greatly; 
the promotion of our cultural diversity and the encouragement 
of the full and open participation of every Canadian in society.
<P>
	In short, the Department of Canadian Heritage is active in 
areas that have as their common objective the promotion of 
Canadian identity. I think everyone listening to this can relate to 
one or another of those areas of interest which this new 
department has that I have mentioned. In my riding of 
Peterborough, and I have only been a member of Parliament for 
a short time, I have already had personal discussions with 
constituents about virtually every one of those areas of heritage 
activity that I have mentioned.
<P>
	As one can see from the proposed legislation we are 
discussing here, this bill will give sanction to a federal 
department that has programs that touch each and every 
Canadian. The department is a rich amalgam of sectors. Indeed I 
believe that the Minister of Canadian Heritage has the privilege 
to direct one of the government's most exciting and challenging 
new portfolios.
<P>
	The word heritage means different things to different people. 
To me one thing is clear. Particularly this year at this particular 
time in this House one thing is clear: Our heritage matters and 
the department dedicated to it are necessarily of great 
importance at this time, at any time, to this country. I have no 
doubt whatever that the new Department of Canadian Heritage 
will prove to be an able and vital player in the federal arena as it 
goes about  carrying out the responsibilities conferred upon it by 
Parliament.
<P>
	Although the bill before us says a technical purpose, 
confirming as it does the creation of the department in statute, to 
me it nonetheless represents a far-sighted and enlightened step 
on the part of the government, a step that will benefit our 
children and for which I think they will thank us. In my view this 
department will help ensure that Canada remains a country that 
others will look to as an example, a nation built on its aboriginal 
foundations that is confident enough in its identity to embrace 
the peoples of the world, not only accepting their cultural 
differences, but welcoming and acknowledging them for what 
they are, living examples of human expression that link us to the 
past, link us to the rest of the world and provide us with the 
foundation and certainty necessary to face the future with 
confidence.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	I have taken note of concerns expressed by some members 
about the rationale for placing responsibility for broadcasting 
within Canadian heritage while the telecommunications policy 
will reside in the new Department of Industry. These members 
pretend to worry about whether the government will be 
hamstrung by this arrangement and therefore be incapable of 
action in these two vital fields. I can only say the truth is far 
from that.
<P>
	Canadians can be assured that both departments are 
co-operating, teaming their efforts and finding innovative and 
effective ways to satisfy their respective mandates.
<P>
	We need look no further than the recent joint announcement of 
my colleagues the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the 
Minister of Industry regarding the government's request to the 
Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications 
Commission, the CRTC, to seek input and report on a number of 
regulatory and policy matters relevant to the development of the 
information highway.
<P>
	Both ministers recognize that the interests of all parties, 
consumers, business, creators, in short everyone, will best be 
served by an open and transparent information gathering 
process.
<P>
	Accordingly the government has asked the CRTC to consider 
such issues as the regulations in new services, the contributions 
to the objectives of the broadcasting act that these new services 
would be required to make, and the transition to fair competition 
between the various players on the information highway, 
particularly the cable television and telephone companies.
<P>
	It is all too easy to sit and wring our hands and worry that the 
two departments will not be able to deliver on their mandates. 
Those that do so have their blinders on and refuse to see what 
can be done or accomplished if the will and effort are there.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7867"> 7867 </A></B>
<P>
	We have heard many speakers on this bill talk about the 
dawning of the so-called information age and what that will 
mean for you and me today and for our children tomorrow. 
Although no one can be sure about the future we can all be 
certain that adaptations will be the prerequisite for success.
<P>
	With respect to the future viability of our cultural sector this 
government is committed to ensuring that Canadian content 
services have a strong visible and audible presence on the 
information highway.
<P>
	For me, debate at second reading has proved both interesting 
and telling in this matter, interesting because of the breadth and 
scope of the issues discussed and telling because it has pointed 
out the fundamental differences in the perspectives of this 
government and members of the opposition parties.
<P>
	The negativism expressed by those in opposition to this bill is 
in stark contrast to the confidence shown by the government in 
tabling this legislation and in the various pieces of legislation 
that will establish the other large new departments.
<P>
	Never has our national heritage and its expression been more 
important than at the present time. The government's actions in 
this regard are founded on a sense of optimism for the future, 
yes, optimism in continuing ingenuity, skill, and energy of our 
fellow Canadians toward ensuring a thriving and prosperous 
future for this country.
<P>
	I want to assure each and every Canadian that they have an 
elected government that is committed to serving them in the 
most effective, efficient way possible.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you for giving me this time and I 
look forward to early passage of this legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak again to Bill C-53 which establishes the 
Department of Canadian Heritage. In my first address to the 
House on this bill I discussed the issues of multiculturalism and 
copyright. Today I wish to address the issue of the national parks 
system. Yes, these inherently different areas all fall within the 
responsibility and jurisdiction of Canadian heritage.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	I continue to be puzzled as to why Parks Canada is now part of 
the Department of Canadian Heritage. While it is very true that 
our national parks provide educational opportunities to all 
Canadians to learn about Canadian history and culture, our 36 
national parks and national park reserves across the country 
seem to me to have greater environmental importance. Prior to 
the introduction of this bill by the previous government, Parks 
Canada had been part of the Department of the Environment.
<P>
	Parks Canada states in its ``Guiding Principles and 
Operational Policy'' that it contributes to ``an understanding 
and collective sense of Canada's identity as well as a shared 
sense of pride. We celebrate this rich heritage through national 
historic sites, national parks and park reserves, heritage 
railways stations, historic canals, marine conservation areas, 
heritage rivers, federal heritage buildings and historical 
markers''.
<P>
	Parks Canada has redefined its purpose in the following 
manner: ``To fulfil national and international responsibilities in 
mandated areas of heritage recognition and conservation and to 
commemorate, protect and present both directly and indirectly 
places which are significant examples of Canada's cultural and 
natural heritage in ways that encourage public understanding, 
appreciation and enjoyment of this heritage while ensuring long 
term ecological and commemorative integrity''.
<P>
	In 1930 the National Parks Act proclaimed that: ``The parks 
are hereby dedicated to the people of Canada for their benefit, 
education and enjoyment and such parks shall be maintained and 
made use of so as to leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of 
future generations''.
<P>
	Over time the mandate and purpose of Parks Canada has 
moved toward the greater emphasis on environmental protection 
and less emphasis on public enjoyment. By its placement in the 
Department of Canadian Heritage, I have to ask the question: 
Will the environmental concerns of Parks Canada become lost 
within the heritage issues?
<P>
	Throughout its history, Parks Canada has been faced with the 
same challenges, balancing development while protecting and 
preserving the ecosystem and funding, administration and fiscal 
accountability of the parks system.
<P>
	I wanted to know more about the concerns of the people who 
live in the townsites and earn their livelihoods from parks. Our 
mountain parks are world renowned and people travel from the 
four corners of the globe to visit them. The economic value of 
this tourism is in the hundreds of millions of dollars and impact 
directly on hundreds of jobs.
<P>
	This summer I met with people from Banff, Jasper and 
Waterton National Park. The single largest challenge facing 
parks today is balancing development of parks while protecting 
the parks' ecosystem. There is no question that Parks Canada 
contributes to Canadian culture and heritage. Development of 
the park resources ensures that visitors to the parks are able to 
fully understand and appreciate our natural and cultural 
heritage. This development also ensures the livelihoods of those 
who live and work there. Since their business is based on 
visitors' appreciation of the natural wonders of our parks, 
protection of the sensitive ecosystem is as important to business 
people in the parks as it is to environmentalists.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7868"> 7868 </A></B>
<P>
	This government is continuing its inaction by stating that it is 
consulting the Canadian public on many issues. This is also true 
of parks. Currently in Alberta and B.C. mountain parks alone 
there are numerous reviews including the four mountain parks 
five-year plan update which separates studies for Banff, Jasper, 
Yoho and Kootenay. There is also the Bow Valley study in Banff, 
including a two-year moratorium on development. There are 
operational reviews for the townsites of Waterton, Jasper, 
Wasagaming, Waskesiu, Field and Lake Louise; a study 
concerning the closure of the Jasper and Banff airstrips; an 
action plan update for Lake Louise and a study concerning the 
twinning of the Trans-Canada Highway through the parks. This 
is symptomatic of a government wrapped up in reviewing, 
discussing and studying. But is it really listening? I ask this 
question over and over. The focus of all of these studies is 
directed at environmental concerns, not the cultural benefits of 
our national parks.
<P>
	I would like to address another major challenge facing Parks 
Canada: funding, administration and fiscal accountability. 
According to figures obtained from the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, Parks Canada 1993-94 budget shows expenditures of 
$170.2 million and revenue of $32.5 million. According to the 
mathematics I learned in school, this leaves a shortfall of $137.7 
million. In these economic times it is impossible to understand 
how Parks Canada can maintain its administration and 
operation, let alone preserve our parklands for generations to 
come. Without a strategic and long range plan sustaining the 
parks at current levels it becomes more and more impossible for 
a cash strapped government.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	As has been demonstrated time and again there is a lack of 
access to information about specific parks expenditures. For 
instance, the residents of Waterton National Park have been 
invited to participate in an operational review. This review is 
based on three suppositions. First, those receiving government 
provided services should pay an appropriate and fair amount. 
Second, Canadians should receive fair market value for the use 
of their land and assets. Third, subsidies should be eliminated. 
This sounds like more do nothing mumbo-jumbo from the 
Liberal government.
<P>
	At a public meeting in Waterton residents were informed that 
the annual budget of their community was $750,000 while only 
$75,000 was generated. It is astounding. The community is 
willing to pay its fair share. In fact they welcome the 
opportunity to be more involved in the decision making and 
operations of their community. However they have not been 
given access to examine the expenditures to determine where 
the money is being spent and where it can be saved. The 85 year 
round residents are being asked to make up a shortfall of nearly 
$700,000 without full and detailed information. Isn't it a 
ludicrous expectation?
<P>
	These residents are questioning such things as the necessity of 
having the equivalent of 59 year round employees within their 
small park of 505 square kilometres and annual visitors 
numbering only 330,000. Meanwhile their public school is now 
closed, and I saw this. Their children will have to be bused out of 
the park to get an education. Their swimming pool has been 
closed and there are grass and weeds growing through the 
cracks. This is stark evidence that community input has not been 
heard.
<P>
	Yet Parks Canada's vision statement clearly states: 
``Stewardship of historic and heritage areas is a shared 
responsibility. Canadian citizens must be more aware and 
involved in decision making and in the delivery of heritage 
programs''.
<P>
	On August 3, 1994 the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
announced that he was looking at the matter of user fees for 
Parks Canada facilities. It is not clear from the documents I have 
seen what exactly the minister is targeting with these user fees. 
Parks Canada is already spending more than $170 million per 
year on national parks alone, not including other heritage sites.
<P>
	Raising visitors' fees should only be considered when the 
government demonstrates its willingness to open its books and 
show Canadians where their money is being spent. Anything 
less becomes another unjustifiable tax grab and a government 
that is casting its greedy eyes to the already empty pockets of 
taxpayers.
<P>
	In all my speeches to the House from the issue of the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation to multiculturalism and other 
heritage issues I have spoken of the need for fiscal responsibility 
and sound management practices. In closing I would ask some 
questions. Are we prepared to pay more to maintain our parks, or 
will our government continue to fund the parks system blindly 
and without accountability? How much more can the taxpayers 
of the country afford?

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to speak on second reading of Bill C-53 to continue my 
opposition to it.
<P>
	In my first speech, I reminded this House of some important 
considerations. First, I said that Quebec's problems are due to 
the very nature of the federal system since the federal system in 
Canada completely ignores the reality of Quebec. The original 
intention of Confederation has been gradually replaced by a 
strong central government in which one of the founding nations 
no longer has anything but the status of a small minority.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7869"> 7869 </A></B>
<P>
	I also reminded this House that the existential questions of 
English Canada in no way concern the Quebecois and even harm 
the development of Quebec. We can only hope that English 
Canada can solve its existential problems for the good of our 
nations. Thus, the decision was made very unilaterally to spend 
huge amounts on the search for this elusive Canadian identity 
that supposedly supersedes the Quebec identity, which is very 
much alive.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	In the same vein, I mentioned the harmful effects of the 
federal government's immense spending power. For example, in 
the referendum debate which is now just getting under way, we 
can already see the real impact of this spending power on the 
form and direction that the debate will take. For the sake of 
Canadian identity and its promotion, as provided for in clauses 4 
and 5 of the bill, the federal government will subsidize various 
groups and organizations to defend the ``no'' option, directly 
contravening the spirit of the Quebec law on referendums.
<P>
	The newspapers told us again yesterday that the Council for 
Canadian Unity was setting up three organizations for the 
Quebec referendum. One of the means being used is the Terry 
Fox Centre, financed-you guessed it-with federal funds. This 
is just the beginning of federal money being wasted in 
provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
	Experience in Quebec has taught us that these well-financed 
groups will grow rapidly in the coming weeks. As I already said, 
all this is contrary to the spirit of the Quebec law. This shows 
how much consideration the federal system has for Quebec's 
distinct character. In my first speech, I mentioned that it is 
important for the development of Quebec culture that the 
Quebec government control this whole area.
<P>
	Does the federal government care about this? Not in the least. 
With this bill, they are getting ready for a systematic invasion of 
all cultural areas, including the arts, the status of the artist, 
cultural heritage and industries, conservation, exportation and 
importation of cultural property.
<P>
	I remind you that the federal government's cultural 
investments will amount to almost $1 billion a year in Quebec. 
That is what I mean when I say that the federal government's 
spending power is harmful to Quebec. I put forward these 
arguments only two weeks ago. Since then, new elements have 
confirmed how important it is to reject the Canadian heritage 
minister's bill.
<P>
	First of all, we realized that the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
sees no limit to his power to take action. That in itself is very 
disturbing. We may well wonder how far the government would 
be willing to go if it felt that the Canadian identity was 
threatened. Would it be tempted to spend the money allocated to 
the Department of Canadian Heritage and to other departmental 
programs on promotion, without wondering at all if it is a 
legitimate investment?
<P>
	The Minister of International Affairs is about to promote 
Canadian culture through his foreign embassies and his cultural 
centre in Paris, which, incidentally, the Conservatives wanted to 
close. The evidence given at the hearings of the Standing 
Committee on Canadian Heritage raises similar questions. The 
mandate of the CBC seems to throw the door wide open to an 
extensive promotion of the Canadian identity. Curiously, except 
for one or two well-known exceptions, after two months of 
sittings, nothing has been said yet about Quebec culture.
<P>
	Is it necessary to specify that the vast majority of those who 
watch national television live in Quebec? What culture other 
than Quebec culture are they trying to reflect? Another element 
to be considered is the central government's attitude towards the 
new Quebec government's legitimate practices. Following an 
old tradition, the Parizeau government is working to revitalize 
the relationship with France and promote Quebec products in 
that country.
<P>
	As we know, Quebec has felt for a long time that it enjoys 
exclusive educational and cultural powers at the international 
level. Cultural products are an important part of these 
international exchanges. How can Quebec protect and promote 
its culture, when the central government is making laws such as 
the bill before us today that would give it control over Quebec 
culture, which is unacceptable?
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Once again, Quebec's specificity and autonomy are being 
denied. The right to control Quebec's culture belongs to the 
Quebec government, not to a government controlled by a 
majority representing English Canada. This is not a whim: It is a 
necessity. In fact, this is what the Bloc Quebecois reaffirmed in 
its dissenting opinion on the report tabled yesterday on 
Canadian foreign policy:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Successive Quebec governments have always rejected this argument of 
indivisibility and developed distinct international policies and relations that 
aim to serve Quebec's national interests and promote its influence and 
development, particularly in commercial, cultural, economic, political and 
social fields.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Since she was sworn in, the new Quebec Minister of Culture 
and Communications has been asking for the patriation of 
Quebec's control over the electronic highway and 
communications, which is essential to the development of 
Quebec's culture. In so doing, the minister reflects the 
collective will of Quebecers.
<P>
	It is imperative that the federal government withdraw from 
Quebec's cultural sector and that it gives fair compensation to 
the Quebec government. For all these reasons, we oppose Bill 
C-53.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me much pleasure to take part in the debate 
concerning legislation that will establish in law the Department 
of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	As an opening comment I must say I am astounded by the 
determined attempts to turn a transactional piece of legislation 
into a seemingly complicated bill. The legislation before us is 
simply intended to give legal effect to a department that has 
been in effect for well over a year.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage brings together the 
various elements that define us as a diverse and vibrant nation 
with a rich and bounteous cultural and natural heritage. The 
department's activities range from cultural development to arts, 
broadcasting, national parks, historic sites, amateur sport and 
multiculturalism. The department also administers social 
languages, state ceremonial and native programs, all of which 
contribute in a significant way to what makes uniquely 
Canadian.
<P>
	The mission of the Department of Canadian Heritage which 
states ``building our future together: strengthening a shared 
sense of Canadian identity which respects the diversity of the 
land and the people'' reflects the broad range of activities that 
define the Canadian society. Direct support to our cultural 
industries, protection and preservation of our national parks and 
historic sites and the promotion of Canadian excellence in sports 
and culture are just a few examples.
<P>
	Each and every part of the department is connected in some 
way to what we could refer to as the spirit and soul of Canada. 
Together these units form a striking panorama of our past 
accomplishments, our current reality and our aspirations for the 
future.
<P>
	As the chief custodian of natural and physical heritage, Parks 
Canada commemorates, protects and presents both directly and 
indirectly places of significance to Canadian cultural and 
natural heritage as a means of encouraging public 
understanding, appreciation and enjoyment. The economic 
activity and tourism, generated by the department's operations 
make a substantial impact on the growth of many local 
economies. As well the parks service is setting new trends in its 
approach to the forging of innovative partnership arrangements 
with private and not for profit enterprises as a means of carrying 
out the responsibilities that fall within its mandate.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage also plays a key role in 
the enhancement and development of English and French 
linguistic minority communities. Respect for Canada's two 
official languages, for the traditions and contributions of our 
aboriginal peoples, for our cultural diversity and for basic 
human rights makes Canada stand out among other countries as 
a nation that truly values and appreciates its diversity.
<P>
	Multiculturalism is essential to Canadian society. Countries 
throughout the world are trying to find the formula that will 
allow them to create a real sense of national identity among 
groups of different ethnic, cultural, linguistic and racial 
backgrounds. Many of these countries are now taking a serious 
interest in the 100 per cent Canadian model we have created.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Members will note that in the act creating the Department of 
Canadian Heritage the government undertakes to advance the 
equality of all Canadians in their country's social, economic and 
cultural life. It recognizes the need to eliminate obstacles that 
divide Canadians and to forge bonds based on confidence and 
respect. The goal of multiculturalism is after all to create social 
cohesion and to strengthen national identity.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage also focuses its efforts 
on the enhancement of culture and the development in Canada of 
a means of communication. Both are crucial to the future of our 
country not only in maintaining the uniqueness of Canada but 
also in acting as a powerful instrument of economic 
development.
<P>
	No one will argue that we live in challenging times. At this 
particular juncture in our country's history unfortunately there 
are forces working to dismantle the entity that is Canada. Within 
this context it is imperative that government foster an 
environment in which Canada's rich cultural heritage can 
flourish and that all Canadians have access to their own 
products.
<P>
	Moreover the march of technology is relentless, changing and 
in many cases erasing traditional borders. We are also 
witnessing changes which are taking place on a dramatic scale 
and are affecting the economies of our established trading 
partners throughout the world.
<P>
	Within this backdrop and keeping it in mind now more than 
ever Canadians will benefit from the creation of a department 
such as Canadian heritage. I believe that the minister of the 
department has the privilege to direct one of the government's 
most exciting and challenging portfolios.
<P>
	The legislation to create the department presents a far sighted 
and enlightened step by our government. This department will 
help ensure that Canada remains a country others look to as an 
example. It is a nation that is confident enough in its identity to 
embrace peoples of the world not only accepting their cultural 
differences but welcoming and acknowledging them for what 
they are: Living examples of human expression that link us to 
the past and provide us with the foundation and certainty 
necessary to face the future.
<P>
	I believe that as a nation we need a Department of Canadian 
Heritage. I hope that the bill will receive speedy passage.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to discuss the 
second reading of Bill C-53, an act to establish the Department 
of Canadian Heritage, which should be renamed the department 
of government waste and overlap. Hon. members across from 
me consider this bill nothing more than routine housekeeping 
yet to us in the Reform Party it is much much more.
<P>
	Canadians want change. The Liberals are finally beginning to 
understand this and I commend them for it.
<P>
	The Reform Party has been advocating decreases in 
immigration levels since the early 1990s and now the Liberals 
have adopted this idea. The Reform Party has been screaming 
loudly about the inadequacies in the criminal justice system and 
now the Liberals are reviewing the criminal justice system. The 
Reform Party has been pleading for serious amendments to the 
Young Offenders Act and the Liberals are also reviewing this 
issue.
<P>
	The Reform Party has been talking about the critical levels of 
our debt and deficit. Our debt now stands at 
$538,181,397,919.00. Just like magic, the Liberals are 
beginning to think there is a problem in this area as well.
<P>
	Although we are not the government, we can still be 
extremely effective and proud to know that our policy directives 
are beginning to be implemented by this government. I must 
congratulate government members on their insight.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	I mention these few examples of where the government has 
been listening to us on the Reform side of the House. I hope this 
trend will continue in the future. I hope this will continue 
regarding Bill C-53.
<P>
	As I alluded to earlier, Bill C-53 should be defeated in this 
House and sent back to cabinet for a complete overhaul. This 
overhaul should deal specifically with the notion of overlap and 
duplication such as: overlap between the Department of 
Industry and heritage; overlap between the Department of the 
Environment and heritage; and we are now seeing the possibility 
of overlap between the Department of Justice and heritage. The 
list goes on.
<P>
	We as a government are spending over $40 billion annually or 
approximately $110 million every day. We do not have a revenue 
problem in Canada but rather we have a spending problem. Last 
week when I was back in my riding of Edmonton-Strathcona 
holding town hall meetings on social reform, many people 
commented on how much money this government continues to 
waste on needless or extremely low priority programs. The main 
programs that were mentioned time after time were official 
languages and multiculturalism.
<P>
	First I want to say unequivocally that we are not anti-French 
nor anti-Quebec in the Reform Party. However, we do feel that a 
tremendous amount of resources is being wasted in areas in 
which the numbers  do not warrant service in both languages. We 
do believe in implementing the policy of territorial bilingualism 
which would see maintaining official languages in key federal 
institutions such as Parliament, the Supreme Court and other 
federal services where the demand is sufficient to warrant cost 
effective minority language services.
<P>
	Second, we have multiculturalism. It is here that I will focus 
my attention today. It seems clear to me that anyone who is 
critical of Canada's multicultural program is immediately 
labelled a racist. That is far too easy a way to avoid an issue. 
How can anyone debate an issue that from the onset has been 
reduced from an intellectual discussion to name calling? It is for 
this reason that I stand before my colleagues and challenge them 
to discuss the issue not on an emotional but rather on a rational 
intellectual level.
<P>
	Proponents of the multicultural program have also begun to 
view honest criticism as attacks, and critics as enemies. 
Multiculturalism is a vision that proceeds from differences, 
from that which separates, and disregards that which unites.
<P>
	Furthermore, in a survey conducted in 1991 Canadians were 
asked whether they approved or disapproved of government 
cancellation of multiculturalism funding which would force 
projects to be self-financed by the multicultural organizations 
themselves. Over two-thirds of all respondents approved and 45 
per cent of them strongly agreed that multiculturalism should be 
funded by the multicultural organizations themselves rather 
than the federal government.
<P>
	Because of time constraints I will only point out one of the 
measures in this act which is to provide support to individuals, 
groups or organizations for the purpose of preserving, 
enhancing and promoting multiculturalism in Canada. It is 
important to read a passage from a recent book written by Neil 
Bissoondath, an individual who immigrated to Canada from 
Trinidad. This book is called <I>Selling Illusions</I>. As Mr. 
Bissoondath illustrates quite clearly, one of the problems with 
the objectives of the multiculturalism act is:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-so it is with the ethnic cultures offered at the pavilions of Caravan and other 
such festivals; all the colourful ethnics bowing and smiling in a mechanical 
greeting gesture to all the tourists. They look like the real thing, but their smell 
is synthetic. They have no bite. They are safe. Culture Disneyfied.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is perhaps even more of a concern than the wastefulness 
of the $30 million we are presently spending on 
multiculturalism. In the divisive nature of this policy there is a 
notion or idea that we are discussing the creation of different 
laws for Canadians based only on ethnicity or culture. It is for 
this reason that the concept of multiculturalism through 
political cowardice and bureaucratic ineptitude and ethnic 
pressure has distorted federal policy beyond recognition.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7872"> 7872 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	For example the Liberals are presently reviewing a cultural 
defence which would allow someone whose culture or religion 
provides an escape from prosecution for something someone 
else of another culture would be prosecuted for. The cultural 
proposal leaves open the question of whether wife beating, 
violent discipline of children and polygamy are to be condoned 
according to culture. This issue raises questions once again: 
How do you define cultural background? Do you have to be from 
this culture? Do both your parents have to be from this culture?
<P>
	Another example would be the Ontario plan which would 
divert black youths from courts to community service work. 
Essentially this program would treat black youths differently 
from everyone else, even though there is no statistical evidence 
that black youths commit more crimes. The reason that data of 
crime by blacks in Canada is scant is that police departments do 
not generally keep race based figures. Why is that? Perhaps it is 
because our justice system in Canada is blind and should be 
blind to factors such as race or ethnicity.
<P>
	What happened to equality before the law? What happened to 
treating all Canadians the same regardless of race or ethnicity? 
Both of these examples are classic illustrations of 
multiculturalism run amok.
<P>
	What Canada needs is a government to lead by example. So 
give the people what they want. Scrap among other things the 
funding for multiculturalism. Send Bill C-53 back and replace it 
with a bill which has eliminated overlap and duplication as well 
as government waste.
<P>
	Multiculturalism works counter to unification. It pulls at the 
very fabric of this great nation. What we need is equality, not 
special treatment for different groups and individuals. There is 
nothing fundamentally wrong with multiculturalism, provided it 
is funded by the multicultural organizations themselves. 
However, this is not the case in Canada and the reality is that 
multiculturalism is nothing more than an abuse of our 
generosity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I listened with interest to my colleague from 
Edmonton-Strathcona. I suppose I should assure him right off 
the top that neither I nor my colleagues on this side have any 
intention of adopting Reform policies nor their manners I do not 
think.
<P>
	It is interesting that the member speaks about this policy and 
how it has been adopted from Reform and the next words out of 
his mouth are why it should be defeated. I am here to tell my 
colleagues and everyone else who are prepared to give me a fair 
hearing on both sides of the House why the bill should be 
supported.
<P>
	Let me assure the member there is precious little in the way of 
the philosophy of his party that we are interested in adopting. 
Indeed that is why we ran candidates in every part of this 
country, in every single province. We ignored no provinces to 
field candidates. I think my colleagues opposite have realized 
their error there and are about to attempt to rectify that. 
Canadians know and realize what is their one truly national 
party in the House. That was seen in the fact that there was only 
one party which elected members in every province coast to 
coast to coast.
<P>
	I am interested in explaining why I feel this is a very 
important bill that is worthy of support from those with open 
minds in all parts of the House.
<P>
	There are several purposes for Bill C-53. It seeks to establish 
by law the Department of Canadian Heritage. It sets out the 
powers, duties and functions of the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage. It would settle various technical matters relating to the 
establishment of the department and it would put in place the 
public service organizational structure formalizing the 
transition of employees. It would bring under one roof 
communications, cultural industries, official and heritage 
languages, national parks and historic sites, voluntary action, 
multiculturalism, state, ceremonial and amateur sport.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	In other words, the bill would provide a much better 
co-ordination and integration of several important functions. It 
would seek to streamline those functions and to carry them out 
more effectively and more efficiently. I think that is a goal that 
ought to be supported by members on all sides of the House, that 
we provide the services of government more effectively and 
more efficiently.
<P>
	I would hope that we would share that philosophy in all parts 
of the House. No, there are comments from members opposite in 
which we can see that because multiculturalism is part of this 
bill somehow it is not worthy of support. That is regrettable and 
it is simply un-Canadian.
<P>
	What does it mean to be a Canadian. I would encourage some 
of the members from the Reform Party, who are hollering out 
comments now during my speech, to take a look at the Canadian 
Coat of Arms. The concept that somehow this nation has ever 
been one sort of pure culture or one blended culture is absolutely 
and patented nonsense. The very Canadian Coat of Arms has 
emblazoned on it the symbols of four cultures. This nation has 
four founding races.
<P>
	I quite frankly think that many Canadians do not know that. I 
regret to say I suspect that some of my colleagues opposite are 
ignorant of the fact that there are four cultures that founded this 
country and they are very well depicted on the Canadian Coat of 
Arms.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7873"> 7873 </A></B>
<P>
	From 1867 by definition this nation has always been 
multicultural. By definition we have always had more than one 
culture. This bill seeks to recognize and to continue a very 
important fact about this nation which is obviously not 
appreciated by some of my colleagues opposite.
<P>
	In a word, this country represented a new nationalism, a 
blending of several cultures right from day one, with four 
founding cultures, with two dominant languages, and since 1867 
we have become even more multicultural. This is not something 
that started recently. Those who think that ought to read some 
Canadian history.
<P>
	Multiculturalism is not something new. It has existed right 
from the start of this country and it was enshrined in 1867 in the 
Constitution. As I have said several times, for those who care to 
look it is well depicted on our coat of arms. We are a polyglot 
nation. We are nation which draws from the strengths of people 
from around the world.
<P>
	I hear members on all sides of the House speaking with 
accents from various parts of the world. Although I may 
disagree with their philosophy on certain things, I am proud to 
hear their accents. Nothing shows more graphically that we are a 
nation which draws from the peoples of the globe. There is no 
country made up of as many cultures of this world as Canada. 
That is something of which we ought to be proud. It is something 
which makes us uniquely Canadian.
<P>
	Frankly that is the Canadian identity, that we are a nation 
which was founded with four cultures, two official languages, 
but has been generous enough since 1867 to open its doors to the 
peoples from around the world. They are literally flocking to 
Canada and that is the strength of this country.
<P>
	That is why my colleague from Edmonton-Strathcona has no 
fear that we are stealing the Reform policy. Unfortunately my 
understanding of those members' policies is that they do not 
recognize that as a strength. That is a very basic strength of this 
country. Perhaps it is our greatest strength as a nation.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	The fact that Canadian culture will continue to drive our 
economy even more in the future as we enter an era of 
globalization of trade ought to be something which is seen by 
anyone who cares to take a look at the facts of the case.
<P>
	A very dominant economic activity all over the world as we 
enter the 21st century is tourism. I do not think as Canadians we 
recognize that fact enough or that we do enough to capitalize on 
it. We are starting to address that and this government hopes to 
make it a key priority.
<P>
	The fact that we can draw from people around the world to 
come and visit their friends and family who are living in Canada 
ought to make us a leader in world tourism if we are prepared to 
see our multicultural character as a strength and not somehow as 
a liability,  which I hear far too often in this House. It 
disappoints me to hear it no matter where it comes from.
<P>
	Of course all of these changes are to be pursued within the 
ambit of fiscal responsibility. Canadians know that this 
government is committed to fiscal responsibility in all areas of 
federal endeavour. They can be assured that Bill C-53 is 
consistent with that objective and therefore with the 
comprehensive review of the federal government programs now 
underway.
<P>
	Our government appreciates that there are some concerns 
about the decision to divide responsibility between broadcasting 
and telecommunications, between Canadian heritage and 
Industry Canada. There are valid reasons for that. The inclusion 
of telecommunications in the Department of Industry's portfolio 
recognizes the increasing role of the economy.
<P>
	On the other hand, broadcasting has a tremendous impact on a 
country like Canada with the enormous geography we are 
blessed with and yet with a population only 10 per cent the size 
of that of our American neighbour. Broadcasting is vital in this 
country. We have to be very vigilant to make sure that it 
promotes Canadian culture at all times and that we not allow it to 
be dominated by the American broadcasting networks. 
Therefore it rightly belongs in the Canadian Heritage 
Department where this bill will have it housed.
<P>
	The department is active in promoting Canadian identity in 
several major areas: natural and physical heritage, official 
languages, amateur sport, community support and participation 
and also the management of cultural development and means of 
communication.
<P>
	We have 36 national parks in this country, many of them 
beautiful parks in our western provinces, but also in every 
province one would care to name. Surely we want to promote 
that. We have nine historic canals and four marine areas located 
throughout Canada. We are a nation with three oceans.
<P>
	We will soon be celebrating the 75th anniversary of Parks 
Canada. Canada's parks generate an annual revenue of over $1 
billion, providing jobs for roughly 30,000 Canadians.
<P>
	In the area of official languages, amateur sport, community 
support and participation, that in itself is a mouthful to say. 
Obviously one can see what tremendously important areas that 
encompasses. We are a nation of tremendous cultural diversity, 
of multiculturalism. It is a strength and it ought to be built on.
<P>
	I will refer to the area of sport with which I am most familiar. 
When we send Olympic athletes to represent this country, they 
represent this country. They are not hung up on whether they are 
French Canadian, English Canadian, whether they are from 
Alberta or Ontario. They represent Canada and they win medals 
as Canadians. That is seen very clearly in the sport of ice hockey 
where we have tremendous excellence and really lead the world 
in that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7874"> 7874 </A></B>
<P>
	I recall the very famous goal, probably the most famous goal 
scored in hockey, the Paul Henderson goal; Henderson scoring 
from a French Canadian named Cournoyer and from an Italian 
Canadian named Esposito.
<P>
	They are three Canadians who very proudly helped to defeat 
the Russians and to show Canadian excellence in hockey. That is 
the kind of teamwork we need in this country, all cultures 
working together, our multiculturalism seen as an asset, not as 
some kind of liability. Some groups get very hung up on the fact 
that we may be encouraging these cultures to hang on to what is 
important to them.
<P>
	I am a father of three children and many of my colleagues here 
are parents. It is possible for me to be what I am, a Canadian of 
Irish extraction. I am very proud of it. I was raised to celebrate 
that fact. Also I am very proud of the fact that I am a Canadian.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	It is equally possible to be proud of two things at the same 
time. They are not mutually exclusive and I do not understand 
the very narrow minded approach that I hear from members 
opposite that somehow one cannot be proud of those two facts at 
the same time. It is to be pitied.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-53, whose 
purpose is to establish the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	I would like to take a few minutes to comment on the mandate 
of the future Department of Canadian Heritage, especially its 
wording reveals something very disturbing about the future of 
Canada. It says: the mandate of the Department of Canadian 
Heritage, and I will read the entire text. My source is a document 
released by the Liberal government, which means that we can 
hardly question its authority. It says: the mandate of the future 
department is to create and promote among Canadians a 
profound sense of identity and belonging, based on bilingualism 
and biculturalism. It also says a little further on that the 
department's objective is to develop and implement programs 
that support a very clear sense of identity among Canadians.
<P>
	The first two words of this mandate raise some questions 
about the purpose of, or even the need for this department, since 
``susciter'' implies there is no sense of identity or belonging, 
according to the text.
<P>
	Before my speech, I checked the <I>Petit Robert</I>, a dictionary 
whose authority one would also hesitate to question, and its 
definition of the verb <I>susciter</I> is to give rise to a feeling or idea. 
This is exactly the mandate of the Department of Canadian 
Heritage. To give rise to something implies that it does not exist.
<P>
	It is rather odd that after 125 years, we have a government that 
creates a department of Canadian Heritage and admits in the 
department's mandate that a sense of identity or belonging does 
not exist. They are right, because what does exist in Canada is 
two identities. We have the existence of a very special and very 
obvious identity in Quebec, the francophone identity, which is 
open to all communities and provides that everyone who so 
wishes has an opportunity to develop his potential and live in 
harmony with everyone else.
<P>
	There is also the anglophone identity, which is found mostly 
outside Quebec and which also is open to people of all 
nationalities, respecting their own cultural identity, while 
giving them an opportunity to grow in this country called 
Canada.
<P>
	So it is entirely correct that this mandate should say and admit 
that a Canadian culture as such, of which all Canadians would be 
a part, including Quebecers, does not exist.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	During this debate, I would like to see the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage tell us which values are shared throughout 
Canada, that is in Quebec as in the rest of the country. This is my 
first comment.
<P>
	On the face of it, I say that the mandate of the Department of 
Canadian Heritage is in fact to promote the values of this 
government, as opposed to the values of Canadians and 
Quebecers. In my view, that makes it a department of 
propaganda. We have known for decades that the federal 
government views culture in Canada, and particularly in 
Quebec, only in terms of bilingualism and multiculturalism.
<P>
	Yet, there are dozens of countries where people are bilingual 
but still preserve their own identity. If you ask French people 
who can speak several languages such as English and Spanish 
what is their primary culture, they will spontaneously say that it 
is the French one. As well, I have yet to meet an American who 
would question his identity. It is a clear and simple reality which 
helps respect those who do not think like us and who do not share 
the same cultural background.
<P>
	I also want to say that, traditionally, the federal government 
and other institutions such as the Supreme Court have always 
reduced, if not eliminated, Quebec's power over its own culture. 
Let me just mention communications, which is a vital sector for 
culture. Over the years, three decisions have been made by the 
Supreme Court which, as everyone knows and as former Quebec 
premier Maurice Duplessis used to say, ``always leans on the 
same side''. The first decision, in the late thirties, confirmed 
that broadcasting fell under federal jurisdiction. The second 
one, in 1974, had to do with cable television, while the most 
recent one, in 1994, concerned telephony. The end result is that 
Quebec is excluded from the communications sector, which is 
an essential and strategic tool for Quebecers' future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7875"> 7875 </A></B>
<P>
	I think I have one minute remaining on my speaking time. I 
would like to conclude by taking a look at the people who head 
these institutions, and the Minister of Canadian Heritage in 
particular, the hon. member for Laval West who, I think 
everyone will agree, is a very nice guy, but does not hesitate to 
impose his views on organizations under his jurisdiction. Just 
think back to recent events; these past few weeks, in fact during 
two weeks, the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party have been 
asking for the resignation of the heritage minister for having 
interceded with the CRTC on behalf of his constituents.
<P>
	During two whole weeks, during question period, the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Reform Party raised repeatedly with the 
Prime Minister the need for the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
to resign for having interfered with a quasi-judicial 
organization which is in fact the equivalent of a tribunal. One 
can wonder what this minister will be able to do, in Quebec in 
particular, with his propaganda department come the day when 
the people of Quebec will decide their future.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	One last point. This minister will find strong support within 
his caucus. Let me name two supporters. First, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs and member for Papineau-Saint-Michel, who 
is remembered in Quebec in particular for the statement he made 
in 1977 about the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation which, to 
my mind, is certainly one of the most prominent cultural 
diffusion vehicles in Quebec. With the prospect of the 1980 
referendum in mind, he said he did not want to see the French 
network of the CBC take a neutral stand in presenting both sides 
of the issue, adding that at the time of the referendum, CBC 
employees would be expected to be unequivocally on the 
pro-Canada side.
<P>
	Recently, the Prime Minister himself said that the operation 
of the CBC was governed by an act under which it was required 
to make the benefits of living in Canada known. That is what the 
CBC was established for, he said.
<P>
	The message is clear, and we are perfectly justified in being 
concerned about the establishment of this department.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Saint John- Veterans affairs.
<P>
	Resuming debate. The hon. member for 
Victoria-Haliburton.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a great pleasure to rise today to join the debate and 
once again speak in support of Bill C-53, an act to establish the 
Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Bill C-53 must be recognized as part of a greater 
reorganization of government. This reorganization will allow 
for a more efficient organizational structure in the department 
which in the long run will prove of greater benefit to the 
Canadian taxpayer, something all of us should be in favour of.
<P>
	Although this department had its beginning under the 
previous government in June 1993, the current government of 
which I am a member has improved the department markedly. I 
am pleased to say these improvements are reflected in many 
accomplishments of the department in the past year in the area 
of heritage conservation, official languages, national parks and 
amateur sports to name a few.
<P>
	With this in mind, the government is now proceeding with the 
task of confirming the reorganization of the Department of 
Canadian Heritage to better serve all Canadians. I believe it is 
important to remember that this department serves a large group 
of Canadians, not special interest groups as some members 
across the floor have criticized. The department serves national 
parks across the country, amateur sports across the country, 
heritage sites across the country and numerous cultural exhibits 
across the country. It is truly a national department dealing with 
Canadians from coast to coast to coast.
<P>
	In my riding of Victoria-Haliburton in Ontario I think of the 
Trent-Severn waterway system which has transported millions 
of people in the last 100 years. It allows users to travel from 
Trenton to Georgian Bay on a heritage waterway system. In 
particular, each summer as a direct result of the commitment to 
heritage by this department, I see the operation of a blacksmith 
shop along the Rideau Canal system which stretches from 
Kingston to Ottawa and contains numerous heritage locks. This 
operation shows the importance of heritage and history in 
Canada. Add to that the diligent work and commitment of the 
department in the Trent-Severn and Rideau Canal systems and 
its important heritage will be preserved for future generations.
<P>
	Culturally, certain members opposite argue that if the free 
market does not support certain types of art then they should not 
be produced. There are many examples of experimental or 
cutting edge art which appear on display in our National Gallery 
here in Ottawa. Once again some members opposite see no 
bottom line need for these pieces of art when in fact some of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7876"> 7876 </A></B>
<P>
art is worth considerably more now than the original purchase 
price. Art cannot be judged quickly or haphazardly.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Upon close examination and as a direct result of the 
department Canadian cultural industries have grown over 40 per 
cent from 1988 to 1992 when other industries saw their revenue 
and sales drop. In large part this is due to the benefits of 
programs like those for sound recordings, postal subsidies for 
book publishers, as well as film and video departments. As a 
matter of fact from 1987 to 1992 in Ontario alone the export of 
critically acclaimed books by Canadian writers increased about 
70 per cent.
<P>
	In addition, because the cultural industries rely so much on 
innovation and technology the jobs they create are of high skill, 
long duration and high value. Award winning books and movies, 
commercially successful theatre productions, million copy 
selling records and production facilities that attract 
international film producers are some of the areas in which 
Canada has become highly successful. All of these successes are 
signs of creative cultural industries that are increasing and 
growing each year. With those increases have come successful 
jobs and businesses for Canadians.
<P>
	Canada's multiculturalism policy has the noble aim of 
promoting equal opportunity for all Canadians to participate in 
the social, cultural, economic and political life of our great 
nation. I would also like to encourage some members opposite to 
become aware and consult with those Canadians who are 
grateful for the multiculturalism policy and its benefits.
<P>
	Our multiculturalism policy is an effort by responsible 
government to help Canadians understand one another and 
develop tolerance. Diversity does not divide us; it can only 
enrich our society. It is important to remember that if Canada 
wants to remain competitive in an ever shrinking world, we must 
pool our resources of diverse cultures and people.
<P>
	I must commend the members opposite for their continued 
efforts to find something wrong with the department of heritage. 
It is apparent they cannot find anything. They cannot find 
anything new to say about the department until they read it in 
some newspaper. Perhaps they should concentrate on the fine 
effort put forth by the minister and his department as well as the 
policies and issues they manage. I believe if the members 
opposite focused on this instead of their theatrics, they would 
agree with me when I urge the passage of Bill C-53.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the House for the opportunity to address 
Bill C-53, an act to re-organize the Department of Canadian 
Heritage.
<P>
	I must confess I learn fascinating things when I come to the 
House and listen to some of the comments made by the members 
across the way. It was fortunate for the hon. member, and I have 
to be careful how I say this, that a couple of his colleagues came 
in to give him some support, otherwise it would have been 
worked pretty thin.
<P>
	I found out that there are four founding cultures in Canada. 
That is very interesting. I wonder if they all happened to set foot 
on Canada's soil at the same time, or whether they came in from 
four corners and met in the middle. It sounds rather odd. I found 
out that if we did not have a massive Department of Canadian 
Heritage we would not have heritage locks in the member's 
riding. That was quite enlightening, I must admit.
<P>
	What we really need to do is rethink the very reason for the 
existence of this ministry rather than talk about some tinkering 
or on some reorganization of the department and the ministry.
<P>
	Earlier I believe my colleague from Edmonton-Strathcona 
referred to Neil Bissoondath and made some remarks on Mr. 
Bissoondath's position on multiculturalism. I cannot remember 
if he quoted from his book or not, but I came across an editorial 
dealing with Mr. Bissoondath's latest book.
<P>
	The editorial was written in the <I>Vancouver Sun</I> published on 
November 14. I would like to bring this to the attention of the 
House. To my knowledge this was not written by a Reform Party 
member but it quite closely shadows the position taken by 
Reform on multiculturalism. If I have some time remaining I 
would also like to bring a few other issues to the attention of the 
House, but the editorial in the <I>Vancouver Sun</I> reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Neil Bissoondath's latest book, a non-fiction examination of the federal 
multiculturalism policy, is provoking timely discussion of both the merits and 
the cost of the policy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Bissoondath, a Canadian who originated in Trinidad, argues that the 
policy does not promote understanding and acceptance but instead underscores 
differences and thereby divides Canadians. Is he right? Is the multiculturalism 
department of the Canadian heritage ministry doing more harm than good, and 
would the $26 million spent annually on grants be better used to reduce the 
deficit?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	It sounds a bit like a Reformer asking these questions but it is 
the Vancouver <I>Sun</I>. It would be foolish to chuck 
multiculturalism on the mistaken notion that it exists to finance 
folk-dancing jamborees. Some money may still find its way 
there but much of it provides substantial support to immigrants 
trying to fit into Canadian society.
<P>
	There is support for ethnic communities struggling with 
intergenerational conflict for seminars to examine family 
violence and for cross-cultural training for institutions like the 
police.
<P>
	While these aspects of the policy seem to attract support for 
many immigrants and other Canadians, the downside worries 
some of them. For Mr. Bissoondath, the downside is the 
weakening of the Canadian fabric as newcomers are stuck with 
hyphenated labels and end up neither simply Canadian nor 
whatever they were before they came here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7877"> 7877 </A></B>
<P>
	Some immigrants describe the downside in terms of stolen 
dignity. Others argue that the policy ghettoizes newcomers 
instead of encouraging them to develop loyalty to their new 
land. On the basis of what immigrants themselves are saying, it 
seems clear that the policy, now more than 20 years old, is due 
for an overhaul. It does not say a reorganization. It says an 
overhaul.
<P>
	The financial crunch provides another reason for an 
examination of the multiculturalism program just as it does in 
the case of the Canada Council with its $98 million budget this 
year, amateur sport with $64 million, Advocacy for Women $8 
million and so on.
<P>
	On a per capita basis, multicultural grants cost each Canadian 
less than $1. Some of the projects seem worth much more than 
$1 but in other cases $1 is too much. Why is any money spent on 
poster and button campaigns against racism or on teaching 
Armenian?
<P>
	If Armenians or any ethnic group wants their kids to be able to 
speak their language, they should find the money for it in their 
own pockets. Government funding for this kind of language 
training speaks to Mr. Bissoondath's point about the policy's 
role in fragmenting Canadians by giving groups a heightened 
sense of their own ethnicity.
<P>
	It also confirms native Canadians in their disinclination to 
embrace immigrants as full citizens. We do not suggest that 
Canada should opt for the U.S. style melting pot, but our 
cherished mosiac feels a bit battered. It is time to rethink 
multiculturalism, its purpose, effects and costs in dollars and 
cents.
<P>
	Thanks to Mr. Bissoondath, whose foreign roots make him 
uniquely qualified to debate multiculturalism, it is now on the 
agenda along with everything else. I concur in the thought that 
this ministry needs to be rethought rather than reorganized.
<P>
	When I spoke to amendments to the bill I talked about the 
dozens of agencies and organizations that answer to the Ministry 
of Canadian Heritage. They range from the CBC to the museums 
and multicultural programs. I cannot help but wonder if many of 
these institutions could better serve Canadians from the private 
sector or whether they should have their funding reduced or 
eliminated altogether. Perhaps their functions could be better 
performed within other departments and under other ministries.
<P>
	For example, I believe we could seriously consider cutting all 
the funding to institutions such as the status of women in Canada 
and, as I mentioned earlier, multicultural grants.
<P>
	Another area where federal spending is unnecessary is on 
official languages. Why do we need an official languages 
commissioner? By making this a responsibility of the provinces 
and private organizations, more relevant service can be 
delivered with considerable savings to the federal treasury.
<P>
	Under the Department of Canadian Heritage we have a 
National Battlefields Commission. I am sure that the forming of 
that is necessary, but perhaps it could fall under the jurisdiction 
of the defence department if there was no Canadian heritage 
ministry.
<P>
	Then we have the Race Relations Foundation. It sounds like 
perhaps there may be some justification in that. It is hard to say 
but if there is perhaps that would fit under justice. Certainly it 
seems odd that we would want to indicate that race relations 
were part of our Canadian heritage. It almost has a negative 
connotation. It is not something we want to be part of our 
heritage but if there is a problem, it is something we want to fix.
<P>
	The Public Service Commission might more appropriately 
fall under the jurisdiction of the Treasury Board.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	There are perhaps some things we should do with the CBC. If 
you asked the average Canadian what they saw as the most 
outstanding example of Canadian heritage I wonder whether 
they might talk about our people and the qualities of our people, 
or whether they might talk about our environment and the 
wonderful land that we have. I doubt very many would point to 
the CBC, especially to Telefilm Canada and the National Film 
Board, which certainly could be merged and probably privatized 
at a great reduction in cost to Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	I hate to even mention this because it has been mentioned so 
many times, but the museums are funded by the Department of 
Canadian Heritage. I wonder if they could not possibly be 
privatized as well. Maybe then the people that enjoy these 
museums would find things that would cause them to want to 
come to the museum rather than be disturbed by what they saw 
in some of these museums. It certainly would eliminate some of 
the boondoggles like the current museum being built in the 
Prime Minister's riding, I would add again, at great cost to the 
taxpayers and a study indicating that this thing is doomed to 
failure.
<P>
	We find that after thoroughly and objectively reviewing all of 
the current responsibilities of the agencies of the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage that this minister may not be required at all. 
It is possible that once all the unnecessary or obsolete spending 
is removed there will not be enough left to justify a ministry at 
all. Perhaps the remaining justifiable responsibilities could be 
provided by other ministries. We believe that this would provide 
some savings to Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	I will take just a couple of minutes in wrapping up to indicate 
what they might be. There could be one less car and driver for a 
minister. There could be one less big office with minister's staff. 
There could be one less multimillion dollar MP pension plan to 
pay out, topped up by taxpayers. There would be less chance of 
letters of intervention to the CRTC if we removed the Minister 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7878"> 7878 </A></B>
<P>
of Canadian Heritage. There would be less chance of  conflict of 
interest. The smaller the cabinet the less chance there would be 
of conflict of interest. There would be one less typical Liberal 
bigwig to worry about.
<P>
	I close by again saying let us rethink whether we even need a 
Department of Canadian Heritage, whether we would be better 
off in this country and have a better heritage if we had no 
Minister of Canadian Heritage. Let us rethink this whole thing 
rather than reorganize it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the reorganization proposed in Bill C-53 to make 
the Department of Canadian Heritage a promoter of Canadian 
culture from coast to coast is in fact a direct attack by the federal 
government on Quebec's specificity, in terms of its culture, 
language and cultural institutions.
<P>
	This is evidenced by the inclusion of the Canadian culture in 
Canada's new foreign policy and it demonstrates once again the 
growing desire of the federal government to marginalize 
Quebec's specificity by imposing an all encompassing Canadian 
multiculturalism. This desire was very clearly expressed by the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage in his speech on Bill C-53, when 
he said: ``We hope to rally the mighty forces of multiculturalism 
behind a cultural identity that is uniquely Canadian''.
<P>
	The objective is clear. Since the only references made in that 
speech to French culture in Canada concern the official 
languages and TV5, we have to conclude that the government 
feels it must absolutely manage to bring not only Quebec culture 
but also native culture into the supposedly ideal context of 
multiculturalism, considering the ever present and ever 
powerful American culture.
<P>
	In such a context, you can easily imagine that the Official 
Opposition feels it would be suicidal to support Bill C-53.
<P>
	In spite of the noble statements made by the minister, a man of 
letters if there ever was, how can the Canadian Parliament not be 
concerned to see today's culture, including our authors and 
creative artists-what I would call heritage in the making-be 
considered like an industry such as steel, footwear or poultry?
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	For example, who will have the last word on the review of the 
Copyright Act? The Minister of Industry or the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage? Chances are that the Minister of Industry 
will keep the powers already vested in him, since nothing in Bill 
C-53 clearly states how responsibilities are to be divided 
between the two departments.
<P>
	Here is another example that should ring an alarm bell in this 
House. Thanks to the information highway, communications 
will soon reach a speed of Mach 2. Is it reasonable to reduce the 
whole issue to the marketing of fibre optics?
<P>
	Yet, that is the conclusion we must reach since the Minister of 
Industry will be the one in charge. They are thus refusing to 
admit that the major technological revolution generated by the 
information highway will no doubt transform global culture 
quickly and dramatically.
<P>
	It is often said that war is too serious to be left to generals. 
Could it be that a society's culture is too precious to be left to 
technocrats and businessmen?
<P>
	I think that Quebec culture is too precious to be left in the 
hands of the federal government. The state of Quebec must be 
the only authority responsible for Quebec culture.
<P>
	Quebec's historical demands in the field of culture have 
always been based on the recognition of its specific identity and 
on the desire of the Quebec government to be the only one in 
charge of promoting and defending Quebec culture. Examples of 
this political will are not lacking. In 1966, at a meeting on 
Canada's tax system, Premier Johnson said that Quebec must be 
the master of its decisions concerning cultural development.
<P>
	In 1969, Premier Bertrand said that cultural affairs were in 
Quebec's jurisdiction. In 1973, under Robert Bourassa, Quebec 
wanted to take back control of all cultural policy, including the 
federal funding for it. In 1976, Quebec proposed that each 
province alone legislate on issues concerning the arts, literature 
and cultural heritage.
<P>
	More recently, in 1991, the Bélanger-Campeau Commission 
mentioned the need for Quebec to have exclusive jurisdiction 
and responsibility for social, economic and cultural 
development. The same year, the Arpin Report, commissioned 
by the Quebec government at that time, said this: ``We can 
conclude that overlap between the two levels of government 
clearly exists in terms of structures, programs, target groups and 
even legislation and fiscal measures. . . Harmonizing the action 
of the two levels of government has always been difficult. The 
federal government never wanted to recognize Quebec's 
precedence in cultural affairs''.
<P>
	For more than thirty years, the federal government, on the 
strength of its spending power, has meddled without any 
scruples in culture. The purpose of these incursions was clearly 
to downplay the impact of Quebec culture. The result has been to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7879"> 7879 </A></B>
<P>
promote duplication and overlap, while making the arts 
community dependent on federal largesse.
<P>
	The federal cultural offensive reflected in Bill C-53 is only 
the tip of the iceberg. Consider the report of the Special Joint 
Committee reviewing Canadian Foreign Policy, which confirms 
Ottawa's resolve to subject Quebec culture to federal standards.
<P>
	The dissenting report tabled by the Official Opposition 
condemns this attempt by the federal government to dilute 
Quebec's distinct identity by stirring it into a Canadian sauce of 
bilingualism and multiculturalism. Clearly, the sauce makes the 
dish.
<P>
	The Official Opposition maintains, and I quote: ``Where 
culture is concerned, the direction of Canada's foreign policy, as 
prescribed in the majority report, is based on the theory of a 
single nation, one single culture (so-called Canadian culture), 
and the resulting requirement that all the provinces must have 
equal status''.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	To the Official Opposition, it is clear that ``the principles of 
bilingualism and multiculturalism, which form the political 
bases for defining so-called Canadian culture, have the effect of 
denying the existence of Quebec culture, which is original and 
which developed essentially from its French origins, with 
contributions from the British, the aboriginal peoples and, more 
recently, the various immigrant communities''.
<P>
	Quebec will never let its culture be beholden to the federal 
government. The Official Opposition vigorously condemns this 
blatant attempt to make Quebec subject to federal dictates.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to address Bill C-53 once again. It is my pleasure to 
talk about the various aspects of the Department of Canadian 
Heritage and to suggest that what is really needed when we talk 
about this department is not just a superficial streamlining of the 
department but a complete overhaul starting with many of the 
departments that reside within the Department of Canadian 
Heritage, including specifically departments like 
multiculturalism, the Canada Council, the National Film Board, 
status of women, CBC and many more.
<P>
	Let me talk about some of these different departments on an 
individual basis and suggest that in some cases we could do 
completely without them.
<P>
	Let me talk first about the department of multiculturalism, 
something many Reformers have talked about already. Hon. 
members from across the way have suggested that if there were 
not a department of multiculturalism somehow there would be 
no multicultural diversity in Canada. That is a crazy notion.
<P>
	I remind members across the way that when we settled the 
west in this country we had cultures from all over the place. We 
did not need a department of multiculturalism. Those people had 
their own cultures, they preserved them with their own money, 
which is a  new concept for Liberals. It is something that is still 
done today. People do not need the government to tell them they 
need to preserve their culture. They will preserve their culture if 
they see fit with their own funds. That is what makes sense to 
most Canadians.
<P>
	For some reason this government has decided that some 
cultures are more deserving than others, that there should be a 
list of priorities in terms of cultures and that some groups should 
get money and others should be shut out. I think that is very 
divisive.
<P>
	I point out to the members across the way who have often said 
that Reformers offer no solutions on cutting spending, here is an 
area where we can cut spending, something like $21 million. We 
could cut it today, I would argue, and most Canadians would be 
very much in favour of it.
<P>
	I want to talk for a moment about some of the other problems 
with the department of multiculturalism. A minute ago I said 
that sometimes I think having a department of multiculturalism 
creates division. As an extension of that, not all behaviours are 
equal. Some cultures advocate types of behaviours that are 
clearly not supported by most Canadians. For instance, some 
cultures suggest that women should be somehow subservient 
and that they should play a lesser role. I do not agree with that.
<P>
	I think when we start to fund cultures and give people money 
to support cultures, it stops what has become a standard in 
Canada, sort of an ethical or moral standard from spreading into 
these other cultures where sometimes they do not treat people 
with respect on the basis of gender. That is something I very 
much oppose and I hope the government across the way would 
oppose as well. We can make the argument that the department 
of multiculturalism has outlived its usefulness.
<P>
	I would also argue that when we see things like what the 
justice minister proposed on the weekend or what came out of 
his department, that there be something like a culture defence in 
law, I think we can see the danger of this whole attitude toward 
setting up special status for certain cultures and what it can lead 
to, possibly opening up a Pandora's box.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	Thankfully Reformers were on guard for Canadians and 
quizzed the minister about this immediately. He backed away 
from it, and well he should have.
<P>
	It is not because they saw this was flawed from the outset. It 
was only because Reformers jumped up, raised the point and 
forced the minister to back down and hopefully we will always 
be there to do that.
<P>
	In the meantime we would certainly encourage the 
government members across the way to take another look at this 
whole department of multiculturalism and to acknowledge that 
this approach to governing can lead to division, can lead to some 
of these strange ideas in the justice system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7880"> 7880 </A></B>
<P>
	Another departmental organization that should be looked at in 
the Department of Canadian Heritage is the Canada Council. 
The Canada Council provides grants for all kinds of Canadian 
artists and people who should be and would be producing art 
anyway. We spend tens of millions of dollars through the Canada 
Council every year to pay people to produce what they at Canada 
Council call art.
<P>
	I would argue that before there was a Canada Council and in 
spite of the Canada Council people still create art. I know in my 
own riding there are many people who are painters, writers, who 
are thrilled to try to produce art not because they get paid to do it 
but because it is a creative impulse that they have. In order to 
satisfy that impulse they produce art and all of society is 
enriched for it.
<P>
	What I really like about it is taxpayers are not expected to pay 
for it. They are not expected to either fund the artist or to buy the 
art. Contrast that with the Canada Council where we have tens of 
millions of dollars going to publishers so that they can produce 
books from writers who are also funded and then of course they 
sit on shelves forever. I read a book actually that was funded by 
the Canada Council about the abuses in the Canada Council, 
believe it or not. It is a great irony that it is almost impossible to 
write a book in this country without it being funded by the 
Canada Council because those funds go directly to Canadian 
publishers. That is one of the strange ironies.
<P>
	This particular writer talked about a warehouse being devoted 
to all these volumes of Canadian literature that people simply 
would not buy. They could not even give it away.
<P>
	When they proposed to send packages of Canadian literature 
around to schools, even to prisons, they were rejected. I suspect 
rightfully so because at the end of the day beauty is in the eye of 
the beholder and people have to make these judgments for 
themselves.
<P>
	I think that is the best argument of all for not having an 
organization like the Canada Council that completely distorts 
the marketplace and really cheapens the product because many 
very good Canadian writers are lumped together with the ones 
who are not very good. In the eyes of people who try to follow 
this they get a jaundiced view of Canadian culture because so 
much stuff comes out that is not good. It is funded by the 
government and people get a jaundiced view and at some point 
say perhaps all Canadian culture is not very good. That is very 
unfortunate. There is a lot of good stuff out there. Because of 
organizations like the Canada Council people get a prejudiced 
view of what we can produce in this country. That is very 
unfortunate.
<P>
	Another institution that causes people to wonder about the 
government's spending of tax dollars is the National Film 
Board. My colleagues from the Reform Party in this House have 
raised the issue of a series of videos funded by the National Film 
Board on lesbian love. They were restricted videos, ones that 
contained very explicit scenes. This causes us to pause and 
wonder whether this government is serious really about cutting 
spending at all.
<P>
	There are many millions of dollars spent by the National Film 
Board every year. Should there not be some strict guidelines that 
that say anything that is pornographic in nature or is x-rated 
should not be produced particularly with taxpayers' dollars 
when so many taxpayers would reject that?
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	That is not what the Liberals think. It begs the larger question 
of whether there should even be a National Film Board. It seems 
to be largely unaccountable.
<P>
	I would argue that many private producers of films would love 
to step in and provide films for schools as is done actually in the 
United States. I had a lady in my own riding who came to me and 
said she would like to show National Geographic films in the 
school. She wanted to know how she could go about getting the 
rights to them. As it turns out it actually offers these to schools 
for free. The National Geographic Society is a society that is 
funded by individuals, not by taxpayers. Why could that not 
happen in this country? I would argue very strongly that it could.
<P>
	Let us talk for a moment about the department for the status of 
women also under the aegis of the Department of Canadian 
Heritage. One of the jobs it has it seems unfortunately is to fund 
private interests including the National Action Committee on 
the Status of Women, a group that is highly politicized, very 
narrow in its focus and absolutely and completely does not 
represent the views of all Canadian women no matter what it 
tells us. If it is so certain of its position, if it really does believe 
that it represents Canadian women then it should go to Canadian 
women and get its funding from them directly. I would 
absolutely support it in doing that.
<P>
	At this point in this country when we are in such a terrible 
fiscal situation I encourage the government to take a look at the 
complete Department of Canadian Heritage to seriously 
evaluate whether we need great gobs of that department and to 
really finally get its fiscal house in order.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I realize 
I have only a few minutes. I have the pleasure to rise to speak for 
the second time on Bill C-53, An Act to establish the 
Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7881"> 7881 </A></B>
<P>
	When I first spoke on this bill, I pointed out that this 
department was a ``grab bag'' with a hodge-podge of programs, 
as a result of dividing up responsibilities and bringing together 
parts of federal departments.
<P>
	I also stressed the very relative political say of the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage as compared to the real power of the Minister 
of Industry who would hold the purse strings.
<P>
	I ended my remarks by denouncing the fact that the existence 
of Quebec's culture was completely ignored since the bill was 
totally silent on it. And finally, I noted the unfair treatment 
given by management to the French network of the CBC as 
compared to its English counterpart, mentioning that many 
regional stations had to shut down.
<P>
	In this respect, in a brief submitted to the Standing Committee 
on Canadian Heritage, Mrs. France Dauphin, from the coalition 
for the defence of the French network of the CBC, raised a 
number of issues. For example, investment in programs per hour 
of broadcast time has increased by approximately $7,000 as far 
as the English network is concerned, but only marginally in the 
case of the French network. In just five years, from 1987 to 
1992, investment rose from $30,500 to $37,500 at the CBC 
while rising from $17,500 to $18,300 at SRC. In other words, a 
mere five per cent increase for the French network, as compared 
to a 20 per cent increase for the English network.
<P>
	I want to go back to an important aspect of this bill, namely 
the sharing of responsibilities. In our opinion, this legislation 
reflects a firm desire to make this department a tool of 
promotion, if not propaganda, for Canadian multiculturalism.
<P>
	As for the management of this new department, I agree with 
the comments made by the member for Calgary Southeast to the 
effect that there is no management strategy or plan. However, I 
would say that the Liberals are ``seemingly'' giving the 
Department of Canadian Heritage very extensive powers, and in 
that sense we have every reason to question the rather 
mysterious mandate of this new department.
<P>
	For example, why maintain this artificial sharing of culture 
and communications technology? This dichotomy was created 
by the Conservatives with culture and the management of the 
cultural industry.
<P>
	The fact is that the Minister of Canadian Heritage is only left 
with responsibility for cultural content, while the Minister of 
Industry is responsible for the means of communication. In 
other words, he is the one who has real control.
<P>
	Moreover, the Minister of Industry managed to set up a 
consultative committee on the electronic highway. This is 
another example of overlapping, duplication and lack of 
co-ordination within the federal administration itself. The 
telecommunications and cable television industries are 
converging on this new department of Industry and this is a 
source of concern to us because it may have a  bearing on the 
Canadian content, which falls under the jurisdiction of the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	The fact is that real power over Canadian culture is in the 
hands of the Minister of Industry. Moreover, by granting the 
CRTC exclusive power to set the rules governing 
telecommunications in Canada, Ottawa downplays Quebec's 
interests and puts them on a par with those of the industry and 
consumer groups, which goes totally against Quebec's 
traditional claims.
<P>
	Finally, let us not forget that Quebec was excluded from the 
broadcasting and cable television sector in 1974, and then the 
telephony sector in June 1993, at the expense of the CRTC which 
was granted extensive regulatory powers, thus confirming 
Ottawa's control over the whole telecommunications industry.
<P>

	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-249, an act to amend the Citizenship Act (right to 
citizenship), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, it is a great privilege for me to rise in 
the House today to speak on behalf of my private member's Bill 
C-249, an act to amend the Citizenship Act concerning the right 
to citizenship.
<P>
	The bill amends the Citizenship Act so that a child who is born 
in Canada after December 31, 1994 will not have Canadian 
citizenship if at the time of his birth neither of his parents is a 
citizen or a permanent resident. However such a child will be 
granted citizenship when one of his parents becomes a citizen or 
a permanent resident and an application to that effect is made by 
the authorized person on behalf of the child.
<P>
	This matter relates to concerns from my own constituency of 
Port Moody-Coquitlam and was further underlined in 
discussion as a member of the citizenship and immigration 
committee. Current events and policy descriptions made me 
increasingly aware of the weaknesses of and the necessity for 
change within the immigration system in Canada. Along with 
many other Canadians I can no longer passively accept the 
choices made for us by governments whose agenda for 
establishing policy in this area is dictated not by the realities of 
our country but too often by political and special interest 
agendas.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7882"> 7882 </A></B>
<P>
	Canada's immigration and citizenship policies must work for 
the benefit of both the country and the new Canadian. It is of 
utmost important that both interests be served. Policies that hurt 
the country hurt the future of all citizens of that country.
<P>
	It is from this conviction that Reform's policy springs. In 
order for the country to best serve the interests of both new 
Canadians and the Canadian born, the economic needs of the 
country must be given highest priority when setting targets and 
policy for immigration. We must come down hard on criminal 
abuse and put the safety of the Canadian community as the 
uppermost priority. We must deal with the reality that Canada 
has one of the most open immigration policies in the western 
world, in fact all the world, and that very openness has led to 
some of the worst abuses.
<P>
	Where does the issue of my private member's bill fit into all 
this? Because of our open and subsequently abused immigration 
policy, especially in the area of visitors' visas and refugee 
claimants, the pride of citizenship in Canada may be the 
casualty. We have developed a category of citizenship by 
convenience for those who can easily circumvent the system.
<P>
	Visitors can take advantage of citizenship of convenience. 
They can arrive with the sole purpose of having their child born 
in Canada to have Canadian citizenship. On our present visitor 
applications no questions are asked about such medical 
conditions. Visitors can stay in Canada for up to six months and 
need only legitimize their stay by naming a contact they wish to 
visit, or even the fact they have travelled before and have not yet 
visited Canada. There is an agreement that they will not work 
and must guarantee that they will return to their home country.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	The system is established on the basis of trust and honesty and 
in turn Canada's hospitality has been abused. The possibility for 
an actual citizenship by birth industry becomes obvious where a 
fee for service is demanded for accommodations and 
arrangements for childbirth in Canada.
<P>
	Under the present rules for a visitor who has a child born in 
Canada the child automatically becomes a Canadian citizen. Let 
us take, for example, the issue of the so-called passport babies 
reported in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> in November 1993. They reported 
that the number of babies born to non-resident mothers in B.C. 
has been between 246 and 333 a year for the last three years 
according to B.C.'s vital statistics division. These numbers may 
be much higher as they do not take into account those maternity 
cases that only appear to be resident because of a B.C. address 
on their hospital records.
<P>
	The Toronto <I>Sun</I> in January of this year reported that there 
were about 400 such births of non-residents last year in Canada. 
It reported that immigration officials find the trend disturbing 
and are now calling for changes to ensure the parent is either a 
citizen or a landed  immigrant. The United States and Britain are 
clamping down on the practice and are tightening up their 
citizenship laws. One immigration worker was quoted in the 
article as saying that it was like buying Canadian citizenship 
when these mothers came here for the sole purpose of having 
their children born here.
<P>
	The potential for abuse is wide open on this issue. It concerns 
all of us who place pride of ownership in the citizenship we hold 
so dear. The citizenship of convenience is available to those who 
are able to afford it by personally paying the cost of $1,500 a day 
for hospital coverage as well as the cost of staying in Canada for, 
say, a month previous to the birth. In other words Canadian 
citizenship can be bought for the price of $30,000. Here is yet 
another privilege for the wealthy and their provision for the 
future of their children. Might I add it may not have been such a 
great coincidence that the first child born in Vancouver in 1994 
was to a mother without any permanent status in Canada.
<P>
	I conducted a telephone poll in my riding of Port 
Moody-Coquitlam this spring on the issue of whether or not 
legislation should be introduced. Over two-thirds of the 
respondents said that the act must be changed to stop this type of 
abuse and the trivializing of Canadian citizenship.
<P>
	Why is it important that Canadian citizenship not be given out 
so freely? Why should those who are born here, regardless of 
their parents' status or their intention to stay in the country, be 
deemed Canadian? As I have examined the issue it has become 
increasingly clear to me that there are very real consequences 
that relate to the very rights and privileges of citizenship we as 
Canadians hold dear.
<P>
	Citizenship should come not only with a list of rights. It 
should also come with responsibilities which help make us 
better citizens and our country one of the very best to live in. 
This sentiment was repeated time and time again in the spring of 
this year as the citizenship and immigration committee 
conducted hearings on possible amendments to the act. It was on 
my initiative that the committee pursued the issue of citizenship 
of convenience by birth, and the committee unanimously agreed 
with the proposals.
<P>
	New Canadians seldom take their place in Canada for granted. 
The freedoms we enjoy and the wealth and beauty of the land 
should make us all uniquely proud to be Canadians, but the pride 
in the land comes from participation and shared responsibilities 
for the future of our families and our communities.
<P>
	As another witness so eloquently put it, nationhood is built 
around shared values, a shared history, indeed a shared 
commitment to the country. This calls for responsible 
interaction and a commitment to being in this country. It is a 
willingness to become part of the community and to be 
committed to the pursuit of learning together what it takes to 
make the country great.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7883"> 7883 </A></B>
<P>
	In the case of passport babies there is no commitment to the 
country and there is no fulfilment of the responsibilities of 
citizenship. There is no growing up in the country or 
understanding what it takes to be a good citizen. There is no 
commitment to the country until the child possibly chooses to 
return at, say, age 18. Is the original motive simply to sponsor 
their parents when they arrive? The whole essence of the 
intrinsic value of citizenship is rendered meaningless and in the 
long term society is not strengthened or furthered in its 
advancement in terms of the contribution of its members.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore at any point in time as a citizen that child is 
entitled, after a minimal residency requirement, to complete 
medical coverage and full education rights as well as all other 
Canadian social programs. In the extreme case these children 
could grow up to a life of crime in their home country and then 
decide to come to Canada. Because of their birthright 
citizenship, there would be nothing we could do to prevent them 
from coming here even though it would be obvious they would 
not share the values or responsibilities we cherish.
<P>
	For those whose parents use our freely given citizenship as 
only a means of security or convenience in the future there is no 
shared contract or demonstration that they are committed to our 
country. It is a convenient and easily obtained commodity for 
the future value it may hold. This is a flagrant abuse of the 
generous visitor system.
<P>
	Preservation of the integrity of Canadian citizenship became 
part of another consideration within the refugee determination 
system. The complexity of the system in our country has led to 
abuse by those who make refugee claims as a means of 
circumventing the immigration system. We have created an 
inland refugee system in Canada where the process of 
determining the claim of status can take up to three or four years 
before a final decision is rendered. During that period life goes 
on and of course babies are born.
<P>
	How can a rejected refugee claimant be asked to leave in a 
final determination when one or two children born here in 
Canada have citizenship? Those rendering the decision must 
take into account the fact that the children are Canadian and are 
entitled to all the accompanying rights and privileges of 
Canadian citizenship.
<P>
	Let us examine for a moment the process so we can appreciate 
the factors that go into the delay that creates the dilemma. First, 
let us consider a bogus refugee claimant, an individual with 
absolutely no right to legal status but with intent to use the 
system. He or she is interviewed by a senior immigration officer 
to assess grounds for a claim. They are given at least one month 
to supply supporting data and more time is often requested. 
Most would have no such original documentation with them so 
they must create it.
<P>
	They are also entitled to legal representation. On request legal 
aid will be provided to them. At that stage those claimants who 
fall into predefined categories are given an expedited hearing. 
All applicants are provided with a scenario for the qualifying 
categories of expedited hearing. The claimants then can tailor 
their claim according to what the government has given them as 
an outline.
<P>
	A full hearing is held for others. There is usually a two to three 
month wait before the hearing can be convened. To this point the 
claimant has usually been in Canada for at least six months. The 
hearing takes place before a two-member board and both must 
agree on a decision not to grant refugee status, that is only one 
member must be convinced to grant refugee status.
<P>
	If the claim is rejected a written statement of reasons must be 
given and these reasons will be examined by the Federal Court 
of Appeal. If rejected by the Federal Court there is a further 
review by the department on humanitarian and compassionate 
grounds. The entire process can take two, three or even four 
years.
<P>
	It is a fact that almost 80 per cent of refugee claimants 
eventually end up staying in Canada, even though only 35 per 
cent of claimants fit into the UN definition for convention 
refugee. Upon inquiry it seems impossible to garner data on how 
many of the 80 per cent are affected by the added consideration 
of having had children born in Canada.
<P>
	It is unfortunate there are those who choose to abuse the very 
system designed to protect them. The vast majority of visitors 
and refugee applications are not seeking to use the present rules 
to their own end. The bill fully recognizes the need for provision 
for children born to bona fide participants in the due process of 
our refugee system. They will be fully recognized as citizens 
upon application after their parents have obtained their 
permanent status.
<P>
	One consideration remains to be addressed. Some 
accommodation in law, perhaps through a simple amendment to 
the bill, is necessary to avoid a condition of statelessness for 
those born on Canadian soil. In conclusion, the present system 
that grants automatic citizenship to all those born in Canada 
regardless of their parents' residency status invites the 
intentional abuse of a shrinking and unpredictable world.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	Immigration should provide access to those who choose to 
strengthen the fabric of their new home. The value of our 
citizenship and the value of our great country will be the sum of 
the values and the sense of belonging of its proud and 
prosperous people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7884"> 7884 </A></B>
<P>
	The practice of citizenship of convenience of birth must be 
addressed by this House. To thus raise the integrity of our 
citizenship process is to impute added pride and purpose to all 
Canadians, past, present and future.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Port 
Moody-Coquitlam indicated before the debate began that she 
wished to share her time. Approximately seven minutes remain 
in the hon. member's time but I do not see the member who was 
going to share this time with her. Shall the Chair assume the time 
is not going to be shared?
<P>
	Very well, the hon. member for Mission-Coquitlam has 
roughly eight minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I might ask you to help me out a little and let me known 
when my conclusion time approaches so I can maybe finish the 
sentence I am speaking.
<P>
	I rise today to speak in support of my friend's private 
member's bill which deals with the growing problem of people 
coming to Canada just in time to give birth, their babies 
therefore gaining Canadian citizenship.
<P>
	This bill would eliminate the conferring of Canadian 
citizenship on the baby unless one of the parents became a 
Canadian citizen or a permanent resident of Canada and an 
application is made on behalf of the child for it to become a 
citizen. The automatic conferring of citizenship would cease.
<P>
	When I first was made aware of the situation of people coming 
to Canada to occupy our maternity wards to have children and 
then go back to their country of origin, I thought this to be an 
unusual state of affairs. It could be argued that Canadians should 
be flattered that people from other countries thinking so highly 
of Canada and the benefits which flow from Canadian 
citizenship that they will actually come to Canada to give birth.
<P>
	As well, I understand that in the majority of cases people who 
are doing this pay for the medical care they receive. Therefore, 
what is the harm? The health care system is compensated. We 
should be flattered that people from around the world want to 
give their babies Canadian citizenship. It is difficult to argue 
that this is a method to ensure that 18 years hence the child will 
sponsor his or her parents into Canada as immigrants because 
the child, now 18, is a Canadian citizen.
<P>
	I suppose there is a good chance this would eventually 
happen. I do not think this is the most grievous flow with the act 
as it is presently written. The Citizenship Act should be changed 
to that this practice of using Canada as a birth place of 
convenience stops. This practice should stop because to 
continue it is to make a mockery of the system we presently have 
in place by which people become Canadian citizens.
<P>
	People come to Canada from all over the world. They come 
here for many reasons, but for the vast majority they come 
because Canada is a land of opportunity, a land of fairness and 
equality, a land where all are to be treated alike.
<P>
	If this is true, and I believe it is, how do we reconcile the 
complicated procedure which immigrants and refugees have to 
go through to become Canadian citizens with the fact that a 
mother can come here for a few days, have a baby which 
automatically assumes Canadian citizenship and then leave? To 
my mind these two procedures cannot be reconciled and the 
latter must be eliminated.
<P>
	Those who make a conscience decision to come to Canada and 
then to apply for Canadian citizenship do so because they have 
certain expectations about citizenship, what it is, what it means 
and what flows from it. These people understood what it means 
to be a Canadian citizen. They each must take an active part in 
building this country we all share.
<P>
	A sense of being Canadian is something that can take time to 
develop. It means being part of a large family and as such it 
means assertion of certain rights and responsibilities that are 
based on our traditions and shared values.
<P>
	Under the charter of rights there are certain guarantees that all 
Canadian citizens have: the right to vote in the federal and 
provincial elections, the right to be a candidate in federal and 
provincial elections, the right to enter, remain in or leave 
Canada, the right to earn a living and reside in any province, and 
minority language education rights.
<P>
	Canadians also have other rights as citizens. They may have a 
Canadian passport. They may be considered first for some jobs. 
Along with these rights come responsibilities to strengthen our 
communities, participate in a political process, obey Canada's 
laws, eliminate discrimination and injustice, respect the rights 
of others, respect private and public property, care for Canada's 
heritage and support Canada's ideals.

<P>
	Canadian citizenship today is I believe about all of us as 
citizens participating fully and equally in our national life. It is 
about promoting our national symbols and values and building a 
Canada where all of us can feel at home.
<P>
	It is my belief that those who practice active citizenship 
strengthen our democracy, our national identity and our sense of 
responsibility for Canada, strengthen our relations with another, 
improve the quality of our institutions, help us deal with 
society's problems.
<P>
	The oath of Canadian citizenship is taken by many people 
every year. It is a solemn declaration which places 
responsibilities on the person who takes it. It can only be taken 
after the applicant meets the following standards:  is at least 18 
years old, is lawfully admitted to Canada for permanent 
residence, has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7885"> 7885 </A></B>
<P>
lived in Canada for a total of three years in the four years 
immediately before applying for citizenship, can speak one of 
Canada's official languages, has enough knowledge about 
Canada including the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, 
is not under deportation order or in prison, has not been 
convicted of an indictable offence within the last three years and 
is not considered a threat to the security of Canada.
<P>
	Even after meeting these standards, an interview must be held 
by a citizen court judge. I therefore urge all members of the 
House to support the bill to end the standard by which 
citizenship is dealt with in Canada.
<P>
	Citizenship in my opinion should be used as a vehicle to 
promote an active critical participation in public affairs on the 
part of Canadians. Passage of this bill will show the world how 
seriously we value Canadian citizenship and all the benefits that 
flow therefrom.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I regard this private members' bill as a very serious bill and one 
on which I am very pleased to speak.
<P>
	Yet I cannot help feel that I have heard from Cassandra's 
prophets of doom and gloom who see conspiracies under every 
bush. One would swear that our shores are about to be invaded 
by pregnant women, plotting to have their babies on Canadian 
soil so that these cunning infants can somehow steal their 
Canadian citizenship and thereby threaten our national security.
<P>
	It is really surprising to hear what I regarded as a very serious 
private members' bill treated so flippantly and lightly. I am 
surprised at that and I am really disappointed. I just hope that 
this invasion is not imminent of these pregnant women.
<P>
	During the election campaign our government called on 
Canadians to examine our policies in the red book, to look at 
what we consider to be our priorities and commitments as a 
party. They responded rather clearly coast to coast to coast in the 
endorsement that they gave to this party.
<P>
	The Reform Party members opposite who are interrupting and 
do not want to hear this, that is fine but Canadians are looking 
for that new decorum they speak of and it is interesting that it 
does not apply when they are hearing ideas with which they 
disagree.
<P>
	Be that as it may, we acknowledge the importance of building 
a nation in which citizens view themselves not as isolated 
individuals or rival interest groups but rather as a mutually 
supporting community. Fundamental to such a vision is the need 
to build a Canada based on mutually held privileges and 
obligations.
<P>
	It is difficult to promote the acquisition of Canadian 
citizenship without conveying a sense of the fundamental values 
that are inherent in that commitment.
<P>
	At the present time our security is undergoing fundamental 
changes, serious changes. Canada is confronted with a variety of 
economic, cultural and social challenges and one of them is not 
this perceived invasion by pregnant women to have their babies 
on our shores.
<P>
	We are faced with a serious need to integrate a population that 
is more culturally diverse than ever before into a society that is 
more complex than ever before.
<P>
	As I said earlier today in this House, Canada is more than ever 
a polyglot nation. We draw from virtually every single culture in 
the world. The members on this side and the majority of 
Canadians regard that as one of our fundamental strengths, 
regard that as what it means to be Canadians, the essence of the 
Canadian identity.
<P>
	It is not something to be feared, not something to be cut down 
and sliced down into a much more limited vision of what it 
means to be Canadian.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	We need to develop a clearer sense about what we can expect 
from our new citizens and what this nation has to offer. To 
achieve this we need new citizenship legislation. We agree with 
that. We need a new Citizenship Act that will reflect the times.
<P>
	Within the year this government will introduce new 
comprehensive citizenship legislation. It will provide a 
blueprint for Canadian society as we enter the 21st century.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member that Canadian citizenship is 
precious but it is not something to be hoarded and hidden away 
in some sort of xenophobic fear of those people who want to 
come here from these other countries.
<P>
	It is something that should never be taken for granted. 
Citizenship encompasses civic rights, duties and 
responsibilities. It means defining the principles underlying our 
citizenship and democracy, including equality of opportunity, 
informed participation, respect for the Canadian rule of law, 
non-violence and mutual respect.
<P>
	Such a vital issue is not something to be tinkered with lightly. 
Frankly I fear that the member for Port Moody-Coquitlam is 
doing that. The hon. member spoke about not trivializing 
Canadian citizenship. Then I heard and could not believe the 
latitude that was taken in the remarks she made and the litany 
about the perceived refugee problems. I think we ought to be 
very careful not to lump in problems real or perceived around 
the issue of refugees with citizenship and granting citizenship to 
new-born babies. I was frankly surprised to hear those remarks.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7886"> 7886 </A></B>
<P>
	One cannot and should not make changes to citizenship 
lightly in a bit by bit, chip away at it fashion. It is much too 
important to be done in that manner.
<P>
	It would be premature in my view if not irresponsible for this 
House to pursue in isolation just one small aspect of the 
citizenship question at this time. It would seem that there are 
members in this House, thankfully not on this side, who are 
obsessed with these perceived problems, almost seeming to me 
at times to border on xenophobic fear of people coming here 
from other nations. I am surprised to hear that.
<P>
	Despite the protests from the members opposite at this time I 
am very surprised to hear this initiative repeated time and again. 
Our government has undertaken a review process which will 
help us to create stronger, better and more efficient citizenship 
legislation. A new bill will soon be tabled.
<P>
	I accept the fact that the member for Port Moody-Coquitlam 
probably means well in her initiative but it is at the wrong time, 
it is far too small in its scope and it is simply something that 
needs to be done in a more comprehensive way.
<P>
	When this occurs the appropriate time will come to address 
this issue more fully in what I say must be a comprehensive, 
responsible manner.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to take part in this debate on Private Member's Bill C-249 
to amend the Citizenship Act. The motion tabled on May 11, 
1994, by the hon. member for Port Moody-Coquitlam will 
ensure that a child born in Canada after December 31, 1994, will 
not have Canadian citizenship if, at the time of his birth, neither 
of his parents is a citizen or a permanent resident.
<P>
	This issue was barely touched on in the consultation process 
carried out by the Standing Committee on Citizenship and 
Immigration in June. At present, the Citizenship Act states that 
every person who is born in Canada is a citizen, except children 
of foreign diplomats and diplomatic staff. The existing 
Citizenship Act is 20 years old. It was not until November 1993 
that the daily newspaper <I>Vancouver Sun</I> came up with figures on 
the number of children born in Canada to parents who were not 
permanent residents.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	No scientific study has been carried out on the issue yet. The 
story was based on information provided by nurses at Saint-Paul 
Hospital in Vancouver. It was reported that the majority of these 
children were born to parents originally from Hong Kong who 
wanted to become Canadian citizens. There was a lot of 
controversy about this news story in the Vancouver Chinese 
community, but community leaders dismissed the issue as a 
minor problem.
<P>
	A Citizenship and Immigration official vaguely mentioned 
something about some 400 children having been born to foreign 
nationals in Canada in 1993 and not all of these births being used 
to secure a Canadian passport.
<P>
	The Department of Citizenship and Immigration does not 
have any statistics on Canadian-born children whose parents are 
not citizens or residents of Canada. There is a very simple 
reason for that: birth registration is a provincial responsibility. 
The federal government has no authority in this area.
<P>
	Is the bill proposed by the Reform Party based on exact 
figures showing a large-scale conspiracy from abroad, an 
endless flow of foreigners knowingly taking advantage of the 
Canadian government? Some parents are here legally, like 
students, temporary workers or refugee claimants.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Clearly the situation is not serious enough to call for radical 
changes to the law at this time. The motion aims at creating a 
new category of people living in Canada. Children born after 
December 31, 1994 whose parents are neither Canadian citizens 
nor permanent residents would not be given automatic 
citizenship.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	One of the principles behind the Citizenship Act is that of <I>jus 
soli</I> or law of the soil. This fundamental principle is applied by 
most countries. The motion put forward by the hon. member for 
Port Moody-Coquitlam rejects the territorial principle out of 
hand.
<P>
	In my opinion, this bill reflects the biased feeling that 
immigrants abuse the system. However, it must be pointed out 
that Canadian-born children will grow up as Canadians and will 
not need language training or other reception services involving 
government expenditures. They will integrate more easily into 
the Quebec or Canadian community.
<P>
	If this bill is adopted in its present form, a child born in 
Canada may run the risk of becoming stateless. According to 
article 3 of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, 
proclaimed by the UN General Assembly on November 20, 
1959, the child is entitled, from birth, to a name and a 
nationality. I stress the word nationality.
<P>
	This motion will create a legal vacuum for these children. 
And this is supposed to be the International Year of the Family!
<P>
	We know that visa officers in this country and in various 
Canadian embassies are very reluctant to issue tourist visas to 
pregnant women. So there are really no figures to support 
allegations of abuse in this respect.
<P>
	I agree with the previous speaker who said there had been no 
invasions of pregnant women in Canada.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7887"> 7887 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The declaration of the rights of the child signed by Canada 
stipulates that children are in need of special protection and 
care, especially appropriate legal protection before and after 
birth. This country owes to our children the very best we can 
offer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Governments must recognize these rights and ensure they are 
observed by passing the appropriate legislation. These rights 
shall apply to all children without exception and without 
distinction or discrimination on the basis of race, colour, sex, 
language, religion, political or other opinions, national or social 
origin, income, birth or any other situation, whether it applies to 
the child itself or to its family. The child must grow up in an 
atmosphere of love and moral and material security.
<P>
	The figures we have so far on children of non-residents born 
in Canada are very tentative and there have been no major 
problems. If there is any abuse, it is certainly minimal.
<P>
	In any case, we will wait for the text of the bill to amend the 
present Citizenship Act which the minister has promised to table 
this fall, before we make a definitive statement. For the time 
being, I am against Bill C-249.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to stand here and speak to Bill C-249 from my colleague 
on the other side of the House, the member for Port 
Moody-Coquitlam.
<P>
	In doing my research starting yesterday in preparing myself to 
speak to this today at first blush I thought the bill had merit but 
on getting deeper into the subject material I discovered that it 
probably was premature. The bill before us today represents a 
very small fraction of a much larger debate concerning the 
direction which Canadian citizenship will take in the future.
<P>
	Bill C-249 does draw our attention to the important 
citizenship questions which will be coming into play in the 
coming months and I agree there is a need for change in the way 
that Canada addresses its citizenship issues.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that Bill C-249 does present an ad hoc 
approach to dealing with citizenship issues. Something as 
important as changes to the citizenship act should not be 
tinkered with one small piece at a time.
<P>
	In April this government committed itself to the development 
of a new citizenship act. We recognize the need to amend the 
current legislation and we recognize that we must remove 
anomalies in access to citizenship and to reinforce citizenship 
integrity. Right now the key to reinforcing this integrity lies not 
in the introduction of an individual specific legislation, it rests 
in the development of a broad citizenship strategy. We must 
have a clear sense of the direction we wish to take before we can 
even begin discussing the specifics.
<P>
	We must develop a plan which reflects the will of the people. 
It must also encourage those seeking Canadian citizenship to 
obtain a knowledge of and commitment to this country. It must 
call for new citizens to become actively involved in community 
life. This is the essence of the government's approach. Yes, it 
will be a complicated process. It is a process we have already 
started and is one we are committed to seeing through.
<P>
	A standing committee was formed in April to review ideas 
which would enhance the visibility and value of our citizenship. 
This group tabled its findings in June. I might add that the 
member for Port Moody-Coquitlam was a member of the 
standing committee that did produce the report ``Canadian 
Citizenship: A Sense of Belonging''.
<P>
	The report on page 17 does state that it appears some women 
may be coming to Canada as visitors solely for the purpose of 
having their babies. However, the committee recognized that it 
was a very small problem and that children born in Canada 
should not automatically become permanent residents. In so 
concluding the committee considered testimony of those who 
supported this position.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	In this same report there are 28 recommendations of changes 
to the citizenship act. Of the 28 the one the member for Port 
Moody-Coquitlam mentions is number 12. It is one of the 28 
recommendations in this booklet. The minister I believe will be 
tabling a new citizenship act in the new year and I think all of 
those 28 recommendations can be addressed and spoken to. It 
certainly will come before the Standing Committee on 
Citizenship and Immigration at that time. This is probably when 
I changed my mind in that I think it is a bit of ad hockery to be 
dealing with this one particular aspect of this report.
<P>
	These recommendations by no means stand alone forever. Ten 
months ago the Department of Citizenship and Immigration 
launched a process of consultation with Canadians. From 
February to September in town hall meetings and study groups 
thousands of Canadians told the government what they thought. 
More than 10,000 Canadians from communities across the 
country and from all sectors of the economy and society 
expressed their views on the important bonds between 
citizenship and immigration and how these values linked to 
form their visions of Canada in the next century.
<P>
	We have heard from Canadians and we have already taken 
action. These consultations have been invaluable for several 
reasons. First, they have let us know how the Canadian people 
feel. Second and just as important, the consultations have 
prompted Canadians to reflect on their hopes and dreams 
concerning what it means to live in this great nation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7888"> 7888 </A></B>
<P>
	The government's citizenship legislation will seek to achieve 
a range of goals. It will strive to promote among all Canadians 
the exercise of civic rights by strengthening citizenship 
education and promotion. We must consider the mutual 
privileges and obligations ingrained in the relationship between 
Canadian citizens and our society.
<P>
	A new citizenship act will also modernize the technical 
apparatus presently in use. Too many people who are currently 
entitled to become citizens and desperately want to are delayed 
by an administrative system which has become cumbersome and 
awkward. There are blockages in the system. There must be a 
better way.
<P>
	Through consultation and thoughtful action we will find it. 
The minister has already decided that the new system will no 
longer include citizenship court judges. This duty will in future 
be performed by distinguished Canadians drawn from the ranks 
of the Order of Canada.
<P>
	The issues discussed in Bill C-249 are important, far too 
important to be dealt with on such a basis. The standing 
committee has addressed the subject before us today. 
Recommendations have been made, but it would be premature to 
cut off one issue from the body of work done until it can be 
properly placed within the context of a comprehensive 
citizenship plan. Such a plan is being developed. Let us have the 
good sense to wait for it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the Reform Party's critic for citizenship and 
immigration I am very pleased to support the member for Port 
Moody-Coquitlam and her proposed changes to the citizenship 
act in Bill C-249.
<P>
	I would like to begin by saying that this bill was tabled on May 
4 of this year, almost two months before the committee's report 
was produced. When the Standing Committee on Citizenship 
and Immigration was formed it was given five general goals to 
accomplish. Among them was the goal to find ways to enhance 
the value and visibility of Canadian citizenship.
<P>
	During the committee's proceedings members of Parliament 
were told many times that the value of Canadian citizenship has 
become trivialized. As one witness said, to be a citizen of this 
wonderful country all you had to do was pass the tests, pay the 
taxes and that is it. Others expressed concerns over how 
Canadian citizenship has become little more than a convenient 
commodity for foreigners or an insurance policy that can be 
cashed in during times of trouble.
<P>
	The committee heard stories of women coming to Canada for 
the sole reason of having their babies here. Under current 
Canadian law any child born in Canada is automatically granted 
Canadian citizenship without question. It would appear that the 
word has spread around the world about this Canadian 
generosity.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	According to recent <I>Vancouver Sun</I> reports, upwards of 300 
babies a year or more have been born in British Columbia over 
the past three years to non-residents. That is over 900 children 
in British Columbia alone. Some of these births were of course 
the result of unusual circumstances.
<P>
	Hospital staff claim however that the vast majority of these 
babies were born to Hong Kong residents hoping to either queue 
hop into Canada or at the very least offer their child or 
themselves an insurance policy in case the transfer of Hong 
Kong from British to Chinese rule does not proceed smoothly.
<P>
	In time these so called passport babies will be eligible for all 
the benefits that Canadian society has to offer: subsidized 
college and university schooling, access to social programs, job 
training programs, old age security, and on and on. All of this for 
people who may not have a single connection to this country 
aside from a piece of paper saying they were born in Canada.
<P>
	As well, at the age of 19 these children will be able to sponsor 
their own parents into Canada even though the children 
themselves have spent little or no time in this country. This in 
my opinion amounts to little more than an insurance policy for 
the parents involved and makes a mockery of our citizenship.
<P>
	I admit that the passport babies issue is a minor one, 
especially when compared to other issues in the Citizenship and 
Immigration portfolio. It is however an obvious loophole that is 
being abused and therefore must be closed.
<P>
	I believe the member for Port Moody-Coquitlam has struck 
an excellent balance between taking a firm stand against abusers 
of the system and showing compassion for newborn children. 
She advocates that a child born in Canada will only be granted 
Canadian citizenship if at least one parent is either a permanent 
resident of this country or a Canadian citizen.
<P>
	Parents such as these have clearly shown a commitment to 
Canada by becoming residents or citizens and should therefore 
be rewarded for this commitment by granting their children all 
the rights and privileges that come with citizenship.
<P>
	Children born in Canada to refugee claimants will 
automatically receive their Canadian citizenship as soon as at 
least one of the parents becomes a permanent resident or a 
citizen. On the other hand passport babies will be required to 
take on the citizenship of their parents.
<P>
	This bill if passed by Parliament will in my view have a 
two-sided effect. First, it will send a clear message to the rest of 
the world that Canada places a high value on its citizenship. For 
a newborn child to become a citizen, the family must show a 
strong commitment to Canada by striving to become residents or 
citizens. Such a commitment will be too strong for some and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7889"> 7889 </A></B>
<P>
will end  both the flow of passport babies and the pursuit of 
Canadian citizenship to act as a child's or parent's personal 
insurance policy.
<P>
	Second, it will send a clear message to Canadians that the 
federal government values citizenship and takes a firm stand on 
who can acquire it. Fewer Canadians than ever before I feel are 
viewing their citizenship as a valuable commodity.
<P>
	The words Canadian citizen have been devalued because of 
many stories like this one of the passport babies and the flagrant 
abuse of citizenship requirements. This amendment would be a 
first step in restoring the value of citizenship to those who 
cherish it most, that is Canadians.
<P>
	In closing, I wish to point out the consensus that I feel Bill 
C-249 holds within this House. The standing committee made 
these very same recommendations four months ago in its report 
``Canadian Citizenship, A Sense of Belonging''. This report 
authored by an all-party committee unanimously 
recommended:
<P>
	``Children born in Canada should be Canadian citizens only if 
one or both of their parents is a permanent resident or a 
Canadian citizen. Children born to a parent who has been 
recognized as a convention refugee or to a parent who is a 
refugee claimant subsequently recognized as a convention 
refugee by the Immigration and Refugee Board should 
automatically gain Canadian citizenship''.
<P>
	I must emphasize that these very recommendations were both 
endorsed by all members of the committee, Liberals, Reformers 
and members of the Bloc Quebecois, and are here in black and 
white in Bill C-249.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	Clearly the member for Port Moody-Coquitlam in drafting 
this bill has reflected the concerns held by Canadians as well as 
the thoughts and intents of the standing committee. I call on my 
fellow members of this House to listen to the Canadian people, 
set aside their partisan differences and support these very 
important amendments to the Citizenship Act.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to address this House regarding Bill 
C-249, an act to amend the Citizenship Act, proposed by the 
hon. member for Port Moody-Coquitlam.
<P>
	We have before us the opportunity to address the process by 
which we confer citizenship upon new Canadians. Prior to 
addressing the specifics of the bill, I would like to speak briefly 
about the importance of the citizenship process. The integrity of 
this process must be protected because, as all members in this 
House are aware, it is considered a great honour to be a Canadian 
citizen. Canadian citizenship is renowned and respected 
worldwide. In this regard we are admired for our tolerance and 
our fairness.
<P>
	Despite this, we do have an understanding that there is a need 
for a reform of our Citizenship Act. The Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration indicated on April 14 in this House that the 
time had come to introduce amendments to the 20-year old act:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We need a Citizenship Act that also ensures fairness and integrity, one that 
removes certain discriminatory aspects of current legislation, eliminates 
inconsistencies in the granting of Canadian citizenship and improves the 
process of acquiring that citizenship.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	To attain this goal important steps have been taken such as the 
elimination of the role of citizenship judges and the introduction 
of significant administrative and regulatory changes aiming to 
expedite the process more efficiently such as increasing the 
daily number of hearings, establishing group hearings, 
extending business hours, et cetera. The termination of partisan 
judicial appointments was especially supported by many 
Canadians.
<P>
	At the same time the minister also requested the standing 
committee to study our Citizenship Act and provide 
recommendations for improvements. Shortly thereafter in June 
the committee released its report entitled ``Canadian 
Citizenship: A Sense of Belonging'' which presented a series of 
recommendations.
<P>
	Of particular relevance to the private member's bill up for 
debate today are three recommendations which have already 
been referred to, but I would like to paraphrase them. Children 
born in Canada should be Canadian citizens only if one or both 
of their parents is a permanent resident or Canadian citizen. 
Second, the provision should be made to ensure the above rule 
need not apply if its application could cause a person born in 
Canada to be stateless. Third, an exception to the first rule 
should provide that children born to a parent who is a successful 
refugee claimant should automatically gain Canadian 
citizenship.
<P>
	In light of the above recommendations I feel compelled to 
point out some serious deficiencies in Bill C-249, the private 
member's bill being debated today. Although the basic principal 
of this bill has been agreed upon by the committee, the bill 
remains quite incomplete in that it has not addressed the latter 
two recommendations which I have just alluded to. Moreover, 
the danger exists that this bill can be employed as a vehicle for 
inciting unwarranted fear among Canadians by exaggerating 
statistically negligible abuses of the Canadian citizenship 
process.
<P>
	A relevant example in this respect involved cases of foreign 
mothers, be they visitors or refugee claimants, who give birth to 
children on Canadian soil for the express purpose of attaining 
Canadian citizenship for their children. I should point out that I 
have been informed by the Department of Citizenship and 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7890"> 7890 </A></B>
<P>
Immigration there is no evidence to indicate we have a 
significant problem to this end as claimed by the Reform Party.
<P>
	The committee concluded in this regard indicating in their 
report that passport babies, as this phenomena is affectionately 
referred to, does not appear to be a major problem. Nonetheless, 
the committee provided recommendations designed to prevent 
the possibility for abuse.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	We should all be very clear in this respect. The committee did 
by no means imply that a problem of any significance existed 
when it provided suggestions on how we might prevent the 
possibility of abuse. As such I caution members across the way 
that it is terribly irresponsible to initiate unwarranted anxieties 
based upon unsubstantiated claims.
<P>
	Some members of the House appear prone to taking advantage 
of occasional and statistically insignificant occurrences and 
blowing them out of proportion to advance a political agenda. 
We have seen this many times.
<P>
	As I alluded to earlier the member's bill is suspect in that it is 
incomplete. It appears to address a simple problem with a 
common sense solution. However we live in a complex work in 
which situations are precipitated by not one factor but often 
myriad variables which may not at first glance be readily 
apparent. Most problems require thoughtful and careful analysis 
and sometimes demand complex solutions to yield optimal and 
fair outcomes.
<P>
	The bill is not well rounded nor fair because it has not 
considered certain scenarios. Although reflecting the essence of 
the committee's first recommendation found on page 17 of the 
committee's report, the bill fails to take into consideration the 
two accompanying recommendations which provide important 
exceptions to the first rule.
<P>
	Let me elaborate in this regard. It would be ruthless and 
uncompassionate to deny children Canadian citizenship if they 
could not be granted citizenship from another country. We could 
not leave children in a predicament such that they would remain 
stateless. I am appalled that the member did not see fit to include 
this reasonable exception.
<P>
	Furthermore, regardless of the hon. member's stated intent, 
the bill indicates very clearly or in no uncertain terms that the 
children of foreign mothers might gain citizenship only after 
one of the child's parents became permanent residents or 
citizens.
<P>
	This poses a serious problem given that it does not take into 
account the case of successful refugee claimants who do not 
choose to seek permanent resident status or citizenship. Because 
accepted refugee claimants are not obliged to seek permanent 
residents or citizenship, the possibility exists that their children 
would for all intents and purposes be denied citizenship.
<P>
	I was most disappointed to note that there was absolutely no 
reference to the above two exceptions in the member's bill. I am 
confident that had a careful and indepth analysis been conducted 
the contents of the bill would have been more complete and 
comprehensive.
<P>
	Without an acknowledgement of these exceptions outlined by 
the committee, the essence of the hon. member's bill is rendered 
unfair and our citizenship process rendered incomplete. This is 
simply not the Canadian way.
<P>
	In conclusion, Bill C-249, although commensurate with the 
general essence of the first recommendation on page 17 of the 
standing committee's report, remains incomplete to the point 
where it would render the citizenship process unjust and 
exclusionary. For the above reasons the amendment should be 
exposed for what it is, a vehicle for partisan gerrymandering.
<P>
	On the bright side, in the near future the House can expect a 
comprehensive and fair reform of the Citizenship Act. I am 
confident that the revised act will prove well balanced and will 
seriously consider the recommendations presented in the June 
report of the standing committee.
<P>
	In the meantime the Reform Party would better serve the 
interests of Canadians by contributing in a positive manner to 
the citizen reform process rather than dwell upon the-

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, on July 10, 
I asked the Minister for National Defence and Veterans Affairs if 
he recognized that additional changes were needed to Bill C-84 
and, if so, would he put these changes on the legislative agenda 
now as time for our merchant navy war veterans is running out. 
He stated that the Department of Veterans Affairs was working 
on reforms that would speed up the processing of veterans' 
claims. I agree with this. However it is not the only thing that the 
merchant navy war veterans require.
<P>

<P>
	Bill C-84 is a complex bill which amends various war pension 
acts. By rejecting the principle of equality with war veterans, 
veterans affairs locked the merchant navy under a civilian act 
instead of including it under an amended War Veterans 
Allowance Act.
<P>
	One solution to the inequities of Bill C-84 is a simple 
amendment to include the wartime merchant navy in the War 
Veterans Allowance Act.
<P>
	The government has said that Bill C-84 is a good bill. I say it 
is a start. Some merchant seamen and their families are 
receiving some benefits and that is a positive step in the right 
direction. Unfortunately it is not as inclusive as it should be.
<P>
	Bill C-84 is not satisfactory as it does not extend full veterans 
status to merchant navy veterans. Nor does it provide equal 
status to the full range of health, disability and income support 
benefits by the department.
<P>
	This past March the deputy minister of Veterans Affairs who 
was involved in the 1992 act admitted at a House of Commons 
committee hearing that the act was not perfect and contradicted 
himself by saying he did not see a need for major change. As 
well, last Friday the Secretary of State for Veterans stated on a 
CBC program that all merchant navy veterans qualify for all 
veterans benefits, but this is not so.
<P>
	After 50 years the present labour government in Australia has 
granted merchant mariners full benefits under its Veterans 
Entitlements Act. In granting them full benefits and equality the 
government has fully recognized the contribution merchant 
seafarers made in the defence of their country.
<P>
	During the war Canadian merchant ships carried essential war 
materials needed for the war effort to succeed. The merchant 
navy was a constant target for German surface raiders and 
U-boats. It is no small wonder why they had the highest casualty 
ratio of any of the services with one seaman in ten being killed.
<P>
	The current Deputy Prime Minister last week stated that 
Canada's merchant navy made the seas wholesome once again 
and kept open the gates of freedom.
<P>
	After the war merchant navy veterans were officially 
civilians. They were not eligible for veterans benefits. We as a 
country have recognized the injustices against our merchant 
navy seamen and women. Why have we not compensated them 
adequately?
<P>
	Last week the government moved closer to recognizing the 
war efforts of the merchant navy. First was the dedication of the 
<I>Book of Remembrance for the Merchant Navy War Dead</I>. The 
book is a lovely symbol of remembrance for the over 2,200 
merchant navy seamen who died in both world wars. Second was 
the participation of the merchant navy war veterans in the vice 
regal wreath laying ceremony which was agreed to by the legion.
<P>
	The number of surviving merchant seamen and women is 
about 3,200 and their average age is 74 years. All they are 
seeking is equal status, treatment and access to benefits.
<P>
	I am asking the Secretary of State for Veterans to start the 
changes to the legislation now so it can be put on the legislative 
agenda before it is too late. Time for our merchant navy veterans 
is running out. Let us once and for all fully recognize the 
merchant navy as the fourth arm of the armed services.
<P>
	It is my hope that the parliamentary secretary will not just 
deal with the issue of pension reform which the Minister of 
National Defence addressed in his first answer. I am asking if he 
acknowledges that changes are necessary to Bill C-84 and, if 
not, why not and, if so, when will the reforms be initiated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for outlining the alleged 
shortcomings of the previous government's legislation. Perhaps 
to complete the irony in that remark, this government will 
certainly consider correcting any legal or technical flaws in the 
legislation.
<P>
	I have personal knowledge of this subject because I was a 
member of the standing committee that fought for and won these 
benefits for merchant seamen. The real point is that the 
legislation is succeeding in doing what it was intended to do. 
Merchant navy veterans have the same access to veterans 
benefits as their military counterparts. They are eligible for 
disability pensions, war veterans allowance, the veterans 
independence program, long term care and veterans funeral and 
burial grants.
<P>
	There is no veterans program currently available to military 
veterans that is not also available to merchant navy veterans.
<P>
	Listening to the hon. member for Saint John this House would 
wonder if merchant navy veterans are receiving anything. They 
certainly are receiving all the benefits. In fact an estimated 
2,000 merchant navy veterans and their dependants are 
receiving veterans benefits and that is certainly a long way from 
the theme suggested by the hon. member.
<P>
	Having said that, the merchant navy representatives have 
identified several areas where they believe that legislation could 
be improved. The Secretary of State for Veterans met with the 
groups involved and their proposals are presently under review.
<P>
	From this review changes with respect to the merchant navy 
veterans benefits will take the form of amendments that would 
be considered for inclusion in a general housekeeping bill. That 
kind of bill is put forward from time to time to modernize 
language and to address technical matters.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7892"> 7892 </A></B>
<P>
	The merchant navy representatives at this meeting were also 
asked to bring to the secretary's immediate attention any 
specific case where it appeared that benefits were being denied 
because of a shortcoming in the legislation. May I conclude by 
extending to the hon. member the same invitation. I thank her 
for her question.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Under Standing Order 38(5), the 
motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly the House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 10 a.m. under Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.36 p.m.)
