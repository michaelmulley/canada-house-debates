Commons and for members of parliament.  I would like to read into 
the record a letter addressed to the Hon. Gilbert Parent, 
effective immediately, from the Leader of the Official

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear Sir: 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is to advise that effective immediately all Reform members 
of parliament should be recognized as members of the Canadian 
Alliance in accordance with the results of the referendum 
conducted among Reform Party members and announced on March 25, 
2000, whereby the Reform Party of Canada has officially adopted 
the new Constitution and Policy Declaration of the Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Please also be advised that Deborah Grey will serve as Leader of 
the Official Opposition (interim) until such time as the leader

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>THE BUDGET 
</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE 
</H4><P align=left>
<A NAME="LINK8">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 29 consideration of the motion 
that this House approves in general the budgetary policy of the 
government, and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a great honour to rise in the House to speak to the budget 
and what it means not only for the provinces and territories but 
for Canadians wherever they live in this great land of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we first dealt with the whole issue of the deficit, it was 
a huge problem in terms of what it meant for Canadians.  We knew 
that over time great sacrifices would have to be made.  Finally 
we are in the position where we have a surplus.  As a result of 
that, we can start to fulfil the very important promises which we 
made concerning what to do with the surplus money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to be part of a government which recognizes that 
there needs to be reinvestment in things like education and, 
especially, health care.  Health care is one of those underlying 
core Canadian values upon which Canadians generally expect us to 
act, and to do so in a meaningful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As chairman of the all-party Standing Committee on Health it is 
very gratifying to see the kind of reinvestment that is being 
made in this all important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I had the opportunity to speak to a number of 
researchers, specifically on Bill C-13, which would establish the 
Canadian institutes of health research.  It is important for them 
to know that the Government of Canada is there for them in terms 
of money.  Dollars to researchers all across Canada will double 
over the next number of years.  We hope to find cures for cancer, 
heart disease and other diseases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget we saw that Génome Canada was given enormous 
amounts of money to get up and running.  It is involved in an 
important health area as well and is something which all 
Canadians applaud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We invested in this budget $2.5 billion in health care, on top 
of the $11.5 billion that was invested in last year's budget. 
That underscores the commitment of the Government of Canada in 
this all important area, which is consistent with the values of 
Canadians.  We know that there is still a way to go.  We 
understand that, which is why the ministers will be meeting.  The 
federal health minister, along with his territorial and 
provincial counterparts, will meet in May.  The deputy ministers 
are meeting as we speak.  Early on, as quickly as possible, they 
will try to carve out the kind of health care system that will 
take us into the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The areas that will be looked at are primary health care, as 
well as community and home care, and the whole issue of 
accountability and making sure that Canadians get what they want 
in their health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those three topics will be dealt with, and hopefully dealt with 
effectively, knowing that it is what Canadians need and want.  We 
certainly want to act in that appropriate way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke about the promises which we as a government had made. We 
know full well that in addition to the reinvestment that we are 
making in a number of areas we also had to cut taxes.  That was 
very important.  We were on the leading edge when it came to the 
reduction of taxes, unlike members of the Reform Party, who 
talked about balancing books and trying to get the deficit 
reduced two years from now.  We were far ahead of them. 
More to the point, we were ahead of them with tax cuts as well. 
I think that speaks volumes about who we are as a government, 
what we do and how we do it.  It underscores the commitment on 
this side of the House to give Canadians, especially lower and 
middle income Canadians, the kind of tax relief that is 
important, not only for themselves, but for their families as 
well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents in Waterloo—Wellington, as well as constituents 
across Ontario and elsewhere in Canada want to see us move on the 
national debt.  I am pleased to note that we have done that and 
will continue to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister was very clear.  He said that it is 
important to move on all these fronts and that there be tax 
relief in a staged fashion.  He indicated that it would be a plan 
over five years.  I think that speaks volumes to our commitment 
as a government, our commitment as Liberals, to act in an 
appropriate and timely way, knowing that it is the right thing to 
do.  Canadians not only expect it and need it, but actually 
deserve it because of the sacrifices they have made over the last 
little while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax cuts, coupled with debt reduction over time, coupled 
with reinvestment in all important areas, are simply good news 
for Canada.  We can see the economy responding as a result. When 
was the last time we saw the economy soar to the extent it has 
over the last little while under our administration? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen over time the great benefits that have taken place 
as a result of good fiscal and monetary management that we on the 
government side have been able to do.  I am very proud to be part 
of a government that is in tune with Canadians and sees the kinds 
of things that need to be done, done well and done effectively. 
We can and do run an effective administration, and that shows. 
We do it in a way that is consistent with the values of 
Canadians. We do it in a way that makes economic, social and 
political sense.  I am proud to be part of a government that is 
able to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to indicate that I will be splitting my time.  This is an 
important topic and other members want the ability to speak to 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to the time of the Conservatives for a minute. 
We inherited a huge deficit from the Mulroney administration.  It 
really was a terrible thing, a great millstone that hung around 
the necks of all Canadians.  Over time we whittled that away and 
took care of it in a very good way that really did not create 
havoc and upheaval.  In a consistent, incremental and solid way 
we were able to take it down to zero and do so with minimal 
disruption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that in that sense we were able to do 
the right thing.  It is important that we do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to see the Conservatives these days and the 
kinds of things they are doing.  I point only to the clarity bill 
as an example, Bill C-20, and the inability of the Conservatives 
and Mr. Clark to stand for Canada.  I find it most distressing 
and I find it very shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I want to come back and hook into health care.  I find it 
equally and even more distressing that Mr. Clark, out of step 
with Canadians, has decided to support Mr. Klein's Bill 11 in 
Alberta.  I find that outrageous and out of touch, but it is part 
and parcel of the Tories and their ability, it seems, to trip at 
every misstep.  That is most upsetting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also note that the NDP is often on interesting ground when it 
comes to a number of the issues, but when it comes to health 
care, when it comes to employment and other major issues, the NDP 
always wants to throw money at them.  That is just simply 
unacceptable.  Canadians see through that.  They find it 
unacceptable.  The NDP always wants to throw money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the Bloc, after Bill C-20 I really have to 
wonder who and what it represents.  It really is quite outrageous 
that its members are so out of step with their constituents and 
Quebecers in that wonderful province.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that the Reform Party has transformed 
itself into a new alliance.  We witnessed the members not so long 
ago in the House taking, I suppose, a modicum of pride in what 
they have done, trying to reinvent themselves and come out in a 
new metamorphosis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My position is that a dinosaur that does Tae-Kwondo, a dinosaur 
that tries to be hip is still nothing but a dinosaur.  It is 
important to note that those people opposite who want to rip 
Canada apart, who want to pit region against region every time 
they can and pit people against people, they stand for the flat 
tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are talking about the budget today let us talk about 
the flat tax.  Let us talk about what those Reformers stand for. 
Even their right wing NRA friends, Charlton Heston, and their 
televangalist friends in the United States, Jimmy Swaggart, Jim 
Bakker and Tammy Faye and all the other ones of that ilk, reject 
the flat tax.  They say it is rubbish.  Still those dinosaurs 
caterwaul away about how important it is to have a flat tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not buy into that nonsense.  Canadians reject it 
because Canadians see through whatever they call themselves. They 
know that the Reform Party switched into an alliance is still 
nothing but a Reform Party; the politics of hatred, of extremism, 
of division, of everything that most Canadians do not want to be 
a part of.  That is what the Reform Party represents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was reading today a little about our friend Stockwell Day. 
Does he ever some interesting baggage that needs to see the light 
of day.  We need to turn over the rock and take a look.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have listened with great interest to my colleague, the hon. 
member for Waterloo—Wellington, who was of course boasting about 
the seventh budget of this government and of the same Minister 
of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is his wont, he took advantage of the opportunity to tear a 
strip off all parties in this House.  Of course his own party 
was spared, a party in which there is infighting going on at the 
present time. 
We no longer know who is governing this government, if it is the 
Minister of Finance, if it is the clan of the Minister of 
Finance, if it is the Prime Minister and his backroom boys, but 
the result has been that the seventh budget of the Minister of 
Finance has totally forgotten this country's farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not surprising that one of them has been forced to travel 
thousands of kilometres to get to Parliament Hill.  He made use 
of the means available to him to raise this government's 
awareness and to meet with the Prime Minister in order to 
establish a relationship of financial assistance, after that 
same government shamelessly slashed assistance to farmers.  Now 
they are turning on the tap a bit for the health of this 
country's agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that displeased me in this budget is that there is 
nothing for people who have seasonal work or to lose their jobs. 
As we are well aware, close to 60% of them pay into the 
employment insurance fund, but when they are forced to apply for 
benefits, there is always one way or another to tell them 
“Unfortunately, you are not eligible”.  There is always an hour 
or two missing, or they are penalized for some past action.  The 
only help there is for these workers is that contributions will 
drop by 15 cents per $100 in income, for the next four years. 
This is a trifle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are calling for is for access to employment insurance to 
be made more humane.  When workers are in a black hole, for 
three weeks, sometimes three months, they find it very 
difficult.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the member for Waterloo-Wellington does not know 
what it means for a couple not to have any money coming in for 
three weeks, for two or three months.  This was something he 
glossed right over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to know very well that at the same time that workers' 
benefits were being cut, HRDC was handing out $500,000 to the 
big company making billions in Cornwall.  The CEO told us  “We 
applied.  We were sure we would not get it.  They handed it to 
us and we took it of course”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Placeteco received $1.2 million to create jobs.  Three 
disappeared, none were created, and Placeteco was saved from 
certain bankruptcy, and we know perfectly well that some friends 
had a hand in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the riding— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to have to interrupt the hon. 
member.  Only five minutes are allowed for questions and 
comments and the hon. member has used almost all of it.  The 
hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington must be allowed to reply.  He 
has one minute to reply. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think it would take a 
little more than one minute to respond to the hon. member 
opposite.  The fact that he took so long to go on his little 
diatribe underscores the frustration of the Bloc members in the 
House.  They do not know what to do any more. They do not know 
what they stand for any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned that we on this side of the House were 
in so-called disarray.  I do not need to be lectured by the Bloc 
when it comes to those matters, because we stand as a team.  We 
stand united behind our Prime Minister and behind the team in 
terms of where we go and what we do.  We do it in a consistent 
manner, which Canadians expect from the governing party, the 
party that governs our great country.  We always do it in a 
manner that is important and underscores our commitment to 
Canadian values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talks about disarray.  He should get Mr. 
Parizeau and Mr. Bouchard together.  He should make sure that his 
ideological friends, who seem to be fraying at every side of the 
issue when it comes to things like sovereignty and other things 
in Quebec, get their act together. I will repeat that I need no 
lecture from him when it comes to those kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I rise in direct reference to the comments made by the member for 
Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take exception, as a member of the Canadian Alliance, to his 
comments that the Canadian Alliance, our new party, formerly the 
Reform Party, preaches the politics of hatred.   I know that 
other opposition members here in the House would also find that 
very unparliamentary.  In fact, I say shame on that member and 
his party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe a retraction is due.  I appeal to the Chair for that 
very course of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  The hon. member is against everything. He 
is anti-feminist, anti-immigrant— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I too rise in objection to the member opposite referring to this 
party, the Canadian Alliance Party, as being some kind of a 
religious bunch of nuts and yahoos.  I suggest that the hon. 
member retract those remarks or apologize to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The Chair heard the 
comments.  I am not sure that anything that was said was 
unparliamentary, but I certainly feel it is appropriate for hon. 
members to have due regard for the words they use in the House 
and use language that is entirely fitting with our practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure that the hon. member completely crossed the line. 
They are not necessarily words that all members would use.  I 
hope we do not continue in this vein.  I hope we can move on and 
perhaps raise our sights a little.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Limoges (Windsor—St. Clair, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
after watching the Minister of Finance previously deliver six 
innovative budgets from outside the Chamber, it is an honour for 
me to stand here today to speak in favour of his seventh budget 
and to participate in the budget debate. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I decided to speak in support of this budget, I thought 
back to a time when federal budgets focused on deficits and a 
ballooning national debt while Canadians had to deal with deep 
spending cuts; a time when the tax burden on Canadians, 
particularly low and middle income Canadians, was increasing at 
an alarming rate;  a time when the national unemployment rate was 
over 11%; a time when Canadians were worried about their future 
and the prospects for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have a federal budget that is able to address very 
different issues.  Under the leadership of the Prime Minister and 
the Minister of Finance, we have a budget today that allows the 
government to build on the foundation secured by the many 
sacrifices made by Canadians in Windsor—St. Clair and across 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget, the first of the new millennium, takes decisive 
action to take advantage of Canada's better finances to improve 
our lives.  The balanced approach of this budget works to return 
hard earned income to Canadians, improve the quality of life for 
Canadians, prepare the Canadian economy for the new millennium 
and make our workplaces more productive and competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The balanced approach of this budget addresses several areas of 
concern and challenges facing this country.  Since I only have a 
few minutes I cannot highlight the entire budget but one area 
which I would like to discuss today is that of tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax relief is a very important issue in my riding of 
Windsor—St. Clair.  Since my election last April, many of my 
constituents have told me that tax relief is important in order 
to improve their quality of life.  This budget goes a long way to 
address this concern by approaching tax relief in a fair and 
balanced manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget 2000 introduces a plan that will reduce taxes by at least 
$58 billion over the next five years.  On an annual basis, it 
will reduce personal income taxes by an average of 15% by 
2004-05.  This five year tax reduction plan delivers immediate 
and growing tax relief to my constituents in Windsor—St. Clair 
and to all Canadians. This is very much the case for middle and 
low income Canadians, as well as families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Low and middle income Canadians will see their net personal 
income tax reduced by an average of 18% annually, perhaps even 
more if our economic circumstances permit.  Families raising 
children will enjoy an average reduction in their net personal 
income tax of 21% annually because of the added assistance 
provided through the enrichment of the Canada child tax benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The combination of tax relief measures and the government's last 
three budgets and the five year plan will reduce the federal 
portion of personal income tax for all Canadians by an average of 
22% annually by 2004, even more for families raising children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a key element of the tax reduction plan, the budget 
immediately restores full inflation indexation of the personal 
income tax system.  This will stop the hidden tax increases known 
as bracket creep.  This means that the real value of federal 
benefits, such as the Canada child tax benefit, the CCTB, and the 
GST credit, will no longer be eroded by inflation, thus 
protecting the integrity of these programs which were designed to 
help low and middle income families, especially those who are 
struggling to raise children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the government is providing meaningful and permanent 
tax relief for Canadians, relief that is sustainable because it 
is built on a solid foundation of fiscal responsibility and not 
borrowed from future generations through deficit financing as we 
have seen with some provincial governments in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another key measure, the middle income tax rate applied to 
income between $29,590 and $59,180 will be cut.  Effective July 1 
this rate will be reduced to 24% from the current 26%.  This 
middle rate will be cut another full point to 23% by 2004 or 
sooner, if possible.  Under this plan Canadians in Windsor—St. 
Clair and across the country will earn more tax free income and 
more of their income will be taxed at lower rates.  The plan also 
enriches the CCTB so that by 2004-05 an additional $2.5 billion 
annually will be provided to low and middle income families in my 
riding of Windsor—St. Clair and across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of these and other measures, a typical one income 
family of four earning $40,000 will have its net federal personal 
income taxes reduced by $1,623 a year by 2004, a reduction of 
48%. 
A typical two income family of four earning $60,000 will have its 
net federal portion of personal income taxes reduced by $1,546 a 
year by 2004, a reduction of 27%.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's commitment to tax relief goes beyond tax 
reductions to individuals and families.  The budget 2000 tax plan 
also helps Canada to become more competitive internationally by 
encouraging investment and innovation.  Measures include reducing 
corporate tax rates by 7% for businesses in the highest tax 
sectors to the lasting benefit of our economy in Windsor—St. 
Clair and all of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Capital gains taxes which tend to freeze up vast amounts of 
capital are being reduced as well.  Now only two-thirds of these 
gains are taxable instead of the previous three-quarters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opportunity for our young innovators will be found in Canada now 
that our tax system will promote creative wage and benefit 
packages, including incentives such as share options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today Canada enjoys a new economic reality.  The federal deficit 
is history.  The national debt burden is in decline.  Canada's 
unemployment rate is at its lowest level in more than 20 years. 
The disposable income of Canadians in Windsor—St. Clair and 
across Canada is on the rise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The balanced approach of budget 2000 continues to build on 
Canada's fiscal and economic success.  The government has clearly 
recognized that tax relief is an important part of a balanced 
approach to dealing with the problems of success that we are 
thankfully facing today and into the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to taking these better finances and 
transforming them into better lives for all Canadians.  Budget 
2000 delivers just that.  Budget 2000 is good for Windsor—St. 
Clair and it is good for Canada.  I ask all hon. members of the 
House to give their full support because it is the right thing to 
do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to the member 
and put forth a particular situation that was drawn to my 
attention this morning. There is a number of ongoing sales 
because of the economy in western Canada.  When there is an 
auction sale the auctioneer comes, takes a list and so on.  He 
publishes that list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This case is a typical example of another widow who is having an 
auction sale.  Among the goods listed are some firearms.  The 
auctioneer, being a professional and one who used to belong to 
the provincial organization, did everything right until sales day 
and he was stopped from selling the widow's guns.  Because of 
this government and the senseless legislation that is supported 
in only two provinces, we send another widow away with a loss of 
$8,000.  The government is totally to blame for that happening. 
Would the hon. member like to comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Limoges:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would be very pleased to 
respond to that question.  One does not have to look too far into 
the headlines today in North America, both in Canada and the 
United States, to know that gun control is a very important 
issue.  It is an important issue of safety for all Canadians.  I 
make absolutely no apologies.  No one in the House should take 
the position that gun ownership is something that we ought to be 
promoting in the way in which that party promotes it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly people have a right to own guns for certain purposes, 
hunters, for example, and so on.  However we have more than a 
right; we have a responsibility.  When we are talking about 
responsible gun ownership, no responsible gun owner can possibly 
complain about the fact that we want to put controls on these 
very deadly, dangerous weapons to ensure that they do not get 
into the wrong hands and to ensure that we know where they are 
and we can protect not only the children in schools but people on 
the streets and in their homes.  I make no apology.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I listened to two backbench 
Liberals speak about the budget, I was quite amused by the fact 
that they accuse our party, the NDP, of just throwing money at 
health care.  In actuality, with this recent budget, for every 
dollar in tax cuts the government gave two cents for health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has lost the moral authority to even talk 
about health care in the country when the Prime Minister goes to 
Alberta and literally kowtows to Mr. Ralph Klein in terms of bill 
11 and the privatization of health care, the most valued and 
cherished program in the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the Liberals do not understand the concerns about health 
care.  Another thing they do not understand is the shipbuilding 
policy on the east coast and elsewhere in the country.  There was 
not a single word in the budget on shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This industry employs thousands of people not only in Atlantic 
Canada but in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia. They sit 
there and completely ignored the industry, the workers and 
employers such as the CAW and the Irving Company when they came 
together with a shipbuilding policy.  We are one of the few 
nations in the world without a comprehensive policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow there will be debate at third reading on a bill 
proposed by one of the Bloc members.  Will this member be 
supporting that initiative and will the government be supporting 
a shipbuilding policy in the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Limoges:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very glad that the 
member from the NDP has brought up health care funding once 
again.  Indeed the figures speak for themselves.  This is the 
fourth consecutive increase in Canada health and social transfers 
by the government.  We are now surpassing the levels of the 
pre-cutback years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government took office in 1993-94 a total of $37.429 
billion were going to the provinces in Canada health and social 
transfers.  This year it will be $39.399 billion or over $2 
billion more.  The $2.5 billion we have added to this year's 
budget will help the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Health said it will take more than money. It 
will take innovative solutions from every province.  It will take 
health care ministers from across Canada getting together to come 
up with ways in which we can better fund and deal with the health 
care crisis we are currently facing and the provinces are trying 
to manage their way out of.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened on Saturday night in Calgary?  Canadians from

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is in the future for Canadians?  Today is the budget debate 
so let us talk about the budget.  The budget the Liberals brought 
forth is an election budget, an election budget in which they 
want to again spend, spend, spend.  They want to buy the votes of 
Canadians with their own money as they have been doing in the 
past.  It is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget ignored the pleas of Canadians for tax relief, for 
reducing the deficit and for fixing health care.  Let us deal 
quickly with the tax cuts proposed in the budget.  Let us see 
what my constituents are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently talked with a young man living in my constituency who 
has a wife and two children.  He earned $17,000 last year and 
paid $2,000 in taxes.  Upon completing his tax return his refund 
came to $97 and his wife's, $150.  His question to me was: “How 
does this government expect a family of four to live on this kind 
of an income?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I got a call from a senior in my riding.  She is 
working part time.  She is 67 years old.  She said “I am working 
part time so that I can go out and earn a little income and be 
busy”.  Why is she paying $24 in EI when she is 67 years old and 
has no intention of collecting EI?  That was her question to me. 
This is how the government indirectly taxes Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My son is 15 years old.  His friend went out to work in the 
evenings.  He is a young fellow, 15 years old, working out there. 
His first paycheque was $300 minus $87 in taxes.  He told my son 
“Tell your dad what is going on here”.  I said “Excuse me.  It 
is the party on the other side that is not in touch with 
Canadians on taxes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out there on the streets of Canada there is a demand for the 
government to address the issue of high taxation.  What do we get 
from the budget?  A band-aid solution.  It is designed to win 
votes.  The Reform Party brought this out and it scared them into 
bringing forth some tax relief.  Otherwise there would have been 
no tax relief.  I am skeptical and apprehensive that the next 
budget brought forth by the government will be spend, spend, 
spend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  They won't get another chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Hopefully the election is next year. 
Then we will see more spend, spend, spend to buy Canadian votes 
to try to win the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Calgary—Nose Hill last week presented a 
motion in the House to deal with the crisis in health care.  Even 
Liberal pollsters said that health care was the number one 
problem in the country that needed to be fixed.  What did they do 
in the budget?  There was a mere $2.5 billion after the major 
cuts had taken place over four years since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the budget increased, it is amazing, by $1.5 billion grants 
and contributions, not to health care.  The HRDC fiasco has shown 
what is happening to the grants.  Grants and contributions are 
nothing but patronage, trying to buy votes and helping out their 
Liberal friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same applies to EDC.  The minister has been using 
confidentiality not to answer questions about loans.  Where is 
the accountability of EDC to parliament?  There is none.  As a 
matter of fact today in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> it is stated 
quite clearly that there was influence by the government on the 
EDC's final report from the Gowling team.  The government is 
using its grants and contributions to help its friends, not 
ordinary Canadians.  What terrible mismanagement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two main things the Canadian Alliance offers are tax relief 
and to fix the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at our solution for tax.  Our solution 17 is a flat 
tax rate that will take the government off the backs of 
taxpayers.  Solution 17 will reduce the top federal-provincial 
tax level to roughly 29% over five years eventually freeing 1.9 
million Canadians from paying taxes.  Solution 17 says there will 
be a flat rate tax of 17%.  The exemptions still remain and will 
rise to $10,000 per person.  Those earning $20,000 or $30,000 who 
have a family of one and $40,000 for a family of four will not 
pay any taxes contrary to what people, even with small children, 
now pay of what they are earning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking of federal tax.  My colleague over there was 
taking much credit for bringing unemployment down among other 
things.  Let me tell him that it was on the backs of the 
provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I say to Canadians do not be fooled by the Liberal 
budgets; they are designed to win your votes.  At election time 
clearly say no to old style politics.  I tell the Liberals this 
is the 21st century.  It is time for change.  Welcome to the 
Canadian Alliance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member gave an example of a family of four making $17,000 
that he alleges paid some $2,000 in tax.  For a family of four 
with only $17,000 of income in one person's hands, when we take 
the basic personal amount plus the spousal amount, that is 
$13,000 sheltered already.  That leaves $4,000.  On $4,000 the 
combined federal and provincial income tax is only $1,000.  That 
same family gets about $4,000 of child tax benefits and GST 
credits which means that on a net basis the family making $17,000 
actually receives over $3,000 in its pocket and pays no tax.  I 
believe the member should check his numbers.  Maybe he would like 
to table the numbers in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also made a statement about a family making $40,000 and that 
under the new flat tax because there are four people and there is 
an exemption of $10,000, it pays no tax.  There is no exemption 
for children.  It is for the spouses so there certainly would be 
tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He started off his speech by saying the government should have 
had a budget that would reduce the deficit.  If the member looks 
carefully at the books, he will see that we have not had a 
deficit for four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member like to clarify for the House why he is giving 
numbers which are absolutely wrong? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for the question because it gives me an opportunity to tell him 
how wrong his accounting is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about that family. He said, and I repeat his words, 
that under $17,000 the family will be charged $1,000 but will get 
a GST credit. 
I want to tell him that over and above the $1,000 he is talking 
about, that family pays GST when making purchases. If they get a 
credit back, it is over and above the $1,000 that they are paid.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to the GST issue the member was talking about. 
We can see how he is twisting numbers.  It goes to show how the 
numbers are twisted by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for his question about the $40,000 and what is going to be 
paid and no exemption, I am talking about our proposal, not what 
is there right now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sure all of Canada is very 
proud of the member.  I congratulate his party for what it is 
achieving for what it believes is its view of politics in Canada, 
although I disagree on most issues it has talked about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One issue I do want to mention is that this budget clearly gave 
the top 6% wage earners in the country the biggest tax breaks 
over that period of time.  That is a fact. He was talking about a 
15 year old boy that had to pay a lot of taxes on his very first 
paycheque, yet the government gave the top 6% wage earners the 
highest tax breaks over the long term in the budget.  It 
completely ignored the aspirations of health care, shipbuilding 
and farmers.  I would like his comments on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all I will take 
the compliment the member has given the Canadian Alliance and 
thank him very much.  We do have a different approach on how to 
solve the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is absolutely right that it is the middle class Canadian 
taxpayer that is taking the heavy burden of paying taxes and 
giving money to the government for frivolous spending.  I agree 
with him on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some statistics. Britain recently reduced to 10% the 
maximum rate for low income taxpayers.  Ireland is cutting its 
maximum corporate rate in stages to 12.5% by 2003. Australia is 
implementing substantial personal income tax cuts that will allow 
for 80% of Australian taxpayers to pay no more than 30% maximum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see from this that everyone understands economics and 
that high taxes at the end of the day will kill productivity. 
Even the Minister of Industry agrees with that.  I hope I have 
answered the question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address the budget speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I listened to the member for Waterloo—Wellington 
on the Liberal side when he made his presentation. I was rather 
disappointed in his comments.  I thought they were quite 
inflammatory toward our party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into the budget speech, the member for 
Waterloo—Wellington made reference to the background of our 
party, the Reform Party which is now the Canadian Alliance. I am 
speaking as a member of parliament from the Canadian Alliance 
party.  I want the House and the Canadian people to know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Waterloo—Wellington made some very damaging 
comments as far as I am concerned to the people of faith who 
trust in God and have faith in God.  He made disparaging remarks 
toward people that built this country.  I do not believe those 
comments should go unchallenged.  I am surprised that the Speaker 
did not stand and put an end to what he was saying, so I am going 
to make reference to those comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made very disparaging remarks to people of faith who trust in 
God and trust in Jesus Christ.  I do not think that is acceptable 
nor should they remain unchallenged.  They are the people who 
built this country.  Others came afterward.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals may snicker and smile and I see some of them doing 
that.  It is absolutely unjustified.  I will make very direct 
reference to the comments of the member for Waterloo—Wellington. 
I will certainly stand up for the people in the country who 
believe in God. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning now to my speech on the budget, the budget that was 
handed down certainly has had very little attention in one 
respect.  I know the members in the front row on the government 
side wanted more attention to be paid to it but something which 
overshadowed the budget was the boondoggle in HRDC.  However, 
that was very much directed to the budget because how are funds 
managed when they are allotted to a specific area?  How are they 
managed? That is more important than setting the budget itself. 
HRDC is a prime example.  A lot of dirt is starting to stick to 
members on that side of the House as a result of the HRDC 
boondoggle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new budget was tabled.  The last thing the government wanted 
to happen was to have anybody pay attention to HRDC and how that 
money was being spent.  Look at the new budget. Members opposite 
said they were even offering some tax relief. Unfortunately that 
was all lost in the boondoggle at HRDC and rightly so because 
there is a principle involving morality in how the taxpayers' 
money is spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxpayer is looking very carefully at what the government is 
doing.  The new budget is not prominent in their minds but how 
the money is being managed certainly is very prominent in their 
minds.  I will get to the specifics in the area of defence, for 
which I am the critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government allotted $1.9 billion extra to the defence 
department over three years.  Defence has been in the news a lot 
over the last year and a half.  It has suffered tremendously.  It 
has been starved to death.  There is a crisis in the quality of 
life of military personnel.  There is substantial equipment rust 
out, so much so that one has to question just how combat capable 
our military really is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government came along and offered a $1.9 billion increase 
over three years.  Incrementally that could be chewed up in three 
years just by doing tours overseas and doing a little on the 
quality of life issue faced by our military personnel. The amount 
is not a lot when it is divided over three years.  It will not 
stop the rust out.  It just prolongs the problem.  There has to 
be a substantial infusion of funds to make our forces what they 
should be, combat capable, and to give them the necessary 
equipment to do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand in the House as a member of the Canadian Alliance which 
wants to see some changes in that area. We know that the budget 
is inadequate and insufficient. There has to be a long range 
plan. 
There is no long range plan from this side of the House. 
Everything is done on an ad hoc basis.  The long range plan is 15 
to 20 years down the road.  That is how far one should look. 
Believe me, the Liberals would have the opposition in total 
agreement with a long range plan for the military.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Depending on what the plan is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  It would depend on what the plan is. The 
key point is to make our military combat capable.  We ramp that 
up to 15 or 20 years and, as the member across the way has 
stated, we should include the reserves as part of that.  I 
totally agree with that.  The reserves should be factored in and 
should be part of the whole mobilization plan.  Unfortunately, 
that is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party has recommended that the budget be approximately 2% of 
the GDP by the year 2015.  We ramp up to the year 2015 and that 
is where we would see the budget factoring in around 2% of the 
GDP.  Do hon. members across the way know what the GDP is in our 
country right now?   It is over $900 billion.  In other words, to 
allow for a combat capable force, the budget should be almost 
double what it is right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our budget is just a little over $10 billion.  Our troop numbers 
are still being cut down.  There is still talk about mothballing 
equipment.  There is still talk about disbanding our reserve 
units that live and work among us, in our cities and in our 
towns, the most visible part of the military.  That should not 
happen.  The funding should be at a level that keeps the reserves 
active within the community.  Unfortunately, so much that the 
military does goes unnoticed.  I find that very unfortunate 
because we have a proud military history that we should all be 
teaching our children, if only they knew. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where the Canadian Alliance is coming from.  We see an 
opportunity to really do something positive, to really build that 
feeling of nationalism higher in our country and that opportunity 
is now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened intently to the second member from the Canadian Alliance 
today.  We can dress them up but we cannot take them anywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I basically heard from the first speaker today was that we 
on this side of the House are just a bunch of spenders and that 
the tax cuts we gave in the last budget were minuscule.  The very 
same speaker then said that $2.5 billion more in health care was 
not enough and that they wanted more.  Then I heard the second 
speaker stand and say that he wanted $8 billion more in the 
defence portfolio.  Those members have no idea where any of this 
money will come from.  They must think it is some kind of magic. 
We will give tax reductions and increase spending at the same 
time. It is just wonderful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard them talk about the flat taxes.  I believe it was eight 
years ago that the former Reform Party talked about flat taxes. 
Just about everybody, except the province of Alberta, which wants 
to experiment with this, has given up on the idea of flat taxes. 
Everybody knows that the great wonders that the members opposite 
want to come up with to modernize the system and reduce the 
administration of the taxation system are not feasible with flat 
taxes.  We can do that in a progressive system as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is that a flat tax, by and of itself, is simply 
shifting the tax burden from the lower middle income earners and 
the middle income earners to the higher income earners of this 
country.  That is what the so-called CAs envision.  By the way, I 
also object to their name.  I happen to be a chartered 
accountant, as are some of my colleagues. 
These people are now calling themselves a professional 
designation by stealth.  I suppose we all have to call them CAs 
as well but they certainly do not know much about economics.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member explain how we are to keep ramping up all this 
money and at the same time reduce taxes and have a responsible 
approach to government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the member's 
question and it deserves a very direct answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is wondering where the money will come from.  Why 
does he not ask the HRDC minister how she has such a handle on 
her department?  One place we could certainly address as far as 
waste and abuse is the HRDC department.  To whom does all the 
billions of dollars go? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see a great need in the country for enforcement all the way 
around.  Both the RCMP and the military have suffered greatly at 
the hands of the Liberal government. They barely have an identify 
left.  The military, the RCMP and other enforcement agencies in 
Canada have been starved of funds and the member dares to ask 
what more the government can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accountability and priority are the keys.  What is the priority? 
We have a need for security.  We live in a global environment 
with a lot more threats.  Where better to spend money than on our 
military and our enforcement agencies in the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should look carefully at what his own cabinet is 
doing when it spends money.  He should ask his own constituents 
what they think.  If the member is in touch with his constituents 
he will come to the quick realization that the money is not being 
put to good use. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I commend my colleague for some of the points he has 
made with regard to the Department of National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to ask the member, in response to the hon. 
member opposite, for his comments on what the auditor general 
said about $17 billion not being properly accounted for.  We need 
to recognize that it involves not only the HRDC department but 
also EDC. What is happening here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if my hon. colleague could briefly address that 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Madam Speaker, I could go on for some 
time when it comes to the issue of accountability.  It has been a 
concern to the Canadian people for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the priorities on this side of the House?  I do not 
care whether the member is looking at EDC money, HRDC money, CIDA 
money or any other department where money is allotted, what are 
the checks and balances in the system that would allow for that 
money to be spent in a fair and equitable way?  Unfortunately 
that does not exist on that side of the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds—Grenville, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to join in this debate.  I followed it this 
morning and it has been very interesting.  I will make a quick 
mention about the member who just spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I probably disagree more than I agree with the policies of that 
member's party but certainly the issue of the reserves is 
tremendously important to rural communities.  Any time I can sing 
the praises of the Brockville Rifles I will take the opportunity 
to do so.  Had it not been for the reserves during the ice storm, 
we would have been in real trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now turn my attention to what the budget says about the 
government's environmental agenda.  Over the next four years the 
Government of Canada will invest $700 million into a variety of 
environmental initiatives.  Most of the money is earmarked for 
climate change and the remaining for pollution control, species 
at risk, habitat protection and the development of environmental 
and sustainable development indicators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a closer look at some of these initiatives. The 
government will invest $25 million into a green municipal 
enabling fund to help municipalities and communities assess their 
environmental needs.  One hundred million dollars will go into a 
green municipal investment fund to encourage private sector 
innovation in areas like waste management and water conservation. 
I think this is a very important expenditure, not necessarily in 
terms of the amount of money, because as we can see from the 
debate this morning, we can always argue about the dollars and 
the amounts.  The green municipal investment fund is a roll out 
of the program that was started in Toronto, the Toronto 
atmosphere fund.   What it essentially does is make money 
available at competitive interests rates for retrofitting energy 
efficient technologies.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why I think this type of expenditure is appropriate is that the 
current markets, if we look at the payback requirements for 
business, the return on investment that some of these high tech 
stocks are giving us in the stock market, the return on 
investment that businesses will require for investments is 
perhaps a year at the most.  These environmental technologies are 
much longer term investments.  Without some sort of parallel 
money that is not going against investment options that pay back 
in less than a year, these things would never be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to invest in these technologies because we need to 
demonstrate that they work.  We need to demonstrate that there 
are economic benefits to some of these new types of technologies, 
otherwise we will never get them off the ground and off the 
drafting table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also $100 million for a sustainable development fund to 
develop new technologies, particularly in the areas of clean 
burning coal and new fuel cell development.  In addition, $210 
million over three years will go to the climate change action 
fund, $60 million to the Canadian Foundation for Climate and 
Atmospheric Science and $100 million over the next four years to 
help developing countries deal with climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess I should point out at this point that I will be 
splitting my time with the member for Ottawa Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will also put in $22 million over three years to 
reducing pollution, to stabilize at $9 million per year 
thereafter, as well as $8 million per year to improve the 
environmental health of the Great Lakes, and part of the 
infrastructure program is something being referred to now as 
green infrastructure which will go to sewer and water and the 
types of infrastructure projects that will result in improvements 
in the quality of people's lives in terms of the quality of the 
water that they are drinking.  These investments are very timely 
and definitely significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ministers of energy and the environment will sit down in 
Vancouver at the end of this month and again in the fall to 
hammer out the national implementation strategy on climate 
change.  The Kyoto file is a very interesting file.  If we can 
come up with a strategy that is effective for dealing with our 
greenhouse gas emissions we will go a long way to taking a 
different kind of look at our environmental policy, a longer term 
look that tries to align society's interest with the market's 
interest so that we are not always at odds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some critics have said that $700 million falls short of what is 
required.  I would argue that we will never have enough money if 
we do not spend our money wisely.   Almost three-quarters of a 
billion dollars is certainly a good start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take highways as an example.  The transportation sector 
is the single largest contributor to Canada's total greenhouse 
gas emissions, accounting for 27%.  How do we approach such a 
challenge?  Our highways and infrastructure are fundamental to a 
competitive economy.  The shipping of goods and services back and 
forth is the key to why we are enjoying such growth in our export 
markets.  Rather than putting restrictions on the use of 
highways, we could make changes to the way they are built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a representation from the concrete manufacturers that 
showed me data that said that if we made highways, especially the 
ones that are heavily travelled by trucks, out of concrete as 
opposed to asphalt that it would significantly reduce the amount 
of fuel that would be used.  I think those kinds of creative 
approaches could turn this ship around.  I think all of us would 
agree that we are headed in the wrong direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now want to spend my time on something that is very near and 
dear to my heart.  It is an item in the budget that did not get a 
lot of attention.  It was the announcement by the Minister of 
Finance that $9 million will go to the development of a set of 
sustainability indicators.  I feel that there should have been 
much more fanfare associated with this announcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present public policy is pretty much based on the assumption 
that expanding economic activity or growth is the only road to 
well-being.  This may have been accurate at one time but things 
have changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we measure the rate of a baby's growth it will tell us a lot 
about how well that baby is doing but we cannot take that measure 
and apply it to an adult and get useful information.  We saw 
exchanges just now about numbers, about money, about GDP.  Is 
anyone talking about whether Canadians are happy?  I think the 
GDP as an indicator of well-being falls well short of what I 
think Canadians expect their governments to adopt.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes no distinction between money spent on education and 
money spent on cleaning up after automobile accidents.  While GDP 
mixes good expenses with bad, it takes no account of the unpaid 
work in homes and by volunteers in our communities.  If we did 
not have that, our well-being would be significantly affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>GDP fails to recognize any changes in the availability of 
natural resources.  My background is one of business.  I have 
never hugged a tree in my life but I may start.  If I could draw 
a business analogy, we run the country off the income statement. 
When I say “we” I mean governments at all levels.  We do not 
have a balance sheet.  We are assuming that we can use resources 
and count the economic activity that it generates.  In no way are 
we reconciling these accounts.  In no way are we keeping books 
for future generations.  We have bought into the notion that 
growth is good and that the GDP is a measure of our well-being. I 
really think we need to take another look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Making decisions primarily on the information provided by the 
gross domestic product is like driving a bus and just staring at 
the speedometer.  The GDP speedometer has its place but it does 
not explain some matters of consequence.  The Atlantic cod is a 
classic example.  The fisheries contribution to GDP was rising 
steadily, right up to the day the stocks disappeared. Another 
instrument on the dashboard, something that gave us some 
indication of the health of the stocks, could have provided 
information which would have stimulated action to steer clear of 
the disaster that followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dashboard of any modern society should be equipped with a 
broad range of instruments to indicate changes in natural 
resource stocks, pollution levels, biodiversity, the durability 
of goods, employment satisfaction, the quality of education and 
health care, leisure time, unpaid work, crime and other factors 
of consequence.  The political reality is that while for years 
politicians have driven the bus looking only at the speedometer, 
the people are looking out the windows.  They are getting more 
and more concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we count and what we measure signifies what we value.  When 
all we count is money, talk about the environment and social 
cohesion does not produce action.  When we legitimize other 
factors by measuring and reporting on them in our core measure of 
progress they become visible.  This visibility enables anyone to 
see how policies and actions affect the measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increased awareness of causes and effects will naturally incline 
decision makers to consider how their decisions might affect the 
measures, and management processes will evolve to seek well-being 
in a broader context.  Once we understand the possibilities that 
improved measures offer, we will never again accept a system that 
relies on a narrow economic perspective.  It is not unlike the 
ISO process that businesses have gone through.  It is simply 
accountability and transparency that the country has never seen 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, long after we have spent our tax cut on the 
public policy implications of developing and reporting on a set 
of sustainable indicators, we will be paying dividends for not 
only Canadians today but for every generation that follows us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened with great pride to my 
hon. colleague and good friend from the backbenches of the 
Liberal Party.  He took a turn in the debate on the budget and 
talked about initiatives and issues on the environment which are 
very serious to the New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member has a private member's bill before the 
House now which I support. It is a great initiative.  I only hope 
that the frontbench of his party will give the attention to that 
bill that someone like me might give to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the hon. member.  With environmental 
legislation and regulations going through wherein provinces and 
municipalities have so much of a say in how they are 
incorporated, how does he see working closely with provinces and 
municipalities on this budget or future budgets of any 
government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in the Halifax-Dartmouth harbour we are pumping raw 
sewage into the harbour.  We have done that for over 200 years. 
How does he propose that his government would work with that 
municipality to keep it in public hands and to maintain the 
protection of our waters, harbours, bays and inlets? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
an interesting question.  When I look at the budget and the 
approach of the government to the whole issue of the environment, 
not necessarily in a partisan way, by earmarking the 
infrastructure program in the short term to go to green projects 
we are sending a very clear message that although new city halls 
might be nice we do not have enough money to go down that road 
like we did in the last one.  We have to earmark for things like 
sewer and water.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I keep coming back to the larger issue.  As the hon. member said 
I do have a private member's bill but this is certainly not my 
idea.  I caught the wave of the indicators because I saw the 
inherent logic of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can engage Canadians.  Canadians can have a measure to find 
out if their well-being is increasing or decreasing in things 
like literacy, mortality and mobility rates.  Statistics Canada 
already keeps track of many of these things.  The first step is 
to look historically at the environmental movement.  I say this 
as an outsider.  It has constantly butt heads with economic 
factors.  It must be very frustrating to be an environmentalist 
because money does not talk.  It swears and they keep losing, 
losing and losing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to step back and engage Canadians.  Let us start 
reporting on the state of the environment in Canada.  If we can 
engage Canadians then governments can be dragged along, kicking 
and screaming.  They will follow.  That is why I underscore the 
significance of the indicators announcement.  It is a long term 
strategy but it will go a long way to changing our approach so 
that we align economics with the best interest of society and the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the member an example.  Germany has a program called 
lifetime products stewardship.  If one builds a washing machine, 
sells it and it breaks, one has to take it back.  It does not go 
to a landfill site.  Let us look at what has happened over time. 
If we take a look at the workings of a washing machine, a very 
large percentage of the parts is being recycled.  The bracket 
that holds the motor is the same bracket that holds the 
compressor in a refrigerator or the picture tube in a television 
set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For people watching at home, they should turn their sets around 
and look at how many different screws are in their televisions. 
That is built-in obsolescence.  That all ends up in landfill 
sites.  As a result of the law in Germany they have better 
products.  They are cheaper to make.  They last longer.  They are 
cheaper to repair.  At the end of the day the environment wins, 
the economy wins and society wins because consumers are paying 
less for goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have gone far enough with the notion that the economy and the 
environment are at loggerheads.  We need to shift the sands and 
take a different approach.  It starts with Canadians being 
informed about problems and priorities.  A set of indicators, not 
unlike what the auditor general reports on finances every year, 
will engage Canadians.  They will demand that their politicians 
start making decisions that are in the best interest of not only 
the economy but society and the environment as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
delighted to speak to the budget items before the House today.  I 
remember when we were on the opposition side and the government 
of the day was running huge deficit after huge deficit, day after 
day.  The economy was at an all time low.  We had a high 
inflation rate, a high unemployment rate and high interest rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we came to power back in 1993 we were faced with a 
situation where we had in excess of a $42 billion deficit, a huge 
debt, very high unemployment and high interest rates.  Less than 
five years in office we were able, with the leadership of the 
Prime Minister, his cabinet and his caucus, to bring things under 
control, turn things around and not only control the deficit but 
generate a surplus, not only beat down inflation but bring it to 
a very low level and keep it under control.  For the first time 
in more than 30 years we were able to bring unemployment to an 
all time low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would not have been able to do that on our side alone and by 
ourselves.  We needed the co-operation of the Canadian public. We 
needed the co-operation of those in the private sector, the 
public sector and all levels of government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Prime Minister has always indicated, Canadians 
collectively, along with the government, managed to get us out of 
the slump and to meet the economic challenge.  To do that we had 
to make a lot of sacrifices.  We had to cut spending and get rid 
of many things we used to do in the past that because of the 
financial situation we were unable to do any more.  In some cases 
we had to pass on responsibilities of the Government of Canada to 
others who may be able to do it as well as the government was 
doing before, and even in some cases better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the areas of health care and education. Now 
that we have our house in order and the government has been able 
to get the financial situation under control, it is time for us 
to start investing.  I want to be frank.  I am not interested in 
seeing the government throw a load of money at the problem to 
satisfy a particular premier or province.  My constituents are 
not interested in that.  They are demanding a level of 
accountability and a level of responsibility.  The two go hand in 
hand every time the Government of Canada hands down transfer 
payments to a provincial government or other levels of 
government.  My constituents want accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about transfer payments for health care and 
education, my constituents do not want the federal government to 
pass on money to provinces that will not effectively and 
efficiently use the money for those purposes.  They want them to 
use it efficiently and effectively.  They want the provinces to 
respect the five principles of health care.  They want the 
provincial governments to move forward, to get out of the past 
and into the future, to stop talking about issues such as primary 
care and to start talking about issues such as the way we improve 
and deliver services, access, and accountability to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way we used to deliver services is not applicable any more. 
In the past our population was not aging at the speed that it is 
aging now.  By the year 2010 or 2015 we will have double the 
number of senior citizens as we had in the past or have in the 
present.  We have an aging population and as such we need to move 
the health care system from an institutional type of setting into 
the community where we will have more home care support and 
services, more services through community centres and through 
frontline agencies and organizations.  Then we could provide more 
and better services than we had in the past or what we are doing 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it means we have to bring the provinces, the territories and 
other levels of government kicking and screaming into the this 
century, my constituents would support the government and 
continue to support it 100%.  The status quo is simply and purely 
not working any more.  We have to introduce new ways to provide 
services to Canadians across the country in the areas of health 
care and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health have 
called on the provincial ministers of health and the premiers of 
the provinces to come together to talk about ways to deliver the 
health care system in a more efficient, effective and responsive 
way.  Then Canadians would receive a return on their investment 
and the appropriate service they so much deserve and need.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a question of simply increasing the transfer payments 
to the provinces and that is the end of it, the problem is 
solved.  Far from it.  I bet we could fill this House and five 
houses on top of it with hundreds of millions of dollars, even 
billions, but unless the structure is changed and the way we 
deliver those services is changed we will have the same problem 
15 or 20 years from now.  We could have a band-aid solution and 
we could buy our way out of the problem in the short term, but in 
the long term we have to look at the structure of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing applies in the area of education.  When we talk 
about education we talk about young children who have not yet 
reached the educational system, or those who were born three, 
four, five or ten years ago who are entering the system.  If we 
want to reform the educational system, that is the area which 
must be our priority.  That is the area into which we have to put 
our investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the election of 1993 this government made an unequivocal 
commitment that, should the provincial governments agree, we 
would have a national child care program whereby all of the 
different partners would come together.  Guess what?  One 
province after the other stood to denounce the federal government 
for intruding into provincial jurisdiction, yet they turned 
around and said “But give us the money”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not want it to be handed down from the federal 
government to the provincial governments without any 
accountability, without a tangible partnership that we can 
measure and see.  To that extent, here again the Prime Minister 
has called on the provincial premiers to come together to develop 
a national strategy to deal with our children and youth, and to 
have a system which responds to the needs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the two challenges facing us in the days, months and 
years to come.  My colleagues on both sides of the House of 
Commons have a responsibility and a mandate to go to their 
provincial colleagues and stress to them the importance of 
working collectively as partners to respond to the needs of 
Canadians, not to stand in the House and say that if we spray 
more money on the problems the problems might go away.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
distinguished colleague, the member for Ottawa Centre, boasted 
naturally, as he should and by the book, about the latest budget 
of the Minister of Finance.  However, formulating a budget is 
not the be all end all; the money still has to be well managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite randomly, the HDRC internal auditors pulled out 459 files, 
for a sort of Léger and Léger poll, and in 80% of them, they 
found malfeasance or dubious cases.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member for Ottawa Centre agree to have an outside 
inquiry examine the entire 11,000 files of the department, in 
order to shed light on this administration? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Doing so could reveal that amounts of $1 billion or $3 billion 
were not mismanaged, given to friends of the government as was 
the case in the riding of Brant, or Cornwall or Saint-Maurice, 
the riding of the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very embarrassing for a government to be seen to be badly 
managing the Department of Human Resources Development, as it 
penalizes the poor workers, only 42% of whom qualify for 
employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague from Ottawa Centre agree to having a full and 
exhaustive inquiry—we know that 14 RCMP investigations are 
currently underway—so we may discover from each of the HRDC files 
from the past four years whether public funds have been properly 
managed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members are certainly aware that a good budget warrants having 
100% of the funds well managed.  The government has no right to 
spend public money left and right essentially to buy votes in 
the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B> Madam Speaker, first, we must pay careful 
attention to the fact that there are two issues involved here. 
One is the fact that the hon. member wants greater transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards that aspect, the auditor general has already said 
that he was taking a close look at these files. He will submit 
his report by the end of the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, I can 
assure you that, here in Canada, we manage our affairs much more 
effectively than anywhere else in the world. The Canadian 
government is very transparent, much more so than any other in 
the world. I am convinced that nowhere in the world, including 
among the provinces, territories, North American countries, 
African states, European nations or Asian countries, is there a 
more transparent government than this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue raised in the House is that the other opposition 
party wants the government to do its share once and for all in 
terms of assistance to the Canadian regions and ridings that 
need such help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the hon. member if he believes that this government 
should stop helping Canadians, which would deprive them of 
opportunities, of a bridge, of better options generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure him that, in my riding of Ottawa Centre, people 
want the government to continue to take care of public money as 
it has been doing for the past six years. My constituents are 
very pleased by the way this government has been managing public 
finances. 
They also want to tell the hon. member that they would rather 
wait until the end of the year and read the auditor general's 
report.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Madam

at the superlatives used by the member for Ottawa Centre.  I 
urge him to tone down the hype. In the coming weeks, his 
government may be shown to be not as transparent and lily-white 
as he would like us to think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit much to be told that things are better run here than 
anywhere else in the world, or in any other province, when we 
know that the financial difficulties the provinces are facing 
are largely the result of this government's budget decisions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year, I take a certain pride in rising in the House on 
behalf of my constituents to speak to the Minister of Finance's 
budget statement.  It is my duty as a parliamentarian to respect 
the sacred principle of responsible government for which our 
brave Patriotes fought more than a century and a half ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, in his budget for 2000-01, the Minister of Finance 
has turned a deaf ear to the expectations and concerns of the 
public. 
Yet last fall the Bloc Quebecois had taken the trouble to 
consult members of the public in order to find out what they 
thought about how the government was spending their money and to 
relay this back to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to warmly thank all the 
social and economic stakeholders—members of the business 
community, university students, union representatives and 
community workers—in Verchères—Les-Patriotes and throughout Quebec 
who were good enough to share their views on this issue during 
the prebudget consultations and exchanges that took place after 
the budget was brought down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would particularly like to mention the contribution made in 
Verchères—Les Patriotes by representatives of the Association des 
gens d'affaires de Boucherville, the Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu and 
Montérégie Association féminine d'éducation et d'action sociale, 
the Carrefour jeunesse-emploi de Marguerite d'Youville and the 
Lajemmerais Centre local de développement.  However, the fact of 
the matter is that the Minister of Finance paid very little 
attention to what they had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax relief, particularly for the middle class; an increase in 
transfer payments to the provinces for health, postsecondary 
education and income support; lower EI premiums and an improved 
EI system; creation of a solid investment program, particularly 
with respect to municipal infrastructures; and gradual and 
balanced debt reduction are all approaches the public would like 
the government to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the feigned focus on the objectives defined by the 
public as priorities, none has been attained.  This government 
has made much of reducing taxes but has, in actual fact, done 
very little.  With the considerable latitude available to the 
Minister of Finance, we might well have expected to see some 
response to the expectations of those who, like the Bloc 
Quebecois, have called for a tax cut in the order of $6 billion 
this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With anticipated surpluses of close to $150 billion by the year 
2004, federal tax reductions for Quebec will in fact total only 
$3.3 billion over three years.  In comparison, the tax cuts 
announced a few days later by the Government of Quebec are far 
more significant, despite the infinitely more modest resources 
available to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal plan to reduce the tax burden focuses mainly on 
indexed tax tables and the progressive elimination of the 5% 
surtax, and these measures will not do much for the least well 
off and the middle class. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It needs to be pointed out particularly that the indexation of 
tax tables does not constitute a tax cut.  It is solely intended 
to avoid having the taxpayer's taxes raised merely because the 
tax tables are not indexed.  This is something we have been 
calling for since 1994.  After pocketing close to $17 billion 
too much, the government has now decided to finally act and to 
index the tax tables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation as far as the transfer payments to the provinces 
are concerned is not much better. 
To enable them to better meet the crying needs in health and 
education, the provinces were expecting a federal reinvestment 
of about $4.2 billion, this year, in social transfers. Instead, 
the Minister of Finance chose to allocate a measly $2.5 billion 
over a four-year period. That amount is not enough to make up for 
the $32.5 billion approximately in cuts made by the federal 
government since 1994 to transfers to the provinces, including 
over 50% in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government deprived the provinces of $32.5 billion, then 
gave them a measly $2.5 billion over a four-year period. And it 
expects them to be grateful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of reduced budgets, partly because of the federal cuts, 
this year Quebec will invest 14 times more new money in health 
than the federal government, and eight times more in education. 
This is significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what about the federal government's tendency to get involved 
in provincial jurisdictions in an increasingly insidious and 
underhanded fashion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to cover its intrusions in education, for example, the 
federal government talks about knowledge economy, the 
development of new skills, the importance of skills and 
knowledge, research assistance, technological innovation, and it 
sprinkles millions of dollars of public money in various 
foundations and trusts, which it created itself and which are 
not subject to parliamentary scrutiny, instead of transferring 
the money directly to the provinces, to allow them to manage it 
based on their specific needs and priorities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As it invests hundreds of millions of dollars in these 
foundations and trusts, almost guaranteed sources of dispute 
with the provinces, citing the sacred challenge of research and 
technological innovation, it forces the Tokamak project to close 
by withdrawing the modest $7.2 million it had invested annually 
in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wonder whether the federal government has not withdrawn from 
the most important energy research and development project in 
Quebec, simply because it could not handle working in 
partnership with the Government of Quebec. 
No, really, it is distressing to watch the federal government 
strutting about as it has after such a disappointing budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance is another case in which the federal 
government cuts a pitiful figure.  It will continue in fact to 
pocket billions of dollars on the backs of the unemployed. 
Again this year, the government will be taking in over 
$5.5 billion, thanks to the surpluses generated by the employment 
insurance fund.  The chief actuary pointed out that, by the end 
of 2000, the government will have drawn off $31.5 billion in 
surplus since the start of its mandate from the employment 
insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This actuary also said that an amount of between $10 billion and 
$15 billion would be more than ample to meet any increase in 
costs arising from a recession. 
So, the Minister of Finance has taken between $15 billion and 
$20 billion too much out of the pockets of workers and employers 
over the past seven years, thus depriving six unemployed people 
in ten of the benefits of the employment insurance plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note, in this regard, that the minister 
acknowledged candidly in his budget speech that “these rates 
will keep coming down to the point where they cover just the 
costs of the EI program itself”.  What a candid admission of 
guilt.  The minister acknowledges that the rates are higher than 
those needed by the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is keeping him from immediately lowering the contribution 
rates so that they just cover the program's requirements and no 
more, starting right now?  Perhaps instead he should improve the 
plan by increasing benefits and making eligibility criteria more 
flexible so that benefits will be available to more than the two 
young unemployed persons out of ten who can currently qualify? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one realizes that the government has reaped more benefit 
out of the employment insurance plan than the unemployed have in 
the past six or seven years, there is good reason to ask some 
serious questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces and the municipalities which have been demanding 
the implementation of a new infrastructure program from the 
federal government will also be disappointed.  The Bloc 
Quebecois recommendation to the federal government was for an 
investment of $3 billion this year into infrastructure related 
projects. 
In order to meet the numerous expectations in this area, part of 
this funding could have been invested in a support program for 
the shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The municipalities were calling for $1 billion annually over 15 
years to be invested by the federal government in 
infrastructures.  Ottawa turned a deaf ear and plans to inject a 
mere $100 million into infrastructures this year.  The 
municipalities will get this $1 billion from the federal 
government in the long run, but over six years only, not 
annually as they had requested.  Contrary to all expectations, 
the federal government's efforts seem to be equally timid and 
insufficient as far as reimbursement of the debt is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, this budget gives us the impression that the 
federal government is trying to get the public to swallow a 
sugar pill.  They would have us believe that they have addressed 
the real problems and responded to the real expectations of the 
public by really laying into public finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, close to $80 billion have flowed into the coffers of 
this government, which passes itself off as a good manager, 
without its having to make the least effort. 
It leaned on others to come up with the surplus that it now has 
and that it is doing such a bad job of administering: $31 billion 
were siphoned away from workers and employers at the expense of 
the unemployed; the provinces kicked in their $32 and a half 
billion as a result of cuts and have been wrestling with major 
problems in their health care and education systems every since; 
and, because the federal government refused to index the tax 
tables, another $17 billion quietly built up in its coffers.

federal government to get its fiscal house in order thanked?  In 
dribs and drabs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By distributing its favours right and left, the Liberal 
government has shown that it is not yet free of its old 
spend-thrift demons.  By handing out money all over the place, it 
has made the decision not to focus its efforts on a limited 
number of budgetary items that are felt to be priorities, with 
the disappointing result that none of its investments have any 
real impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as a tree can be identified by the fruit it bears, so can a 
good government be identified by its actions. 
There is no getting around the fact that, with this budget, 
Ottawa has once again put itself on the map as the capital of 
broken dreams and promises.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member went over a number of items.  I started to add 
them up and I lost track of the number of ways he wanted to spend 
additional money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about additional tax cuts.  He said that the 
deindexation was not a tax break for Canadians because it had to 
be done.  He wanted more.  He said there were no real tax breaks 
and he wanted more tax breaks.  I do not know how much he would 
like to add to the spending of the government in terms of reduced 
taxation. He talked about EI, another $5 billion to deal with the 
national surplus.  He talked about another $1 billion for 
shipbuilding. He also talked about the need for health care 
spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should consider that the revenues coming into 
the government through income taxes, payroll taxes, et cetera, 
all go into the same pool of funds.  The funds that Canadians 
contribute are available to take care of programs.  Right now we 
are presenting a balanced budget.  With that balanced budget the 
member is saying he wants $5 billion here, another $5 billion 
there, another $1 billion for shipbuilding and another amount, I 
do not know how much as he was not specific, on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If those expenditures or tax reductions are to be delivered, the 
money has to come from somewhere.  If the member is suggesting 
that there should have been another $5 billion to $15 billion 
expended in the budget for tax reduction, EI reduction, health 
care, et cetera, what would he cut year after year after year in 
order to fund those additional expenditures or tax reductions? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously, the hon. member 
heard my speech, but he did not understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He claims that I said that the government's budget does not 
include tax cuts. He is surprised that I would make such a 
statement. I did not say that the budget does not include tax 
cuts and I ask the member to listen to my reply, because it 
might help him not only hear it, but also understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never claimed that the budget does not include tax cuts. I 
simply said that, based on the public's expectations, these tax 
cuts were inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fact that the indexing of tax tables is not a tax cut. 
This only means that taxes will not increase next year, as they 
otherwise would have with non-indexation. This is, for all 
intents and purposes, much more a freeze than a cut. In the long 
term, it obviously means savings for taxpayers, but it is not a 
tax cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the reduction of the 5% surtax will benefit the rich much 
more than the middle class and the poor, who have been the 
primary targets of the Liberals' initiatives to put their fiscal 
house in order, since 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asked where the money would come from. He seemed to 
be implying that I was proposing an increase in spending. I want 
to make it clear to him that I never suggested investing $1 
billion annually in a shipbuilding policy. 
What I said is that the municipalities and the provinces were 
asking for annual investments of about $1 billion, over a 15 
year period, in infrastructures. The government is obviously not 
meeting these expectations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of this money could have been used in conjunction with a 
policy on shipbuilding, a policy on the shipbuilding industry, 
as all the premiers requested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to the member's question about where the money will 
come from.  I say quite simply to our Liberal friends that they 
should not fall back into their bad old habit of sprinkling 
their generosity about here and there, they should focus the 
budget on a number of priority items, such as tax reductions and 
transfers to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has decided to invest in foundations and trusts 
outside parliamentary control and appoint as members of their 
boards individuals over whom it has good control. 
These trusts will intervene in the fields of education or health 
care or both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of millions being invested in a given trust, we see that 
nearly 80 of these trusts and foundations have been created 
since 1994.  The government should stop investing millions of 
dollars here and there, take all this money and consolidate it 
in a single transfer payment to the provinces.  They are best 
equipped to deal with the problems facing them in the fields of 
health care and education. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
support what my colleague from Verchères—Les-Patriotes said at the 
start of his speech about the hon. member for Ottawa Centre. I 
have heard some questionable praise of this government and of 
this country, which is “the best in the world” and which is 
totally without scandal or anything else negative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is really hiding one's head in the sand like an ostrich. 
The house is burning down, but “Everything's fine, just great, 
so worry not”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it almost boring to take part in this debate on the 
budget, because it ought to pass without any comment.  The good 
news that has been so long awaited has been put off until later. 
It has been put off until the next time there is an election 
campaign, this fall; maybe they will make it part of their 
platform. 
This is why they have put off the tax cuts until 2001 and 2002. 
Taxes will be lowered later; we will have to wait.  As I have 
already said, it will likely be announced during the election 
campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the federal government had a clearly sufficient margin of 
manoeuvrability by this year to step up its efforts to reduce 
the tax burden.  They are telling the taxpayers to be patient. 
It will take another few years for individuals, families and 
businesses to really be able to profit from the tax breaks 
announced by the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the indexation of the tax tables, the Bloc Quebecois has 
been calling for this measure ever since 1993.  Since 1994 the 
Minister of Finance has got $17 billion from the pockets of 
taxpayers. That is clear: $17 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did he not do it earlier?  Because it was very lucrative. 
The federal government did not index the tax tables earlier 
because this was how it came up with $17 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out to those listening, who are perhaps not 
familiar with this issue, that indexing the tax tables does not 
mean that taxes will go down.  My colleague explained this 
earlier.  It merely means that next year an individual's taxes 
will not go up.  Indexing the tax tables merely means that 
people will not pay more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big losers in this budget are the provinces.  In fact, the 
Minister of Finance refused to go along with the premiers' 
urgent demand for a permanent increase in the cash portion of 
the social transfer intended for health, social assistance and 
postsecondary education.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces demanded that the Canada social transfer be 
restored to the 1993-94 level.  I was elected in 1993, at which 
time I was the health critic.  Unless I am mistaken, things have 
been going badly in that sector since the Canada social transfer 
was slashed and separate payments were combined into one smaller 
amount, which was handed over to the provinces with the order to 
find a way to make it cover health, social assistance and 
postsecondary education. These billions of dollars in cuts left 
the provinces in a very difficult situation, particularly in the 
health care sector, where needs are growing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often mention that the population is aging, that new 
technologies are increasingly costly, but the federal government 
turns a deaf ear and makes cuts to eliminate its deficit, on the 
backs of the poor and the sick. It passes the bill on to the 
provinces and then says “The problem is that the provinces do 
not manage their affairs properly”. But the public is not 
stupid. It can see that, by squeezing the provinces, this 
government has forced them to reduce their services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance tells us that he did provide an 
increase. But he did not increase the Canada social transfer. He 
took $2.5 billion, put it in a trust and told the provinces “You 
are entitled to a prorated amount, you are entitled to a few 
million, based on conditions set by me”. This is all because of 
the social union. We were right when we said that the provinces 
sold their birthright for a pittance. 
This is how it happened. The provinces are now forced to beg and 
to implore the big boss, who has the money, and say “Please give 
us some money, because we have people who are dying of hunger”. 
This is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of fully restoring the Canada social transfer, which is 
supposed to meet the public's needs, the Minister of Finance 
preferred to start another legal battle by establishing this 
independent trust which will have, in my opinion, a totally 
inadequate budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem generated by this budget is that of social 
housing and infrastructures. In the case of social housing, it 
is nothing short of outrageous. The government did not even 
allocate any money, except a few dollars to renovate housing 
units that are in a state of disrepair. But we are asking for 
social housing for the poor. We are asking for new units, not 
just minor renovations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard Liberal Party colleagues boasting about the sums they 
supposedly invested in social housing. However, if members look 
at the budget, they will have a hard time finding funds for 
social housing.  It is like looking for a needle in the 
haystack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois asked the minister to inject $3 billion into 
an infrastructure program, including $1.7 billion for social 
housing.  The request had the support of all the community 
groups, such as FRAPRU in Quebec, which looks after social 
housing for the most disadvantaged.  It supported the proposal, 
because the need is there and to the extent of at least $1.7 
billion.  When the government says it looks after the poor in 
this budget, well, we can forget about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, the government announced provision for infrastructures 
in municipalities and urban and rural communities.  In the first 
year, it will provide $100 million for all the provinces. 
But, Quebec's share of this will be between $20 and $25 million. 
Given that five kilometres of road costs about $1 million, does 
the government think we are going to go far with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is worse to come—the employment insurance plan.  This 
budget provides no improvement to the employment insurance plan. 
There is simply a reduction in contribution rates of 10 cents a 
year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not say it too loud, because I do not think the Liberals 
have emphasized it much.  Ten cents a year is so ridiculous.  In 
four years, it will be 40 cents.  Applause, applause, employment 
insurance contributions will go down a whole 40 cents.  This is 
scandalous and unacceptable, because the Minister of Finance is 
using this fund as if it were his milk cow.  He is using the 
unemployed as if they were his milk cows.  The robbery 
continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the chief actuary, the accumulated surplus will be 
up to $31.3 billion by the end of the year 2000. 
To think that the former Celanese employees who were involved in 
a massive layoff this last week, and who have paid into the EI 
fund for 20, 25, 30 or 35 years, will get nothing.  They are not 
even eligible for employment insurance because they got 
separation pay, and that is considered income for determining 
eligibility for employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance had, however, given us a hint of a 
possibility, via the former Minister of Human Resources 
Development, that he would be putting into place an enhanced 
POWA-style program to help these former workers with 35 years of 
service, who have always paid into the EI fund. These workers 
have no prospects of help, and find themselves in a desperate 
situation and forced onto welfare.  This is a horrible and 
unacceptable situation.

colleague from the Bloc Quebecois party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has completely abandoned its moral 
obligation toward health care and has thus forced the provinces 
looking at other avenues for more privatization of health care in 
terms of user fees and everything else.  In fact the premier of 
my province of Nova Scotia is now talking about user fees for 
some forms of health care and other forms of doctors appointments 
and so on. We hope that does not happen in the next budget.  We 
also notice in the province of Quebec that one of the hospitals 
is initiating some sort of user fee system for some aspects of 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member think that is the way the provinces should 
go or should the federal government actually start to live up to 
its obligations to health care and to the five principles which 
it originally signed on to. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for this 
fine question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I believe there is no room for a two tier system.  If 
Quebec does become sovereign one day, these conditions, the five 
great principles the Canada Health Act incorporated, will 
remain.  I think we have a good health insurance plan in Canada. 
It also covers all of the most disadvantaged.  Everyone can 
therefore obtain treatment without cost. It is accessible, and 
the care is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, at the moment what we are faced with—and it is of some 
concern—is the famous cuts by this government to the Canada 
social transfer, drastic cuts, when the provinces were at a very 
critical point because of the increase in population aging and 
the increased costs of new technologies. 
The provinces were already in a situation of having to cut 
themselves in their management in order to reduce their 
deficits.

the axe to the Canada social transfer, causing the provinces to 
now find themselves faced with desperate needs in terms of the 
sick and of income security.  Cuts had to be made there as well, 
but support must continue to be given to these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is good reason then for the appearance of other means, 
such as private industry. It sees in this a share of the market. 
By wanting to restore a system with shorter waiting lists and 
better care, it is facing off with the governments.  Private 
enterprise is putting enormous pressure on the governments. 
The governments must really make sure they can maintain all 
health care services by not losing sight of these five 
fundamental principles.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this truly is a watershed budget for Canadians.  After 
seven years of sacrifice, of seeing treasured programs reduced 
and bracket creep eat up more and more of their family incomes, 
Canadians finally can see the benefits of the long period of 
restraint which has addressed our overspending, which has produced 
two surplus budgets in a row.  It is finally providing the kind 
of tax relief and reinvestment in our social programs and the 
future of our economy that Canadians want to see to create a 
better future for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was privileged during the course of the discussions leading up 
to the 2000 budget to have the benefit of significant and 
important input from my constituents in Ottawa West—Nepean.  In 
the fall we held a prebudget consultation meeting and I was very 
pleased that there was lively and well-informed discussion. 
The discussion focused not only on the long term and short term 
interests of individuals in my constituency but just as 
important, the long term interests of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also distributed a survey during our door to door visits last 
summer and throughout the fall, at various meetings and in my 
fall householder.  There was a very impressive response.  I want 
to refer to that prebudget survey which was done in Ottawa 
West—Nepean and then talk about how the budget has responded to 
the concerns expressed by my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very clearly the top priority of more than one-third of the 
respondents was personal tax reductions.  The government has 
responded.  The second most important priority was health care. 
The government, notwithstanding the comments of the member from 
the Bloc, has responded.  People were also concerned about the 
environment and the need to invest in new environmental 
solutions. The government has responded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The largest employer in this region now is not the federal 
government.  It is the high tech sector.  People were concerned 
about investment in research, science and technology.  The 
government has responded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we were able to start tax relief in the 1998 budget, we 
have focused most on low and middle income Canadians.  We have 
focused on families with children and the deindexing of tax 
brackets, reducing the tax rate for the middle income bracket, 
raising the amount of basic income that is exempt from income 
tax, raising the level of the middle and top tax brackets and 
eliminating the 5% surtax.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this will lead to a 15% reduction, on average, for all 
Canadians, which does not include the benefits of the tax 
reductions in the last budget, 18% for low and middle income 
families and over 20% for families with children.  All in all, 
more than nine million Canadians will see a reduction in their 
taxes just by changing the middle income tax rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some tax measures as well that were important to this 
region and to the high technology sector.  In the 
telecommunications area, 75% of the activity in that sector 
happens in the national capital region.  It will be of particular 
interest to that sector of the economy that the tax rate for 
service and high tech industries will drop from 28% to 21% over 
the next five years, with the first reduction kicking in by 
January 1, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treatment of stock options, which is a major component of 
compensation for many in the high tech sector, has changed, so 
that they become taxable only when sold.  That is a measure which 
the high tech sector has requested for some time in the interests 
of keeping and retaining highly qualified employees in that 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other important measure to stimulate investment in small 
start-up companies is the rollover of $500,000 which is now 
permitted.  Money which has been invested can now be rolled over 
into a new investment without incurring any capital gains. That 
will be a major generator for investment in somewhat high risk 
but nonetheless extremely important new initiatives in the high 
technology sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also supporting the foundation that feeds those new and 
growing sectors of the economy which will be producing an 
increasing proportion of jobs by funding 2,000 research chairs 
across Canada.  We are ensuring that the basic research necessary 
to keep our economy innovative, growing and providing new 
opportunities for the next generation will continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The investment we have made in this budget in education by 
allowing people to receive far more support for their education 
tax free, from $500 up to $3,000, will make it easier for more 
young people to get a post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that we are putting more money into the Canada 
Foundation for Innovation is another important investment in the 
future of our economy and employment for Canadians.  I should 
mention that one initiative of that foundation is its investment 
in the newly launched National Capital Institute of 
Telecommunications in this region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lest anyone think that the only concern is money, dollars and 
cents, it is not.  Canadians are concerned about health care. 
Notwithstanding what the Bloc member just said, she should 
acknowledge that the transfers to the provinces for health, 
post-secondary education and social services has increased by 25% 
in the last two budgets.  We know that is to make up for cuts 
which had to be made to get our finances in order, but 
notwithstanding what some of the provinces are saying, 33% of all 
public spending in health care is by the federal government. 
That is a fairly significant increase and a significant 
contribution to an area that is primarily a provincial 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to leave time for my colleague to speak, with whom I will 
be splitting my time, so I will only mention very briefly what I 
think is an equally important contribution, and that is the $700 
million that will be committed over the next three years for 
major environmental initiatives.  There will be $210 million over 
three years for green energy development and the climate change 
action fund, and $100 million for a new sustainable development 
technology fund which will help companies develop new 
environmental technologies and bring them to market. 
This will accomplish two things for Canada and the rest of the 
world:  finding solutions to environmental problems and finding 
them in a way that will also benefit the Canadian economy. 
There will be $100 million for a new green municipal investment 
fund, a revolving fund that will leverage private sector 
investment in such areas as waste management and water 
conservation at the municipal level, as well as $90 million over 
three years for a national strategy on species at risk.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only conclude that this is a well balanced budget.  It 
meets the needs of Canadians, their expectations for tax relief 
after a number of years of very stringent financial and economic 
measures, and it also invests very clearly in a better future and 
quality of life for all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the words of the hon. 
member.  It is obvious from all of the surveys that health care 
is the number one issue across Canada.  It is also obvious that, 
no matter what province we travel in, we can pick up a newspaper 
and there will be horror stories about the health care that is 
being provided because of lack of funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that we have an aging population.  We know that modern 
technology in health care requires a great deal more money.  We 
also know that the premise of sharing between the federal 
government and the provinces with the Canada Health Act is really 
based on a formula which is quite simple, 50:50.  That has 
dropped, in some cases, to only 11% from the federal government 
to the provincial government.  Health care is in serious trouble 
in Canada if it is to remain universal, as we would like it to 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the hon. member see having to happen if we are to 
preserve universal health care in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as one who represents 
the riding with the second highest proportion of seniors in the 
country, next only to Victoria, I am well aware of the growing 
need for health care services for seniors and of the demand that 
will placed on our system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first correct something the member said.  He may not have 
heard me, but the fact is that the federal government contributes 
33%, not 11% but 33%, of the public funding for health care in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also should be very well aware that our first priority, our 
first major investment in last year's budget, after we had gotten 
rid of the deficit, was to health care.  We place a great 
importance on health care and on our public health care system. 
In that budget we made a major investment of $11.5 billion, plus 
we eliminated the cap that had been placed on transfers to 
Ontario, B.C. and Alberta.  In Ontario alone that meant nearly $1 
billion extra. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major investment in this budget again was money for health 
care.  In the last two budgets alone we increased by 25% the 
amount of money going to the provinces through the Canadian 
health and social transfer.  That is 25% in just two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now at the highest level ever of federal contributions to 
the provinces in those areas.  We also know that we have to work 
very closely with the provinces to look at better primary health 
care, home care, community care for people, not only as they age, 
but when they are ill and when they are recuperating from 
illnesses.  There is a major job for us to do together to improve 
our health care system.  Money is not the only thing that is 
needed.  We also need new approaches, and community based 
approaches, which I fully support.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to return to the environment for a second.  The hon. member 
mentioned the investment that the Government of Canada will make 
for species at risk.  The legislation to address this will come 
forth in the next little while.  All hon. members know that the 
government has not passed one piece of environmental legislation 
of its own since taking power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the government ignore the species at risk working 
group, which is a coalition of mining consortiums, woodlot 
owners, farming communities and environmental NGOs?  Why would 
the government not accept the investment in time that those 
groups have made?  The Minister of the Environment has chosen to 
ignore that particular initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think 
anything could be further from the truth.  In fact, there are 
some groups that would argue that the legislation for the 
protection of species at risk is not strong enough.  Given that 
we have not yet seen it, I am not sure how anyone could make that 
judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the work of that working group has concerned 
itself with the needs of woodlot owners, agricultural producers 
and so on, as well as the need to balance all of those interests 
to produce legislation that will work in co-operation with the 
federal government, the provincial governments and private 
property owners.  The work of the working group has very much 
guided the development of the legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was here in 1993 when the government 
began to pick up the broken pieces that were left from the 
government we replaced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Be gentle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder:</B>  I will, but I will be honest and 
factual at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be here now, when we are in an era of surpluses 
and we can move forward to embrace the opportunities of the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to talk about those early days.  Many of my 
colleagues were also here in 1993.  They could tell the House 
what it was like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seven years ago this country was at an economic low.  Nine years 
of the Mulroney government had played havoc with our federal 
debt.  Estimates indicated that within eight years the debt had 
increased by $250 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were also left with a $42 billion deficit and we had to pay 
33 cents of every revenue dollar to the interest on the debt. 
This was not paying back the debt, it was just the interest on 
the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unemployment was at 11.4% and high deficits and the resulting 
pressure on interest rates had affected, adversely I may add, 
economic growth and job creation.  If this cycle had been allowed 
to continue Canada would have been in very, very bad shape.  It 
may even have hit the New Zealand wall that everybody talks 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government we made some pretty tough comprises and 
prioritized, down to the absolute detail I might add, and thought 
about the sorts of things that were important to Canadians.  With 
the economy now gaining momentum and new jobs and opportunities 
available to us we are optimistic and we are ready for the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of months before the budget was announced I asked my 
constituents what they thought these investments should look 
like.  The informal survey which I sent out asked them to list in 
the order of priority where they would like to see budget dollars 
spent.  I received approximately 200 responses.  The top three 
priorities— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  HRDC, $1.2 billion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder:</B>  No, Mr. Speaker, the member is 
absolutely wrong.  The landslide was for tax reduction, health 
care investments and debt reduction.  That is what the survey 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Where did the government put the HRDC 
money then? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is typical of the 
Tories.  They are just out of touch.  That is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Important to my constituents also were environmental projects 
and job initiatives.  These priorities were right in line with 
what the budget delivered.  I cannot help but feel good about 
this budget when its top priorities were the same top priorities 
identified by my constituents.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget 2000 has something for everybody.  Let us take a look at 
the tax cuts.  Personal income taxes are being cut by an average 
of 15%.  For families with children, they are going to be cut by 
21% over five years and middle class families will receive a 
break of 23% from 26%.  Restoring full indexation of the personal 
income tax system, which is something that took everybody by 
surprise, will end bracket creep caused by inflation.  This means 
that Canadians will be able to earn more tax free income and more 
of their income will be taxed at a lower rate.  It is a good 
deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are lowering taxes when the nation's finances allow us to do 
so.  These cuts have already been paid for through three 
consecutive balanced budgets.  I want to make perfectly clear 
that we are not borrowing the money to pay for these cuts like 
the Mike Harris government has been doing in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make strides in our economy it takes more than lowering 
personal income tax.  The budget will also help small businesses 
in my riding and across the country by lowering their tax rates. 
The budget also proposes to spur investment and encourage 
entrepreneurship by lowering capital gains tax, by taxing stock 
options only when the shares are sold, and by allowing a $500,000 
tax free rollover for new ventures.   It will also help by 
increasing resources available through the community futures 
program.  This program delivers economic support to small and 
rural communities in the form of mentoring services, business 
counselling, training and loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a sound investment the budget provides for health care and 
quality of life for Canadians.  Building on the 1999 health care 
announcement, the budget increases the Canada health and social 
transfer payments to the provinces and the territories by $2.5 
billion for health care and education.  This means that the CHST 
will reach an all time high of almost $31 billion for the 2000-01 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last two years the federal cash support for health care 
and education in Ontario increased by 24%.  The government 
provides transfers to health care in Ontario through cash and 
through tax points under the Canada health and social transfer. I 
want to stress a point that does not come out very often but 
should.  All contributions taken into consideration, the federal 
government now provides in excess of 33 cents of every public 
dollar spent by governments in Canada.  My constituents want us 
to continue our responsible fiscal management and to continue 
paying down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As budget 2000 reports from 1997 to 1998 when the budget was 
first balanced and through to 2000 to 2002, the growth in program 
spending will be held roughly to the growth in population and 
inflation.  The unemployment rate is 4.5% lower than the 11.4% 
the government inherited shortly after taking office in October 
1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 1.8 million new jobs have been created since then.  The 
budget continues the principles under the debt repayment plan, 
setting aside a $3 billion contingency reserve each year to 
ensure a balanced budget.  If we do not need the reserve it 
automatically goes to debt repayment.  Previous governments set 
aside long term deficit targets that were never met.  This 
government's approach to budgeting is to set credible two year 
rolling deficit targets.  This means the government is held 
accountable on a continuous basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many more important investments outlined in the budget 
to make Canada more innovative such as in new technology and 
leading edge research and innovation in research hospitals, 
universities and the private sector.  There are many supports for 
the environmental initiatives of clean air, water and health 
habitats.  On the community level there are $25 million to help 
municipalities and communities to determine best approaches 
toward waste management, renewable energy, water conservation, 
and the list goes on.  There are $100 million in a revolving 
fund, the green municipal investment fund, to support projects in 
areas such as sustainable communities, urban transit, energy and 
water savings, and the list goes on.

environment.  With the headwaters of three rivers, the Credit, 
the Humber and the Saugeen, plus the Grand River system and 
Nottawasaga in my riding, they are very interested in initiatives 
that can help in their protection.  The creation of a new 
sustainable development technology fund will help companies 
develop new environmental technologies and bring them to market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another initiative, building on local efforts to preserve 
natural habitats and species, the federal government is cutting 
by half the capital gains tax arising from donations to 
ecologically sensitive lands and will be providing $90 million 
over three years to protect species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other initiatives include increasing the tax exemption for 
income from scholarships.  That was one I pushed for.  It has 
been increased from $500 to $3,000.  There will be $90 million 
over three years to strengthen the government's ability to 
regulate biotechnology products and processes, and $160 million 
over two years so that federal government services will be 
offered to Canadians on line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a proposal to work out a multi-year agreement with 
the provinces and the private sector to improve highways and 
municipal infrastructure, including green infrastructure and 
affordable housing in urban and rural communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents were happy with the budget.  I have not to date 
received one phone call complaining about the budget.  I can 
remember back in 1993 my fax machine going crazy.   We could not 
keep paper in it.  There were no tax increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents were afraid that we were going to be like the 
previous government.  We are not.  Canadians are very comfortable

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
did the hon. member who just spoke so eloquently in the House 
also inform his constituents that the GST and the NAFTA, which 
the government was to get rid of, are still in place?  Promises 
were made by the 1993 Liberal government the member talked about, 
but they were not kept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the member tell his constituents that in 1993 there were 
approximately $16.8 billion in health care, which in 1998 dropped 
to $12.6 billion or a reduction of some $4.2 billion from 1993 to 
1998?  Did the hon. member tell his constituents that the reason 
health care has such a problem right now is that the Liberals 
took the money out of the budget in the first place?  Did he tell 
them that $2.5 billion which the government talked about in the 
budget was over four years, and not $2.5 billion this year? Did 
the member tell his constituents these facts before he sent out 
the survey? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the short answer to that 
question is yes, and they agreed with what we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member across the way talked about the GST.  One of the 
first things I told my constituents in the 1993 campaign was that 
whatever we do with the GST it generates $18 billion worth of 
revenue for the government, that the government needs that money, 
and that if we do away with the tax we will run an extra $18 
billion deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last six and a half years the government has not only 
solved these problems but are now in the black.  The previous 
government could not get its act together in this regard.  The 
short answer to his question is yes, my constituents knew about 
all decisions the government was making and agreed with them, 
because I am back here for a second term.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very glad to have an opportunity to take part in the budget 
debate.  I should say at the start that I will be splitting my 
time with the member for Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make use of the time I have by pointing out not 
only what the budget does but certainly what it fails to do and 
how it affects my riding of Winnipeg Centre.  I would like to 
point out missed opportunities.  I would like to point out where 
the government has been out and out negligent and irresponsible 
in not doing obvious things that needed to be done and choosing 
as a priority to do things that were politically expedient and 
politically to its advantage.  I hope by these arguments, Mr. 
Speaker, that you will be convinced as well that the government 
missed a serious opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I say it is a missed opportunity is that the Minister 
of Finance started this process with a unique problem that we 
have not seen in many years:  a surplus budget, a budget that 
could have been put to use to fix many of the social issues the 
country is demanding be fixed in short order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get the basic premise, let us look at where the surplus came 
from.  The most obvious source from a working person's point of 
view is the EI surplus.  People seem to have forgotten about this 
issue.  The changes the government brought in to employment 
insurance made it more difficult to qualify.  Claimants could 
collect for a shorter period of time and their weekly benefit 
would be reduced.  Obviously the government would have a surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think, even in its wildest dreams, the government would 
have known it would enjoy a windfall of $700 million a month in 
surplus, taken directly out of the pockets of unemployed workers, 
the most vulnerable people arguably in our whole community.  That 
is $700 million a month, not a year.  That is staggering.  We can 
see, as I have said before, it is a perverted sort of Robin Hood 
to rob from the poor and give to the rich in the form of tax 
cuts.  We should be well aware of that before we go into the main 
arguments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government stumbled upon another windfall.  It was a very 
calculated and cynical move which will have repercussions for 
every pension plan across the country.  It took the surplus from 
the public service plan away from the beneficiaries of the public 
service pension plan.  The government did not steal it, but it 
took it right out of that plan to use for whatever it wanted in 
its general revenue. I predict the government will pay the 
political price for taking those surplus revenues out of that 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We noticed the minister responsible for the Treasury Board had 
no sooner done his dastardly deed than he had to leave this 
place.  There was no way politically he could survive taking $30 
billion of surplus out of the public service pension plan, money 
that should have gone to improve the pensions of those 
beneficiaries.  That is the second source of revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not real sound fiscal management that led to the surplus. 
It was the finding of these buckets of money, stumbling across 
these buckets of dough.  Anybody could do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals failed to listen to Canadians in the prebudget 
consultation.  They did tour the country to listen to Canadians. 
Invariably everywhere government members went, Canadians told 
them they wanted one thing done and one thing only.  They wanted 
the health care system fixed once and for all.  There was no 
question.  There was no debate about it.  The number one priority 
was to fix our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did we see done, even though the government had the 
astronomical windfall of a surplus?  The government is giving 
$2.5 billion, not per year but over four years.  And it is not 
just for my province of Manitoba.  It is for the whole country. 
My province of Manitoba's share will be about $20 million a year, 
or enough to keep the hospitals open for two days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The great renewal of spending on health care amounts to two days 
budgeting for the province of Manitoba.  It is so small that it 
is almost insignificant.  It is offensive frankly.  It leads to 
greater cynicism in the electorate because they were consulted. 
They said what they needed and the government did not listen to 
them.  Instead, what did the government choose to do? It chose to 
use the money, which as I pointed out it took from unemployed 
workers to a large degree, for tax cuts for the wealthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For every dollar in tax cuts that is given back into the system, 
two cents goes for health care.  How is that for skewed 
priorities?  Yet when Canadians were asked, tax cuts ranked 
number seven, eight or nine on their list of priorities.  They 
wanted their health care system back.  They wanted post-secondary 
education addressed so their kids would not have to graduate with 
a small mortgage. They wanted all these issues fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians wanted something done about child poverty. I should 
not have to remind members, especially those who have been here 
for any length of time, that in 1989 it was members of parliament 
who passed a unanimous resolution to eliminate child poverty by 
the year 2000. For the first time since 1989, we are in a 
financial position to that, yet no effort has been made to do so. 
Again, I point to a failure on the part of the government 
because the opportunity was there and it chose not to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dante reserved a special depth of his hell for those who had the 
ability to prevent evil and chose not to.  That was the lowest 
depth of Dante's inferno.  Just as obnoxious and just as foul to 
me as those who had the ability to do something noble and 
honourable and elected not to is the failure of the people in 
this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can point to another obvious shortcoming in that those people 
over there cut, hacked and slashed programs for many, many years 
without looking for other sources of revenue or for ways to 
preclude the need to do that, or what they thought was the need. 
Without being vague about it, I will point to one obvious thing 
they could have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I introduced a motion that was passed in the House of Commons a 
year ago to energy retrofit all of our publicly owned buildings. 
The federal government owns 50,000 buildings.  It spends billions 
of dollars a year in energy costs. Many of those buildings are 
outdated, obsolete and are absolute energy hogs.  They waste 
energy and they pollute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we undertook a serious initiative to energy retrofit all our 
publicly owned buildings, we would not only create thousands of 
jobs, we would reduce our operating costs by as much as $1 
billion a year. We would also reduce harmful greenhouse gas 
emissions as per our obligations under the Kyoto convention.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again it was a missed opportunity because it seems that side of 
the House is devoid of ideas.  That side is out of gas in terms 
of creative things to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on that side of the House voted in favour of that motion 
because they thought it was a really good idea.  That was a year 
and a half ago.  They have not done diddley-squat in that regard. 
They could be the example.  They should set the example for the 
private sector to do the same. In this northern climate we should 
show the world how we can conserve energy and how we can use our 
precious energy resources in a wiser way, a way that works for us 
instead of being the victims of some international oil cartel. It 
was another missed opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finest achievement any government can aspire to is to 
elevate the standard of the living conditions of the people it 
represents.  That should be the goal. That is why we are here. 
If we can only keep our eyes on the ball, our job and goal should 
be to elevate the standard of the living conditions of the people 
we represent.  If we did not deviate from that, we would not have 
so much confusion in terms of what we should do.  Let us do what 
is right in a way that would really move society forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A basic tenet and truth is that society does not move forward 
until we all move forward together.  If we leave a significant 
number of people behind, we do not really move forward.  Freedom 
is only privilege extended unless it is enjoyed by all people. 
That is a basic tenet that we must adhere to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion to eliminate child poverty by the year 2000 was one 
of the most significant things ever agreed upon in the House of 
Commons.  Governments to this point through mismanagement by the 
Tories et cetera did find themselves in a disastrous financial 
situation, but in recent years money is no longer an excuse.  If 
money is not an issue, what does that lead us to believe?  That 
the government just does not care about that subject. Money is 
not a barrier. Money is not an obstacle.  The government has 
barrels of money.  It has money coming out of its ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that a society shall be judged not by the might of its 
cities, not by the grandeur of its statues and not by the power 
of its armies.  A society will be judged by how it treats its 
most vulnerable people:  the unemployed, the disenfranchised, the 
poverty stricken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When all the dust settles and all of us are in our graves, 
society will judge this piece of history by what steps we took to 
move that part of society forward.  The budget does nothing to 
move society forward as a whole. We do not move forward unless we 
all move forward together.  We are not moving forward at all when 
the gap between the rich and the poor grows ever wider and wider.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West—Nepean, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I cannot help but be somewhat concerned when I hear the 
kind of talk I have just heard, things like oodles of money and 
scads of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly the kind of thinking that got us into a 
situation where we were dependent upon foreign borrowing to pay 
for our entire health care system and our entire public pension 
system just seven years ago. That is exactly the kind of thinking 
that would have destroyed those systems had something like the 
Asian crisis happened before we started getting our deficit under 
control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take issue with the member's statement that the government has 
not done what needs to be done for society.  He has to 
acknowledge that once there was a surplus budget the first thing 
the government did was put money back into health care, back into 
post-secondary education, back into all those things to create a 
strong and healthy society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two budgets have increased spending in those areas by 25%. 
Health care and education are the foundations of a strong 
society.  Those areas of spending are now higher in actual 
dollars than when we took office.  I would like the hon. member 
to respond to that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, back in 1995 the CHST when 
it was created was $19 billion a year.  The Liberal government 
brought it down to $11.5 billion per year and is slowly 
incrementally jacking it back up.  It went to $12.5 billion.  In 
this budget it is supposed to go to $14.5 billion and even $15 
billion.  That is still $4 billion less in actual spending than 
it was before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cannot use smoke and mirrors forever. Canadians 
do not believe it and they frankly do not accept this stuff about 
transferring tax points.  They want cash on the barrelhead.  They 
want to see the federal government's actual participation in 
health, social spending and post-secondary education. Those are 
the priorities we heard about when we consulted with Canadians. 
That is what they told us.  They wanted the government to use 
this budget to fix health care, to stop the crisis in 
post-secondary education tuitions and to do something about 
social spending to elevate the standard of living for all 
Canadians.  If that is not our goal, I do not know what is.

Winnipeg Centre for his remarks today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to elaborate a moment longer on his private 
member's motion in terms of the energy retrofit of those 50,000 
government buildings.  This is one of the better ideas I have 
ever come across in the House.  Both sides of the House passed 
that motion.  What has the government done after one year?  What 
is it doing to create jobs and reduce our dependency on fossil 
fuels? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very glad to elaborate 
on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 300 passed with a great majority in the House of 
Commons.  The concept was that we can create jobs, reduce 
operating costs in publicly owned buildings and reduce harmful 
greenhouse gas emissions, all at no cost to the taxpayer because 
the private sector is willing to finance those jobs and be paid 
back slowly out of the energy savings.  In other words, it is off 
balance sheet financing that we could use to finance this 
project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 50,000 federally owned public buildings in the 
country.  Only about 100 have had significant energy retrofitting 
done to them.  Even at a 1,000 per year, it would take 50 years 
to finish the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to see the government, now that the motion has passed, 
to exercise this and expand the program so that all federally 
owned public buildings are retrofitted so that they are 
completely energy efficient and do not belch out harmful 
greenhouse gas emissions as they do today.

knows no borders and no one is immune from being afflicted with

deaths attributed to TB are 2 million.  It is greatest among 
young women and individuals with AIDS, Canada's aboriginal

with TB through various ways.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an internal audit done and the results were damning. 
It stated “Our audit revealed a lack of compliance with 
criteria and with departmental policies”.  The number one 
recommendation was “The minister should define the terms that 
leave room for interpretation”.  In other words, close the 
loopholes so the Liberals cannot get their paws on it and dish 
out the cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A follow-up audit was done nearly a year later.  No matter how 
many audits come out, the results seem to be the same.  The

three audits the quote in the document once again is “The

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, over 
a year ago the House of Commons passed a motion that directed the 
government to energy retrofit all of its 50,000 publicly owned 
buildings.  Given our obligation under Kyoto to reduce harmful 
greenhouse gas emissions and given the obvious cost savings 
benefits associated with the demand side management of our energy 
resources, I would like the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services to answer one simple question.  How many of 
these 50,000 buildings has the government energy retrofitted 
since it was directed to do so by a motion in the House over a 
year ago? 
<P><A NAME="LINK150"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, many buildings have 
already been retrofitted and we continue to do so.  We work with 
the agencies and all the departments involved.  We have a problem 
and we intend to achieve all our objectives and have all 
government buildings retrofitted to meet the energy requirements. 
<P><A NAME="LINK151"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
can tell the hon. minister how many.  Fewer than 100 have been 
done since 1993.  Of 50,000 buildings, 100 have been completed. 
It will be a 500 year program to energy retrofit its buildings. 
The government is devoid of ideas.  It is a government that is 
out of gas, except for greenhouse gases it would seem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an opportunity to save billions of dollars a year in 
operating costs, create thousands of jobs and reduce harmful 
greenhouse gas emissions by hundreds of millions of tonnes, yet 
the government refuses to act.

<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>BILL C-206 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Last Friday the hon. member for Prince 
George—Peace River raised a question of privilege concerning 
Bill C-206 which is under the name of the hon. member for 
Wentworth—Burlington.  As I recall, it had to do with the amount 
of time given to the member for Wentworth—Burlington to get 100 
signatures for his bill.  On Friday the hon. member simply could 
not be here and therefore his motion was dropped to the bottom of 
the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington is in his seat.  Is he 
aware of the question of privilege which was brought up?  He 
signals to me that he is.  Would the hon. member like to make an 
intervention?  The hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington. 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very surprised by the attack made by the Canadian 
Alliance Party.  You will forgive me if I reply at some length. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically what the whip for the former party said was that I was 
absent from the House on Friday because he felt that I was unable 
to get the 100 signatures that I was expected to get in order for 
Bill C-206 to remain on the order paper.  He was making the 
assumption that I had to get those signatures by that Friday in 
order for my bill to remain on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would like to take you through exactly what the 
whip for the Reform Party did say.  I would like you to compare 
it with the evidential record.  The member was referring to the 
procedure and House affairs committee discussions of March 2 in 
which the status of my signatures and Bill C-206 were discussed 
in the context of a point of privilege that you ruled on, Mr. 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said on Friday that during the discussions at committee it 
was suggested that the member for Wentworth—Burlington be 
apprised of the intentions of the committee before the committee 
actually finalized its report in order to allow him time to seek 
the recommended support for his bill.  The reason for this 
urgency was because the committee intended the deadline to be the 
first opportunity for the bill to be considered for its first 
hour of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I have in my hands—not as a prop—the committee 
record of that discussion of March 2.  In it you will find no 
such reference.  There was no such discussion by anyone in that 
committee about whether I should be apprised to get my signatures 
in advance of the final report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, Mr. Speaker, I received no official communication from 
the committee before the finalized 19th report.  No one said 
anything to me about the decision to require me to get the 
signatures again for my Bill C-206. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might interest you to know, Mr. Speaker, that the timing was 
interesting as well because the deputy whip tabled the 19th 
report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs 
on March 17, the Friday before March 20, which was the first day 
that the committee record became available.  The records were not 
even available before the report was finalized and I received no 
communication whatsoever. I suggest to you that what was said by 
the hon. member for Prince George—Peace River is completely at 
odds with the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, while I was aware of the recommendation that was 
contemplated by the committee, even before the report was 
finalized, I, quite honestly, never expected you to rule the way 
you did.  I did not expect you to uphold the recommendation that 
came from that committee much less the recommendation as 
contained in the finalized report that was only available to me 
on the Friday before the Tuesday on which you ruled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, I took your ruling in good spirits 
because I respect the Chair.  I might find it uncomfortable 
sometimes when you rule in ways that take me by surprise but 
nevertheless I respect that any time you do approach a ruling you 
approach it with the kind of dispassionate impartiality that we 
expect of you.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Friday the whip for the Reform Party went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Wentworth—Burlington rose after the Speaker's 
ruling and sought further clarification.  He clarified with the 
Chair that if he could secure 100 signatures by Friday, March 24, 
200, today, his bill could remain on the order paper. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it that I actually said following your ruling on March 
21?   Mr. Speaker, for your benefit, I will quote what I actually 
said.  I said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am asking you, Mr. Speaker, is, if I can get the 
signatures in the next day or so that perhaps Bill C-206 could 
remain where it is on the order of precedence rather than being 
dropped to the very bottom and perhaps not being debated for some 
months to come. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to be doubly sure, I repeated it and said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am asking you, Mr. Speaker, is, if I can get the hundred 
signatures in the next day or two—and I would hope to have the 
co-operation of the opposition parties in this—can my bill 
remain on the order of precedence and come up on Friday— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, as you can see from what I just said, the 
assumption was that I would have the opportunity to collect those 
signatures so long as the bill remained on the order of 
precedence, whether it was on the order of precedence for Friday 
or dropped in the order of precedence at the time, it did not 
matter.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, in your own words, you said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the question the hon. member is asking is whether this 
bill will come up in the normal course of events.  The answer is, 
yes.  Is that what the question is? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said “Yes”.   So, Mr. Speaker, that is clear.  You can see, 
if you go back to what the whip for the Reform Party said, he has 
distorted the record.  He was suggesting that for some reason 
there was a ruling on your part that prevented my bill from 
dropping to the bottom of the order of precedence and not being 
valid as a result of having done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most wounding and injurious thing of all that the member for 
Prince George—I can never remember where it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Prince George—Peace River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Prince George—Peace River.  Well, yes, 
some peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am sure that we do want to make fun of any 
member's riding.  It is Prince George—Peace River, I would 
remind the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sorry, but I am 
suffering.  I have been ill all weekend and you can tell by my 
voice.  I am coming to that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, the last wounding charge was the suggestion that I 
was deliberately absent from the House on that Friday because I 
could not get my 100 signatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I have to tell the hon. member opposite something. 
I was sick.  I was very ill.  On Wednesday I had a sore throat 
and was afraid I had strep throat.  On Thursday I carefully 
backed off going around trying to collect my 100 signatures 
because I was afraid I was contagious.  I have to admit that I 
would have been delighted to sit behind the member for Athabasca 
and maybe make him a little sicker, but I did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I will point out to you that the member for New 
Brunswick Southwest will recall that I came over and sat in those 
chairs where the pages are right now.  He called me over because 
he wanted to talk to me about Bill C-206.  I sat there in those 
chairs and I said “I am sorry, I cannot come any closer to you 
because I am afraid I have something.  I do not want you to 
become ill”.  If I did not pursue my signatures on Wednesday and 
Thursday it was for the very good reason that I did not want to 
risk the members of the House getting the illness that I had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is any doubt whatsoever from that party opposite that I 
was sick on that particular day, I have here—and I can give it 
to a page—the actual doctor's prescription that I received at 
the very moment that the member was making those charges against 
me.  I deliberately did not fill this prescription so that I 
could present it in the House as evidence that I was indeed sick 
at the time that we are speaking of.  If I can get a page to come 
up, this will show you, Mr. Speaker, that it is an actual

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-462, an act to amend the Criminal Code and the 
Firearms Act (exemption of long guns from registration). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is indeed with pleasure that I have 
the opportunity to introduce my bill, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code and the Firearms Act, to ensure that there is an 
exemption from the need to register long guns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this enactment is to exempt ordinary long guns, 
meaning firearms that are neither prohibited nor restricted from 
registration.  The criminal code is amended to remove the 
provision that makes it an offence to possess a long gun that is 
not registered.  The Firearms Act is amended to remove the 
requirement to register long guns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there are a number of consequential amendments to 
both acts removing references to registration with respect to 
long guns.  This enactment does not affect the law respecting 
prohibited weapons or restricted weapons.  Essentially, to 
paraphrase the bill, it is to remove the need to register long 
guns which are commonly used by deer hunters, duck hunters and 
farmers. 
It is a very important piece of legislation that we believe 
wastes taxpayer money, so it is my pleasure to table the bill at 
this time.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that this House 
approves in general the budgetary policy of the government; and 
of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, one 
way to judge the budget is not just by the debate that takes 
place in the House.  It is also by what kind of response there is 
in the community from the various organizations that monitor what 
the government is doing and are involved in various programs and 
campaigns, for example, Campaign 2000 or the campaigns around 
housing.

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the day of the budget one of those organizations, a group of 
poor tenants from a Quebec social housing coalition called 
FRAPRU, occupied the offices of the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission in Ottawa.  They sat in the offices of the Canadian 
Human Rights Commission because they wanted to hear what was in 
the budget.  They were very worried that the government would 
turn its back on the needs of poor tenants and the homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After they heard the budget they continued their occupation of 
the Canadian Human Rights Commission offices.  It carried over 24 
hours into the next day.  I visited to speak to them about their 
concerns.  They were pretty disappointed.  More than that, they 
were outraged that the $100 billion surplus which had been built, 
as we have heard from our member for Winnipeg Centre, on the 
backs of the unemployed, the surplus from the unemployment 
insurance commission and the public pension plan, did not contain 
any money for a national housing program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget basically reannounced the $753 million that had been 
announced by the minister responsible for homelessness prior to 
Christmas.  Anyone who for a minute has been fooled into thinking 
that announcement will mean the construction of affordable, safe, 
secure and appropriate housing for families, children, seniors, 
unemployed people and low income people has made a big mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a meeting in my riding with the HRDC officials who are 
responsible for carrying out this initiative and with community 
groups who wanted to find out whether the $750 million which was 
reannounced in the budget actually would build social housing, 
and the answer was no.  It is basically a program that will 
institutionalize shelters.  It deals with training programs, 
youth at risk and aboriginal programs, all of which are good 
measures, but the budget failed on the fundamental issue that 
needed to be addressed in terms of a housing strategy.  It was 
completely absent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder that a group like FRAPRU and the organizations 
which it represents felt the need to take demonstrative action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks later representatives from housing organizations 
came to Ottawa to bear witness to yet another death of a homeless 
person.  Several homeless people died in the city of Toronto. 
Representatives of those organizations came to the Canadian Human 
Rights Commission, called on the government and demanded to know 
why in the budget, when there were such opportunities with the 
surplus that existed, the poor, the homeless and people who are 
underhoused in the country were completely forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been working closely with people concerned about the 
so-called children's agenda.  I wanted to know their reaction to 
the budget.  How many times have we heard government members talk 
about the children's agenda?  How many times have we heard 
government members talk about the platitudes of wanting to end 
child poverty?  Even today in the House there were three 
petitions presented by government members from their constituents 
in Liberal ridings who want the government to end child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a lot of expectation that the budget would be a 
children's budget, but it failed on that score.  There was no 
money in the budget for a national child care program or an early 
childhood development program.  There were no funds announced to 
ensure that the child tax benefit would be passed on to children 
and families on welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it any wonder that a group like the Canadian Teachers' 
Federation in its analysis of the budget said that it falls short 
of fulfilling the federal government's promise of implementing a 
national children's agenda as outlined in the recent throne 
speech.  It goes on to say that the budget repeats the same 
promises that appeared in the Speech from the Throne and in 
statements made by first ministers in 1997 when they agreed to 
accelerate work on a national children's agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no dollars allocated for this purpose.  Canada's 
children deserve more than rhetoric.  That is what the Canadian 
Teachers' Federation had to say.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go back to the October 1999 throne speech, the commitment 
made by the Prime Minister was to take the action necessary as a 
country so that every Canadian child could have the best possible 
start in life.  The government has failed miserably on that 
score.  Not only has it not taken action to ensure that all 
children have a good start in the early years of their lives, the 
situation has deteriorated considerably since the resolution 
which was passed unanimously by the House in 1989, introduced by 
the then leader of the NDP, Ed Broadbent, to eliminate child 
poverty.  There are now 50% more children than there were in 1989 
living in poverty.  Why did this $100 billion surplus not address 
the needs of those kids? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very credible organization, the National Anti-Poverty 
Organization, headquartered in Ottawa.  It works at the 
grassroots level in social justice and anti-poverty right across 
the country.  What did its analysis say?  That the budget would 
widen the gap between rich and poor.  It pointed out that while 
the finance minister spoke about the gap between the rich and the 
poor, the measures in his budget not only failed to reduce the 
problem but would actually make it worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real proof is in the numbers.  As NAPO has pointed out, if 
we compare the situations of two single people, one who has an 
income of $10,000 and another with an income of $100,000, the gap 
between those incomes will actually increase by $2,377 because of 
this budget.  It begs the questions:  Is this a budget that is 
based on any sort of principle of equality?  Is it a budget that 
deals with the horror of what poor children, families and the 
unemployed have to deal with?  The answer is no.  As we can see 
clearly, this budget actually increases the gap between those who 
are wealthy and those who are poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have information that was provided by groups like the 
Canadian Federation of Students.  One of the things I was really 
interested in seeing in the budget was whether there would be any 
real relief for students who are facing crushing debt loads 
because of their post-secondary education.  Let us make no 
mistake, student debt in the country has increased threefold, 
from about $8,000 to about $25,000.  That has been the average 
student debt since the Liberal government came to power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no two ways about it, the reason is because of the 
massive retreat in public funding of more than $3 billion which 
has been cut from post-secondary education and training.  Is it 
any wonder that the Canadian Federation Students came out with 
its analysis which said that the federal 2000 budget did nothing 
to fix the funding crisis in post-secondary education.  In fact, 
the $600 million in additional annual funding for health care and 
education falls far short of the $3.7 billion which the premiers 
have publicly stated is immediately required for post-secondary 
education.  It will not even cover inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is particularly offensive.  In the throne speech we heard 
various platitudes and commitments to a knowledge based economy 
and to helping young people in the future.  If we look at the 
reality, young people are facing debt loads and increasing 
inaccessibility to our schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it is no better on the health care front.  I am proud 
to say that the NDP has campaigned rigorously day after day in 
the House to point out the shortcomings of the budget when it 
comes to health care.  We have made it quite clear, and the 
numbers tell the truth, that even with the so-called increase in 
health care we will still be short $3.3 billion more than when 
the Liberals came to power in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my constituents, Mr. Harvey Dueck, wrote to the finance 
minister.  He said: “I am writing to add my voice to those who 
are asking you to favour funding health care and other social 
programs above tax cuts in this and future budgets”.  He 
continued:  “I am in an income tax bracket where I would benefit 
more than most from any proposed tax cut, but I beg you not to 
tread that path until social programs are once again secure and 
the debt, not merely the deficit, has been vastly reduced or 
limited”.

visited the emergency room because there were not enough nurses, 
there were not enough doctors and there were not enough records 
management people to provide the information that was needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget fails on that score as well.  I want to say that we 
in the NDP believe that the government missed the opportunity it 
had to deal with poverty and to deal with growing inequality. 
Instead it decided to implement tax cuts, which basically favour 
the rich over the poor.  For us, that is simply appalling.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the member's remarks and I would 
like to respond to her remarks concerning higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the recent budget scholarship income was made tax free up to 
$3,000.  In previous budgets there was the RESP, the registered 
educational savings plan program, which included not only tax 
breaks but actually a grant for each child in a family, up to a 
considerable amount.  These were the first new grants in higher 
education for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in this budget there were the 2,000 funded research chairs, 
funded research professorships, which will have a direct affect 
on students.  There will be junior and senior professorships. 
Students will be employed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The granting councils over the last several years have received 
considerable additional funds.  This year, for example, the 
social sciences council alone received an additional $10 million. 
All of those grants go to help students on the campuses to get 
jobs working with professors and that kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the government put all colleges, universities, high 
schools and elementary schools on the Internet, which is a very 
important step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not even mentioned the millennium scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that the government has not done much to help 
higher education.  I know that more must be done, but this time 
university groups, students and others, have said to us that we 
should increase transfers to the provinces so that core funding 
for universities, not more scholarships or research help, which 
is supplied by the provinces, could be strengthened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member reads the budget, this time the transfers to the 
provinces were referred to as higher education and health.  Our 
concern on the government side was that if we transferred this 
money for higher education and health, how would we know, in 
either of those fields, what the provinces would do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has she heard of any province which has used the increase in the 
block transfer this year for higher education purposes?  If she 
has, I would be glad to hear it.  If she has not, could she 
suggest to us ways in which we could be sure that the money we 
transfer to the provinces will be used for the purposes for which 
it was intended, higher education and health? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the 
hon. member for his question.  It is a very good question and it 
gives me an opportunity to say a bit more about the concerns we 
have with post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to raise the question that if there is an increase in 
the Canada health and social transfer, how could we provide an 
assurance that the money would actually be used for education.  I 
know that is the case in my own province of British Columbia. Our 
government has put a freeze on tuition fees and has made sure 
that accessibility to post-secondary education will not be 
eroded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that if the member is concerned about where the 
dollars are going for health care, social programs or 
post-secondary education, he should be supporting the initiative 
which the federal New Democrats put forward both at the HRDC 
committee and in the House to say that the federal government 
should bring in a new national standard based on accessibility to 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe very much that there must be federal dollars.  The 
measures that the member outlined do not even come close to 
making up for the billions of dollars that have been stripped 
away and gutted from our colleges and universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever increase there is, the government should be 
implementing a standard based on accessibility precisely to 
ensure that students across the country, whether they are in 
Ontario, New Brunswick or British Columbia, have access based on 
affordability to post-secondary education. 
Unfortunately that does not exist.

the provinces, “Do whatever the hell you want”. That is why we 
are in a mess now.

Youth), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am splitting my time with my 
hon. colleague the secretary of state for parks and rural 
development.  I should not forget rural development. We know how 
important that issue is to all the rural regions of Canada, my 
constituency being one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget 2000 is an achievement of historic proportions.  The 
third successive balanced budget of this government is a feat not 
seen since the days of C. D. Howe.  We have tackled the 
burdensome and ballooning deficit left by the previous 
government. We have increased job creation.  We have launched a 
strategy to invest in Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians now have every reason to feel confident and secure 
about the economy.  A bright future lies ahead for all thanks to 
the sound fiscal management of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In relation to my riding, it has been an extremely interesting 
time in the Northwest Territories.  We have a new government.  We 
have a new premier, Premier Kakfwi who is of aboriginal descent. 
We have a cabinet the majority of whom I believe are aboriginal, 
as well as the MLAs from the various parts of the territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new commissioner is to be sworn in at 3.30 p.m. this coming 
Friday.  This Inuvialuit woman is a widow who has been very much 
a community activist on health and social issues and educational 
issues.  She is raising four daughters on her own.  She was a 
very steady companion of her husband who passed away from cancer 
a couple of years ago.  It was a very long and tough journey for 
both of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the way through which I have become familiar with the 
circumstances of these individuals who take the lead in our 
territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have a new senator, the first ever to make the history 
books for the Northwest Territories, Senator Nick Sibbeston.  He 
also is of aboriginal descent and is a Dene speaking individual 
from the Deh Cho region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have many unsung heroes in the north who work toward the 
development in the most exciting time in the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is not separate from that.  We look to a strong 
partnership with the federal government. We have major issues to 
bring together for the benefit of all of Canada including the 
north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national unemployment rate is at its lowest level in 24 
years.  Inflation remains in check.  The debt burden is dropping. 
The Canadian economy is growing.  These are facts that not even 
the opposition can deny. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is precisely in the hope of achieving such impressive results 
that Canadians elected us to office. Our government followed up 
on its commitments and will pursue its efforts to continue to 
improve the tax situation of all Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This record of achievement is what Canadians elected us to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this budget Canadians will reap the rewards of sound 
fiscal management through tax savings and investments in our 
children through increased investments in health care and 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to invest in social and economic 
development for all Canadians.  We recognize regional inequities 
in opportunities.  We will not leave anyone behind as we move 
forward in this new century.  We do not believe in leaving the 
most vulnerable in our society to fend for themselves.  We 
believe in access of opportunity.

believe in pulling together as Canadians by investing in all 
Canadians.  Above all, investing in our children will secure a 
better future for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to work with our provincial and 
territorial partners to develop an action plan by December 2000 
to support early childhood development.  We have identified six 
priority areas: strengthening the family; early childhood 
development; economic security; readiness to learn; adolescent 
development; and support of communities.  These speak loudly to 
my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Northwest Territories we are in the midst of the biggest 
development my territory has realized in the last number of 
decades.  Two diamond mines are in operation.  Within six years 
the exponential rate of return to the federal government from 
those mines including the others that are potentially to come 
onstream is going to be very high.  Presently we get $19,000 per 
capita for the individuals in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the generation of revenue from these various industries, 
including the development of a major pipeline down the Mackenzie 
Valley which is now being studied, a number of options are being 
proposed. The potential performance of that major pipeline 
perhaps will make us a have territory some day.  We will be able 
to carry our own weight by virtue of the fact that we we will be 
taking these resources out of our own area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope to develop a partnership with the federal government on 
devolution. That means a sharing of the revenues, a sharing of 
the authorities, powers and responsibilities.  This is what the 
government in my territory is proposing to do.  This partnership 
is a sound approach for prosperity, for participation and for 
equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aboriginal people at one point many decades ago were opposed 
to building the pipeline for their own reasons.  Now the 
aboriginal people are saying they want this development.  Not 
only do they want to build it, they want to own it. They want 
equity ownership.  That means a great deal of self-sustainability 
for our community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget is not separate from that.  This all comes together. 
We do not pretend we are a region onto ourselves, that we can do 
it on our own.  We believe we can do best in partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the budget will increase the Canada child tax 
benefit by $2.5 billion a year by 2004.  This is a significant 
investment.  We cannot separate those things that are child 
specific from the other fiscal issues and say they do not have an 
impact.  That is not the way in which governments or economies 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our five year tax reduction plan will ease the tax burden for 
low and middle income families with children beginning with the 
current fiscal year.  The maximum leave period for employment 
insurance maternity and parental leave will be doubled to one 
year.  There will be $29 million allocated for family law related 
services to support parenting information programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget will increase support and tax initiatives for 
persons with disabilities and their families.  That is of 
particular concern to me.  I have a great deal of concern for 
young people with disabilities, those young people who are the 
most vulnerable, those who need that hand up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget also speaks to an issue of great importance to the 
north, the environment.  Global environmental changes have a 
special impact in the western Arctic and northerners have a 
special relationship to that land.  This budget will now support 
new environmental initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a delegation in town from the community of Deline who are 
seized with the issue of uranium contamination from the mine at 
Port Radium.  There is contamination of the community and its 
environment through the waterways all the way down the Mackenzie 
through the Great Bear Lake and the Bear River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are looking at the incidence of deaths related to 
cancer.  They are concerned not only about the people but also 
the environment, the fish, the animals, the caribou, all of these 
issues combined.  They have a deep and abiding concern about the 
wellness and the health of their people. 
This working group and others have shown a great deal of concern 
and initiative.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I always like to listen to the hon. member when she 
speaks about her part of the world.  She makes eminently good 
sense.  I commend her for the enthusiasm with which she supports 
her constituents and in particular on some of the natural 
resources development like the proposed pipeline and the diamond 
mines.  That is perfectly legitimate.  It is the kind of thing I 
would expect any member of parliament to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member opposite whether she has 
thought about other parts of the budget and in particular the 
increase in Human Resources Development Canada.  In this area 
there is roughly $1 billion and economists have done some 
estimates as to how much it really costs in terms of the output. 
If we put a number of dollars into the job creation scheme the 
assumption is that jobs are actually created. What is not said is 
how many jobs are lost or what output costs are attributed to 
each of these job creation schemes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The job creation schemes have to be paid for through tax 
increases to someone.  People are paying additional taxes to pay 
for these job schemes.  Where does it come from? Economists have 
estimated that the $1 billion has cost Canadians $520 million, 
over half of the $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member address this issue?  It has been addressed 
by people like Jim Mirrlees for example who won a Nobel prize 
recently in developing the optimum taxation theory.  I wonder if 
she could comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not profess 
to be a specialist in taxation but I can say that I come from an 
area of very high need.   Unemployment is very high.  I am very 
pleased we have made the investment in HRDC, putting aside all of 
the other administrative difficulties that have befallen the 
programs. I stand by the initiatives that we have undertaken in 
my riding and across Canada that have created two million jobs. 
They are two million jobs for two million Canadians who needed 
good permanent jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also applaud the fact that we went from 11.5% to 6.8% 
unemployment.  Youth unemployment is going down but we are still 
seized with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from an area where we must diversify the economy. We do 
not need a hand out; we need a hand up.  Northerners take good 
advantage.  I know there are other hon. members in the Chamber 
who live in areas that are not as well served as those on the 
industrial grid.  We do not have huge industries. Jobs have to be 
devised and opportunities have to be created for these people, 
such as in tourism and the mining industry. We have to invest in 
training and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it is today, the majority of our workers are coming from 
outside the territories. It is good for the hon. member's riding 
and others as well, for Manitoba, Saskatchewan, British Columbia 
and as far as the Atlantic.  Workers are coming to the north to 
work at these mines because we have invested in the opportunities 
for them to do so. 
On the other hand, we have to train people and we need the funds 
to do that.

has highly supported the petition that came in.  I am sure she 
recognizes that it was her Indian affairs minister who made an 
agreement that literally wiped away the benefits for those 
pensioners with no consideration for them.  Obviously that is the 
approach the government has taken in a number of areas that 
reflect on ordinary Canadians.  In this case it was workers who 
in a lot of situations gave their lives.  Those who are left are 
now having their pensions wiped out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If she truly supports this, how does she feel about her Indian 
affairs minister signing the agreement that wiped away those 
pensions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my hon. 
colleague, the Minister for Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, and I have worked together for almost 12 years.  I 
have the utmost respect for his judgment and thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to this situation, the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development is seized with his officials and 
officials of another department in finding a solution and not 
looking at blame.  We are trying to find a solution so that these 
people do not have the gap that will be created and will receive 
full pensions.  We are working on that.  We are not looking to 
blame someone.  If we do that we could do an historical 
chronology and many fingers could be pointed elsewhere.  We are 
not into that.  We want to find solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am from that riding and I not only support those workers but I 
support the workers across the country who may be in the same 
situation.  I feel that their story has to be told.  Most of the 
workers are older workers and I support them wholeheartedly in 
their attempts to get a full pension.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Rural Development) 
(Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address the February 28 
budget, a budget full of good news for all Canadians, including 
those who live in rural areas. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know Canadians have responded well to the budget put forward 
by the finance minister on February 28.  That has been evident in 
the House in the weeks since the budget was tabled as we have 
seen very few actual questions from the opposition.  In fact 
people who have been around this place a lot longer than I have 
expressed absolute astonishment on the general acceptance of the 
budget by the opposition and, indeed, the general acceptance by 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that has occurred because the budget, in essence, 
dealt with the priorities of Canadians.  It dealt with the issue 
of tax reductions.  The budget put forward a plan of tax 
reduction of some $54 billion.  Canadians had indicated that one 
of the objectives that needed to be addressed in this budget was 
tax reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also dealt with the issue of debt reduction.  At the high 
point a couple of years ago, as a percentage of our GDP, the debt 
in the country, thanks to the mismanagement of the Tory 
government for years and years, had risen to a little over 71%. 
As we follow through on the budget plan, the debt to GDP ratio 
will drop to below 50%.  In fact, over the last three years close 
to $20 million in marketable debt has been repaid.  This is a far 
cry from what we saw from the Mulroney Tories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget has also gained general acceptance among Canadians 
because of the types of investments it has made and will continue 
to make.  We saw $2.5 billion being invested in health care, 
adding to the $14.5 billion the year before.  Transfers to the 
provinces went up this year to the highest level, to some $43 
billion over two or three years.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw the commitment of $2.6 billion to the infrastructure 
program to partner with other levels of government, $1 billion 
for the federal government to deal with its own infrastructure 
and, as we have heard from some of the previous comments made in 
the House, some $700 million being invested into items to do with 
the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased and most importantly I would like to talk 
today about this budget in terms of rural Canada.  I will quote a 
piece of the speech that the Minister of Finance made.  He said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—there are major differences between urban and rural 
communities. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concerns of rural Canadians are those shared by all 
Canadians—quality health care, the best education for their 
children, a good job.  The difference is that, in the case of 
rural Canada, a hospital closing, a school cutback or the loss of 
a major employer threatens the very life of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, we must expand economic development in smaller 
communities right across the country, north and south, east and 
west.  We must recognize that in the years ahead, all orders of 
government have to come together, as never before, to broaden 
opportunities right across the country. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those words, I think the Minister of Finance spoke clearly 
to the needs, concerns and issues of rural Canada.  What the 
budget does is it recognizes, as this government began to 
recognize and first enunciated in the Speech from the Throne in 
1996, that the realities faced by rural Canadians are indeed 
different than those faced by urban Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We simply have to take a look at some of those issues.  Let us 
take the issue of geography.  If people live in a rural area 
there is so much more geography.  Let us take a look at the 
distance from markets.  If people are operating in a rural 
marketplace, they often have added transportation costs and added 
issues because of the distance from the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the whole issue of population density.  If one is 
looking at investing in a rural area, often times there is not 
the same potential market size that may exist in an urban area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the economy of rural Canada.   When people 
operate in rural Canada, it is, in most cases, a natural resource 
based economy that is normally cyclical in nature.  It is very 
different from an urbanized, diversified, manufacturing based 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that urban and rural Canada are different, the fact 
that the challenges are different and the fact that the 
circumstances on the ground are different, requires the 
government to respond differently in both areas. One of the great 
strengths of this budget is that it realizes that we do need to 
respond differently.  The budget puts forward very clearly what 
is a basic debate in this country:  Does government have a role 
to partner with communities, to partner with individuals and to 
partner with businesses where circumstances call for an 
improvement in the quality of life of, in this case, rural 
Canadians?  I believe it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members across the way have stood in the House day after day 
enunciating that the government does not have a role when it 
comes to dealing with the regions.  In question period today we 
heard criticism after criticism piled on the minister responsible 
for regional development in Quebec.  Day after day we hear 
criticisms when HRDC partners with rural communities and rural 
citizens to help improve the quality of their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget has clearly stated that we recognize there are 
differences in rural Canada.  We recognize there are different 
challenges faced by rural Canadians.  We are going to work as a 
partner with those institutions, with those communities and with 
those people to help improve the quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at some of the specific points made in the budget, 
some of the specific measures, we can see that the budget does 
deal with some of those differences I talked about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the issue of geography, we see an initiative there 
of $160 million to ensure that we will be able to deliver all 
government services on line.  Those who live in a rural or remote 
community often do not have the ability to access government 
services in the traditional way of going to a particular office 
or some place made of bricks and mortar. Here we have a 
government understanding that specific issue in rural Canada, 
understanding that rural Canadians need to have access to their 
government, and we see an initiative of $160 million to provide 
that type of access to them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at distance from markets we look at the $2.6 
billion infrastructure program that we will roll out in 
conjunction with other levels of government.  This is our own 
billion dollar program.  Something which is very important and 
which rural Canadians saw clearly is that a component of the 
infrastructure program has been specifically directed to rural 
Canada, to the needs, the criteria and the challenges facing 
rural Canadians in terms of developing their infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is the program there but it is being designed in a way 
that will address the needs of rural Canadians and deal with the 
difference in distance from markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of population density is important to those who 
live in rural Canada.  The private sector often goes to an urban 
setting, where it has a very vast market, and makes an investment 
on its own because it can get a quick return on its investment. 
Trying to make that same investment, for example, in 
telecommunications infrastructure or in energy distribution, in a 
rural area where we do not have that population density, requires 
another partner.  Often times that partner can and should be a 
level of government.  Sometimes is it is the federal government, 
sometimes the provincial government and sometimes even the 
municipal government, but it is an appropriate role to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see in the budget a $54 million commitment to community 
futures which can take an innovative approach to assisting 
communities.  It takes an approach that I like to call a bottom 
up and not a top down approach.  Community futures are run and 
operated by local boards of directors, selected from local 
individuals who make decisions on how they will go about 
community development, not based on some decision that may be 
made in Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton or Victoria, but based on the 
needs of that rural community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also see the government dealing with the cyclical nature of 
our resource based economies with assistance to agriculture, 
forestry and mining.  This is a budget that demonstrates clearly 
that this government understands the needs of rural Canadians, 
that it is addressing those needs and that it cares about rural 
Canadians.  That is why I believe this budget deserves the 
support of all members of the House, and particularly those 
members who represent rural constituencies.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to speak very passionately 
about my constituency, as the Secretary of State for Children and 
Youth just did.  I particularly want to address the minister in 
charge of rural development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want tell the last speaker that if he wants to see rural 
development in a rural area going into collapse, he should look 
at what is happening with the amount of money that this 
government has put into my constituency.  Of the $1.7 billion 
announced across Manitoba and Saskatchewan, only 26% of the money 
has been paid to the farmers as of March 12.  Some 60% of all 
Manitoba and Saskatchewan farmers had their AIDA forms rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what I have as of today:  First, the highest debt ever 
in my constituency; second, more paved roads having to be 
returned to gravel; and third, the worst fallout of people 
leaving the constituency with the abandonment of towns all 
because this government did not treat the number one industry in 
western Canada in the same way it treated the west during the 
national energy crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how the member can stand and brag about rural 
development when I am facing rural decline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that the 
hon. member is very concerned with his riding, as are all hon. 
members in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the four occasions in the last four months that I have been 
to Saskatchewan I have had an opportunity to talk to a wide range 
of individuals.  I am a little surprised that the hon. member 
speaks that way.  When his party was campaigning it talked about 
taking money out of the agricultural budget but now that it seems 
to be politically expedient it encourages it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that not only did we put a billion dollars into a 
farm aid disaster package in 1998-99, but the minister of 
agriculture announced another billion dollars for 2000 and 2001. 
Then we announced another $240 million specifically for 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba.  Just last week the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, along with his 10 colleagues from all 
the provinces including the minister from Saskatchewan, signed an 
agreement on how to deal with the basic safety net package.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was quite 
interested to hear the Secretary of State for Rural Development 
speak about rural Canada.  My riding of West Nova is very rural. 
On January 21 a severe storm affected five or six wharves along 
the coastline of Nova Scotia from Port Lorne down to Delaps Cove 
and areas in between.  Because of the severe cuts the federal 
government had already done to the provinces and to various 
programs, these wharves were in a state of some disrepair and the 
storm severely damaged them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the secretary of state talk about supporting our rural 
communities.  Would he be prepared to encourage the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans to put the proper funding in place to repair 
the wharves, instead of just using the existing budget that is 
taking away from the ongoing repair that needs to be done?  Would 
he encourage him to put in place some emergency relief by 
possibly taking some of the millions and millions of dollars 
wasted on the gun registry and putting it toward the repair of 
those wharves and, as my colleague mentioned, helping farmers? 
What does my hon. colleague think of that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to hear from 
the member for West Nova.  I have had an opportunity to travel to 
his riding and to work with him there.  He makes a very good 
point.  There are different challenges in rural Canada than exist 
in urban Canada which require the participation of the government 
to deal with them.  I send a very clear message to the former 
Reform Party, the Canadian Alliance Party, that government has a 
role to play in dealing with rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to see as part of the criteria for the 
government's own billion dollar infrastructure program, that is 
the infrastructure under its own auspices, that wharves was one 
of the items listed as an example of things the particular 
funding could deal with. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to have an opportunity to speak to this debate.  We all 
know that the budget debate is one of the most critical ones we 
have each year.  I will be splitting my time with the learned 
member from the riding of West Nova.  I know we are all looking 
forward to his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budgets are more than just about numbers.  Budgets are 
essentially what I consider to be a blueprint that illustrates 
the values of the government.  It is a blueprint to discovering 
what kind of vision the government has not only for today but 
well into the future.  It is also very much a blueprint to ensure 
that we put forth the necessary initiatives so we can be 
competitive not only today but into the future, so we can have a 
vibrant economy to pay for all the programs or initiatives that 
we hold dear as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about what the government is not doing in the 
budget.  In 1988 Canada went to the polls on the initiative of 
free trade.  We all know that election came down to one public 
policy issue.  At that time our trade with the Americans was 
essentially around $90 billion each and every year.  Today I am 
very proud to say that through the FTA and NAFTA our trade with 
the Americans is well over $260 billion annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had an enormous amount of economic growth over the last 
seven years. 
From where has that enormous growth come?  It has largely come 
from our trade relationship with the American economy, which we 
all know is white hot.  Without that initiative, without that 
vision, without that blueprint, we would not be able to compete 
in the economy and pay for the programs that we hold so very 
dear.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now at another milestone in the country's development. 
The rest of the industrialized world, our trading partners, the 
Americans and the Europeans, are now taking leaps in tax 
reduction, giant steps to ensure that their economies are more 
affluent.  I call this an amazing coincidence.  Maybe it is just 
a coincidence, but I would argue that it makes economic sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Irish exponentially lowered taxes both in the corporate tax 
regime and in the personal tax regime, combined with investments 
in terms of education.  The Celtic tiger as it has come to be 
known in Europe, Ireland, now leads Europe in the amount of its 
economic growth with 98% growth in its GDP over the last 15 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last number of years we have seen an exponential amount 
of growth by the Germans of 18%, by the British of 18% and by the 
Americans as well.  It is a similar number.  Meanwhile growth in 
Canada has only been 7%.  We are lagging behind our trading 
partners.  The reason for it is that we cannot keep wealth in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again it has been proven, and I call it the 
amazing coincidence, that if we lower taxes we grow an economy to 
create more wealth to pay for the programs that define us as a 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It happened in Ireland.  It happened in Finland.  Finland was 
essentially a Soviet bloc country.  Now it has a very growth 
oriented economy.  It happened when John Kennedy lowered taxes in 
the 1960s.  It happened when Progressive Conservative Premier 
Ralph Klein made it a mandate to ensure that the Alberta economic 
fundamentals were put in order and to pay down debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It happened with the economy of Ontario.  The low tax regime 
that Michael Harris brought forth, I would argue quite sensibly, 
is responsible for the record amount of growth in our economy 
over the last number of years.  If Michael Harris and the economy 
were not as vibrant we simply would not be collecting the 
revenues in Ottawa to pay for the programs we have right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the blueprint.  Our trade regime has done well, but to 
retain our economic competitiveness into the future we need first 
and foremost to get our economic fundamentals in order.  This 
means paying down our national debt.  We have a moral obligation 
to all future generations to pay down the $587 billion national 
debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an obligation to ensure that our best, our brightest and 
most adventurous can grow and prosper in this country.  They 
should be provided with a tax regime by which they can profit and 
participate in our Canadian economy.  We are losing all too fast 
our best and brightest to the United States and other 
jurisdictions as they seek opportunities in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is trying to take accolades for its one time 
initiative of $2.5 billion for health care and post-secondary 
education over four years.  That is only a very small portion of 
the large amount of money that has been taken away from our 
provincial partners over the last five to six years.  Before we 
have any more grandiose programs, before we give any more money 
to HRDC in grants and contributions, before we start reinvesting 
in new made in Ottawa solutions, let us do the fundamentals 
first. 
Let us pay down the debt.  Let us make sure that we lower the 
taxes. Let us make sure that we put money in our priority 
spending programs, our health care system and our post-secondary 
education system in particular.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know you are of Celtic heritage as well, Mr. Speaker.  I spoke 
a few moments ago about the Celtic tiger.  People talk about the 
fact that they have lowered income taxes both corporately and 
from a personal income perspective.  However they have also made 
it an objective, a mandate of their society, to ensure that 
anybody who has the aptitude to attend university, to seek 
post-secondary education, to seek training at a higher level, has 
the economic capacity to do so.  By that I mean post-secondary 
education in their country is accessible to everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today that is simply not the case.  I believe we need to make it 
a common objective as a society so that every individual who 
wants to can participate in this economy.  I want to create a 
culture of opportunity so that we can provide the necessary 
skills to those individuals who want to provide for themselves by 
helping them to get educated, by helping them reach the highest 
level they can with respect to the economy and make the best 
contribution they can.  In order for us to do that we need to 
make post-secondary education and training more accessible and 
more affordable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I finished school just over a decade ago.  It may be a bit more 
than that; I am starting to age.  At that time a student debt 
level of about $6,000 or $7,000 was considered extremely high. As 
many members of the House know, the average student debt level 
now is $25,000 to $30,000 annually.  For that to quadruple in 
this period of growth is a national shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one solid thing on which I would like to compliment the 
finance minister.  Reindexing the income tax brackets for 
inflation was a very solid initiative and I applaud the 
government on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I want to talk about the blueprint the country 
needs, the vision that we need.  Let us get our economic 
fundamentals in order so that we can participate in the upcoming 
century by making sure that Canada has a low tax regime, both 
corporately and from a personal income perspective; that we pay 
down our debt; and that we put money in the priority spending 
areas of health care and post-secondary education. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened intently to the member's speech and I want to 
ask him a question because he talked about reduction of debt. 
This is the biggest thorn in my side with respect to the budget. 
In so-called good times with surpluses there is no meaningful 
plan on the part of the government or the finance minister to 
reduce our debt and thereby reduce the interest payments and free 
up more money for actual program spending or for further tax 
reductions, which would be a huge boost to the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member admitted that he is young, and compared to me he is 
just a child.  He may not know the answer to my question because 
he was only a babe in diapers when the Conservatives were running 
the country.  They pretty well doubled the debt they inherited, 
mostly by doing nothing about it.  They continued to add to it 
with deficits every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does he suppose that the Progressive Conservative Party, 
with nine years of majority government, never did anything about 
stopping the huge deficits it had every year during its term of 
office?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's question 
was intended to be constructive and he will get a constructive 
reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the facts. Quite simply during the 1984 to 1993 era 
the Progressive Conservative government could have and should 
have done more in terms of paring down our deficit and heading 
toward balancing the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put that in perspective, in 1984 the deficit was 
approximately $40 billion.  The Progressive Conservative 
government of the day pared down the deficit to just under $20 
billion.  At that time the government was clearly headed in the 
right direction over the first three years. The Progressive 
Conservatives were heading toward an era of actually paying down 
the debt during a boom economy.  I have said before that it 
should have and could have done more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that era the Reform Party actually took flight.  It would 
be very wrong for Reform members to say they came about because 
they were upset with the direction in which the country was going 
with respect to fiscal responsibility.  During that same era from 
a historical perspective we were on a better track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 and 1989 the government missed an opportunity to 
continue on that track.  It walked into a cold recession, one of 
international magnitude which affected many economies. In the 
United States the U.S. debt doubled by $2 trillion during the 
Reagan and Bush administrations. It doubled in a number of 
economies.  One exception was the U.K. under Maggie Thatcher 
which actually had a more aggressive approach during that era. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To blame only Brian Mulroney for why we had a huge deficit is 
the same as blaming the whole western economy. It is the same as 
blaming George Bush and Ronald Reagan for the deficits and 
combined debt in the U.S. When we put it in that perspective, 
deficit permissibility was in our psyche.  I applaud the 
Progressive Conservative government for bringing the issue to the 
table and actually venting it but it missed the opportunity to do 
more, I must say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the context in which this debate should always be 
phrased.  To blame the Conservatives for the deficit, they were 
heading in the right direction.  They got caught up in an 
international recession.  It was part of the western world.  It 
happened in Germany under Chancellor Kohl as well.  History will 
speak for itself in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for his constructive question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
participate in the budget debate.  I do so with a deep sense of 
regret and disappointment. I say disappointment because like most 
Canadians I believe the Liberal government missed a great 
opportunity to provide all Canadians with the significant tax 
relief they so richly deserve after years of suffering and making 
concessions to bring the country's deficit under control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past couple of years the finance minister has told 
Canadians that the country is now in a surplus position when it 
comes to its finances.  In normal circumstances this would be 
reason to celebrate if Canadians were allowed to reap some of 
those benefits.  Instead they are provided with very modest tax 
relief which in many ways will be felt somewhere down the road in 
three or four years from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can no longer afford to wait much longer.  They 
deserve significant tax relief now.  All Canadians are aware of 
the billions of dollars of surplus in the EI program.  The PC 
party has consistently called for a significant reduction in the 
EI premiums. We have suggested lowering the premiums down to $2 
which is the level for long term stability recommended by the 
fund's chief actuary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the government would have us believe that Canadian 
workers are beneficiaries of some EI premium reductions since it 
took power, it seems to forget that any decreases in the EI 
premium were basically washed away by the increase in CPP 
premiums. That is not acceptable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister knows that high payroll taxes kill jobs, as 
my hon. colleague just mentioned.  We saw it and history shows 
it, yet we are not doing anything about it. The Minister of 
Finance once referred to high unemployment insurance premiums as 
a cancer killing tax on jobs.  What has happened to suddenly 
change the finance minister's way of thinking?  Why does he 
maintain these artificially high EI premiums rather than 
immediately reduce them to $2?  That was recommended by the chief 
actuary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has the highest personal income taxes among the G-7 and 
the second highest corporate tax rate in the OECD.  Naturally, 
Canadians expected to hear about significant tax breaks in the 
finance minister's  budget.  When the smoke and mirrors cleared 
away, Canadians still found themselves with the highest personal 
income tax rate in the G-7 and the second highest corporate tax 
rate in the OECD.  As a member of parliament representing a part 
of the country in this hallowed institution, I do not feel proud 
of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Chamber of Commerce has criticized the budget for 
failing to narrow the income tax gap between Canada and the U.S. 
The huge gap is already responsible for the tremendous brain 
drain which has and will continue to affect Canadian 
productivity.  We cannot continue to lose our most educated and 
brightest minds to our American competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent study by a senior researcher at the Conference Board of 
Canada confirmed that there was a significant increase in the 
number of permanent and non-permanent skilled emigrants to the 
U.S.  It went from 17,000 in 1986 to 98,000 in 1997.  Many of the 
emigrants are in the high tech and health care fields.  There is 
nothing in the budget that is going to stay the exodus of our 
brightest minds in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should Canadians celebrate this budget? The budget will do 
very little to alleviate the problem facing most of Canada's 
university students.  Already the average debt for an 
undergraduate degree from a Canadian university is approximately 
$25,000 and when we tack on interest it gets to $40,000.  That is 
a mortgage on a young person's life which is not acceptable.  It 
will restrict that young person's ability to go ahead in the 
future and do something worthwhile.  Instead of putting something 
back into the economy, he or she will be repaying that huge debt 
and will be burdened by it for a long time.  That is not 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Michael Conlon of the Canadian Federation of Students said that 
the finance minister's budget all but ensured that tuition fees 
for post-secondary education in Canada would continue to rise. In 
Nova Scotia our students already pay some of the highest fees in 
the country.  It is time for action before we lose more of our 
most valuable minds and well-educated people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague said, the decision to provide a one time 
$2.5 billion supplement to the Canada health and social transfer 
payment for education and health care over four years falls far 
short of what was expected by those institutions and what is 
required to help maintain them.  Following the budget 
announcement, the Canadian Medical Association said that the one 
time $2.5 billion amount was insufficient to deal with the 
growing crisis in medicare.  With an aging society and rising 
technological costs, the small cash infusion will not address our 
health care needs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the CMA, Canada loses approximately 400 doctors a 
year to the U.S.  Calls for a $6 billion increase in transfer 
payments over a four year period to help fund much needed new 
medical technology have been ignored by the government in lieu of 
the $2.5 billion announced in the recent budget.  The 
government's failure to address the immediate needs of an ailing 
health care system simply provides further reasons for doctors to 
seek better opportunities elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a lot recently about the possibility of having a 
two tier health care system in Canada.  We certainly do not want 
to see such a system.  The federal government is slowly trying to 
push our provincial governments in that direction because of its 
serious lack of commitment to the funding of Canada's health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time the federal government was contributing to health 
care at the rate of 50%.  Now only 13 cents of every dollar spent 
on health care in Canada comes from the federal government. 
Health care in the country is declining and the $2.5 billion over 
the next four years will do nothing or very little to rectify 
this serious situation.  Canadians demand a far greater financial 
commitment to health care than what they have seen thus far from 
the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few minutes ago I listened to my hon. colleague the 
secretary of state for rural development talk about rural 
communities.  I represent West Nova which is predominantly a 
rural community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 21 a severe winter storm hit a stretch of coastline 
and affected some five wharves between Port Lorne and Delaps 
Cove. These wharves were severely damaged, wharves that had been 
neglected over the years by the federal government.  They did not 
have adequate upkeep because of lack of funding.  Some of these 
wharves were damaged beyond repair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the answer to the repair question?  When it was asked 
for emergency relief the government said it was going to repair 
the wharves within the existing budget instead of providing the 
needed emergency relief.  Wharves that should have been repaired 
this year and which were on a priority list will now not be 
repaired because the funds will be diverted to those wharves that 
were severely damaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is neglecting our rural communities.  I find it 
difficult when I hear my hon. colleague stand and say he supports 
rural communities.  It is not so.  The Liberals' words say one 
thing and their actions say something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on for days and days about how serious this budget is 
and how little it does for Canadians, for some of the hardest 
hit, the poor. The government said it would increase the personal 
exemption by $100 from $7,200 to $7,300 in one year.  In this 
country those who cannot feed, clothe and house themselves should 
not be paying tax.  That is how I see it.

Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to the budget today.  I would 
like to speak not of past successes but of opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is poised between this year and next, into the 
next budget, to make changes that will fundamentally alter the 
way government operates in its spending practices which will make 
Canada's civil service one of the most efficient bureaucracies in 
the world and indeed our spending practices the most efficient in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a difficult time right now as a federal parliament 
because the winds of change in the provinces are such that 
cutting spending is all the rage and cutting taxes is all the 
rage.  It puts the Liberals particularly in a dilemma insofar as 
we continue to believe that there is a role for government in 
making things better for people in the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have been rightly suspicious over the years, whether 
it is a Liberal government, a Tory government or an NDP 
government, whether it is provincial or federal, that often 
taxpayers' money is not used very efficiently.  The answer in the 
provinces all too often has been simply to cut spending.  In my 
own province of Ontario that has been the typical attitude.  The 
Harris government began with that principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just had a note passed to me.  I would say that I am 
sharing my time with the hon. member for Halton, Mr. Speaker, in 
case you were not aware of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember very clearly that one of the mantras of the 
provincial Tories was that they would cut spending by 20%.  When 
one talks about hospitals, health care and all that kind of 
thing, or all kinds of social service NGOs, if spending was cut 
by 10% across the board it would not be the inefficient ones that 
would suffer, it would be the efficient ones that would suffer. 
I know of an NGO in my riding that survived the 20% cut simply by 
eliminating all of its staff.  It retained its administrators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is not simply to cut spending; the answer is to spend 
wisely and well.  I think that is where we are headed or can be 
headed as a government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not speak for the government.  I speak as a member of 
parliament.  My interests are the interests of the country, not 
simply the interests of my party or my government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that there is an opportunity now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know, for example, that the Standing Committee on Public 
Accounts has been examining for some time a whole new way of 
doing accounting.  I know and I support this catastrophe of the 
Minister of Human Resources Development.  She wanted to release 
all of these documents to the public and, naturally, some of the 
documents were found to be wanting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opportunity that presents itself to governments today, and 
to this government in particular, has been created by the 
Internet.  For the first time ever it is absolutely possible to 
put all of the documents generated by the bureaucracy on grants 
and contributions, bidding processes or purchases on the Internet 
so that the new auditor general is not some official but can be 
the people of Canada themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come into this equation in two areas because I have been very 
interested in trying to bring accountability to non-profit 
organizations and charities.  I have been trying to get 
legislation which would provide standards of transparency, 
accountability and reporting.  The theme behind that was simply 
that when organizations send in their tax and financial 
information forms to Revenue Canada, if the information could be 
guaranteed to be good, then Revenue Canada could put it on the 
Internet.  Then, when a person came to decide whether they should 
donate to one charity or another, they could call it up on the 
Internet and see for themselves how efficiently that organization 
was running. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that it was a great disappointment to me that the 
government did not announce in this budget some movement toward 
bringing legislated transparency and accountability to charities. 
However, this principle of getting that information, making sure 
it is good information and then making it available through the 
Internet is precisely what we should be doing with all government 
data that is not of a secret or confidential nature or is not an 
invasion of privacy.  That is enormous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, in the Department of Human Resources Development 
every time an organization applies for a grant it should be 
required to sign a form authorizing the government to release the 
application form by which it made that grant.  Then the people in 
the community could see who these individuals were and the people 
in the community would know fast enough whether they were 
charlatans or people who were responsible and who should be 
receiving government funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is an enormous opportunity, if government seized 
the opportunity.  In a way, I would like to think that I am part 
of that equation. 
As a matter of fact, I would like to think that all private 
members in the House, the backbenchers and the opposition 
members, could be part of that equation because I have before the 
House now, Mr. Speaker, a private member's bill that would 
complement this whole principle of transparency and making 
government documents available.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to digress and advertise my own private member's 
bill, but it is part of this entire equation of making all 
government documents which should be reasonably accessible to the 
public available and then put them on the Internet.  What a 
marvellous, marvellous move that would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say to you, Mr. Speaker, that I admire what the 
Minister of Human Resources Development tried to do.  She just 
sort of jumped the gun a bit.  What she did was, she said “All 
right, you can have all of these documents”.  It is the first 
time this has ever occurred in which a minister has disclosed 
everything from a program of grants and contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inevitably, Mr. Speaker, there are going to be problems.  That 
is inevitable.  I do not argue that the opposition should not be 
pointing out those problems, but it should not just be the 
Department of Human Resources Development, it should not just be 
a minister doing it one time, it should happen all the time.  It 
should be constant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time there is a grant or contribution or the government 
makes a purchase, so long as it is not necessarily secret because 
of national security or privacy, then it should be available on 
the Internet.  I think that is entirely possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look to the future and I think that if we bring in that type 
of transparency to government it will create the most efficient 
bureaucracy in the world and the most efficient spending 
bureaucracy in the world.  Because in the end the quarrel is not 
that money has been spent on social programs; the quarrel is 
whether that money is actually getting to the social programs it 
is supposed to get to and whether it is doing the job it is 
supposed to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I suggest to you that this House of Commons, my 
colleagues opposite, should join me in trying to bring this to 
pass, instead of, as has been occurring in the last week or so, 
blocking a private member's initiative which would benefit all 
Canadians, which would bring transparency on a scale that is 
unheard of anywhere in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have read the American freedom of information act.  It is 
nowhere near as transparent as what would occur with our access 
to information act if I could get the reforms I proposed in my 
Bill C-206 forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, Mr. Speaker, I do not want to use my time to advertise 
what is my own initiative.  It is just that I urge on my 
companions that it is good legislation and I would wish that 
they, as backbench MPs, would support it.  Actually, I have 60 
backbench MPs on the Liberal side who support it.  We could all 
take advantage of this opportunity as MPs to change the way 
government operates, to make it transparent, accountable and 
effective when it uses taxpayers' dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this not only to members of the opposition, but I say it 
to my own government.  The opportunity is in this next year.  If 
we can spend well we can save well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is absolutely possible to spend effectively, to do 
the things we have to do as a government in the economy to make 
the lives of people better, but we can also save enough to make 
sure that the debt goes down and we can even save on the taxes. 
Because in the end it is only Ontario, British Columbia and 
Newfoundland which have created this incredible example of 
cutting taxes when they still have a deficit.  The key thing, Mr. 
Speaker, is to cut taxes when you have saved and when you know 
how to spend, and spend well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to what my 
colleague across the way had to say.  I want to reflect on what 
he had to say about transparency and putting all of these things 
on the Internet.  I think that he misses a key point when he 
makes that suggestion.  I have no problem with being transparent. 
No one would argue with that, but there is a much bigger question 
that underlies all of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to give Canadians the opportunity to look at all of 
these programs and all of the grants and contributions that are 
made by government, I wonder whether they would not say “I 
think I am going to keep my money”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member, why should money be transferred from people 
who are running a business efficiently to those who are not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government talks about creating jobs, so many jobs with this 
particular project and so many jobs with that project, but it 
never says how many jobs are destroyed by taking that money away 
from Canadians who have worked hard to earn it and transferring 
it to those who cannot do something properly and efficiently. 
That is the key question that needs to be answered by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It talks about creating jobs but it never tells us how many are 
being destroyed by high taxes.  I think it is a given that high 
taxes destroy jobs.  What is the hon. member's response to that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are thousands upon 
thousands of grants and contributions which are made.  There are 
tens of thousands of purchases made by government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the system works now, there are internal checks, but 
they are not very good because we cannot check internally as 
effectively as we can check from outside.  The only outside 
checks are done by the auditor general and the occasional media 
person or MP who makes an access to information request.  We have 
to acknowledge that the access to information law, as it exists 
now, is not very effective in getting the kind of information we 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are thousands and thousands of grants and contributions 
out there.  If a bureaucrat decides to be sleepy at his task, or 
fails to send a piece of paper, or fails to do anything, the 
chances of him or her being discovered are absolutely minimal. 
The Access to Information Act is inadequate and the number of 
people who are actually looking are few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if every time that bureaucrat had to pass a piece of 
paper, and that piece of paper became available on the Internet, 
and somebody could check it, then we would see efficiency.  We 
would see efficiency in the government, in the bureaucracy, that 
would be unheard of in comparison to any corporation and in 
comparison to any bureaucracy in the world. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my Alliance colleague was right. 
When the government takes money away from a taxpayer and gives it 
to a profitable corporation all of Canada should question that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the government, in any way, shape or form, give half a 
million dollars of taxpayers' money to the Wal-Mart corporation 
to set up so-called jobs in the whip's riding?  Why would the 
government give half a million dollars to an American run 
corporation that is already, by its own standards, very 
successful in the commercial market? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I should say at the 
beginning that I am no fan of this particular type of program 
that gives money to corporations of that nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I should say to the member opposite that the reason he 
knows about that is because the minister disclosed all of that 
documentation.  That is precisely my argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to know that, not just as MPs, but the people need to 
see it as it happens so they can react and say “No, not in my 
riding, not in my town.  Do not give the money to Wal-Mart.  Do 
not give it to the corporations.  Give it to my small 
business”.  But we cannot see that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had spending in my riding that has taken me completely by 
surprise.  I did not know about it.  The only reason I could find 
out about it was because the minister made those documents 
available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I suggest we need to have happen is that we need to reform 
the Access to Information Act.  We need to make sure that 
information is produced and is available on the Internet so that 
every Canadian can become his or her own auditor general.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is indeed 
an honour to rise to debate the budget.  It has been an honour to

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will recall that when the government changed in 1993 
we encountered a deficit situation which amounted to $42 billion. 
What a difference seven years makes.  I am no fan of deficit 
budgeting.  There was a deficit when the Tories took over.  In 
half the time they doubled the debt.  It was becoming a travesty. 
Had the situation not been turned around, there is no doubt the 
International Monetary Fund would have been looking over our 
shoulder.  I remember one of the first tasks the Minister of 
Finance was required to perform.  He went to New York to calm the 
fears of Wall Street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over that seven years we have succeeded in overcoming the 
deficits and now, for the third year, are into a surplus 
situation.  I am told it is only the third time since 
Confederation that there has been a three year run of surplus 
budgeting.  It has changed the whole complexion of governance. It 
has changed the way we do business, and we have had to learn to 
do it from an entirely different perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This last budget consisted of an initial thrust into 
comprehensive tax cutting.   We had done a bit in some of the 
years before for people with lower incomes and so on as we could 
do it, and rightly so.   Now the Minister of Finance has been 
able to come in with a far broader based tax cut.  He has also 
said that as the country can afford it those tax cuts will 
increase with the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The remarkable thing about it is that unlike our friends in the 
province of Ontario it was done without maintaining a deficit 
situation.  We have maintained the surplus and we have built a 
very strong base that will reflect very positively in the 
immediate years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are into a new world, a new experience.  It is expected that 
in the next year we will have the second highest growth in the 
G-7.  The prediction is something like 3.8% and that is 
remarkable because it is not accompanied by inflation.  It is not 
accompanied by those ghosts that sit behind us when we move 
forward with a strong economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  What ghosts?   The ghosts of abuse? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  I say to my hon. friend the ghost of 
inflation is probably one of the worst ones.  I also want to tell 
my friend that we have been able to do something else.  I am 
going to defend HRDC because all members need to do is to talk to 
some of the people who have been recipients of that money about 
what it has done for them.  Letters of thanks have come in to the 
offices of members.  I would say to members across the way that 
they have all received money from HRDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  None at all? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  None. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  Fine, I can accept that gentleman's 
comments, but the other comments are a bit hypocritical because 
they have been recipients of HRDC funds.  I invite them all to go 
to those recipients.  They have a list of whom they are.  They 
should go to those organizations and ask them what the money was 
used for, where it went.

</I></B></P><P align=left>How many people who are physically handicapped were able to be 
employed because of the distribution of that money?  How many 
young people were able to experience their first job because of 
that money?  How many people were able to take retraining and 
move from a very marginal existence into a well paying, permanent 
job?  That is what that money was intended for, and that is where 
it went. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the next few months come along that evidence will be falling 
into place.  I am proud to be part of that.  Although I must say 
that the riding of Halton, which is a contributory riding and not 
a recipient riding, did not receive very much money.  We did not 
qualify for the transitional jobs fund in Halton because we had 
an unemployment rate that was too low to do so.  However, other 
funding came in to Halton for other kinds of purposes.  As the 
months go on I think all members will receive communications from 
their ridings and from the recipients saying thanks very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also remind members who are so critical of the 
government that their offices spent a lot of time contacting the 
minister's office at HRDC, pleading with her to speed up the 
transfer of money.  I am rendered speechless when I see members, 
who were recipients of HRDC money and wanted as much as they 
could get, stand in the House week after week criticizing the 
program, all 26 programs or however many there are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope those programs continue, incidentally, and I hope that 
the less fortunate, the people who sincerely deserve it, are able 
to get a leg up so that they can enter into the workforce full 
time and with a decent income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget also did some other things that are not talked about 
as much and have not been talked about in the debate.  There have 
been $700 million invested to develop environmental technologies 
and sustainable practices.  Coupled with that there are increases 
for the Canada Foundation for Innovation by another $900 million 
to $1.9 billion.  There are also $900 million over five years to 
fund and sustain 2,000 chairs for research excellence at the 
universities.  All these things dovetail together so that the 
investment in sustainability and in sustainable technologies for 
the future has really received a boost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a situation now where I think there is a general 
acceptance that global warming is a reality.  We all see evidence 
that comes to us every now and again.  The most recent one last 
week was when we learned that the oceans in the last 50 years 
have risen in temperature by half a degree.  We also saw the 
satellite shot where the big ice shelf in the Antarctic has now 
broken away.  It is twice the size of Prince Edward Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These things are cause for great concern, for if the oceans rise 
one metre hundreds of millions of souls will be displaced and 
will have to move away.  In China the figure is something like 95 
million should the oceans rise.

have a question for the hon. member.  He was praising what was in 
the budget for education.  I am wondering if a more substantial 
approach in the budget for education might have been to give 
students who are in debt up to their eyeballs a break and maybe 
allow them to deduct their student loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government says it will make it a little easier for 
those who are getting scholarships or bursaries.  That is very 
commendable, but why not put something in the budget that gets to 
the core of the problem and allows students who are in debt up to 
their eyeballs because of the government's approach to cutting 
education dollars to claim that as a tax deduction?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member made a comment.  He 
told us to talk to the recipients of grants.  Obviously if people 
are receiving a lot of money they will say it is just great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question.  Why not talk to all the people who are 
donating the money?  What about all the people who have to donate 
money to that project?  Why not talk to them?  They are the 
taxpayers of the entire country.  He tells us to talk to the 
people who are getting jobs because of it.  What about all the 
people who are having their jobs destroyed because of it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province of Saskatchewan farmers have to move off the 
land.  Their livelihood, their jobs are being destroyed because 
of high taxation.  They have to donate money to these billion 
dollar boondoggles and they are getting fed up.   How about 
talking to the people donating money and losing their jobs 
because of mismanagement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  Madam Speaker, the citizens of the great 
riding of Halton are the people who donate the money.  We have 
the honour of having one of the highest per household incomes and 
therefore the highest levels of taxation in Canada.  I talk to 
the people every election time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to ask the member a question along the same 
lines.  I think my colleague was overly kind when he said the 
people who are donating.  The fact of the matter is that the 
taxman reaches into our pockets and takes the money.  We are 
considered very bad citizens if we do not fully comply with his 
request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not against taxation per se.  Farmers in western Canada are 
going bankrupt partially because of the huge tax load and now the 
added high fuel costs with huge federal taxes.  Taxes are killing 
farmers and this is the money that is being used to presumably 
create jobs.  It is killing thousands of jobs across the country 
and killing the small business of farming in Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  Madam Speaker, I was a farmer.  It was a 
non-profit business but it did not start out that way.  I have 
great sympathy for farmers in western Canada and what they are 
going through.  I am not an accountant, but if I were an 
accountant at tax time, it would seem to me that the taxes 
farmers pay are input costs that are deductible.

<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I find this debate very interesting and enjoyable.  The 
only thing that confuses me every once and a while is how far 
away from the facts the hon. members across the way seem to be 
from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to address the budget from a principled point of view. It 
has to do with what exactly is a budget.  A budget reveals the 
values and the priorities of the government.  It also reveals, 
indirectly and directly, the character of the people who wrote or 
constructed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to present four very elementary principles of what a 
budget should do.  First, it should be achievable.  Second, it 
should be sustainable.  Third, it should help Canadians achieve 
their goals and objectives.  Finally, it should help Canadians 
realize their dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did budget 2000 fair on those principles?  First, is it 
achievable?  I suppose if interest rates do not rise very much, 
it is achievable.  We will grant that one.  Is it sustainable?  I 
would suggest that, no, it is not sustainable unless Canadians 
are prepared to stop loading onto future generations the 
expenditures on programs that they enjoy.  It may also be 
achievable if it stops the brain drain by reducing taxes.  The 
way it stands now it will not do that.  The taxation regimes are 
so burdensome that people are taking their money out of Canada 
and investing it elsewhere.  So it is not sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will not allow Canadians to achieve their goals and 
objectives either.  I know that more than 50% of the money we 
earn should be discretionary.  If I am to achieve my goals and 
objectives, I should have discretion over how that money is 
spent.  When the government takes 55% of that then I have lost 
55% of my discretion over my money.  I cannot achieve the goals 
and objectives that I want.  I cannot own my own home, I cannot 
give my children the post-secondary education that I want them to 
have and I cannot have the entrepreneurial application of capital 
so that businesses can be developed.  It will not help Canadians 
realize their dreams of their children and grandchildren having a 
better life than the one they enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget fails on at least three of the four principles we 
talked about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked myself the question:  What is the vision of the 
government?  Is it to pay down the debt?  A little while ago, the 
hon. member opposite said that the government was paying down the 
debt.  That is such a nominal amount that if we divide the amount 
of money that it is putting toward paying down the debt, which is 
roughly $3 billion a year, it will take 200 years to pay down the 
debt.  That is a 200 year vision to pay down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question I have is:  Is the government's vision to 
reduce taxes?  I looked at it and it sounded really good.  Over 
five years we will have a reduction of $58 billion in tax cuts. 
Notice that it is not a reduction in taxes. It is a cut in taxes. 
What it did not say was what the increase would be in taxes over 
that same time period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give members a specific example.  EI premiums will go 
down but CPP premiums will go up.  Guess what?  The EI premiums 
went down less than the CPP premiums went up.  The end result is 
that the individual pays more in taxes than before the cuts took 
place. That is some cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would the Canadian Alliance do?  I could criticize the 
budget in some many different ways but I will not do that. The 
Canadian Alliance is committed to principled and substantive 
fiscal responsibility, in particular tax relief.  How do I know 
that?  I know it by solution 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Solution 17 is a single rate tax.  I will not go through all the 
particular features and specifics of that but I will deal with a 
few of them and some of the benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What hon. members opposite and what we as colleagues in the 
Canadian Alliance are saying is that we want specifics but we 
also want to know why we have those characteristics. The first of 
those is to increase the base tax exemption to $10,000. That 
would take some 1.9 million taxpayers off the tax roll.  We would 
have a single marginal tax rate of 17% and we would eliminate the 
5% surtax.  What would that do for Canadians? 
Right off the top, it would eliminate the discrimination of 
single income families versus dual income families.  Why should a 
single income family be penalized and the advantage given to a 
dual income family?  It is unfair, it is inequitable and it does 
not build strong families.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another part to this.  It will also help to reduce the 
brain drain.  It will probably not stop it, because taxes are 
still too high, but it will at least help to discourage the brain 
drain.  It will also encourage the entrepreneurial spirit of 
young people.  It will allow individuals to apply their capital 
to build enterprises here in this country and develop the skill 
and talent that will make more money and increase the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have a universal child care deduction of $3,000 per 
child.  What will this do?  It will support the freedom of 
choice.  If there was one thing that democracy did it was to give 
us freedom of choice.  We want that.  Here is a tax plan that 
will do that.  It will leave the money in the hands of the 
parents so that they can choose the kind of child care that they 
believe is best for their children, not some kind of state run 
system where the government tells them this is where they should 
send their kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That particular tax plan also suggests that the RRSP 
contributions should be increased to $16,500.  What is the 
benefit of that?  The benefit of that is that it improves the 
incentive for individuals to look after their own retirement. 
What is the great benefit of this?  It makes it totally and 
completely transferable and we do not have all of these 
complications of succession duties or of transfer of funds from 
one generation to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has all the advantages for which we could possibly dream.  It 
has the general corporate tax reduced from 28% to 21%, seven 
percentage points.  That is a tremendous increase and allows 
these businesses to hire more people.  That is the kind of job 
creation scheme we should have.  We should not be doling out 
money.  We should be giving it to entrepreneurs so they can 
develop the kind of expansion in their business and hire the 
people that they need.  That is the kind of tax plan we need. 
The small business tax was reduced from 12% to 10%.  It is a 
similar set of arguments, only this time for small business. 
That is what the Canadian Alliance would do, and it is solution 
17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does it differ from budget 2000?  First, it differs 
remarkably by being specific, clear and sustainable.  That is the 
big difference.  It will give to Canadians the tools whereby they 
can achieve the goals and objectives they have for themselves and 
for their children and grandchildren.  It will allow them to 
build and to realize some of the dreams that they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people say that we are dreaming in technicolour and that it 
cannot possibly ever be because solution 17 is not that good of a 
plan.  Let me read to the House the conclusion by the people who 
put together the examination of that plan.  This was not a group 
of Reformers who are now Canadian Alliance.  It was not our 
people who did it.  This was an independent group, the same group 
that does the numbers for the Government of Canada, the Liberal 
government.  The conclusion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax reduction proposals...are well focused on the needs of 
Canadians today.  They expand the economy, and most powerfully: 
personal disposable income, consumption and our standard of 
living.  They create jobs.  By lowering the marginal tax rates 
they are particularly effective in stimulating work effort, and 
stemming the brain drain and other productivity enhancing 
features.  By powerfully reducing the level of personal income 
tax, particularly for Canadians of average and above average 
income, they are well directed at providing a more competitive 
tax environment in Canada relative to the U.S. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not my words and they are not the words of the 
Canadian Alliance.  These are the words of an independent group 
that looked at that plan and said that it will work.  We should 
listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax reduction proposals of the Reform Party, now the 
Canadian Alliance, are affordable.  If all the tax reduction 
proposals are introduced as a combined package over the 2001 to 
2004 or 2005 period, there would still be a fiscal surplus in 
each and every year.  That is very significant and we should pay 
very careful attention to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for a change.  It is necessary to recognize that 
there is an alternative to the Government of Canada today, a 
government that is there to build an achievable and sustainable 
budget that will indeed reduce taxes and leave in the hands of 
the taxpayers the disposition of their disposable income so that 
they can achieve the goals and objectives for themselves and for 
their children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
agree with many of the comments my hon. colleague made in his 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not see the division that we had perhaps in 1988 that 
actually created the growth in our economy with respect to the 
free trade agreement.  As I mentioned earlier in my speech, our 
trade with the Americans was around $90 billion and it is now 
$260 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had any kind of a downturn in the economy, particularly in 
the American economy, does the hon. member think our economic 
fundamentals are in order now?  Do we really have a plan to 
actually reduce taxes so that we can ensure that we are still 
competitive here in Canada?  Is there a plan for us to actually 
pay down the debt? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is as far as the 
Canadian Alliance is concerned.  I think the underlying 
assumption that the hon. member has made is a very significant 
one.  He is almost implying that the Canadian economy could exist 
independent of the American economy or independent of any other 
nation in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world has changed dramatically in the last while.  It is now 
a global economy.  A major part of our economic benefit comes 
from trade with other nations.  The major part of that is of 
course the American economy, the United States, our excellent 
neighbours to the south.  We benefit from them and they benefit 
from us.  It is a mutual and beautiful symbiotic relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was a downturn in the American economy would it affect 
us?  Of course it would.  It is simply nonsensical to suggest 
that it would not affect us.  Do we have a plan to deal with that 
situation?  I wish I had an hour to tell the hon. member about 
that, but I will tell him how much the output costs are of every 
job creating scheme that has been created by his government the 
Conservative Party, when it was in power, or when the Liberals 
were in power.  Does he realize that for every tax dollar that is 
given away in the form of job creation schemes, there is an 
output cost?  For payroll taxes, it is 27 cents.  For every 
dollar that is put out in a job creation scheme, 27 cents is lost 
in output costs.  For the sales tax it is roughly 17 cents.  For 
capital costs it is $1.15 for every $1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it any wonder that people are discouraged when they see all 
these millions of dollars going there?  In fact, Jim Mirrlees, 
who developed the optimum tax theory, has clearly indicated that 
by applying that to the Canadian billion dollar HRDC system it 
actually costs the Canadian economy $529 million in order to give 
away $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the net gain?  It is not nearly as much as what the 
government is suggesting.  It kills jobs in other places.  It 
kills expansion and it does not last. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened to the member's speech and I disagreed with it almost 
from the beginning to the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe very strongly in the balanced approach.  He knows well 
that the economy depends on all sorts of things.  I believe in 
paying down the debt.  We have paid down $20 billion in market 
debt and almost $10 billion in internal debt.  I believe in tax 
cuts.  We have made tax cuts once we had balanced the books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do strongly believe in reinvestment.  Government has a 
tremendous role which Canadians support in our society.  This 
government is reinvesting in Canadians, both Canadians who are 
making money and in Canadians who are at risk, are having great 
difficulties or are in ill health.  It is a balanced approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member keeps using a term that I do not understand.  What is 
this Canadian Alliance he keeps speaking about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is absolutely 
tremendous.  I would love to enlighten the hon. member as to what 
this Canadian Alliance is.  I will tell him what the Canadian 
Alliance is.  The Canadian Alliance is the alternative to the 
Liberal government.  This is a brand new party that has just been 
created.  It received 91.9% support in Calgary last Saturday 
night, March 25, if the hon. member needs to know the date.  That 
is the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the balanced approach, yes, I am totally involved 
in the balanced approach.  Let us pay down the debt so we have a 
balanced budget.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to the 
budgetary policy of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that many members today have said that Canada's growth in 
regard to the other G-7 countries is very good, in the 
neighbourhood of the third best I believe.  I certainly agree 
that the economy is doing well.  I would probably disagree with 
the government as to how much is a direct result of its actions. 
Let us look at this growth and what the government does with the 
money that comes to it which is to be used for programs and other 
things in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start with health care.  It is my understanding that 
health care is funded at about a 1994-95 level. Thousands and 
thousands of Canadians are left standing in waiting lines because 
there is no MRI machine, bed or some other facility for them to 
receive the medical treatment they need. Education also seems to 
be underfunded.  Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a first nations reserve in my riding of Selkirk—Interlake, 
the Fairford Indian reserve, why are hundreds of people living in 
construction trailers?  We could fly out there today and see 
people living in construction trailers with no bathrooms, at 
eight or ten degrees below zero.  If there is money in the 
government and it is running massive surpluses, why are people 
living in construction trailers?  I do not understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may be part of the answer to my second question.  The 
Corbière decision referred to off reserve aboriginal people 
having the right to vote in reserve elections.  Why is the money 
going to the assembly of chiefs to look at this issue instead of 
the very people that are off the reserves and need the funding in 
order to exercise that franchise on the reserves? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It shows that the spending is wasteful and the government has 
its priorities wrong.  That first nation which I spoke of is a 
real sad situation. Church services are currently being held in a 
small building because the original church burned down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are sad commentaries on how the government is handling its 
budget.  I will now go on with some straightforward suggestions 
and programs it could be utilizing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture has some real bright spots but it also has some 
problems.  It is the government's responsibility in dealing with 
the budget to deal with problems. The 2000 budget certainly did 
not offer any long term plan for the future of farming in Canada. 
There was an announcement of $400 million between the federal 
government and the provinces for Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  That 
had been announced previous to the budget but it was announced 
again so the government could get double mileage out of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government left out every other province and farmers are 
hurting in the other provinces as well.  At least Alberta had the 
backbone and common sense to say that it could not leave its 
farmers unprotected from foreign subsidies. In place of the 
federal government taking some action regarding the farmers, the 
Alberta government said it was going to pay out $4.29 an acre and 
give the farmers some help.  This was done in time for spring 
seeding. The money is already on the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget failed to do a number of things.  It failed to 
provide meaningful or timely emergency compensation to farmers 
that were suffering from other countries' trade distorting 
subsidies.  That is something that could have been done.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the previous money the government had already made out under 
AIDA, that was a fine, good program in the that it had money in 
it but the delivery has been a disaster. Around 25% or 26% of 
that money has been delivered when the promise was that for 
1998-99 it would all be delivered in time for seeding in the 
previous year and this spring.  We still have not seen that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ongoing scandal at the federal human resources department is 
another example that the government does not know how to deliver 
program money. When it wants to use money for political purposes, 
it can simply shovel the money out the door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has an opportunity in a budget to reduce taxes. 
In regard to agriculture, the federal excise tax on gasoline 
could have been reduced. It is four cents. Farms particularly in 
western Canada but also in other parts of the country have large 
fuel bills.  Fuel is one of their major expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario just south of here the Oxford County Federation of 
Agriculture has estimated that farmers will pay between 48% and 
50% more on their fuel costs than they did a year ago.  In my 
riding of Selkirk—Interlake we were buying fuel at approximately 
28 cents to 29 cents a litre.  When I last looked at a bill a few 
weeks ago it is up in the range of 40 cents to 45 cents.  The 
hurt that is being felt in Oxford county is being felt right 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government does not quite get it and its individual 
members of parliament do not understand.  Last Sunday the member 
for Oxford was quoted as saying that a reduction in fuel taxes 
would do little to help farmers so just leave the taxes on.  I do 
not know how that rationale applies, “We cannot help you very 
much so we will not help you at all”.  It is time to say give me 
a break because the government should be doing everything 
possible, even the little things, to help farmers, aboriginal 
people and people with low incomes. There are thousands of places 
where the government could be doing a much better job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continues to charge user fees.  The auditor 
general has indicated time and time again that he is not sure who 
the beneficiary is or who should actually be charged a user fee. 
In the cases of the ones being applied against agriculture, they 
are not being reduced.  They are continuing to be applied and 
that further reduces the income of farmers who are having a tough 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fighting high foreign subsidies is also something the government 
could be doing.  In our trade with France for instance, it has a 
surplus of about $2.5 billion over what Canada exports to that 
country.  It would seem to me that is a fairly strong negotiating 
tool that we could use in our negotiations with the European 
Union and France to get them to lower their subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee on agriculture had an interesting 
presentation from the National Farmers Union.  Its economic 
theory sounded a lot like that of the New Democratic Party.  It 
does not believe that subsidies have any effect on the amount of 
grain that would be produced by a farmer.  I do not think even 
Liberal members believe that economic theory.  It was a pretty 
interesting presentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only sum up by saying that the government does not seem to 
be listening to farmers.  I will conclude by saying what farmers 
do want.  They want a voluntary Canadian Wheat Board. They want a 
commercial contracts based grain transportation system.  They 
want simple, predictable long term safety net disaster programs. 
They want good health care and good education. They want a future 
for their children in agriculture.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
member mentioned taxes on gasoline and I know he did not mean the 
GST because farmers get it back as a rebate.  Excise tax on 
diesel is four cents a litre, the lowest in the G-8 countries. It 
is 10 cents a litre on gasoline. Because this is a business cost, 
farmers get some of that back. I would support lowering these 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member misquoted one of my colleagues.  I see the problem 
this way.  Frank McKenna took three cents a litre off gasoline a 
few years ago resulting in the price going down for a day or two. 
The following week it was back up at the same level.  The three 
cents which had been taken off was not going to the consumers but 
it was going to the oil companies which were already making too 
much money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member would ask his provincial government to 
regulate the price of gasoline in his province in such a way that 
the taxes that were cut by the federal government would genuinely 
flow not to the oil companies but to the farmers whom he claims 
to represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, certainly the federal 
excise tax of four cents is on Canadian farm fuel. The hon. 
member asked about the G-8 countries.  The farm subsidies in the 
G-8 countries are much higher and as a result, the cost of their 
fuel is incorporated into those subsidies whereas ours is not. 
We need to eliminate the four cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to regulating fuel, I think the member is going back 
to the old days of Pierre Trudeau and the wage and price 
controls.  We remember the fiasco that caused. The big government 
of the Pierre Trudeau era is not the kind of regulation we want 
in this country, a controlled economy which does not work. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, does the hon. member for 
Selkirk—Interlake and his new party believe that the dismantling 
of the Crow rate was a good thing or a bad thing for farmers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, the dismantling of 
the Crow rate has been a good thing for farmers. What was bad was 
the Liberal government reduced subsidies after getting rid of the 
Crow rate in other areas much faster than our competitors did. 
The reduction in the subsidies was a big problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B> Madam Speaker, I have in my office a photocopy of a 
cheque stub belonging to a young farmer who lives just north of 
me.  This young man took off some grain during damp weather.  Two 
semi trucks arrived from the grain terminal and he received 61 
cents a bushel cash advance.  By the time the trucking and the 
freight was paid this individual picked up a cheque for $1.47. 
That is as true as I am standing here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my colleague from Selkirk—Interlake, if this present 
trend continues in the west, what will it take to save it from 
complete abandonment of the agriculture industry?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, part of the answer 
lies in the answer I was giving to the member from the NDP.  When 
the Crow rate disappeared, farmers in western Canada saw a big 
livestock industry being created with our feed grains being used 
on the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are raising a lot of the hogs and cattle that were formerly 
being raised in Ontario and Quebec due to western Canada having 
the competitive advantage and eastern Canada having the advantage 
of the Crow rate to get our cheap feed grain.  Now we have the 
packing plants and the production in the west, which is helping. 
Ontario and Quebec still have a lot of that production, which is 
also good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the current farm income crisis, certainly the 
government should be supporting our farmers closer to the levels 
at which our foreign competitors, the U.S. and EU, are supporting 
theirs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it has been a delight to listen to some of this rather 
curious debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is either the last day of the Reform Party or the first day 
of the Canadian Alliance, however one wants to cut it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the budget and saving money, I have a couple 
of questions to put forward in a rhetorical sense and members 
opposite can decide whether they wish to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know, for example, if the former leader of the 
Reform/Canadian Alliance Party is sleeping in Stornoway tonight. 
I am not trying to be difficult.  I would not want to see that 
man and his lovely wife out on the streets of Ottawa.  Lord 
knows, we have a homeless problem and we do not want to 
exacerbate it.  Is the moving van in the driveway and is the new 
leader of the Canadian Alliance moving in?  Maybe they are all 
going to bunk together and have a pyjama party.  That is a 
possibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another question which has not been addressed, which 
impacts on the fiscal responsibility of the government and 
opposition parties.  Who has been paying the salary of the 
individual who is the immediate past leader of the Reform Party? 
Who has been paying the salary, which is not only an MP's salary 
but is also a salary that is afforded the Leader of the 
Opposition, along with a limousine, which of course he was not 
going to use?  We remember that.  With the limousine there is a 
chauffeur.  That is why they call them limos, I am told. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who has been paying for all that for the past three months as 
that individual travelled the nation to sell his vision of a new 
united alternative?  In all fairness, the party which stands in 
this place and purports to hold the feet of the government to the 
fire on fiscal and financial matters should be responsible enough 
to tally up the bill for living in Stornoway, that illustrious 
bingo hall down the road, and for using the limousine for the 
past three months while the member openly campaigned from sea to 
sea to sea for his own purposes, to further his own career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about all the staff time?  Was his staff working in the 
leader's office, concentrating on the business of parliament, of 
a member of parliament or of the Leader of the Opposition?  Or, 
were they in some surreptitious manner helping this individual to 
sell his so-called vision? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish that one day we could turn the tables and have someone 
from this side of the House ask a question of the Leader of the 
Opposition.  I would like to ask him to explain what I suspect 
would be hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars spent 
on campaigning to bury the old Reform Party and somehow launch 
the new.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  There is the real boondoggle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  That is right.  There is the real 
boondoggle.  Good line.  I wish I had thought of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Don Valley West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point that needs to be looked at, once we get over the 
fiscal situation, are the principles.  Just a short time ago a 
member opposite stood to talk about principles.  It seems to me 
that the Canadian Alliance and principles is an oxymoron.  Or, 
could it be that its members have discarded their support of the 
National Rifle Association and Charlton Heston?  Or, could it be 
that while they buried the Reform Party, they buried that policy 
which calls for the elimination of any form of subsidy to the 
Canadian farmer?  Is that possible?  Have they actually gone into 
the shower and rid themselves of all of those so-called 
principles and policies?  I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could it be that they are somehow hoping to ride into town on 
the wave of the new Reverend Day, who will come here with guns 
blazing, shouting his particular brand of political right wing 
extremism and the Canadian public will forget about everything 
they have said in the past few years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
As a member of the finance committee, I would say that we are 
here to discuss the budget.  I would really like you, Madam 
Speaker, to ask this member to be relevant to the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member has 
somewhat of a point.  I would ask the hon. member to keep his 
speech on the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I can understand that 
the members opposite do not want me discussing the spending 
habits of their former leader.  I do not mind the fact that they 
would raise some concern about that.  In relationship to this 
budget, could it be that the newest baby born in this place has 
somehow changed its spots?  I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about health care.  I do not care what we want to 
call it, but we have a party which clearly would abandon and 
scrap the Canada Health Act.  If that would not have an impact on 
the budget— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is a lie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  The member says that is a lie.  The 
former leader of the former Reform Party who used to occupy those 
benches has called for the scrapping of the Canada Health Act 
without any kind of plan or explanation as to what it would be 
replaced with.  I can tell members what it would be replaced 
with.  It would be replaced with a privatized, U.S. style health 
care system which the Prime Minister, the Minister of Health and 
this government would not stand for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could look at delivery mechanisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find really interesting is the confusion of members 
opposite of all parties.  I do not want to single out members of 
the fifth party.  It has been purported that the only safe seat 
is occupied by the member for Fundy—Royal.  That was probably 
true before his leader opened his mouth in support of some 
privatization of health care coming from western Canada.  That 
might have been true before the divisions in his party occurred 
when his leader did not support the clarity bill, one of the 
finest and clearest pieces of legislation ever put through this 
place.  And yet other members over there did not agree with their 
leader.  We can understand their confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about health care.  This government is committed.  The 
CHST payments have an established floor of a $11.5 
billion.  Members opposite were crying for nothing more than tax 
cuts leading up to the last budget.  What happened?  After we set 
the floor at $11.5 billion, after we provided $58 billion in tax 
relief, after we completely eliminated the $42 billion deficit 
left to us by the great legacy of the Conservative Party, after 
we invested in science and technology, created new seats in 
universities for our future, worked with our youth, helped in 
retraining, worked with people who were unemployed—after we 
did all of those things—we also provided tax cuts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then what happened?  They stood and said “You have not 
transferred enough to health care”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We put an additional $2.5 billion on the table for health care. 
Guess what?  We found out that last year, when we put an 
additional $3.5 billion on the table for health care, the 
provinces of Quebec and Ontario chose not to use that money. 
They left it sitting in a trust account, wisely invested I am 
sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand.  The people in my province and in my riding 
do not understand how they could eliminate beds in hospitals, how 
they could fill up emergency departments, how they could 
continually cry for more money to be given to health care, and 
then it comes out that they have not even spent the money that 
was allocated to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anyone over there thinks that the government is about to 
write blank cheques for anything, they are sadly mistaken.  The 
health care system must be accountable.  It must be accessible to 
all, as we know, and the government will ensure that happens. 
However, we will not do it by simply throwing money at a problem 
without a clear direction with all health ministers in the 
country, from all provinces and territories, sitting down with 
our health minister and working out a deal to ensure that we have 
sustainable, affordable, accessible health care for generations 
to come. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the hon. member's speech.  His 
speech was very indicative of what we saw in the terrible budget 
that was tabled a few weeks back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During essentially 70% of his speech he never uttered the words 
“tax cut”.  When the rest of the industrialized world is taking 
giant leaps to reduce taxes, the government is taking baby steps 
and jeopardizing this country's competitiveness well into the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government grow up and learn what a tax cut really 
is? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is really 
interesting to get a lecture from a member of the Conservative 
Party on tax cuts and fiscal management.  We know that the former 
leader of that party, the former Prime Minister and his 
government, introduced the GST.  We know that.  We understand 
that the Conservatives did that.  We understand that they 
introduced the excise tax on gasoline.  We understand that they 
did that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we understand that while the Conservatives 
want to stand and cheer on some of their accomplishments, they 
left office with an overdraft of $42 billion, with record debt, 
with an inability for the government to have any flexibility to 
deal with its fiscal program without making serious changes in 
the relationships that existed with everyone in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government bit the bullet.  Now we are rewarding Canadians 
for their hard work by making those tax cuts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, again I listened intently to my 
colleague from the Liberal Party.  He quotes numbers like $2.5 
billion for health care.  The reality is that $2.5 billion 
announced in the budget is for health care, education and other 
social programs over a four year period.  It is not just destined 
for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he is convinced that the health care announcement which the 
government made is so positive, why is every premier and 
territorial leader in the country upset and why is every other 
person who has ever accessed health care in the country, who has 
used home care and so on, upset with the Liberal government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several members on the other side, the Atlantic caucus as they 
call it, produced a document called “Catching the Wave”. 
In that document they called upon the government to introduce a 
shipbuilding policy, and I notice that the budget completely left 
that out. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Wednesday we will be having a vote on Bill C-213 from the 
Bloc Quebecois.  We will be initiating that.  Will the hon. 
member be supporting the other Liberal members of his caucus in 
supporting a very important initiative for shipbuilding policy in 
the country?  The budget certainly was not inclusive in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>   Madam Speaker, the member opposite 
knows full well that a budget is a document that shows leadership 
and gives direction for policies.  He is talking about a specific 
issue that would have to do with economic development.  The 
government has led the way in terms of economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to respond to the hon. member.  I am not sure what his 
question really was because I heard him taking the opportunity to 
bash us again on health care and then saying that was not his 
question.  Let us be clear.  The government set the level of 
transfer payments at $11.5 billion.  We added $2.5 billion to it. 
We are committed to a sustainable health care program without a 
doubt, but we will not simply open the vault and write a blank 
cheque.  That is not what the Canadian public wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am at it, let me suggest to the member that there is no 
one responsible in the country who would suggest that somehow the 
provincial governments should wash their hands of their 
responsibility as taxing authorities with relation to health 
care.  They cannot have it both ways.  They cannot take transfers 
from the federal treasury, invest them in some kind of savings 
account and then cry poor to the federal government.  The member 
opposite might want to make political mileage out of that, but 
the Canadian people will not be fooled because they know better. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I take this opportunity to talk a bit about a subject which 
relates to some of the previous interventions.  For example, the 
member for Selkirk—Interlake talked about the poor condition of 
aboriginal families in his province.  Those aboriginal people 
have children who are in even worse condition, so my subject is 
the fate and the presence of children in the most recent budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were those of us both within the government caucus and 
across the way who agitated and worked for a children's and 
families' budget to be the theme of this year's millennium 
budget.  I am looking at the hon. member for Shefford as one of 
the allies in this cause.  In some ways we were a little 
disappointed.  We did not get the package deal we wanted. 
However, let me tell the House what we did get and what we hoped 
to get.  Part of the function of a budget speech is not only to 
look back to the budget but to look forward to the next budget, 
to the great unfinished work we have before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us who agitate and work on behalf of children and their 
families see that the children and their families need two 
things.  They need more income but they also need support at the 
community level with services.  I particularly talk about the 
case of parents with young pre-school children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was good about the budget from the point of view of child 
and family policy was that we focused on three matters of income. 
First, we reduced taxes which put more disposable income in the 
hands of families with young children.  Second, because we wanted 
to make a statement that the early years are the most important 
years, we extended the parental benefit system from six months to 
a year for those children who are born after December 31, 2000. 
Third, we increased the amount available for the child tax credit 
and the national child benefit system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All those things are important because they put more disposable 
income in the hands of families with young children, but 
disposable income alone will not be the answer to what families 
need.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What families need in their daily lives is for there to be a 
system of support at the community level.  Whatever choices they 
may make in the workplace, whether they choose to work inside or 
outside the home, and whatever degree of risk their children may 
or may not be exposed to, the community will be there for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the change in family life over the last 30 years we know 
that the traditional role of community fulfilled by informal 
networks has disappeared.  With 70% of Canadian women of child 
bearing age working either part time or full time, we know that 
neighbourhoods have changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was therefore interesting to look at the unfinished work of 
the budget, the first social project of the 21st century for this 
parliament, and the following words of the finance minister in 
his speech: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why federal and provincial governments agreed to develop 
a national children's agenda, to expand the capacity of 
governments, voluntary organizations and our communities to 
provide the services and support upon which so many of our 
families and their children rely. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He pointed to the hope of the government for a national action 
plan to be arrived at by December of this year, with provincial 
governments on a system of support services at the community 
level to help young children and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be the first great test of the social union framework 
agreement.  It will require the provinces and the federal 
government to sit down and work out what a national action plan 
would mean that would allow communities to access an early 
childhood development services fund to do a better job in filling 
in the gaps, which we all know to be present in our communities, 
if we are in the business of raising young children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be an extraordinarily important and difficult 
operation.  I hope we arrive at such an agreement but it will 
require the agreement of the provinces.  It will require the 
support of communities to show us what they would do with the 
money.  It will require the support of parents in whatever 
situation they find themselves to put pressure on us as 
politicians to do it. In turn, I hope it will trigger in the next 
budget a fund for community development services for our youngest 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will not be an easy matter, but what I find so heartening 
is that within this caucus and across parliament there are people 
who are dedicated to improving the lives of children and their 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us understand that the magic of a democratic society 
rests in its civil society, in its neighbourhoods and 
communities.  The family may be the building block upon which we 
construct family policy without understanding the magic of 
community.  Why is it that some communities do a better job in 
preparing young children for school and making them confident 
about their future?  Why is it that other communities with the 
same or more income do not do such a good job?  It goes beyond 
income.  It goes to the matter of social cohesion.  It goes to 
the things which will overcome income if we do it right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have in your constituency, Mr. Speaker, a community which 
does this job.  Port Colborne is an example of an area which goes 
beyond income to produce a kind of wovenness.  Our challenge as 
we look to the future budget is to support such communities.  The 
federal government and the provinces should sit down together on 
a national action plan that will put in place the things families 
need, whether it is child care, parenting resources, parenting 
courses, drop-in centres, playgrounds, nutrition programs, and in 
particular nutrition programs for expectant mothers because that 
is when so much crucial brain development takes place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to put in place a system so that every family knows 
where to find the support it needs and we do not have mothers 
living in isolation, cut off from the community.  We need to do 
it in a way which recognizes the character of every Canadian 
community.  If we do our job well we reduce the risks all 
Canadian children experience.

poverty is a major risk factor for Canadian children and that 40% 
of poor children experience emotional or learning difficulties 
when they are in school.  It is also true that 20% of the best 
off children in the country also experience those risks.  There 
are more middle class children with emotional and learning 
difficulties in school than poor children because the middle 
class is so much bigger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My plea is for all of us as we look to next year's budget to 
understand that we have a great piece of work ahead of us in 
working toward a national action plan to provide services at the 
community level for Canada's children.  If we do our job right, 
this may be the greatest thing for which all of us will 
ultimately be remembered. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened to the Liberals promise 
a future for our children and for health care.  Yet they still 
have not been able to maintain their 1993 promise on the day care 
concern across the country.  They also failed to break their 
promise on the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the child tax credit, which they talked an awful lot about, 
they never put in strict guidelines to say that provinces could 
not claw that money back.  This happens now in my province.  My 
fear is that with the additional money through the child tax 
credit again the province of Nova Scotia will claw that money 
back because the federal government refuses to tell the province 
that under no circumstances can that money be clawed back.  I 
would like the hon. member's comments on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Godfrey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member may be 
surprised to know that I agree with him on two issues.  Some of 
us who ran in the 1993 election and took the promise of a 
national child care strategy seriously do not consider that 
promise stale dated.  Some of us believe it is an ideal toward 
which we should be working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also understand it is only part of a bundle of services that 
have to be undertaken at the community level.  We do not restrict 
ourselves to the vision of a national child care strategy, though 
it would be central to the piece I have described on community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the clawback provision and the looseness of the 
reinvestment framework strategy for the national child benefit, I 
agree with him again.  Whatever else we do in our national action 
plan we must make sure that a kind of discipline is imposed on 
ourselves and on the provinces.  That discipline will come 
through the social union framework agreement when we allow 
ourselves to look at outcomes, to be held accountable to the 
Canadian public and to make outcomes like school readiness or 
birth weight, for example, part of the whole package in the 
accountability regime.  We are not as far apart as he might have 
thought.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, one 
part of the speech I did not pick up was actually mentioned by a 
couple of members.  The government has allocated more revenues 
with respect to the environment.  We all know that the 
environment was the sixth largest department when we were in 
government.  Now it is the very smallest, the 21st largest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was this initiative, this little tidbit of cash, put in place to 
assist the government in passing its first piece of environmental 
legislation of its own?  Is that why we had a bit of an 
augmentation in the environmental budget? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Godfrey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will attempt to weave 
the environmental piece back into the story of children by 
pointing out that in the budget we have allocated money, as the 
hon. member suggested, for the environmental health piece. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which are the most vulnerable populations in terms of 
environmental health?  It is very young children and very old 
people.  Anybody who wishes to undertake a family or child based 
policy, as the hon. member suggested, has to take a horizontal 
view of all these questions and issues.  We understand that if we 
do a survey of government departments whose policies have an 
impact on young children, we could easily find 16 or 17 including 
the Department of the Environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we undertake these great challenges for the 21st century, 
the challenge will be to take traditional line governments and 
traditional orders of government between the provinces and the 
feds and ask how in these cross-cutting issues we can develop a 
full policy which makes sense in a holistic way, which takes into 
account the environmental dimensions of a children's policy or 
the childhood dimensions of an environmental policy.  The two are 
inextricably linked.
