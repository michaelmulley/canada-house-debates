</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant 
to Standing Order 36(8), I have the honour to table, in both 
official languages, the government's response to six petitions.

<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in the House to make a statement on the Government 
of Canada's position following the adoption yesterday in Alberta 
of bill 11, legislation that provides for the expansion of the 
role of private for profit facilities in delivering surgical 
services in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first put this issue into a broader context.  We all know 
that the time has come to strengthen and renew Canadian medicare. 
Indeed, governments across the country accept that the status 
quo is no longer an option.  The Government of Canada recognizes 
that it must do its part and is prepared to commit to long term 
stable increases in funding to support a common plan and set of 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The improvements and the changes required can and must occur 
within the context of our public medicare system.  The principles 
of the Canada Health Act are broad and flexible enough to allow 
for innovation while building on the strengths of our single 
payer system.  It is clear from the reaction of the majority of 
Albertans to bill 11 that they strongly agree.  They know that we 
need not imperil our principles in order to improve our 
practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For our part, the Government of Canada, has repeatedly expressed 
the view that bill 11 is not the direction in which we should be 
heading to strengthen our publicly funded health care system.  We 
have grave reservations about investing public funds in private 
for profit facilities, particularly where they offer services 
that involve overnight stays. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to reiterate for the House the concerns that I have 
outlined to the Government of Alberta and the steps we plan to 
take to safeguard the interests of Albertans, and all Canadians, 
with regard to the principles of the Canada Health Act. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we have already informed the Government of Alberta that 
surgical facilities as defined in bill 11 will be considered for 
our purposes to be hospitals within the meaning of that term in 
the Canada Health Act.  The practical effect of what that means 
is that any charges to patients or insured health services in 
these facilities will be considered a violation of the Canada 
Health Act.  I want to make it clear that should that happen I 
have the power required to fulfil my responsibilities as Minister 
of Health and enforce the Canada Health Act in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a second matter, we suggested some weeks ago to the 
Government of Alberta that bill 11 be amended to reflect 
legislation in Saskatchewan and Ontario that prohibits charging 
for enhanced services in private for profit facilities.  To 
permit for profit facilities to sell enhanced services in 
combination with insured services may create a circumstance that 
represents a serious concern in relation to the principle of 
accessibility in our health care system.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Alberta has chosen not to make such an 
amendment.  We are therefore serving notice today that we will 
monitor closely what may happen on the ground in private for 
profit facilities permitted under Bill 11 to ensure that queue 
jumping and other accessibility issues do not arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not singling out Alberta, but we will ensure compliance 
with the Canada Health Act in Alberta as in any other province. 
If violations of the Canada Health Act occur we have the 
authority to act and we will do so. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say a word about the way in which the Government of 
Canada is permitted to enforce the principles of the Canada 
Health Act. We cannot withhold funds based only on a suspicion 
that practices might develop under the bill that might 
contravene the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process to be followed is clearly outlined in the CHA.  A 
case must be built; concrete evidence must be collected and 
shared with the province in question; efforts must be made to 
resolve the conflict and, should that fail, then funds will be 
withheld. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to work openly and transparently with all 
provinces, in accordance with our social union framework 
commitments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of Canada Health Act compliance, the auditor 
general has recently expressed his view that Health Canada does 
not have the capacity to enforce its responsibilities under that 
act.  I am therefore immediately allocating an additional $4 
million to an existing budget of $1.5 million annually to 
monitor, assess and ensure compliance with the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, Health Canada will have increased staff across the 
country to monitor compliance with the act's principles and 
conditions and to develop a capacity to investigate potential 
non-compliance issues and to assess the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message of the Government of Canada today is clear.  We 
intend to meet our responsibilities to protect public medicare in 
this country.  The health care system does not belong to 
governments or to political parties, it belongs to Canadians. 
Parliament has given us the tools to enforce the Canada Health 
Act.  Canadians expect us to use those tools when necessary to 
protect our principles.  I will make certain that those 
principles are respected in Alberta and throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me close by saying that while we are prepared to act if 
there are violations, I also hope that we do not reach that 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I began by saying that the time has come to renew and strengthen 
public medicare in Canada.  That is a process that will require 
collaboration and co-operation among all governments.  In the 
last analysis, we will not preserve medicare simply by enforcing 
rules.  We will do so by renewing our common commitment toward 
its principles and objectives.  That involves, among other 
things, the proper level of funding, including appropriate 
funding from the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will devote my efforts in the weeks and months ahead toward 
building a constructive working relationship with Alberta and 
other provinces focusing on the creativity and innovation that 
will be required if we are to preserve for all Canadians what 
they cherish most, a strong public health care system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I listened with interest to the statement by the health minister. 
His rhetoric was excellent.  He talked about co-operation.  He 
talked about protecting the Canada Health Act.  He has made the 
statement over and over that the status quo is not good enough. I 
would like to go over a few of the objective facts which I do not 
think the minister mentioned.  He probably would not like them 
mentioned in this forum.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 health and education transfers to the provinces were 
$18.8 billion.  That was when the Liberals took office.  Today in 
2000 they are $15.5 billion, and they went down to as low as 
$12.5 billion.  Most important are statistics regarding per 
capita spending under health, which under the federal Liberals 
has dropped.  That comes directly from the health institute.  We 
have dropped from number two in health care spending in the 
world.  We are now number five and dropping.  Those statistics 
are not up to date.  They are about three years old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private share of health in Canada when the Liberals took 
power was 27%.  It is now over 30%.  Fewer procedures are covered 
under medicare today compared to 1993.  Public confidence in 
health care today is at the lowest level in Canadian history. The 
final and probably the worst issue is that the waiting lists in 
Canada are longer today than they have ever been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am optimistic about health care because I do not believe 
Canadians will let health care be lost.  Even some high profile 
Liberals have come out lately and said that the status quo was 
not enough.  They are not willing to leave it at a statement like 
that.  I do not agree with this, but Tom Kent said that user fees 
might be necessary in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Liberal response to the bill in Alberta, a place 
where I practised medicine for 25 years?  More health police, 
that is the commitment.  More threats, that is the commitment. 
More protection of the system instead of the patient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to spend just a brief minute on bill 11.  It is a 
very tentative step toward innovation, a very modest step.  I 
believe that provinces which try to innovate, try to improve 
waiting lines, and try to bring in fresh new thinking should be 
rewarded rather than threatened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would I do if I were the health minister in this case?  I 
would say to Alberta, if I did not agree with bill 11, that it 
has two years to prove that the bill will do something.  Alberta 
believes that this bill will shorten waiting lines.  Can we 
measure the waiting lines today and can we measure them in two 
years?  If bill 11 reduces waiting lines in Alberta, I would 
reward the province.  I would give it a big pat on the back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government will not be judged by its rhetoric.  It 
will be judged by its actions.  What should the government do?  I 
should like to be constructive in this regard.  Funding should 
not be covered in a big Canada health and social transfer, but 
federal funding should be specific for health so that every 
Canadian could judge whether or not the funding was appropriate. 
There should be a growth factor for inflation and for population 
growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said before that we should reward provinces that reduce waits. 
Would I have health police to monitor how Alberta is doing?  No, 
I would let the citizens of Alberta decide whether or not their 
provincial government was looking after medicare in the way they 
felt was appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I direct this comment to the health minister.  I would beg the 
health minister to put the patient first rather than the system. 
If he will do that, medicare will survive.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to begin by stating that the intervention by the Minister of 
Health is, at the very least, paradoxical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a minister proposing the addition of $4 million 
extra to hire more staff for inspection and monitoring purposes 
relating to the enforcement of the Canada Health Act.  The five 
principles set out in that act include universality, 
portability, and public funding, as we are entitled to expect 
for public services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, the federal government is not fulfilling its 
part of the contract as far as health is concerned.  Take Quebec 
for example. 
As we speak, the federal government contributes a little over 20 
cents, 22 to be exact, of every dollar invested in health. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet when the public plans were set up in the 1960s, the federal 
government committed to a 50% contribution.  On a number of 
occasions, all provincial premiers have demanded that this 
government re-establish transfer payments to their 1993-94 level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a party, we do not subscribe to the reflex of privatization 
of certain provinces.  Thank heavens, the Government of Quebec 
is very far removed from such a desire for privatization. 
It is our profound belief that governments have the 
responsibility to use public funds and public resources to put 
into place a generous, universal, accessible health system, one 
which meets the needs of our fellow citizens, particularly in 
today's context, with not just the elderly but also another 
group more advanced in age, the old elderly, and with people 
wanting to remain in their natural communities as long as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are forced to see a connection between the fact that this 
government has cut transfer payments to the provinces and the 
fact that that the provinces did not always get their share of 
the resources they were entitled to expect from it in order to 
keep the system viable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister be surprised at this point?  How can the 
minister play wounded innocent?  How can he be so hypocritical 
today as to oppose this in the role of defender of the public 
health system, when he himself is not fulfilling his part of the 
contract? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the minister that we are prepared to go along with him 
in certain instances, such as the case of smoking, where we do 
not want young people to be the primary victims of inadequate 
information when their health is concerned.  But we will go 
after this minister to get him to assume his responsibilities 
and reinstate the transfer payments at their 1993-94 level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not surprising today, since the federal government has 
failed to honour its part of the contract, that certain 
provinces are tempted to privatize. 
We might have wished that, in addition to announcing the 
increase in staff for inspection work, what we might call the 
health police, the government would assume its share of the 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of transfer payments, for Quebec alone, $1.4 billion has 
been cut in health care.  If the Minister of Health is serious 
and concerned about the integrity of the public health care 
systems, his first responsibility is to rise in this House and 
say that he will lead the battle in Cabinet to have the transfer 
payments returned and that he will deliver the money he owes the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Quebec alone, the figure of $500 million is at issue 
annually, for health care alone.  That is the equivalent of 
Quebec's entire budget for home care, and about half the budget 
for the CLSCs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister wants to have some credibility, if he wants 
opposition parties to work with him, if he wants to be a 
respected voice in the health sector, his number one 
responsibility is to support the provinces, which are urging him 
to be a strong voice within cabinet and demand that transfer 
payments be restored. That is the minister's primary 
responsibility, and I hope that he will work on that in the 
coming days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all too easy to be concerned about what is going on in the 
provinces. It is all too easy to want to encroach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister sent a letter to the Standing Committee on Health 
asking us to set up a national mental health strategy. What 
business does the federal government have with mental health? 
Read the letter sent to us by the minister. He wants a national 
mental health strategy. But this area does not come under his 
jurisdiction. Let us not be hypocrites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all too easy to be concerned about the provinces violating 
the law, considering that in 1966 the government itself, as a 
partner, pledged to contribute 50% to health care programs, but 
does not do so. It is all too easy to be concerned like that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not expect this minister to be a tormented soul, but like 
all my Bloc Quebecois colleagues and, I am sure, all the 
opposition members, I do expect him to loosen the purse strings, 
resist the temptation to set up new national programs, avoid any 
future encroachment and assume his responsibilities, which are 
to restore health transfer payments to their 1993-94 level.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with a profound sense of sadness that I rise today to address the 
remarks of the Minister of Health.  It is ironic and 
disappointing in the extreme that I am responding to remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since bill 11 was unveiled last fall on November 17, to be 
exact, the Minister of Health has offered nothing but remarks on 
how the bill is bad policy, remarks on how he wanted Ralph Klein 
to withdraw the bill, and remarks on how important it is to 
protect our public accessible health care system.  Today, as the 
biggest threat ever to medicare has now passed into law, what is 
the government's response?   More remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 17, 1999, the NDP called for action.  The minister's 
response at the time was “The proposals that came from Alberta 
arrived today.  We are looking at them”.  On December 13, 1999, 
the NDP called for action.  The minister's response was “We will 
react to it as soon as we have completed our examination”.  On 
March 2 the NDP called for action.  The minister's response was 
“We are awaiting tabling of the legislation later today”.  On 
March 15 the NDP called for action.  The minister's response was 
“We have yet to see the regulations”.  Again on Tuesday the NDP 
called for action.  The minister's response was “We will monitor 
what happens”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is an historic day, a sad day, a shameful day, a day when 
Canada's health minister has said that a parallel for profit 
health care system can proceed. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a day when the Minister of Health has said that a hospital 
can exist and operate on a for-profit basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B> He has said that our country is now one 
where the wealthy can get health care ahead of the less wealthy. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that the content of bill 11 is not bad, not a problem, 
but that there may be dangers in its implementation.   This is 
the minister's ticket into the history books because according to 
his own words private for profit hospitals are not in and of 
themselves bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine the facts.  For months the minister said today 
would be the day of action.  Yet all we have is more talk, more 
remarks about how he might act tomorrow.  There is not a word on 
his secret 12 point privatization deal with Alberta.  There is 
not a word on NAFTA's implication.  There is not a word on his 
own $24.7 billion in federal cuts that Ralph Klein uses as an 
excuse.  There is not one word on the fact that Ralph Klein 
introduced bill 11 just two days after the federal Liberal budget 
gave a mere two cents for health care for every dollar in tax 
cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear the minister has dropped the ball, as my kids would 
say, big time.  We welcome today's long overdue announcement that 
real enforcement of the Canada Health Act will finally begin, but 
the fact is that on November 30, 1999, the NDP called for 
enforcement of the Canada Health Act. The fact that the 
government is finally paying for health care monitoring is not a 
response to bill 11, because a real response to bill 11 would 
take action.  It would not just speak about the possibility of 
taking action at some future date.  A real response would be for 
the minister not to be outsmarted by Ralph Klein. 
If it is the minister's opinion that bill 11 complies with the 
Canada Health Act, then amend the Canada Health Act to give it 
the teeth needed to protect medicare.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 12 the minister said that bill 11 imperils the 
principle of accessibility.  I would argue that it kills the 
principles of accessibility but let us stick with the minister's 
words.  If it imperils medicare's foundation, then for heaven's 
sake, take action.  If the minister does not think he can take 
action, then change the Canada Health Act to allow it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has already amended the Canada Health Act.  In 
1995, section 6 was removed in order to allow greater 
privatization.  It could be amended again so as to prevent 
greater privatization. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead the minister chooses to posture.  It is posture because 
the NDP raised existing violations of the Canada Health Act both 
in Calgary and Montreal recently and the minister chose to do 
nothing.  It is posture because four years ago the last time a 
Liberal health minister went to Alberta to supposedly save 
medicare, we got a secret deal facilitating two tier and 
privatization.  It was a secret deal that paved the way for bill 
11 today.  If the minister had wanted to act, he could have 
cancelled that secret deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is astounding that the minister still has not tabled and 
today did not even mention a single legal opinion on the NAFTA 
implications of bill 11.  He announced a medicare police force 
but he ignored the fact that if NAFTA takes effect, the lawmaker 
will not be him, the lawmaker will be an unelected, unaccountable 
trade tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 26, 1999 the minister said “Bill 11 may run afoul 
of provisions of NAFTA”.  On April 12 the minister actually 
boasted about raising with Alberta a definite problem with NAFTA. 
On April 13 the minister said the situation was so serious that 
two other ministries and their experts were studying the NAFTA 
implications. We do not have these studies.  The minister now 
says that the Canadian right to regulate and protect our health 
care system is not affected by NAFTA. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the studies to support this brave statement?  Where 
are they? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Barry Appleton says that bill 11 loses our NAFTA exemption.  His 
study is public.  The last time the Liberals said he was wrong, 
they lost it at NAFTA.  If the minister is saying Appleton is 
wrong and he is right, where are the studies?  Show us the 
studies.  If Appleton is right and the minister is wrong, he can 
have a million cops to police medicare but a NAFTA tribunal can 
overrule them all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's statement by the minister does nothing to stop the 
massive threat that bill 11 presents.  It does nothing to stop 
Mike Harris from doing his own bill 11, nothing to stop John Hamm 
from doing the same, and nothing to stop Bernard Lord.  Ralph 
Klein's bill sadly is now law; it is unchanged, it will affect 
Albertans and thanks to this minister, it will affect us all. 
The minister's legacy and the Prime Minister's legacy will be the 
destruction of medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the thousands of Albertans who bravely fought Ralph 
Klein, I condemn the minister's cowardice.  On behalf of millions 
of Canadians, we will not forget.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is a crisis in health care and the blame for that 
can be laid right at the door of the government and specifically 
the health minister.  The government has had seven years to do 
something, seven years with not one single idea.  If that is not 
frightening in itself, just consider this.  If the Liberals stay 
in power until 2004, and hopefully they will not, but if they do, 
the Liberal government will have surgically removed $30 billion 
from health care alone.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the fact that Ralph Klein and other premiers have had to 
scramble, the question would be why not?  They have had no 
choice.  Funding has been drastically reduced to the point where 
the provinces are going to have to make up the shortfall.  The 
government has created this crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The approach by the government has been ad hoc, making it up as 
it goes along.  The Liberal government has never had a plan and 
it has been going on seven years without a plan.  The health 
minister should consider calling a national symposium on health 
care with all of the stakeholders in one room.  It should include 
health care professionals, caregivers and doctors along with the 
first ministers, the health ministers and most important, the 
Prime Minister.  Why has that not been done?  The government has 
conveniently blamed the provinces for the past seven years. That 
approach is not going to work. It is going to cost the Liberal 
Party its power. Canadians are not going to take any more. It 
reminds me of the famous phrase, no ideas, no votes.  The 
government is devoid of ideas in the health care field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has violated the five principles of the 
Canada Health Act not to mention what the provincial governments 
have done.  Just to remind the health minister, the five 
principles are a system that is accessible, universal, 
comprehensive, portable and publicly funded.  If the system is 
not publicly funded as it has to be by the federal government, 
what choice do the provinces have?  The answer is simply no 
choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read into the record a couple of questions that my 
leader, Joe Clark, had on this issue.  These drive the point home 
quite well.  Why does the Liberal government not restore the 
health care funding that was taken away without consultation 
right now?  Why does the Liberal government not restore the 
stability of funding so that hospitals and health care 
professionals and provinces can plan with some certainty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party and our leader suggest that we need a sixth principle 
in health care which would be stable, long term, sustainable 
funding so the provinces know where they are going and what they 
can do.  Making it up as we go along is simply not good enough. 
We are asking for leadership on this issue.  We have had 
absolutely no leadership from the minister or the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read the minister's statement.  What has he come up with?  A 
paltry $4 million for what is now called health care police.  The 
government is going to spend $4 million to peek around the 
corners, lift up the carpets and find out what is going on within 
the hospital system. Is that the best the government can do after 
seven years?  It is not good enough.  I am suggesting that the 
government immediately call together all the principal 
stakeholders in the health care field and get to work to come up 
with a long term sustainable plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has basically taken $30 billion out of the system 
and downloaded it on the backs of the taxpayer.  At the end of 
the day where does that money go?  What is done with it?  Where 
is the shortfall?  Is it ever used?  Does it show up?  Of course 
it does.  The Liberals are bragging about balancing the books, 
fiscal responsibility.  It is fiscal responsibility on the backs 
of the taxpayers.  The government has no plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. system scares the heck out of Canadians and that system 
is the way our system is headed if the Liberals stay in power. 
The U.S. system is fueled by two things: litigation and insurance 
companies.  We do not want to see that happen here. Unfortunately 
if the minister stays in his present job and the Liberal 
government stays in power, that is exactly where we are headed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces are scrambling to make up the difference. Examine 
everything that has happened in Alberta and all the other 
provinces. Incidentally, Alberta is not alone in this.  In my 
home province of New Brunswick, the private sector accounts for 
about 35% of all spending.  In Alberta it is slightly less than 
that.  The problem is not isolated in Alberta alone.  It affects 
all provinces and jurisdictions simply because the federal 
government has refused to act on the number one issue or the 
number one challenge in the minds of all Canadians.  Young or 
old, we are all suggesting that the federal government can do 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The underlying theme to our position is let us see the plan. The 
Liberals have been here for seven years. The backbenchers love to 
yak, but they are devoid of ideas themselves.  They are nothing 
more than lapdogs to the minister who has consistently done 
nothing about this problem.  If they have something constructive 
to say, then they should get up on their hind legs and let us 
hear them.  They have not done a single thing. They are nothing 
more than the peanut gallery.  They are trained seals who prop up 
the health minister whenever he needs it.  Today is no exception. 
Let them come across and we will give them some ideas.  Let them 
be brave enough to stand up on their hind legs and suggest what 
some of those ideas might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want leadership on this issue.  Canadians are demanding 
leadership. There has been no leadership.  No ideas, no votes. 
The jury is out.  The Canadian public will decide whether the 
Liberals have handled this file properly or not.  I suggest they 
have not.

is a pleasure for me to rise today to speak to the Group No. 3 
amendments to Bill C-16, the citizenship bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 6 refers to the review committee and the appointment 
by the governor in council of retired judges.  The amendment asks 
that opposition parties have a real say.  In other words, the 
opposition parties should have the chance to consent, not simply 
for the government to consult them, as happens most of the time. 
We hear about what is going on, but in the end it ends up being a 
partisan appointment, hopefully of a qualified person, but that 
is not always the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Granted this position will be rarely used, since it would only 
be in the case where the review committee cannot come to a 
decision.  I will be supporting this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 7, concerning clause 31, is an amendment that is 
totally logical.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“(1.1) The Governor in Council shall not appoint a person who 
has been convicted of an offence under section 39 or 40 as a 
Citizenship Commissioner.” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems so logical that I wonder why it has to be there. 
However, with the cases we have seen in the past it is probably a 
good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 8, referring to clause 32, is again an amendment that 
would give some input to the Standing Committee on Citizenship 
and Immigration.  In a good democracy that is the way it should 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 15 to 20, referring to clause 43, would bring the 
work on regulations back to the committee and the House.  I 
agree, and that should be adopted also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 21 comes back to what all opposition parties have 
been saying probably forever, that the committees concerned 
should have a real and positive input, especially after all the 
time that is spent in committees reviewing, interviewing 
witnesses and doing their best to get the views of ordinary 
Canadians.  The committees have to be more involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be supporting all of the motions in Group No. 3. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to address the motions in Group No. 3, put forward by 
various parties seeking to amend Bill C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is worthwhile to start by pointing out what a great 
level of community interest there has been in Bill C-16 and the 
issue of citizenship.  When the bill was first introduced as Bill 
C-63, over 37 groups and organizations made representations 
before the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration.  I 
would say there was an overwhelming amount of public interest 
demonstrated by Canadians who feel very passionately about the 
whole concept of citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the reason these people were so motivated is because 
the whole idea of being a citizen of Canada hearkens to the idea 
of national pride, of being part of something great, like the 
country of Canada, where the sum of the parts is greater than the 
whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we saw was a great outpouring of emotion.  These people 
said to the committee, to the House of Commons, that when we 
amend the citizenship and immigration legislation we must ensure 
that the changes reflect accurately how much we value our 
citizenship, not just as a right, but also the duties, 
obligations and responsibilities that come with citizenship.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We found it necessary to move many amendments to Bill C-63, the 
predecessor to Bill C-16, and we were pleased when most of the 
recommendations, amendments and details that we found necessary 
to raise were incorporated into Bill C-16.  In fact, the NDP 
caucus is now satisfied that Bill C-16 accurately reflects what 
Canadians told us.  The changes we asked for were incorporated 
into the new bill, so we were quite pleased to see the new Bill 
C-16 in its current form.  It is something that we can support as 
it goes through the House.  In fact we hope for its speedy 
passage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note, though, that many of my colleagues in opposition parties 
and even some on the Liberal side are moving amendments.  Group 
No. 3 deals with six or seven different clusters of amendments. 
I will comment on some of them and point out whether our caucus 
will be able to support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 6 we would support.  It was put forward by the 
immigration critic for the Canadian Alliance and it simply seeks 
to have all appointments ratified by parliament.  Appointments of 
citizenship judges or any other type of appointment made by order 
in council should really come to parliament or at least to the 
standing committee where parliamentarians, elected officials, can 
approve and ratify those appointments.  It is something that most 
Canadians would support and our party recommends supporting the 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 7 seeks to amend the legislation so that a person 
cannot be a citizenship commissioner if that person has been 
convicted of the crime of defrauding immigration or smuggling or 
trafficking people, or any type of crime under the Citizenship 
Act.  This is only common sense.  I would like to think that the 
powers that be would have come to that conclusion already without 
having it stated in legislation.  I cannot imagine anyone 
appointing a citizenship commissioner who had been convicted of 
fraud under the Citizenship Act.  We support that amendment put 
forward by the Canadian Alliance as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 8 states that the standing committee must approve the 
appointment of citizenship commissioners.  Again we support this 
idea.  We believe that there is a role for the standing committee 
to ratify and approve appointments to ensure that these 
appointments are not some kind of political patronage and to 
ensure that the right people occupy these important positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 15 is clustered into this group as well.  We oppose 
this motion put forward by the Canadian Alliance.  We believe 
that either there was a typographical error or it simply makes no 
sense.  The words “alternative” and “affirmative” seem to be 
mixed up in the way it is written.  It is absolute gibberish and 
not worthy of anybody's support.  It was either an error or the 
drafters were deliberately putting it forward as some kind of 
nuisance motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 16, 17 and 18 are similar in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support Motion No. 20.  I would rather dwell on the motions 
that we see fit to support rather than oppose because I think 
that warrants more comment.  This motion, again put forward by 
the Canadian Alliance, would allow the governor in council to 
define public interest for the purposes of the act.  It would 
actually mandate the governor in council to define what is meant 
by public interest.  There is a whole section of articles 
regarding public interest in the act and we believe that it does 
need further clarification, for transparency if nothing else. It 
could be that lawyers can glean from the current act what the 
intent of the act is in terms of public interest, but we see no 
harm in further clarifying that definition so that the general 
public can also easily and readily see what is truly meant by 
that term.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that Motion No. 21 is also clustered into Group No. 3. We 
support this motion.  Some of the things raised by my colleague 
in the Canadian Alliance are legitimate points of view that would 
improve and enhance the act.  This particular motion seeks to 
make the standing committee responsible for the approving of any 
regulations that pertain to fixing fees for any services offered 
by the department, whether it is citizenship papers or whatever. 
We believe the standing committee should have a role in setting 
fees.  It is the opinion of our party that the fees are far to 
onerous currently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like the opportunity to bring forward at the committee 
level that the fees should be adjusted and adjusted down.  It is 
the same as the hated head tax.  We should abolish the head tax 
on all immigrants and refugees.  We note that the government has 
seen fit to listen to us and has recently abolished the head tax 
on refugees.  However it has not abolished the other service 
charges associated with being a refugee.  It has abolished the 
$975 head tax but it has not abolished the many other fees which 
add up to more than $500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that Motion No. 21, which would give the standing 
committee the opportunity to have some input into the fixing of 
any fee schedule, would be very appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to raise a point that I think has not been raised enough 
in the House of Commons.  The whole concept of citizenship is 
tied directly to the whole concept of the nation state obviously. 
We are proud to be Canadian citizens because of the borders that 
define our geographic country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole concept of the nation state, democracy and citizenship 
are intertwined in an inexorable way.  We believe that all three 
of those things are jeopardized by the globalization of capital 
and the demise of the nation state in that free trade agreements 
do not recognize borders.  Capital does not recognize borders. 
The free movement of goods, services and capital ignores borders 
and often ignores freely elected governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise, as a cautionary note, that as we give more and more 
international authority to the WTO, to the MAI, to NAFTA and to 
liberalized trade agreements, we diminish the authority that 
citizens enjoy in their democracy within their nation state. I 
think there is a growing awareness of this issue.  We saw the 
battle in Seattle recently where young people were raising this 
very point.  They were sounding the alarm that they would not 
tolerate this idea of diminishing democracy by diminishing the 
nation state and the citizen's role in controlling their own 
economic sovereignty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is unanimous consent, we could speed through this 
relatively quickly.  We would not have to do the standing and the 
yeaing and the naying.  We could just assume they are all 
deferred and divisions requested.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the member from Winnipeg for pointing 
out a typographical error in one of the motions in the last 
grouping.  The word “alternative” appears in the phrase 
“alternative resolution”.  It should read “affirmative 
resolution”.  In all the similar resolutions it was written as 
“affirmative”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way this was organized by the government, report stage was 
scheduled to come up next week.  We found out on Tuesday 
afternoon, a couple of hours before the deadline for submitting 
resolutions, that the government had bumped report stage up to 
Wednesday afternoon.  At the same time, the Minister for 
Citizenship and Immigration was in committee, where many of us 
expected we could speak to the report stage motions. Because of 
that rush, we did not see the error.  I thank the member for 
pointing it out.  I hope the error can be corrected as it would 
be consistent with the other motions presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with only two motions in Group No. 4, Motion No. 
9, presented by the Bloc critic, and Motion No. 23, presented by 
a Liberal member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc motion suggests that along with the citizenship 
certificate given out at the ceremony, there would be some 
information from the Government of Quebec given out as well.  It 
is really interesting that we have a party, which wants Quebec to 
separate from Canada and wants more authority given to the Quebec 
government, that is now asking the federal government to 
intervene and ensure that it can hand out this information with 
the certificates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province can decide in any way it wants and in any form it 
wants to hand out this information if it feels it is something 
its citizens need to have.  It really does not make any sense at 
all having that included in this bill.  I know I certainly will 
not be supporting this motion.  It really does not make any 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about in this bill is Canadian citizenship, 
something that most Canadians value very deeply. I would also 
suggest that it is something most Canadians from Quebec value at 
a very high level. 
When we have a citizenship ceremony, we should be accepting 
certificates that we can proudly display indicating that we are 
citizens of Canada.  I therefore cannot support the motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 23, which was presented by a Liberal MP, calls for a 
change to the proposed new citizenship oath.  I do not have any 
particular disagreement with the oath that is in the bill.  What 
is really wrong is the process.  How many Canadians were ever 
asked to take part in developing the oath?  The minister said 
that there were some.  I would like to ask Canadians if they were 
asked to take part.  I know I was not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe the oath is the real issue.  The member is 
proposing an alternative oath but I do not think it is any 
better.  In fact, it is less acceptable and does not fix the 
problem.  The government thinks it can present an oath that has 
had no support or input from Canadians. I think the member is 
taking the same position.  He, as a government member, seems to 
think he knows better than Canadians what should be in the oath. 
It really is the process that is at issue here.  I certainly will 
not be supporting this motion.  I do not think it improves the 
oath nor does it improve the process.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2.1) The Commissioner presiding over a citizenship ceremony 
shall, during the ceremony and in the presence of a 
representative of the Government of Quebec, give to every new 
citizen residing in Quebec a copy of the following documents and 
an explanation of their purpose: 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) the Charter of the French Language (R.S.Q., c. C-11); 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(ii) the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms (R.S.Q., c. C-12);

</I></B></P><P align=left>(iv) the Declaration by the Government of Quebec on Ethnic and 
Race Relations, signed on December 10, 1986. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we asking that new Canadian citizens be given these 
documents? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There exists naturally, and we would agree with this, a 
citizenship which, by definition, is a legal citizenship, one 
which is granted to members of a political community, with 
civic, political and social rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a citizenship that is part of a political 
community, with rights and obligations as well, which enables 
citizens to establish relations with one another. We all agree 
with this civic and legal definition of citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are proposing here is to extend this citizenship. We 
fundamentally believe that citizenship can and should be based 
on a collective identity that would not be built solely on 
rights and responsibilities but could also incorporate concepts 
such as the potential for citizens to exercise those rights and 
responsibilities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This might involve giving people, through all sorts of tools and 
documents that we have created, a chance to take part in Quebec 
social and collective life. We also believe that this 
citizenship should include the possibility for all citizens to 
become fully integrated into a community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are proposing is a new type of citizenship based on 
notions of inclusion, pluralism and openness, and of course on 
notions that would be unifying and open. 
What we are calling for is for citizenship not to exist only in 
legal terms, but to be more widely recognized and included in 
the bill, through this clause and this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the amendment we are proposing today should gain 
support from both those in favour of one big Canada and those 
fighting for a sovereign Quebec, which would control its own 
destiny. This amendment stems from a legacy, a consensus and a 
recognition of the fact that there is a common public culture 
particular to Quebec. This culture is the most important spur to 
action at our disposal to take up the challenge of the 
integration of new Quebecers. This common public culture defines 
the way and the method by which the citizens who chose to settle 
in Quebec can and must participate to the public life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I do not think I am mistaken when I say this culture 
is comprised of three major components, three major lines of 
force at the heart of Quebec society. What are they? First, it 
is a society where French is the common public language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a democratic society where participation and contribution 
of all people are expected and promoted. This democratic 
participation is recognized and guaranteed by the Loi sur les 
droits et libertés de la personne, which has the value of a 
charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a pluralistic society that, although having rejected 
multiculturalism, remains definitely open to numerous 
contributions from the outside, within limits imposed by the 
respect of democratic values and the need for intercommunity 
sharing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the name of this common public culture, which is exclusive to 
Quebec, and the development of French society, whose destiny is 
so special in America, we ask the federal government to agree to 
this amendment, which is not only moved by the Bloc Quebecois, 
but which also has been supported by a number of members of the 
Quebec community and society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment has already received, in the context of 
consideration of Bill C-63, the support of a number of 
stakeholders. I am talking, among others, of the Haitian 
Christian community of Quebec, which supported the Bloc 
amendment during consideration of Bill C-63. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this expresses the will of Quebecers to belong to a 
society that is open to the world, pluralistic and able to 
protect citizens' democratic freedoms and rights. 
Our belief in this fundamental values is what prompted us to 
create the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms.  It is 
precisely our fundamental belief in democracy which moved us to 
create the Quebec Election Act. It is our belief that pluralism 
is one of the fundamental values to integration which led the 
Government of Quebec to issue its declaration on interethnic 
relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are calling for today is for the fundamental values of 
Quebec society, which are characterized by and set out in 
certain very specific documents, to be handed out to new 
citizens.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In pledging allegiance to Canada, I take my place among 
Canadians, a people united in God— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind hon. members of the basic values and concepts to 
which I have already referred.  These are values of openness and 
pluralism.  Nothing must be done that would exclude a group of 
people who do not believe in God, who do not belong to that 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, this is fundamental. And the notions of 
inclusion, of pluralism must be included in this bill. I fear 
that Motion No. 23 would really exclude a number of citizens who 
do not have such belief in God. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party will vote against Motion No. 23. Needless to say, my 
colleagues will support Motion No. 9 proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding this motion, I thought it was important to recall the 
fundamental values enshrined in official instruments passed by 
Quebec's national assembly. This was done simply to inform new 
Canadian citizens of the democratic, pluralistic values specific 
to Quebec's society. These values were accepted unanimously by 
Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us inform new citizens of their democratic rights. Let us 
inform them of their rights and freedoms. 
Let us allow them to understand clearly that we belong to a 
French speaking society established in America. The French 
speaking community in Quebec accounts for 2% of the population 
of the North American continent. We have expressed our desire to 
develop and to prosper in French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's charter of rights and freedoms shows that. We want new 
Canadian citizens to know about it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am speaking to Motion No. 23 which would change the 
oath of citizenship as it is in the current bill to another 
version. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to correct the member for Lakeland.  The second version 
that I will read presently is very much a version that was 
created in this parliament in answer to the fact that after 
extensive consultation with Canadians the government failed to 
listen to what Canadians were saying about their oath of 
citizenship and continued with an oath that is essentially the 
very same British oath that has been with this country since the 
expulsion of the Acadians in the mid-1750s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read the oath that is in the bill now.  Then I will read 
the oath that I propose.  The oath that is in the bill now says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From this day forward, I pledge my loyalty and allegiance to 
Canada and Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada.  I 
promise to respect our country's rights and freedoms, to uphold 
our democratic values, to faithfully observe our laws and fulfil 
my duties and obligations as a Canadian citizen. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To repeat, this is a direct descendant of the British oath that 
began two centuries ago.  This is in its tone and content an oath 
that is not born in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all the consultation that occurred—I was on the 
citizenship committee in 1994-95—we received many, many 
Canadians and many, many ethnic groups that spoke about the 
current oath and made suggestions.  The citizenship committee 
cycled through this discussion yet again just a couple of years 
ago and the government did extensive studies.  All said that the 
oath containing the allegiance to the Queen was no longer 
something that resonated with current Canadians, much less with 
those new Canadians who come to our country and have to take this 
oath.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the citizenship bill was first presented to parliament last 
year as Bill C-63, and we saw this oath that I just read, a 
number of us on this side were scandalized.  We were absolutely 
scandalized.  Right here the member from Brampton West on this 
side and the member from Dufferin—Peel—Wellington, we put our 
heads together and we wrote a new version of the oath based on 
what we believe in our heart of hearts as parliamentarians is 
what Canada is all about and based also on what we heard people 
tell the citizenship committee over three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we came up with is an oath that has three components.  It 
eliminates reference to the Queen.  It restores reference to God 
and it attempts to summarize the principles that are contained in 
the charter of rights and freedoms which I believe are the 
principles that motivate Canadians and describe our unique 
identity.  The oath that we came up with, and I will read it now, 
is this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In pledging allegiance to Canada, I take my place among 
Canadians, a people united by God whose sacred trust is to uphold 
these five principles:  equality of opportunity, freedom of 
speech, democracy, basic human rights, and the rule of law. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I propose to deal with each of those three elements and first 
the Queen.  One of the themes that came out of the hearings on 
citizenship that was absolutely consistent was that people come 
from all over the world to Canada and when they come to swear an 
oath of citizenship to Canada they cannot understand the 
reference to the Queen.  In fact the government's own opinion 
polls find that most new Canadians coming to Canada cannot 
understand the reference to the Queen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Queen is a foreign monarch.  It is certainly true the 
monarchy has a role in Canadian society in terms of our legal 
entity and our functions as parliament and eliminating the 
reference to the Queen, as the Australians did in 1993, in no way 
affects our parliamentary traditions or the operation of this 
parliament or the governor general or anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is, as we heard in testimony, that many people come 
to Canada from other lands in which they associate the British 
monarchy with slavery.  Indeed I point out that the original oath 
of allegiance that was required of francophones, of French 
Canadians and of Acadians, was required in 1755 and when they 
failed to swear allegiance to the monarchy of the time the 
Acadians were expelled.  They were taken out of Nova Scotia and 
scattered down the coast of the United States. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think most Acadians would now refuse to take an oath 
containing a reference to the monarchy, because of this dark 
period in our history. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we doing having the Queen, the monarchy, in an oath 
that describes Canada when we are inviting these people to 
Canada?  I think what I am saying here is that the Queen no 
longer captures the spirit of what it is to be Canadian.  In fact 
in the context of an oath of citizenship I wonder whether the 
Queen ever did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is out of place to eliminate the Queen from 
the oath of citizenship.  I think when we do so we repatriate the 
oath of citizenship, because new people coming to this land 
realize that it is Canada that they are coming to, not Britain, 
not to some foreign monarch, not to the British monarchy.  They 
are coming to Canada.  That is the first point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is the oath I propose has the words that new 
Canadians come and take their places among Canadians, a people 
united by God.  I was very careful in using this reference to 
God. 
I point out first that all the other major oaths of citizenships, 
in the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain 
have a reference to God.  What happened in Canada was when we 
last went through the oath of citizenship we took the reference 
to God out.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In proposing to put the reference back in, all I am doing is 
reflecting the fact that we have the reference to God in the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  I am not suggesting 
that a new Canadian coming to Canada should feel that in taking 
this oath that the person is indicating he or she believes in God 
or the person is assigning an association with one religion or 
another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality about the Canadian history, our life, is that every 
kind of Canadian has had an association with God. Whether we are 
a Christian, or a Muslim, or an aboriginal, actually 80% of 
Canadians believe that there is some sort of higher authority. 
We as Canadians owe our good fortune of having one of the most 
wonderful countries in the world to something more than just 
NASDAQ, the stock exchange or our mining riches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are more than meat and potatoes.  This land is more 
than fire and water.  This land is something that is above our 
human intellect.  Generally speaking, Canadians as a society have 
held that belief.  What we do here is say that a new Canadian who 
comes to this land is going to be a part of this tradition of a 
faith in God.  This is not an ideology.  It is still open to 
opportunity.  The person does not have to believe in God because 
this is a land where we accept people of all points of view. 
That is one of the reasons why we can have a room of such 
tolerance here.  We can have separatists and people of different 
ideologies.  That is the genius of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there are the five principles of equality of 
opportunity, freedom of speech, democracy, basic human rights and 
the rule of law.  These derive directly from our charter of 
rights and liberties.  This is what we are as Canadians.  This is 
the spirit of being Canadian.  This is what defines our 
tolerance.  It is not just being equal, it is having equality of 
opportuntiy.  That is why we believe in medicare and why we 
believe in universal education.  Freedom of speech, democracy and 
all these things are essential to the Canadian spirit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to you, Mr. Speaker, these are what define Canadians; 
these are the principles that define Canadian.  I urge all party 
leaders to allow a free vote on this issue.  I heard the member 
for Rosemont and respect his point of view.  But for heaven's 
sake, this opportunity to repatriate the constitution, to 
repatriate the oath of citizenship and to bring it back to Canada 
should surely be a free vote allowed by all party leaders.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to Group No. 4 of amendments to 
Bill C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will first talk about Motion No. 9 by the member for Rosemont. 
He will perhaps find this a bit surprising, but I agree with 
much of what he is proposing, although I think that the 
citizenship ceremony is perhaps not the right time for these 
documents to be given out.  This should be done long before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his motion, the members asks to have new citizens given: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i)  the Charter of the French Language; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(ii)  the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(iii) the Election Act; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(iv)  the Declaration by the Government of Quebec on Ethnic and 
Race Relations... 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are documents it would be appropriate to give to people 
coming to Quebec.  I would go even further and say that this 
would be useful for any province.  However, we are talking about 
Quebec here.  I think that people arriving in Quebec as 
immigrants should get all these documents.  I think they already 
do, but they should at least be aware of them and their content.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the time they applied for citizenship, seven years have 
passed, on average.  This is why I think it is a bit late for 
them to be getting these documents at that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a party, we must unfortunately vote against this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Rosemont also talks of having a representative of 
the Province of Quebec at the swearing in ceremony, but his 
presence must not be vital to the holding of the ceremony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that a number of MPs do not attend swearing in 
ceremonies. 
I think that it should be important, even a duty.  I attend 
these ceremonies myself at least once a year, and I then send 
letters of congratulations to all new citizens in my riding. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about Motion No. 23 presented by the hon. 
member for Wentworth—Burlington. I definitely have a problem 
with this motion.  I cannot support it and our party will not 
support it.  It is certainly not because I am or am not a 
monarchist, which is what I will touch on first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were going to get into changing anything as significant as 
this, we would have to change our constitution first.  The Queen 
is still in the constitution and until we make a major change in 
it we cannot remove that from the oath. The member talked about 
different oppressed countries where royalty is feared but it goes 
a lot further than royalty.  It can also extend to politicians 
and people's fear of them.  We have to be careful about how far 
we go on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He referred to a people united by God.  I have no problem saying 
that I am a Christian and I strongly believe in God.  But in this 
day and age, with all the different religions in Canada, I feel 
we are putting them totally aside by adding that type of phrase 
to the oath.  Because of that, there is no way I can support 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other points the member made about the oath are very 
interesting. I think they are nice, but we have to stick with 
certain parts of this right now that are already there and a part 
of a constitution.  Therefore, we will be voting against this 
motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to speak against both of the proposed amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Motion No. 9 concerns the guidelines for ceremonies 
celebrating passing the citizenship test.  We have to remember 
that is what these ceremonies are for, a celebration. The testing 
has been completed.  Participants at those ceremonies are there 
to be celebrated and not to be politicized.  They have passed a 
test.  They are there with their families.  I have attended many 
of these ceremonies.  They are very joyous occasions particularly 
for people who have come from countries where there has been 
heavy persecution and they have had a very difficult time getting 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The materials for distribution go through the local offices and 
they are very flexible.  No one says that the Government of 
Quebec cannot, particularly on application for the citizenship 
test, be aware of this and make sure that the materials are 
distributed.  We do not have any objections to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing I would point out is that residents have to live 
in Quebec for three years before they are able to go through a 
ceremony.  Therefore, there are three full years to make sure 
that they understand how valuable the French language is and how 
valuable the culture of Quebec is, and I do not disagree with 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot force the Quebec government, the Ontario government or 
the Manitoba government through federal citizenship laws to make 
sure they have an official at a ceremony that is strictly 
federal. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT20"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT20"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1140

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think a ceremony of celebration is the place to bring 
in political debate.  I do not think it is the place to try to 
force other levels of government to attend.  We have a hard time 
in many cases getting MPs to attend some of these ceremonies so 
we are not in a position to order other governments around and I 
do not believe the member opposite would want that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as Motion No. 23 is concerned, I am sorry the member for 
Wentworth—Burlington left because the third part of it is a very 
interesting proposal.  His amendment is much like a smorgasbord; 
he has too much in there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member opposite that this is not the place or 
the time to debate the relevance of the monarchy.  Many of the 
people who come to this country come from Commonwealth countries 
and would not be the least bit surprised to pledge allegiance to 
the Queen.  She is still a very significant part of our Canadian 
psyche. Regardless, as I said, this is not the appropriate place 
to get into a debate on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning the relevance of God, I also agree with the member 
from the Tory party who suggested that people have a vastly 
different image of God.  There are many titles for a superior 
being and 20% or 30% of people who come from other countries 
actually do not believe in God.  The concept that an oath can be 
sworn to an individual's own God within his or her own heart is 
very much a part of the ceremony.  It is nothing to be excluded. 
Both of these amendments will not be supported by the government 
for very good reason. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to take part in the debate on Bill C-16, the Citizenship 
of Canada Act, previously known as Bill C-63. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take this opportunity to thank our young and dynamic 
colleague for Outremont. Besides taking an interest in the issue 
of violence on television and introducing an excellent bill—one I 
am sure you will insist on supporting, Mr. Speaker, since you 
have always been against violence—he is our critic for 
citizenship and immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it was very wise on his part to follow in the steps of 
his predecessor and to revive an amendment which reminds us of 
the importance of citizenship. Citizenship is important to a 
society. It is, first, the conviction that we live together, 
that our way of living together forms a common public culture. 
In such a common public culture, there is a number of elements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will understand that knowledge of history is important. 
Otherwise, not only would nobody be able to understand Quebec 
but nobody would understand why Quebecers aspire to a national 
destiny. If you would be so good as to nod, Mr. Speaker, this 
would greatly encourage me to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about Quebec's national destiny, we are referring 
to an unfulfilled, uninterrupted quest that will inevitably lead 
it, in the coming years, to achieve sovereignty and, of course, 
to create a country. The Premier of Quebec reminded us of that 
when he said that this whole process was now back on the 
political agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our common public culture is our history. It is also our 
language. No one can ignore that by choosing to live in Quebec, 
they are also choosing to speak a vernacular language, a 
language that is not the language spoken by North America's 
majority, but by a minority, the French minority. There can be 
no common public culture without participation through a common 
language. I will get back to this issue, which is rather central 
to today's proposal before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to Quebec citizenship, another component of a 
common public culture that is just as essential as the language 
is a commitment to democracy. I hope Canadian Alliance members, 
government members and Progressive Conservative members—who 
will hold their convention this weekend—are well aware that 
there is a deep, fundamental attachment to democracy in Quebec. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1145"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that all citizens will participate in our institutions 
and we say that democracy is a very real and dynamic component 
of the concept of citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is that citizenship exercised? If I asked that question to 
hon. members, they would tell me that citizenship is exercised 
through the right to vote, through the choice that we make to 
have elected representatives speak on our behalf on major public 
issues and voice our concerns in the various assemblies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the National Assembly is among the most important 
assemblies in North America. 
My colleague, the member for Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, knows 
about this issue better than I do, because he is a member of the 
world interparliamentary association.  I think I can say that 
the National Assembly is among the oldest parliaments of North 
America.  Parliamentarism was born with the Constitutional Act, 
1791.  Back then, there were few parliaments in North America. 
Therefore, Quebec can pride itself upon a long and deep rooted 
tradition of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another element of our public culture is intercommunity 
relationships. We do not see Quebec as an homogenous mass where 
there is no place for input from other communities. Quebec is a 
land of immigration for various reasons. 
Of course, there is the inherent attraction of Quebec because it 
is at the crossroads of several major cultures, including the 
United States and France.  Our francophile and francophone roots 
are of course very much present in our heritage and our society, 
because we still speak French, but also because this language is 
the expression of our culture.  Quebec is a point of contact 
with North American society.  It is no small matter to be the 
neighbour of the first economic power of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember what Kennedy said.  Mr. Speaker, I am sure that 
when you were a child, a long time ago, you were an admirer of 
John Fitzgerald Kennedy. 
What did he say? Here is what he said about the relations 
between Canada and U.S. “Geography made us neighbours, and 
history made us friends”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an elegant way of saying that we did not choose to be 
the neighbours of the most powerful nation in the world. This 
has its advantages and its disadvantages. This was a 
disadvantage as far as foreign investment is concerned, but it 
was also an advantage in terms of sharing a common market that 
has a potential to be expanded, a potential that has always been 
recognized by sovereignists. This is why, early in the process, 
sovereignists supported the previous government in the free 
trade initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I want to discuss our perception of 
citizenship in terms of the contribution of various cultural 
communities. 
For instance, a member representing a Montreal riding—I am a 
member from Montreal as are my colleague, the hon. member for 
Rosemont, and those from greater Montreal, though I will leave 
it to Mrs. Harel to define its boundaries—cannot do his or her 
work without acknowledging the presence of cultural communities 
that are very dynamic in everyday life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in the northern part of my riding, there is a 
Haitian community. I think there is a large Ukrainian community 
in the riding of Rosemont. In the eastern part of my riding, in 
Bourget, there is also a small Portuguese community. What does 
this mean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to make a fundamental distinction here. We are 
sovereignists who believe in the existence of a political 
citizenship in Quebec that has to be recognized. I will get back 
to this later. However, we also believe that Quebec society 
should benefit from the contribution of various communities. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike multiculturalism, we do not define society as the 
co-existence of several cultures without a common thread. We 
believe that, for instance, Haitians who immigrate to Quebec, 
Portuguese who settle in Montreal or Ukrainians who live in 
Rosemont may have strong feelings about their culture, but we 
nevertheless expect them to adhere to a public common culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best proof of adhesion to this public culture is, of course, 
making the effort to master the language sufficiently to be able 
to communicate in daily life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Multiculturalism allows for the co-existence of several cultures 
and for everyone to continue to master their own culture while 
considering themselves Canadians. We do not share this vision. 
It is not the vision of the Government of Quebec and, of course, 
we do not believe it is not the vision that is most promising 
for Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal of our colleague from Rosemont is extremely 
reasonable and I cannot imagine that anyone would oppose it. The 
amendment proposes that, during swearing in ceremonies, the four 
main symbolic documents underlying the common public culture of 
Quebec, namely the Charter of the French Language of Quebec, the 
Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, the Elections Act and the 
Declaration by the Government of Quebec on Ethnic and Race 
Relations, be distributed. An official of the Government of 
Quebec would be there to explain their importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, Quebec is an land of immigration. Montreal, Toronto and 
Vancouver are three major centres of immigration. This means 
there are three provinces where there is a major centre of 
immigration. Quebec is one of them. We hope that immigrants will 
come to Quebec in large numbers and will take an active part in 
this common public culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to order made on Wednesday, May 10, the motions in 
Group No. 5 have been previously moved, seconded and are now 
before the House.  Motions Nos. 10 to 14 are now available for 
debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to these motions, all of which 
have been presented by the Canadian Alliance party.  They deal 
with the issue of appropriate punishment for dealing with crimes 
committed under the citizenship act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My general feeling is that the penalties are extremely weak, 
particularly in a situation where a citizenship official breaks 
the law, takes bribes and so on under the citizenship act.  I 
will speak a bit more about that later but that is the general 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration says often that 
citizenship is something to be valued, but she does not have 
penalties which reflect this when it comes to people who 
fraudulently trade in citizenship and that type of thing.  That 
is regrettable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chair of the committee and other government members told me 
to bring my amendments to the bill forward at committee rather 
than at report stage.  I did that with this group of motions. 
They did even not listen.  They shot them down automatically.  So 
much for committee functioning.  I brought them back at report 
stage to show the Canadian public what was rejected by the 
Liberal members at committee. 
It is important that they know.  It demonstrates to the Canadian 
public just how the government views breaches which allow people 
to become Canadian citizens through fraud and how weak the 
punishment is that it puts in place in that regard.  That is what 
this whole group of motions is about, but they are dealing with 
slightly different things. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT23"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT23"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1155

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Motions Nos. 10 and 11 deal with clause 39 which deals 
with various offences regarding the obtaining of citizenship. 
They include making false representation, committing fraud or 
knowingly concealing material circumstances.  They include 
obtaining or using another person's certificate.  They include 
knowingly permitting one's certificate to be used by someone else 
so the person will be identified as a Canadian citizen.  We can 
all understand the kinds of problems that would cause.  They 
include offences of trafficking and offering to traffic in 
citizenship documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are extremely serious offences.  Yet what types of 
punishment has the government put forth in its legislation to 
deal with these offences?  It has put in place fines of not more 
than $10,000 and/or five years in jail.  Hon. members will know 
that the maximum penalty is five years in jail.  We can certainly 
see with sentences handed out under the immigration act and under 
the citizenship act that the penalty which is usually imposed by 
the courts is very weak and often includes no prison time and a 
very minor fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important to increase the penalties which could 
be imposed to demonstrate clearly that it is a serious offence 
when one traffics in documents, falsifies documents or gets into 
the country fraudulently in some way and is recognized as a 
citizen of Canada fraudulently.  Yet the government does not take 
it seriously enough to put in place appropriate punishments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One area in particular that I find really offensive is the area 
of citizenship officials, people who are put into a position of 
trust in the citizenship department and break citizenship laws by 
doing things like issuing false documents or false statements 
that apply to citizenship issues, or commit offences like 
accepting bribes or encouraging someone else to accept a bribe so 
that citizenship can be obtained falsely and fraudulently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Offences such as contravening various provisions of the act by 
dealing with people who try to bribe citizenship officials and 
those who impersonate citizenship officials are dealt with in 
Motions Nos. 13 and 14.  I find it surprising that under the 
bill, the way the government has presented it, that it would 
impose exactly the same penalty, no more, for departmental 
officials in that position of trust who break the law as it does 
for anyone else who is not in a position of trust and is breaking 
the law.  I cannot understand the reasoning of a government that 
thinks like that.  It is completely beyond me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to deter people who are in a position which lends 
itself to making a lot of money accepting bribes and handing out 
citizenship falsely and fraudulently, we have to put in place 
very serious penalties.  They certainly should be more serious 
than the penalties given to anyone else for the same type of 
activity.  Yet that is not what has happened.  I believe what is 
proposed in here is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think of this in terms of the way the real world is 
operating right now and in terms of people wanting to enter 
Canada illegally.  If people wanting to enter our country 
illegally pay to obtain the services of a people smuggler or a 
people trafficker, they will have to pay between $20,000 and 
$70,000 to do that.  It is a lot of money.  That is the going 
rate for people, depending from which country they are coming, to 
come into our country illegally with the help of people smugglers 
or people traffickers. 
Yet because of the way the government has dealt with that in this 
law, for a few thousand dollars a person can bribe an official, 
get a false citizenship document and not only be allowed to come 
into the country, but become a citizen of the country in the eyes 
of the officials, if it is done properly, because the person will 
have the appropriate citizenship documents to be recognized as a 
citizen. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any government department, in any business, there will be 
those people who, for some reason or another, are willing to 
break the law to make money.  There are usually not very many.  I 
would suggest that in the citizenship and immigration departments 
there would be very few people who would be willing to do that, 
but they are there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If given the opportunity, and if the penalties are weak, then 
the temptation increases.  For people so inclined, I believe that 
a weak penalty would encourage them to become involved in this 
illicit activity whereby people would become recognized as 
Canadian citizens by obtaining false documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason my motion calls for increasing the fines.  The 
government is proposing a maximum fine of $10,000 and/or not more 
than five years in jail.  What a joke that is.  A person could 
make $10,000 in a good day's work of issuing a couple of false 
documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know how these things work in the immigration department, and 
I assume it would be the same in the citizenship department. 
When cases like this come up they are swept under the rug.  The 
person may or may not be dismissed. Seldom will people ever 
actually end up in court, but when they do the courts view these 
things lightly.  They look at a five year maximum jail sentence 
and they do not think it really means that.  The courts seem to 
think that means maybe a suspended sentence or some type of 
probation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important, because of all these factors, that the 
maximum penalty be increased substantially.  We are proposing 
that when it comes to citizenship officials there should be a 
maximum fine of $150,000, which is a real threat, a maximum jail 
sentence of 10 years and/or both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think a higher maximum penalty would cause officials working 
in the department to think twice.  Of course, that in itself 
would not solve the problem.  I recognize that, but we have to 
have a department which is administered and managed properly. 
That is up to the minister to ensure.  The minister has failed 
miserably, as did the previous minister, as did the one before. 
The three Liberal ministers of immigration have failed miserably 
in terms of improving management and administration in the 
departments.  It is not me saying that; it is the auditor 
general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general issued, just a couple of weeks ago, the most 
damning report he has ever issued, to the immigration department. 
He said that management was absolutely in shambles, that 
administration was not working and that enforcement was weak. 
Many people have said it is the most damning report the auditor 
general has ever issued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Putting these more serious penalties in place may cause people 
to think twice about committing the very serious offence of 
allowing people to become Canadian citizens when the law would 
not allow it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is shameful that the government is so weak in terms of 
protecting the security of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do organized crime figures get into this country?  They are 
the first ones who would be willing to bribe officials.  They 
have done it and they will do it again.  They are the first ones 
who would use people smugglers to get into the country.  The top 
individuals of course have other ways to get in, but certainly 
they would not hesitate to bribe officials.  It happens all the 
time. It is a sad commentary on the government that it takes this 
issue so lightly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through these weak penalties that the government has put in the 
bill, it is accommodating organized crime and terrorists, and in 
a way encouraging them to bribe officials to become citizens of 
our country completely fraudulently.

oath, and although I did speak out against his oath, there is one 
aspect of the oath that I really did appreciate, and that is 
including the reference to God in the oath.  God of course is the 
term that many religions, in fact I would suggest all religions, 
could consider to be pretty much a generic term.  Recognizing 
that supreme being is extremely important.  I think that should 
be in the oath.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CRIMINAL CODE 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK52">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from December 3, 1999 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-18, an act to amend the criminal code 
(impaired driving causing death and other matters), be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it has been a long and 
arduous road to reach this stage of Bill C-18.  This provision 
was part of a private member's bill that I submitted a couple of 
years ago.  However, the bill was lost due to the 1997 election. 
The official opposition brought the bill back to the Parliament 
of Canada in the form of a votable supply day motion, which 
motion was carried unanimously in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then had a delay getting the original bill to committee.  We 
finally dealt with it last year, just prior to the summer recess 
of 1999.  Indeed, we were able to put through this House about 
98% of the original supply day motion dealing with impaired 
driving.  I believe at that time we made a giant leap forward in 
taking leadership in addressing the issue of impaired driving in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were seeking unanimous consent so that we would not lose the 
previous bill to the summer recess and more delays.  We were able 
to put it through, for the most part.  However, members of the 
Bloc were not prepared to accept the provision in the original 
bill which provided judges with the discretionary power to 
deliver a sentence of life imprisonment for someone convicted of 
impaired driving causing death where aggravating factors were 
present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is designed to address simply that, impaired drivers 
who have multiple convictions, who have refused treatment, who 
have spent time in prison, who have perhaps driven while their 
drivers' licences were under suspension, who perhaps have been in 
an accident causing bodily injury, leading up to the point where 
they were once again impaired on the road.  With all of these 
aggravating factors behind them, perhaps they then took the life 
of someone through their criminal act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the tool that we have sought for three or four years to 
send a clear message to society that the federal government does 
not regard the incidence of impaired driving as simply another 
social ill.  Rather, it is regarded as a very serious crime, and 
the crime of impaired driving causing death is the most serious 
crime of all.  We read in our newspapers, we see on our 
televisions and through the electronic media every day it seems 
that some innocent life or lives have been taken because of the 
stupid and criminal act of driving while impaired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To review, Bill C-18 would amend the criminal code with respect 
to impaired driving causing death and other matters.  The bill 
would make impaired driving causing death subject to a maximum 
sentence of life imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time the latitude a judge has is a sentence of 
imprisonment of zero to 14 years.  Unfortunately the precedents 
that have been set by judges in this country in dealing with 
impaired driving causing death have most often been at the very 
low end of that scale, anywhere from six months to two and a half 
or three years. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one case on record where an impaired driver got eight 
years.  Unfortunately that precedent has not been followed as 
often as it should have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would increase the latitude of judges from zero to a life 
imprisonment sentence.  When there were some extreme aggravating 
factors, a judge could say to the person upon whom he was to 
deliver a sentence, “You are a menace to society.  You have 
taken a life through your criminal act. You have taken a life 
through your stupidity.  You have taken a life because you have 
refused treatment.  You have taken a life because you have not 
learned through the consequences of your previous actions that it 
is not acceptable in our society to behave in the manner that you 
you have been.  Therefore, I will give you a sentence of life 
imprisonment”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to relate some numbers in case anyone may have forgotten 
the human cost of impaired driving in our country.  In 1996 3,420 
people were killed in automobile crashes.  Where the drivers were 
tested, nearly 40% had alcohol in their blood for an estimation 
of about 1,360 fatalities.  That means that Canadians are more 
than twice as likely to die in an accident involving alcohol than 
they are to be murdered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The monetary cost for motor vehicle incidents is $390,000 per 
fatal crash and about $12,000 per injury. Considering the 
incredibly dire straits of our health care system, would it not 
be something if we could put forward yet another deterrent 
against impaired driving that would save lives and prevent the 
injuries caused by impaired driving.  It would also save a lot of 
money that could be put into health care services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read another statistic.  It is important that we have 
these numbers to recognize the frequency of impaired driving.  In 
1998 over 70,000 Canadians were charged with impaired driving. 
Statistics also show that it takes a repetition of about 20 
incidents of impaired driving before there may be a chance of 
getting caught.  These numbers really do not tell us how many 
people are actually driving while impaired.  The numbers are only 
the people who got caught.  It is pretty scary when driving down 
the street with our families to imagine there could be in any 
given block at least one and maybe two people who are driving 
having consumed alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The alliance party strongly supports this bill.  We believe that 
if ever there was a solid case for deterrence in the criminal 
code, it is on the issue of impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The penalties that we have been able to put forward in the 
criminal code and the amendments we have made coupled with this 
final part of this bill which was put forward and part of it 
passed, would be a wonderful first step.  It would send the 
strongest possible message out to Canadians that if they intend 
to drive after they have been drinking and they are caught, we 
intend to deal with that crime in the strongest possible terms. 
This will give the judges yet another very heavy tool in the 
fight against impaired driving.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-82 was the original bill on which we made some serious 
progress.  I want to go over some of the provisions.  It is 
important that Canadians know there have been some changes made. 
The federal government through the insistence of the alliance 
party has worked very well to ensure that parts of Bill C-82 went 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the federal criminal code level, the mandatory minimum fine 
for a first offence was been doubled from $300 to $600.  Driving 
prohibitions for a second offence have been increased from two to 
five years imprisonment and from six months to three years for a 
third offence.  For impaired driving causing death, the sentence 
has been changed in Bill C-18 from one year to three years, to 
three years to life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One part of the bill said that the judge may impose a sentence 
of from three years up to life driving prohibition for an offence 
where there was no injury or fatality involved.  We should be 
prepared to look at this and say that is a serious penalty the 
judges have been given to use.  In the event where there has been 
a death as a result of impaired driving by a person who has 
simply disregarded the laws of our society, the judge should have 
the discretion to impose a sentence of life imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-82 we also passed a provision for the use of an 
alcohol ignition interlock system.  The Canadian public is 
becoming more aware of this device.  It provides that someone may 
not operate a motor vehicle without giving a breath sample into 
the device.  If alcohol is present in the person's breath sample, 
the vehicle will not start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-82 the penalty for leaving the scene of an accident 
that caused bodily harm was also increased.  The maximum was 
increased to 10 years from the previous five years.  We in the 
alliance party were happy about that.  We also increased the time 
limit for law enforcement officers to demand a breath sample. 
That was increased from two hours to three hours.  Many times 
because of the shortage of officers and the logistics, it has not 
been possible within the two hour limit to get a breath sample. 
There is now another hour to work with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something I am very happy about is the penalty for driving while 
disqualified was increased from two years to five years.  For so 
many years all over the country people have lost their licences 
due to impaired driving.  For whatever reason so many of these 
people have disregarded the fact that they have been prohibited 
from driving and have chosen to drive anyway.  Instead of a two 
year sentence, which seems a long time to me but maybe to some 
people they do not think it is too long, it was increased to five 
years.  That was an important change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of changes that we wanted did not make it to Bill C-82. 
I will go through some of them before I wrap up by addressing the 
urgency of Bill C-18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-82 was a good first step to take.  It sent a stronger 
message to impaired drivers.  While we would have wanted to go 
further in many cases, I think we are going to see some results 
of the amendments to the criminal code. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before Bill C-82 got to committee it had been 13 years since the 
federal government had reviewed the criminal code as it applied 
to impaired driving.  Given the human cost and the monetary cost 
that impaired driving causes year after year, it was very much 
overdue but finally it got there after 13 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have wanted to increase at the federal level the 
mandatory minimum fine for an impaired driving first offence to 
$1,000 up from $300.  We did not quite make it.  We made $600 but 
we would have liked to have seen it at $1,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing we wanted to pursue was to change the criminal 
code so that only evidence that the breathalyzer was 
malfunctioning would be permitted as a defence against a charge 
for a reading of over .08.  This would be to eliminate the 
so-called two beers defence.  Too often in the courts judges 
accept this defence, notwithstanding that the crown has put 
forward certificate evidence of the breathalyzer results, 
notwithstanding the report of the arresting officer who clearly 
gave testimony that the person arrested seemed to be incapable of 
performing some simple required tests, notwithstanding evidence 
which the average person would think was enough to convict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Defence lawyers have been putting forward witnesses for their 
clients who have said that they were with old George or Jane the 
whole evening and all he or she had was two beers.  In the face 
of certificate evidence which showed a 0.15 breathalyzer test, 
judges have been saying “Two beers, are you sure?” “Yes your 
honour, two beers”.  Believe it or not, in far more cases than 
we can possibly imagine, judges have been accepting the two beers 
defence.  This is absolutely irresponsible on the part of many 
judges. They simply have not gotten the message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had hoped we would also get the BAC, the blood alcohol 
content limit lowered from .08 to .05.  The reason is that while 
evidence shows clearly that at .08 the person was indeed 
impaired, there is a built-in margin of error used by defence 
that has been set by precedence over the years. Judges have 
accepted a margin of error to the effect that no one, unless he 
or she blows .1 or more, ever much ends up with a criminal 
conviction.  Had we lowered the BAC to .05 and left a margin of 
error that would have taken it up to .08, that would have looked 
after the problem.  Unfortunately far too many lawyers were 
present at the standing committee when we examined this.  They 
rolled their eyes and said that this could be a legal nightmare 
so we did not proceed in that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 is a major step for the Parliament of Canada.  It 
gives notice to Canadians, victims of impaired driving and their 
families who are left to mourn the loss of their children or 
other loved ones that this parliament has taken some leadership.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The motion is in 
order.  The routine is that we would go right back to debate and 
that there be no amendment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to take part in the debate on Bill C-18, concerning 
impaired driving causing death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate my 
colleague from Berthier—Montcalm for his work as justice critic 
for the Bloc. He works tirelessly on this issue, and I thank him 
very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to state clearly that the Bloc is against Bill C-18. 
I want our position to be very clear. I would like the House to 
know, from the outset, that the Bloc does not in any way condone 
driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or any 
other substance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can already imagine the big guns from the right, not to say 
big guns at my right, that is to say some members of the 
Canadian Alliance, getting themselves in a state and crying 
“This does not make sense. The Bloc should not be against this 
bill. Drunk driving is a scourge in society. There are 
organizations like MADD”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members receive many documents from MADD, Mothers Against 
Drunk Driving. 
A women who lost her son and her husband in road accidents 
caused by drunk drivers founded the association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to stress that the Bloc does not encourage drunk driving. 
However, we think that the proposed sentence for impaired 
driving causing death is unrealistic and unenforceable. It is 
one thing to have a sentence in the Criminal Code, but if it 
does not mean anything, if judges find it is unenforceable, why 
bother amending the code?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may be surprised to see a transport critic speak to this 
issue, but there is a connection between driving and road 
transportation, by car or truck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also specify that my training and my experience as a 
lawyer before I got involved in politics made me realize that it 
is important that lawmakers make changes to the Criminal Code or 
any other law that are enforceable. This holds true for Bill 
C-18. What the government proposes is impossible to enforce and 
is also incompatible with other types of sentences provided for 
in the Criminal Code, and I will come back to this later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois believes that impaired driving causing death 
is a very serious offence. Nevertheless, if we were to pass Bill 
C-18, we would be denying the specific nature of this offence and 
creating a profound imbalance in our penal system. We will prove 
this later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics show that the courts still have lots of room to 
manoeuvre with the provisions of the Criminal Code. The longest 
sentence imposed by courts for impaired driving causing death 
is, currently, 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts, which are in the best position to analyze the 
characteristics of every delinquent, have not exhausted the 
resources of the Criminal Code, which sets at 14 years the 
maximum sentence for impaired driving causing death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The percentage of people sentenced to jail upon conviction, by 
the courts, for impaired driving decreased from 22% to 19% 
between 1994-95 and 1997-98. The terms of imprisonment imposed in 
the majority of these cases were less than two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a provision in the law providing for a much higher 
maximum penalty, but in all logic and in all justice most of our 
magistrates and our courts impose penalties of less than two 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget the deterrent effect of the penalty. Let us 
not forget society's repulsion for offences it punishes. That is 
why people who do wrong must be punished by having the courts 
impose penalties on them. That is why we have a penal code, the 
Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking into account what I was saying earlier, namely that most 
judges impose sentences of less than two years of imprisonment, 
why should we, as parliamentarians, legislate to allow life 
imprisonment when the courts are not inclined to fully use the 
tools currently at their disposal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although impaired driving causing death is a very serious 
offence, it is wrong to suggest that we are now faced with a 
criminal outburst in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 in Canada, 103 people were charged with impaired driving 
causing death, which is the fewest since 1989. I understand that 
103 convicted offenders is still too many and that we should aim 
for zero. But do 103 convicted offenders really represent a 
problematic situation in Canada, although it is still too many? 
There had not been this few since 1989.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past few decades, many groups and federally appointed 
committees and commissions given the responsibility of studying 
various aspects of the criminal justice system have argued that 
imprisonment should be used only as a last resort and should be 
limited to the most serious offenders. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These words are important because they set the tone for the next 
part of my speech, where I will compare this type of offence to 
other types of offences. 
If we consider it a serious offence, then we must look at the 
way the Criminal Code deals with other serious offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Sentencing Commission goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in spite of the number of times this recommendation was 
made, very few steps have been made in this direction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying earlier, by proposing life imprisonment for 
those who are convicted of impaired driving causing death, the 
Minister of Justice is ignoring the comments of her own supreme 
court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only solution is prevention. Incarceration should be a last 
resort. 
However, the Minister of Justice has not shown that she has used 
up all the tools at her disposal to fight impaired driving and 
to protect the public. She has opted for the easy way out by 
increasing prison sentences. She has opted for the line of least 
resistance suggested by the Canadian Alliance, when she could 
have acted otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are effective ways other than imprisonment to lower the 
number of offences related to impaired driving. For instance, 
there is the ignition interlock device, greater use of which we 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alberta and Quebec are currently the only provinces to impose 
the use of an interlock device as a condition for a restricted 
licence for drivers who have had their licence suspended by the 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An ignition interlock device—we remind our listeners—is a 
device that determines the blood alcohol level by a simple 
breath sample from the driver. This system prevents the vehicle 
from starting if the alcohol level exceeds a certain level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, only people accused of a first impaired driving 
offence can have the period during which their licence is 
suspended shortened by court order if an ignition interlock 
system is installed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois believes that the 
Criminal Code should be amended to make it mandatory to install 
an ignition interlock system on all repeat offenders' vehicles. 
The hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm, the Bloc critic for 
justice, will soon introduce a bill to this effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of program would be much more effective than 
imprisonment. 
Not only does this system prevent the offender from committing 
an offence, but it also allows for consciousness-raising 
activities. Imposing life imprisonment for impaired driving 
could generate nonsensical situations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, an impaired driver, who is undoubtedly negligent— 
we agree on this—could be sentenced more severely  than a hired 
killer who, having skilfully planned a murder, would be given a 
reduced sentence by becoming an informer.

Eve be treated the same way as a member of organized crime? 
Granted, both individuals have acted wrongfully but it must be 
recognized that they have very different profiles, a reality 
which is denied by Bill C-18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, one must take into consideration certain types of 
sentences related to other offences with characteristics similar 
to those of impaired driving causing death. In the case of 
dangerous driving causing death, a prison sentence of 14 years 
is prescribed by section 249(4) of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other types of offences could be mentioned. 
For instance, an individual who commits attempted murder is 
liable to a 14 year sentence; the offence of accessory after the 
fact may result in a maximum sentence of 14 years; participation 
in a criminal organization—involving hardened criminals—may result 
in a 14 year sentence; a person committing aggravated assault is 
also liable to a 14 year sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government knows only one way to do things about 
criminal justice, and that is to overdo things. Whether it is 
about young offenders or impaired driving, the Minister of 
Justice has once more shown her incapacity to deal with complex 
problems without using dangerously repressive measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach is totally unjustified, since criminality has been 
on the decline in Canada over the last few years. Furthermore,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am not sure if it is a pleasure to rise on this issue, but it 
is certainly one we should all be involved in.  I feel it is 
important for our party and all members to take interest in this 
issue.  It is a very serious issue that involves fatalities and 
injuries to human beings and accidents that just should not 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certainly pleased to rise on Bill C-18 and to speak 
strongly in support of all its aspects.  Bill C-18 amends the 
criminal code by increasing the maximum penalty for impaired 
driving causing death to life imprisonment.  It also provides for 
the taking of blood samples for the purpose of testing for the 
presence of a drug.  The amendment gives police the power to take 
a sample from the person in question even if this person is 
incapable of giving consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a car dealer for 18 years and even before that I was 
involved in the car business.  Part of our business was 
accidents.  Part of our business was wrecks.  Many of those 
wrecks were as a result of drunk driving and most of them 
involved fatalities.  I still remember each one of them.  I still 
remember every day that they came in on the back end of a tow 
truck, smashed to smithereens and reflecting the injuries and 
even the fatalities of the people who were involved in the 
accidents.  The losses of life were not necessary.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the young people especially that were involved in 
many accidents.  I think of all those lives that were lost.  I 
think of some of the young people whom I knew well that are gone. 
They should be here, those tremendous young people, but they are 
gone and never will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view there should be zero tolerance for this offence. I 
totally support the increase in penalties proposed in Bill C-18. 
We were anxious to see the bill come forth earlier, but even with 
this delay we are pleased that it is now here.  We are pleased to 
return to the debate on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was last debated in December 1999.  At that time the party 
pushed for the government to come forth with legislation that 
introduces the life imprisonment clause for impaired driving 
causing death. Since then one year has almost passed and 
parliament has yet to make much headway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pleased to be back here, but we are worried about the 
delay and wonder about the priorities of the government.  We 
understand now that it is anxious to bring in Bill C-17 
respecting cruelty to animals.  Meanwhile this bill, which is 
such an important one in my view and in the view of my party, 
lies dormant.  It is difficult to justify how the bill on cruelty 
to animals is more important and should take priority over this 
one, although cruelty to animals is certainly an important issue 
that should be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the government raised the question of providing $175 
million for road work in western Canada to accommodate the grain 
industry when in fact provinces all across the country have been 
asking for money for road work, for highway improvements and 
reconstruction from one end of the country to the other to help 
save lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best example is Highway 101 in Nova Scotia where over 50 
people have been killed in just six or seven years.  Most of 
those people were in their twenties or younger.  Again the 
government has chosen not to do anything for those highway 
problems, even though they involved fatalities, and instead put 
its priority on moving grain.  It is putting money in highway 
improvement for grain but it continues to refuse to put money 
into highway improvement to avoid deaths and injuries.  That 
points to the government's priority in bills.  It is difficult to 
justify or to figure out what thought pattern it uses when it 
comes up with priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another one that often concerns me is that there are 3,400 
deaths per year on highways in Canada.  There is no federal input 
or direct investigation into these accidents to find out what 
caused them.  Yet we have the Transportation Safety Board of 
Canada that investigates every train crash, every plane crash, 
whether there is death or injury. Even at that there were on 
average for the last five years approximately 100 deaths per year 
in plane crashes whereas there were 3,400 on highways.  There is 
no focus on those accidents. Perhaps there should be.  I feel 
strongly there should be more attention on the highway aspects of 
fatalities than on transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 which will increase the penalties for impaired driving 
should be a top priority.  It should go through the House very 
quickly.  It deals with the life imprisonment provision, which 
was originally part of Bill C-82, an act to amend the criminal 
code for impaired driving.  That became law in the last 
parliament.  Bill C-18 will allow a judge leeway to invoke life 
sentences.  It does not impose the life sentence, but it gives 
the judge, after reviewing all the circumstances of the case, the 
leeway to invoke a life sentence for impaired driving causing 
death, and we totally support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were disappointed when all parties softened their position in 
the original debate on Bill C-82 and dropped the life 
imprisonment provisions in exchange for speedy passage.  It was a 
mistake in my view and in the view of our party, and that is why 
we support Bill C-18.  We hope that it goes through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We supported Bill C-82 but we wanted it improved.  We were 
disappointed to see it watered down.  We wanted the current 
outdated legislation improved upon by including tougher 
sanctions, fines and suspensions.  The bill did not give police 
enough power to protect society from hard core drinkers who are 
resistant to change.  When we look at the statistics, it is not 
the younger people now who are the repeat offenders.  It is the 
older drivers who are into a lifestyle and a habit that are 
finding it difficult to change. 
Young people are benefiting from the education programs on 
impaired driving that the government, the provinces and the 
education system provides.  However it is the older repeat 
offenders who are causing the problems.

</I></B></P><P align=left>High school proms and summer vacation are quickly approaching. 
Statistics from MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, show that 
one in every eight deaths and injuries in road crashes is a 
teenager.  In my former occupation in the car business and now in 
my position as transport critic, it seems to me that the 
statistics are worse than that.  I refer to Highway 101 in Nova 
Scotia where more than 50% of the people killed on that highway 
were in their twenties or younger.  It does seem to affect 
younger drivers more than any other.  MADD feels that alcohol 
plays a key role in a great many of these accidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, the most recent year for which statistics are 
available, 404 youths aged 15 to 19 were killed and another 
28,780 were injured in road crashes.  The troubling statistic is 
that 40% of the teenage drivers killed had been drinking. 
Three-quarters of them had alcohol levels in excess of the legal 
limit, in excess of 150 milligrams.  Dangerous habits developed 
at an early age become a chronic problem.  It is not the younger 
drivers who are the repeat offenders, it is the older drivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Groups like MADD are working hard to deal with this problem at 
an early age with some success.  They are trying to raise the 
minimum age for drinking.  They are trying to raise the minimum 
age for driving.  Many provinces have instituted systems where 
young drivers get conditional licences and are only approved 
after a certain period of time when they have proven they can 
handle the responsibility of a driver's licence.  Some provinces 
have introduced smart card technology to verify the age of an 
individual trying to buy alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MADD is not getting enough attention nor enough co-operation 
from the federal government even though this organization is 
extremely well-respected and appreciated for the good work it 
does.  Its only purpose is to prevent drunk drivers from killing 
more people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MADD is working hard to stop impaired driving among all ages of 
the population.  However, it will not be effective if it does not 
get the legislation to back up its position and if the police do 
not get the tools to work with.  It appears that the provinces 
are leading the battle with innovative approaches to drunk 
driving and impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nova Scotia government recently passed a tough impaired 
driving legislation under the Motor Vehicle Act which came into 
effect on December 1 last year.  In Nova Scotia, any driver 
pulled over with a blood alcohol level between .05 and .08 
receives a 24-hour licence suspension.  That is not an infraction 
or an offence.  Infractions start at .08, but even before that, 
Nova Scotia has a new stage where licences are immediately 
suspended for a 24 hour period.  There is no charge laid but it 
is a good solid warning and gets the attention of drivers. In 
Halifax last Christmas, the police did 8,000 roadside checks and 
no one was charged with impaired driving.  That was a quite a 
successful approach for the Halifax police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Continuing with the get tough approach, the Nova Scotia 
Conservative government is considering whether it can charge room 
and board at $100 a day to incarcerate drunk drivers.  This idea 
is only in the initial stages, but putting the extra burden on 
the impaired driver is seriously being considered.  Impaired 
drivers should be responsible for their actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario is another province that is leading the way.  It grew 
tired of waiting for the feds to act so in 1997, with the 
province's statistics showing more than 300 people killed in 
drunk driving related accidents, it took action.  As a result, in 
Ontario, if drivers are caught three times for impaired driving, 
they will get a lifetime licence suspension.  It will be lifted 
after 12 years if the driver installs an ignition interlock. A 
lifetime suspension takes drivers off the road forever.  It has 
also increased fines to at least $2,000 from $300.  This gives 
judges the leeway to decide what the appropriate penalty will be 
for the individual and it gives them the tools to work with.  The 
federal government is not giving the judges and the police the 
tools they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time the federal government followed the leads of these 
two provinces.  It is time to deal with the issue, to get tough 
and to took a stand. 
This is such an important thing because it involves fatalities 
and injuries, and mostly to young people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government had an opportunity to send the message 
that drinking and driving will no longer be tolerated but it has 
not done it.  Every one of these accidents can either take a 
human life or cause terrible injuries.  People who choose to 
drink and drive and cause an accident or death should be treated 
the same as if someone took a life in any other fashion. To take 
a life is to take a life.  There should be no excuse and they 
should be treated the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Liberals continue to delay Bill C-18.  They show 
their reluctance to take action on this.  They drag their feet. 
We say that we should not let up on our efforts in the House 
until the drinking and driving statistics are brought down to 
zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are positives in Bill C-18 that we endorse and support. 
Increasing the time limit for the breathalyzer and the ASD 
testing to three hours, and strictly enforcing the .08 blood 
alcohol concentration limit are effective amendments that will 
help police in performing their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early education is the only way to really begin this process. We 
support the education aspect.  We also support the education of 
older drivers, those between 35 and 45, who are currently the 
most frequently charged re-offenders for this charge.  It is not 
the 16 to 21 year old drivers who are causing most of the 
problem, but the drivers between 35 and 45 remain a startling 
problem for driving while impaired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also financial consequences that are becoming more 
substantial all the time.  Over a two year period an impaired 
driving conviction costs at least $5,000 extra in premiums for 
insurance to any consumer involved.  Yet, with all the financial 
hardship, embarrassment and everything else, it is still not 
getting through to those drivers 35 to 45 who should know better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police have many problems dealing with this issue. It is one 
of the issues they find most difficult to deal with. It takes a 
police officer an average of two hours and 48 minutes to process 
a criminal code charge.  They also need the use of mobile 
breathalysers, physical sobriety testing and passive alcohol 
sensors to make their jobs more efficient and effective.  They do 
the best they can with the tools they have to work with but 
presently they just do not have enough to do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in light of the one year delay, I would like to thank the 
Minister of Justice for keeping her promise and reintroducing the 
life imprisonment provision through Bill C-18.  We can only hope 
that all parties will see the importance of this legislation and 
give the bill swift passage through the House.  Speaking on 
behalf of the Conservative Party, we certainly will support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 amends the criminal code by increasing the maximum 
penalty for impaired driving causing death to life imprisonment. 
It also provides for the taking of blood samples for the purpose 
of testing for the presence of a drug.  The amendment gives 
police the power to take a sample from the person in question, 
even if that person is incapable of giving consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to say that these are all necessary tools 
which we must put into the hands of the police.  The whole goal 
is to stop fatalities and injuries.  The whole goal is to stop 
impaired driving and make our highways safer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the words of MADD president, Carolyn Swinson, in her

Sadly, I must inform the House that, despite the traditional 
co-operation the Bloc Quebecois has always shown when bills were 
reasonable, we will not be able to support Bill C-18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago, I shared my concerns about the Criminal Code 
with the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine.  As she knows,

to reach decisions here as a legislator.  I can say that readily 
because I know that the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine 
herself studied law at UQAM in the early 1980. 
Those were the days when the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine was not only Liberal, but perhaps 
even a little Bolshevik at times. That being said, she has always 
had social concerns, which is, I must say, to her credit.

requires a degree of measure, flexibility, rigour and balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before getting to the core of the issue, I want to say how much 
the Bloc Quebecois caucus benefited from the expertise of the 
hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm, who is himself a great legal 
expert, one of the brightest of his generation, even though he 
can sometimes be stubborn. Still, I think he is one of the most 
brilliant legal experts in the House.

association in his riding, who had extremely harsh words for the 
Prime Minister. The riding of Berthier—Montcalm is a breeding 
ground for dissenters, a riding where critics are very vocal. I 
would not be surprised to learn that, in that school where 
criticism is a requirement, the member for Berthier—Montcalm 
taught a few classes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I salute the hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas, whom I would ask 
to send me his wishes for a happy birthday on May 13, since he is 
no doubt the member of this House to whom I am closest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to the substance, Bill C-18 goes too far. How can 
the government ask us, parliamentarians, to impose life 
imprisonment—these words have a meaning after all—for impaired 
driving causing death or bodily harm resulting in death? We must 
set things back in their proper context.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine what the Criminal Code is all about.  The 
Criminal Code is a law.  Some might think it is not a law, but 
it is.  It is a law containing several hundred sections—on 
procuring, on criminal interest rates, on property given as 
security, on homicide, on defamatory libel, section 347 on 
criminal interest rates.  It is a key piece of legislation.  But 
in a society that wants criminal law to be taken seriously, 
there must be a balance between the sentences proposed to us as 
lawmakers and the offences committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that our justice system is an adversarial system, with 
the crown, represented by those defending the government, on one 
side, and the defence on the other. 
Even though lawmakers have suggested a number of sentences 
within the Criminal Code, these are always discretionary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to interrupt my speech to read a message which I 
will not hesitate to make public, with the kind permission of 
the House.  I am touched.  It reads:  “Happy birthday, love and 
kisses, Svend Robinson”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like a round of applause because May 13 will be my 
birthday.  Thank you to all those who remembered to send their 
good wishes to me and my twin brother.  It is this sort of 
thoughtfulness that makes it all the nicer to work together.  I 
thank all my colleagues.  I will be 38, and 40 is just around 
the corner, but I must say that I think I am in rather good 
shape for my age.  Once again, I thank our colleague, Svend 
Robinson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code must therefore reflect what we see as 
effective sentences.  The House will remember how, a few years 
back, we amended the Criminal Code.  I must pause again for all 
the congratulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A man much liked by the House, one of the most brilliant 
defenders of the working class, has sent me another birthday 
telegram  “Happy birthday, and many more, Yvon Godin, 
Acadie—Bathurst”.  I thank my colleague, and on behalf of— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please.  The hon. member knows very 
well that we cannot read out the names of members, only their 
ridings.  Everyone knows that, and the hon. member for 
Acadie—Bathurst may be cited without the need to mention his 
name.  I hope the hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve will 
comply with the Standing Orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> You are right, Mr. Speaker, but I thought that, 
in this special moment of celebration as we focus a bit on our 
private lives, you might be a bit more indulgent.  I want to 
thank the member for Acadie—Bathurst, who, as we know, has been 
an outspoken advocate of workers in the House.  I think he 
deserves our recognition.  That, I think, closes the birthday 
period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to return to the extremely important Bill C-18, in which 
there has to be a balance between sentencing and the offence 
being considered.  This is so true that, a few years ago, we 
amended the Criminal Code to provide that in social terms there 
were certain circumstances and certain offences that would 
result in a harsher sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We adopted provisions on crimes of hatred, for example. 
We agreed as a society and as parliamentarians that in certain 
instances, such as when people beat others up because of their 
sexual orientation, the judiciary would have no choice but to 
mete out a harsher sentence to those doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question today is whether it might be a bit excessive to 
want to put a person in prison for life for impaired driving 
causing the death of another.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously we must take every measure available to us to prevent 
people from driving under the influence. The Bloc Quebecois 
supports measures that are along the lines of education 
campaigns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remember the education campaigns aimed at drinking 
and driving carried out in co-operation with a number of cable 
companies. We all recall the campaign “Drinking and driving is a 
crime”. I believe we are right not to tolerate this kind of 
behaviour. But it seems to me that between trying to deter 
people from driving under the influence and sentencing them to 
life in prison, there is quite a step that we as 
parliamentarians should not take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Berthier—Montcalm, whose huge talent we all 
appreciate, did tell us in caucus that it was extremely 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must stop once again to bring to the attention of the House 
that I have received a gift of flowers, little red roses from an 
anonymous donor. As we are all a little bit on the socialist 
side in this House, I wish to thank the anonymous source, it 
gives me a great pleasure nonetheless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I resume by saying that the Bloc Quebecois cannot agree with the 
government members who want us to allow the judges to sentence 
to life in prison individuals guilty of impaired driving causing 
death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the deep emotions I am feeling right now, allow me 
to share with the House an editorial from <I>La Presse</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is really unbelievable.  I hardly know how to react, but I 
will share this message with those listening “Happy birthday to 
a brilliant and charming colleague.  Vive le Québec libre”.  And 
it is signed “the premier”.  Well, really, my life is complete. 
And I have the piece of paper to prove it. But, moving on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Journalist Pierre Gravel, who is not on the payroll of the Bloc 
Quebecois and who is known for his seriousness, integrity and 
analytical mind, wrote the following editorial a while back, on 
June 3, 1999.  It is therefore fairly recent. He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has often been criticized for systematically 
blocking Ottawa's every move just to prove that the federal 
system cannot work. 
But this is a charge that will not stick in the case of its 
stand in the debate on sentences for impaired drivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, in this debate, it is the Bloc Quebecois' firm stand 
that has been largely responsible for tempering the excessive 
zeal— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—for tempering the excessive zeal of the champions of zero 
tolerance and thus putting the entire debate into a reasonable 
perspective, in which the sentences handed out for impaired 
driving will not be out of proportion to those for equally 
serious crimes with much lighter sentences. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the number of 
serious accidents due to impaired driving climbing year after 
year until there is now a crisis, federal authorities have been 
concerned about this problem for some time now.  In 1997 alone, 
there were no fewer than 193 accidents in Canada related to 
alcohol consumption that resulted in the death of at least one 
person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The publication of statistics like this would have been a 
signal to any responsible government to review the preventive and 
punitive measures that might stop the slaughter.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This was in fact the mandate of a Commons committee on justice, 
which, in recent months, applied itself reviewing all laws that

colleagues in government. I will not read too quickly so it will 
not be too difficult for the interpreters.  I will table this

headlong into an ultraconservative and populist opposition such

</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will understand that this was before the day the right 
united in the hope of one day forming the government. All this, 
members will understand, is just wishful thinking, but this is 
not what the author was getting at. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when the government, as is the case at the moment, runs 
headlong into an ultraconservative and populist opposition such 
as the Reform Party, which always advocates stiffer sentences to 
ensure that law and order prevail everywhere, we run the risk

rumblings of an exasperated public whose desire for vengeance is 
constantly thwarted by a bunch of demagogues. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The expression does not come from the Bloc Quebecois, I remind 
members, but from journalist Pierre Gravel.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said it in English to make sure the Liberals get it. 
Continuing, then: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—we find ourselves faced with an unacceptable and vehemently 
opposed bill, the opposition by the Bloc Quebecois being totally 
justified in this case. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here then we have a tribute to the lucidity of the Bloc 
Quebecois being made by <I>La Presse</I>, a paper that cannot of course 
be suspected of any sympathy for the sovereignty cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Continuing to quote the editorial: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must have been obvious to those drafting it that, regardless 
of the opinion of the supporters of unqualified severity, it was 
total madness to call for life imprisonment for impaired drivers 
involved in a fatal accident.  All one needs to do to convince 
oneself of this is to look at how any murderer or hit man can 
reach deals with the authorities, plea bargaining for a lesser 
sentence in exchange for some co-operation, or some more or less 
spontaneous admission.  As the leader of the Bloc Quebecois has 
in fact pointed out, it is a kind of aberration to insist on a 
life sentence for a driver who has done something stupid, 
something of enormity but nevertheless unpremeditated, while a 
criminal who has carefully planned someone's death can get off 
with fourteen years in the penitentiary. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the most basic of inconsistencies.  Continuing to quote 
Mr. Gravel: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Undeniably, a clear message must be sent to all those who are 
irresponsible enough to drive when they are drunk.  But if 
wisdom starts with fear, we ought perhaps to start out by 
letting them know that judges will have more leeway in future 
for imposing more severe sentences.  They also need to know, 
however, that these sentences will really have to be served. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will stop for another brief aside, as I have received another 
message of good wishes.  I shall make it public because we are 
paid to make our points of view public:

<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I listened carefully to the speech made by my colleague, who 
lost his concentration a few times because of his birthday, but 
who made serious remarks about this issue, since we must also 
think about the victims who die in accidents caused by impaired 
drivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague mentioned, we must avoid going too far because 
sentences that are too harsh may have a negative effect. I was 
at the committee last year because there were cases that had to 
be mentioned, in my riding as well as elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the sentence is too harsh, it will encourage what is called 
hit and runs. Imagine someone who causes such an accident. If 
the sentence is too harsh, such as life in prison, that person 
will be inclined not to face up to his or her responsibilities, 
to flee the scene of the accident without trying to come to the 
victim's aid, even if it is just by calling for help as soon as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In applying such a harsh sentence, I think we must look at the 
negative effect it can have. I would like my colleague to 
comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, the House rectified one situation, and we all agreed 
that people involved in hit and run incidents had to be dealt 
with as harshly as those who caused death, involuntarily of 
course, because they were driving while impaired. There is a new 
balance. It was something that had to be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that if a life sentence is maintained in such 
cases, it will encourage people to flee the scene of an 
accident. I would like my colleague to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I fully endorse the very qualified 
and judicious comments of the hon. member for 
Lévis-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, whose pragmatism has always benefited 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague reflects the view of our caucus when he says that 
there is a point beyond which sentencing, because of its 
excessive nature, becomes counterproductive. I also heard the 
hon. member for Chambly, who is also a legal expert, and whose 
comments were just as judicious. He reminded us that the 
practical consequence of a bill like this one, if it is passed, 
is to authorize and encourage hit and run offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this what we, as parliamentarians, want? As I remember, the 
Criminal Code includes a provision requiring people to provide 
assistance when a person's life is in danger, although I cannot 
tell members which section it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are acutely aware of the fact that we must deter people from 
driving under the influence. We do not believe that, from a 
social perspective, that objective can be achieved through 
excessive sentencing. We must think about it: life imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sentence is of course imposed by the bench, but the 
practical consequence of the proposed legislation is to allow a 
judge to impose life imprisonment on a person who drove under 
the influence, when those who commit the most serious crimes— 
those who terrorize us—can get away with a 14 year sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not take a rocket scientist to understand. 
It seems to me that the point of view defended by the Bloc 
Quebecois is a balanced, reasonable and rational one that calls 
for a fair trade-off between what the Criminal Code allows and 
the integrity to which we must aspire as individuals.

Paper for consideration by members of the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights.

importance. I would not like it myself if my sister, my brother 
or my little nephew were killed in a collision with a drunk 
driver.  As parliamentarians, we do not wish to experience this 
in our personal lives, but I think that we must not go to 
extremes and pass bills as radically unreasonable as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Justice is with us today.  I say to him, as we have always 
done—we are a responsible opposition—that when the government 
introduces balanced bills, bills that are in the best interests 
of Quebec, we vote in favour.  The list of bills that we have 
supported is a long one.  We have always done so with this same 
sense of proportion and responsibility that must transcend 
political differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat: this bill cannot be supported because, as the member 
for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière has said, it goes too far.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot ask my 
question without first wishing my colleague from 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve happy birthday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if my learned colleague, who knows and 
studies every single piece of legislation introduced in the 
House, would agree that, in the responsibility placed on 
citizens and in the degree of criminality assigned to the 
actions of citizens, there should be some kind of gradation 
whereby sentences should also take criminal intent into account? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I totally agree that nobody should drive while impaired. Only a 
fool would say that it is acceptable, except that in Quebec—and 
the same thing must be happening throughout Canada—there is an 
increase in hit and run incidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the harsher sentences provided for in this bill cause a 
further increase in hit and run incidents? For example, when the 
person who inadvertently exceeds the speed limit has to pay a 
heavier fine than the man who assaulted his neighbour with a 
baseball bat, there must be something wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve to tell us if 
it is fair to say that the penalty imposed for a reprehensible 
act must be proportionate not only to the act itself but also to 
the intent of committing that act? The mens rea, or guilty 
intent, principle seems to be totally ignored in this bill. We 
know that there is no crime without the two main elements, 
namely actus reus and mens rea, the act and the intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is an example I studied in law school. Someone breaks into 
a residence, stabs the occupant in the back—and it has happened 
—and the occupant panics and jumps from the second floor to 
escape the aggressor and dies from the fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts said that the actus reus, or the act of stabbing the 
person, was not the cause of death. Some will say that this is 
an aberration. The bill before us must not lead to similar 
aberrations. Perhaps the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, who is 
celebrating his birthday today—time flies—could tell us if this is 
one of his concerns. Could our brilliant colleague, who is also 
a legal expert, tell us that?

there is a huge gap between the objectives of the bill and the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today, it is important to discuss 
Bill C-18, a bill dealing with impaired driving causing death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill introduced by the federal government goes too far. It 
provides for life imprisonment for an offender who is condemned 
for impaired driving causing death. I think this is going beyond 
the objectives we should have in the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois opposes Bill C-18, even if it considers 
impaired driving a very serious offence. We think that, by 
passing Bill C-18, we would negate the specific nature of this 
offence, and create a serious imbalance in our criminal justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sentences already provided for are said to be underused by the 
courts. Statistics show that the courts have not used, far from 
it, the full range of the sentences provided for in the criminal 
code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most severe sentence ever imposed by the courts for impaired 
driving causing death is ten years. The judges are in the best 
position to analyse the specific case of each offender, because 
it is their responsibility to do so, and they have not used the 
full range of what is already provided for in the criminal code, 
which sets at 14 years the maximum sentence for impaired driving 
causing death. In other words, there is a gap between what is 
actually being done and what is allowed in the code. Right now, 
the average sentence is 10 years, but sentences could go up to 14 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, the ratio of offenders sentenced to prison for 
impaired driving has dropped from 22% in 1994-95 to 19% in

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we pass legislation to allow life imprisonment 
sentences when the courts are not fully using the tools they 
already have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, partly because of the practice in the United States 
and partly under the influence of the right wing movement 
represented here by the Canadian Alliance, we have often believed 
that we would solve problems by imposing harsher sentences under 
the Code.  Each time we have a problem with the behaviour of 
offenders in our society, we think the best way to deal with the 
problem is to amend the criminal code and increase the sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before us today is a case in point, and so was 
the bill on young offenders; the Liberal government was somehow 
intoxicated by this right-wing approach according to which it is 
absolutely necessary to strengthen discipline, make it very 
harsh, and offenders will only change their behaviour if we 
strike them hard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's case is a perfect example of this new philosophy which 
is influencing law in Canada.  I think we can safely say that 
this approach is more widespread in the provinces with a majority 
of English-speaking people and much less so in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have shown that showing compassion and openness, by giving 
young offenders a chance to rehabilitate themselves for instance, 
often produces better results in the end. 
It actually allows us to have a more just society, which is 
always the purpose of the law. The purpose of the law is not just 
to punish as much as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose is to create a just and balanced society and, in 
this case, the Liberal government's attitude appears to be based 
much more on its desire to please people, namely the right wing 
in Canada, who are asking for stiffer sentences. This does not 
seem to be an interesting solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of offences involving impaired driving causing death 
is not rising. No one denies the fact that impaired driving 
causing death is a very serious offence. We must judge these 
situations very carefully and make sure we find the right 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is false to claim that we are facing a rash of 
crimes in that area. In 1998, 103 individuals were charged with 
impaired driving causing death, and this is the lowest number of 
cases since 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation where rumour has it that things are 
terrible. Rumour is often magnified by the media and by the focus 
which is put on events. However, statistics based on a 10 year 
period show a situation which does not correspond to the isolated 
events reported on TV. From that perspective, the current 
situation in Canada does not justify such a serious measure to 
deal with the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I referred earlier to the right wing. It appears that Canada is 
becoming a champion of incarceration, second only to the United 
States. 
Canada incarcerates twice as many people as most European 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides, in the Gladue case, the supreme court justices 
condemned the federal lawmakers' excessive reliance on prison 
sentences to deal with delinquency problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is yet another example of our need to be responsible in 
this parliament. We are not here only to ride social trends. We 
are here also to legislate and make decisions that reflect 
reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have realize that, under this legislation, we would treat a 
drunk driver like a hitman. We have a double standard, here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members who spoke before me have made it clear that for a crime 
to be committed, there must be an act and an intent. A hitman, 
for example, has clear intent from the beginning and his act is 
deliberate. On the other hand, in the case of the person who 
commits the crime of impaired driving causing death, something 
horrible that must be punished, motivation and full knowledge are 
not as obvious.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it would be a mistake to give, under the criminal 
code, equal importance to these two things. This could lead to 
discrepancies. For instance, a drunk driver, who has undeniably 
been negligent, could receive a harsher sentence that a hired 
killer who, after skilfully plotting the death of his victim, can 
be given a reduced sentence as an informer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can imagine this: an individual is given life for 
impaired driving causing death, and even though it is his first 
offence, he receives a very harsh sentence for an offence which 
is certainly serious but which, in our opinion, does not warrant 
such a sentence, whereas a hired killer would be sentenced to 
less time in prison because of his being an informer. This is a 
double standard and it is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both individuals committed very reprehensible acts. However, 
their profiles are quite different, a fact Bill C-18 does not 
recognize. This is why the Bloc Quebecois will vote against the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, one must take into account other sentences related to 
offences the characteristics of which are comparable to impaired 
driving causing death. For instance, under the criminal code, 
dangerous driving causing death is punishable by a 14 year 
sentence. Since 1985, for this kind of offence, the average 
sentence handed down by appeal courts in Canada has been 19 
months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister justify sentencing an offender who killed 
someone in cold blood and in full possession of his faculties to 
a shorter prison term than a driver whose faculties were 
diminished by alcohol? Again, this is not consistent with the 
rules on which our laws are based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are further examples of serious offences, the perpetrators 
of which are fully aware of what they are doing, leading to 
lesser sentences than impaired driving should Bill C-18 become 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let us look at attempted murder. 
An individual who has attempted, without success, to murder 
someone would get a lighter sentence than someone convicted of 
impaired driving causing death. Pursuant to section 463(<I>a</I>) of 
the criminal code, this individual would be liable to 
imprisonment for a term of 14 years. As members can see, an 
individual who attempted knowingly to murder someone would face a 
lighter sentence than someone convicted of impaired driving 
causing death. There is a double standard here, and it is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is the case of accessories after the fact. 
Someone who has helped a murderer to elude the authorities would 
face a lighter sentence than someone convicted of impaired 
driving causing death. Pursuant to section 463(<I>a</I>) of the 
criminal code, this person is now liable to imprisonment for a 
term not exceeding 14 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another type of crime is participation in a criminal 
organization. As everyone knows, the issue of organized crime is 
dramatic and terrible nowadays. A confirmed criminal who is part 
of a criminal organization and who participates in its illegal 
activities is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 
years, pursuant to section 467.1(2) of the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are three examples of a double standard in comparison with 
what is proposed in Bill C-18: attempted murder, accessory after 
the fact and participation in a criminal organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will add a fourth one: aggravated assault. An individual  who 
wounds, maims, disfigures or endangers the life of someone 
commits an aggravated assault. Pursuant to section 268 of the 
criminal code, an individual who commits such an offence is 
liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would impose a life sentence on a person who causes 
death in an accident because of impaired driving, while a person 
who assaults, injures, maims or disfigures someone or puts their 
life in danger gets a maximum of 14 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a clear lack of logic in the current position. The 
reason for that is that this position is not based on legal 
considerations, but rather on political considerations, in that 
the Liberal government wants to please the right wing, which is 
found mainly in English Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the person accused of impaired driving causing death, the 
person accused of causing bodily harm did not foresee the 
consequences of the offence. Yet, one is given a much harsher 
sentence than the other: ten years for the one who caused bodily 
harm and life for the one who caused death.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What makes impaired driving causing death more negligent than 
impaired driving causing bodily harm? Both offences are identical 
in terms of intent, with regard to the consequences of the 
offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the Bloc Quebecois is of the opinion that the 
sentences for both offences must remain different, it does not 
want that difference to be disproportionate. In maintaining the 
sentence at 14 years imprisonment, as is the case now, for 
impaired driving causing death, we would make a distinction that 
is proportionate to the consequences of both offences, while 
recognizing their similarity in terms of intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that, when we already have in Quebec and Alberta the 
possibility of using far less drastic means that would produce 
equally satisfactory results: the ignition interlock system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alberta and Quebec are currently the only provinces to impose 
ignition interlock systems as a condition for the issue of a 
restricted driver's license for drivers whose driver's license 
has been suspended.  In other words, someone whose license is 
suspended, known to be a repeat offender is obliged to use an 
ignition interlock system, and the problem is solved at source 
in most cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than send someone to prison for life for something he did 
not intend to do—it is a serious act and should be punished—it 
might be a good idea to try to prevent the recurrence of this 
act by applying practical solutions such as the ignition 
interlock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This system determines blood alcohol level from a sample of the 
driver's breath.  It prevents the vehicle from starting if the 
driver's alcohol level is higher than a set level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois believes that the criminal code should be 
amended to make it mandatory to install these interlock systems 
in the case of a repeat offender.  I think this is a practical 
solution that could be implemented.  It is a preventive measure 
that eliminates the problem at source and limits potentially 
tragic mistakes as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who are very responsible citizens could do something 
unacceptable in a given situation, such as driving while 
intoxicated and by doing so have caused a death. 
The situation is not necessarily the result of a life of crime. 
It is not the result of continual delinquency, but a situation 
that occurred once in a person's life.  Few people in this House 
could say that they might not do the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practical solution proposed by the Bloc Quebecois, and I 
hope the government agrees to it, is the alcohol ignition 
interlock system, to put a stop to these situations at the 
source.  In ten years, we will see, if the Bloc proposal is 
chosen, fewer and fewer sentences and fewer and fewer deaths 
caused by the irresponsibility of a drunken driver.

almost spit up though when she learned he became a committee

will build the many diverse and educational exhibits on display 
at the museum.  The government's funding will help create five

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an ambitious project.  I would like to commend all of 
those individuals, and specifically Rosemary Aicher, for their 
dedication in providing this facility which encourages learning 
and invests in our children.

and the indifference of the federal Liberal government. On this 
one stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway alone there have been 900

serious injuries.  In fact some 40 people have died on this one 
stretch of highway since 1979. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Thursday, April 13 Saskatchewan highways minister Maynard 
Sonntag demanded again that the Liberals participate in the 
twinning of the Trans-Canada Highway. Tragically the next day 
there was another accident killing three people and closing the 
highway for over 12 hours.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

raised the spectre of McCarthyism.  A billion dollars was bungled 
and friends of the reds benefited.  Questionable grants were 
handed out and friends of the reds lined their pockets. 
Questionable donations were encouraged and friends of the reds 
cashed in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the red menace, is she now or has she ever 
been a member of that bungling— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I would remind members that we address each 
other by our proper titles rather than give each other nicknames. 
<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad that the hon. member is willing to admit by 
her question that she is a member of the bungling, boondoggling 
party originally known as C-C-R-A-P. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I would ask my colleagues 
once again to please tone down the rhetoric.  We are getting a 
bit off track. 
<P><A NAME="LINK97"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Modes Conili got nearly three 
quarters of a million dollars in a job grant, even though no jobs 
were going to be created.  Pierre Côté, the head of the 
commission governing working conditions in the ladies clothing 
industry, confirmed yesterday that the jobs were transferred, not 
created, and he had assured Quebec regulators that no jobs would 
be lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He told the Montreal <I>Gazette</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were advised that the employees were going to be transferred 
to Conili Star. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Mr. Côté knew it and the Quebec regulators knew it, why did 
HRDC cut them a cheque? 
<P><A NAME="LINK98"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have said 
repeatedly that if new information were to come to this House we 
would investigate it.  We received new information on Tuesday, we 
reviewed it yesterday and, therefore, we have passed this new 
information to the RCMP. 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it took three years.  Let us look at 
the chronology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Ahuntsic lobbies the HRDC minister for a job 
grant for the newly incorporated Modes Conili.  The department 
then cuts a cheque for three quarters of a million dollars. 
Modes Conili then finances 10% of the election campaign for the 
member for Ahuntsic.  The HRDC minister gets 160 new jobs 
transferred to his riding just in time for the federal election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could it be that these are the facts that kept HRDC from blowing 
the whistle on this scam three years ago? 
<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member's question is based on faulty premises, 
the kinds of insinuations and innuendoes that led to the very 
valid point made yesterday by the parliamentary secretary. 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, HRDC supposedly looked into the Modes 
Conili allegations back in 1997.  A cross-check of social 
insurance numbers had shown that workers hired by this newly 
created Conili were simply transfers from a former company.  A 
reporter made a few phone calls last week, three years later, and 
quickly uncovered even more evidence that the whole exercise was 
a scam designed to scoop up three quarters of a million taxpayer 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the minister hiding the report that she claims showed no 
wrongdoing? 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are not 
hiding anything.  As I said yesterday, there was a review of this 
file.  Our officials expressed some concern about it.  A person 
from the fraud and investigation branch looked at it.  At that 
time he could find no evidence of wrongdoing and the file was 
closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was upon receipt of the new evidence provided by the Bloc 
that we were able to move and refer this to the police, which is 
the appropriate action. 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, then it is very simple.  If the 
department in fact found no evidence of wrongdoing, why will it 
not simply table the report that it claims shows it had no reason 
to interfere before?  If nothing is wrong, let us see the 
evidence.  Come clean, be transparent and show us the documents. 
<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the same 
theme is re-stated over and over about transparency.  This is the 
department that the Reform's own researcher said was the best for 
access to information requests.

on the transaction of the property in Brampton, the management of 
Canada Lands asked KPMG to conduct an independent audit.  The 
report indicates very clearly that there were no irregularities. 
It also said that a series of special circumstances allowed the 
original purchaser to sell the property at a considerable profit. 
This property was put on the market through two prominent real 
estate firms for 18 months.  This is a long time for the real

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the question I think Canadians have on their mind as we 
enter into this Thursday question is:  What exactly is the House 
leader's plan for business in the days ahead?  Are we are going 
to deal with the meaty issues of the land or are we going to just 
deal with the fluff? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the House if he will tell Canadians today what legislative 
program he plans for the rest of this week and for the week 
following. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is always the best question 
that is asked every Thursday.  I will try to give the best 
answer, although some of my colleagues gave such excellent 
answers today they would perhaps be hard to surpass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, we will continue today with Bill C-18, the criminal 
code amendments with regard to impaired driving.  If by any 
chance this is completed we could start with Bill C-33, but I 
understand there probably would not be any more than one or two 
speakers on that today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, tomorrow we will do second reading of Bill S-10, 
the DNA, and Bill S-3 respecting international tax conventions. 
Should those bills be completed tomorrow before the end of the 
day, I would not propose to call any other business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday, we would hope to deal with report stage and, if 
possible, third reading of Bill C-26, the airlines bill.  There 
are ongoing consultations to that effect.  If we complete all of 
this we would then continue with Bill C-33 or in any case get 
started on Bill C-33 if it was not begun earlier.  Bill C-33 is 
the legislation concerning species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Tuesday, we will debate Bill C-25, the income tax 
legislation.  This is the bill that is presently stuck at second 
reading as a result of two reasoned amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Wednesday, we would propose to complete any of the listed 
bills we have not completed.  I wish to designate Thursday, May 
18, as an allotted day.

</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am at it, because that leaves only one additional day 
before the parliamentary break, it would be my intention, if 
possible, to call Bill C-12, the amendments to the Canada Labour 
Code, at report stage and third reading on Friday of next week. 
That would complete the sequence until the break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, could the government House 
leader tell us if a bill regarding the grain transportation issue 
which was dealt with today in question period is soon to be 
tabled in the House?  I understand that the government would like 
it passed before the start of the next crop year, and it is 
important for us to see the details of that bill so we can start 
the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
for raising this issue, which is obviously of great importance 
not only for us, but for the agricultural community, particularly 
in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope to introduce this bill at the very earliest opportunity. 
I am hoping to do so before we adjourn next week.  I understand 
that the drafting will probably not be complete.  I intend to 
introduce it as soon as we return and give it the maximum time 
that is available to all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could be introduced, with consent, perhaps as early as the 
Tuesday after we return.  That would require being later in the 
day, because of different instruments of government.  I would 
propose to seek that consent should the bill be ready by then. 
If not, the latest date for the introduction, as proposed, would 
be on the Wednesday, but again I will do my best to have it 
available as early as Tuesday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, in part, of representations from members of the 
House, together with colleagues, we arranged that the policy at 
least would be announced yesterday so that members could consult

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>THE CRIMINAL CODE 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK193">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-18, 
an act to amend the criminal code (impaired driving causing death 
and other matters), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, before Oral Question Period, I had th 
opportunity to speak to Bill C-18 and explain the Bloc Quebecois' 
position and its opposition to Bill C-18, and to explain why we 
are going to vote against the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois recognizes that impaired driving causing 
death is a very serious offence indeed. We are all in agreement 
on this because for the victim the consequences are final and it 
causes a lot of trouble, a lot of pain to the family. Everybody 
agrees on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we think that giving a life sentence to the driver who 
caused this person to die by operating his vehicle while impaired 
would be disproportionate as compared to other sentences under 
the criminal code, and it would not solve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois believes there are other practical, concrete 
solutions that should be implemented such as an ignition 
interlock with a breath alcohol analyzer, a system I will be 
pleased to explain later on, if I have the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make is that the bill before us was 
introduced by the government much more out of political 
expediency than to meet a need in the justice system. Everyone is 
aware of the fact that there is in Canada a very strong shift to 
the right spearheaded mainly by the Canadian Alliance calling for 
tougher, harsher laws, especially with respect to the criminal 
code, without necessarily any factual basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw it with young 
offenders. The situation is very clear, very obvious. We in 
Quebec have developed a preventive approach to bring young 
offenders back on the right track, to help them learn again how 
to live in society and respect the legal framework of our 
society, and it works. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT63"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT63"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1520

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the rest of Canada really let the American approach 
influence them. They want longer prison terms. They want young 
men and women to be harshly punished when they make a mistake. 
They often forget that by doing so, these offenders end up in 
prison and that prisons are often schools for crime. I think 
that the example of the young offenders also applies to Bill C-18 
and to the issue of impaired driving causing death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of adopting this kind of punitive approach, the Bloc 
Quebecois would rather increase the deterrent effect through a 
device known as an alcohol-ignition interlock device. It is 
simply an ignition locking system that by including a clause to 
that effect in the criminal code, this type of offender could be 
compelled to have in his car. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All sorts of uses could be made of this device. Why not, for 
example—and this is my own personal opinion—install this type 
of device in every single car? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seat belts have already been made compulsory. 
At first, a lot of people were against it, but today we all 
buckle up because we know that it is safer and that, should we be 
involved in an accident, our injuries would be less serious. Such 
measures could therefore be considered. However, if the 
government is not prepared to go that far, it could at least 
apply such measures to impaired drivers who are repeat offenders, 
so as to prevent them from taking the wheel and causing death, an 
offence for which, if the government had its way, they would 
receive a life sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see the difference. The bill seeks to punish after the 
fact without doing anything to remedy the situation, by 
preventing further deaths, whereas the Bloc Quebecois wants to 
deal with the root of the problem to ensure there are as few of 
these types of situations as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the Bloc Quebecois has a very responsible attitude on 
this issue. It is a well thought out attitude that is advocated 
by many stakeholders. The prevention system I am talking about 
was used in the past in Alberta and Quebec. Current programs are 
satisfactory, produce significant results and help prevent these 
types of situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I will simply say that, as far as the Bloc 
Quebecois is concerned, Bill C-18 is a bad piece of legislation. 
It does not get to the root of the problem, and it will create 
more problems than it solves. It also introduces a double 
standard in our criminal code, which we find unacceptable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to my colleague for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques. He 
recommended some intelligent measures which should be implemented 
as quickly as possible. I call that prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Putting someone in prison and cancelling his driver's licence 
for years, that is obviously something. Sometimes we may have to 
do it but nobody can convince me that in the year 2000 we cannot 
do better than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see young people who are generally more serious than people 
who are 40 or 45 years old. For many years now, when they go to a 
tavern for a few drinks, they get someone to drive them home. 
However, some might forget and let themselves be led by others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I heard that many accidents happen in Quebec 
involving bikers. We must also think about this. What means 
should we take? Should we send someone to prison? Should we 
suspend his driver's licence for 5, 10 or 20 years? I do not 
think this is the solution. My colleague told us about an 
ignition interlock system which prevents the car from starting. 
When we pass a bill what do we want? We want two things: to 
protect society and to protect the guy who, after a few drinks, 
can become a criminal under the code. We should think twice.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my colleague to explain further what this system is. 
Should we adopt it as quickly as possible? Has this system been 
adopted in other countries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend my colleague for his speech and I urge the government 
to think, to listen and to pay close attention to what my 
colleague has to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before going into the details of the ignition interlock system 
with breathalyzer, I would remind the House that, indeed, as the 
member said, the percentage of people sentenced to jail upon 
conviction by the courts for impaired driving decreased from 22% 
to 19% between 1994-95 and 1997-98. Consequently, it is not 
urgently required to increase penalties. Instead, we should try 
to eliminate the source of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Bloc proposal, the ignition interlock system with 
breathalyzer? It is simply ignition interlock system that, in 
specific circumstances provided for in the code and which I will 
mention, would ensure an impaired driver is not be able to start 
his vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the criminal code should be amended to allow judges 
to order an offender to install an ignition interlock system with 
breathalyzer in his vehicle, as a condition of probation or in 
exchange of the reduction of a much longer period of prohibition 
from driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would be a real prevention measure. It would even promote 
behavioural changes, because the offender would have the 
opportunity to change his attitude. It would ensure that there 
are less and less of this type of accidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this system? It is a little breathalyzer installed in 
the vehicle, which requires the driver to provide a breath sample 
showing a level of alcohol that is nil or almost nil in order to 
be able to start it. The current technology of ignition interlock 
systems is very reliable, even in extreme temperature conditions. 
This system has been validated, it is working very well and it is 
in use in Quebec and in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ignition interlock systems with breathalyzer are normally 
installed after a period of suspension of the driver's licence, 
as a condition for returning the licence to the offender. This 
way, we attack the problem at its very root. We go to the repeat 
offender and make sure there will be no further offences and 
further deaths; that is a much more progressive approach than 
convicting the offender once someone has been killed. It is much 
more progressive to prevent loss of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Evaluations made over the last 10 years have shown time after 
time that ignition interlock systems are effective.  As I said 
earlier, Alberta and Quebec now have satisfactory programs for 
the installation of such systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal code would allow all Canadians to benefit from the 
increased security provided by this technology.  It could be done 
in two different ways.  The judges could have the power to order 
an offender to install an ignition interlock system as a 
condition for his release under mandatory supervision, or the 
convicted offenders could be prompted to install an ignition 
interlock with breathalyser in exchange for a reduced period of 
driving prohibition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would require the prohibition period to be extended 
considerably so that, after it has been reduced in exchange for 
the installation of the system, it would still be as long as the 
suspension of licence by the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could encourage the provinces to make the installation of 
ignition interlocks a mandatory condition for the reinstatement 
of driver's licences, at least for repeat offenders and first 
time offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, instead of telling people who have lost a family member in a 
car accident that they will be vindicated because the person 
responsible for the accident will get life imprisonment, we told 
them that if this system had been in place, nobody would have 
been killed in their family, which of the two alternatives do you 
think people would choose? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should be open to this suggestion of the Bloc 
Quebecois. It is a positive suggestion, and I think the federal 
government should start bucking the right wing trend that 
currently inspires every criminal code amendment.

<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to what the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he tell us whether there are any other preventive 
measures—in addition to the one that Quebec and another province 
in Canada have found effective—that would prevent those who 
might drive while impaired from paying the extreme penalty 
contained in this bill introduced by the Minister of Justice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think there are two kinds of 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first involves preventive measures.  We must ensure that 
impaired driving is reduced to the absolute minimum in Canada, 
that there are fewer such situations.  Provincial and federal 
legislation is needed.  There could be advertising campaigns so 
that fewer and fewer people drive while impaired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There could be theme campaigns, such as the RIDE program, which 
reduces the number of people who drive during the holiday season 
while impaired.  These are preventive measures which could be 
continued and the member for Jonquière's question makes that 
assumption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another approach, which is not preventive, but which I 
think should be considered. We know that the current provisions 
are not used to the full.  I will give an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The heaviest sentence handed out by the courts for impaired 
driving causing death is 10 years, while the courts, which are 
the best placed to analyse the characteristics of each offender, 
have not exhausted the resources of the criminal code, which now 
sets the maximum sentence for impaired driving causing death at 
14 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is already some play.  Judges are already handing out 
lighter sentences than the criminal code allows for.  This would 
perhaps be one avenue to consider.  Judges would send the message 
to the public that what is in the code is what will now be meted 
out, rather than amending the code when the full extent of what 
is available is not being used right now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the bill before the House today, Bill C-18, is aimed, once again, 
at amending the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A great many changes are made to the criminal code here in this 
House, particularly where impaired driving causing death is 
concerned.  This is, of course, a serious offence.  Hon. members 
will understand that, even if we are strongly opposed to this 
bill, our position is not intended to convey the idea that it is 
a minor event if a person kills another because he or she had 
too much to drink before driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Toward the end of 1999, Pierre Gravel, a respected editorial 
writer for <I>La Presse—</I>there is such a thing as a respected 
editorial writer—wrote as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is often faulted for carrying out systematic 
obstruction in Ottawa, solely for the purpose of demonstrating 
that the federal system is not workable. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am tempted to add “solely for the purpose of demonstrating 
that the federal system refuses to be improved by taking the 
views of the opposition into consideration”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Gravel continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not, however, an accusation that can be made of its 
interaction in the debate on the sanctions to be imposed on 
impaired drivers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is probably the most important point in his editorial: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is, on the contrary, in this connection that its hardline 
attitude has contributed greatly to moderating the excessive 
zeal of the zero tolerance zealots. 
</UL>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those zero tolerance zealots are to my right here in this House, 
although their intolerance has, regrettably, crossed the floor 
of this chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Continuing to quote from Mr. Gravel: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And, at the same time, to take over from any discussion of this 
matter from a reasonable point of view, in which the sanctions 
connected to these offences will not be disproportionate to 
crimes as serious— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These crimes could even be worse, in some instances. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—for which the offenders get much lighter penalties. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 is back in the House today and it is rather disturbing 
to see the impressive silence from the government side, from the 
right wing parties. Could it be that they have nothing left to 
say to refute our arguments? That would already be a sign of 
wisdom, but the greatest wisdom would be to withdraw this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could it be that they are more concerned about an election? One 
of the parties in this House is holding its convention as of 
today and I can understand why its members are not participating 
in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The alliance also has a convention of course, but it is held 
around Quebec's national holiday, so there is still time for 
them. The party opposite held its convention just a few weeks 
ago. So, why are they silent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe they are keeping quiet because they decided that this 
bill would be passed with a very large majority, since it is 
clear that the Bloc Quebecois will be the only party to oppose 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same article, which was written about a year ago, on June 
3, Pierre Gravel added this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when the government, as is 
currently the case, faces an ultraconservative and populist 
opposition such as the Reform Party— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, they were still called the Reform Party. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—which always advocates the harshest possible sentences to 
ensure law and order, there is inevitably a risk of having very 
radical solutions that do not always take into account the whole 
reality. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you are well aware that radicalism and respect 
rarely go together. There are some very recent examples in this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pierre Gravel went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest merit of these measures is to calm a population 
obsessed by a desire for vengeance that is constantly exacerbated 
by a large number of demagogues. When, in addition to that, the 
party in office— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was true one year ago. Members can imagine now. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When, moreover, the party in power feels an urgent need to 
increase its popularity with a group of people who support the 
intractable attitude of the opposition, we end up with an 
unacceptable bill such as the one that earned the absolute and, 
in this case, totally justified opposition of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A year later, Mr. Gravel will be able to take his editorial and 
adapt it to today's reality and see, increasingly, that this 
government is making a name for itself with its opportunism and 
the effect of this will be dealing this way with people, who are 
honest, but who may have made an error in judgement.  Who has 
not? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who can rise and say “I have never and will never make an error 
in judgment”.  This is the way they will treat an honest 
citizen who has made an error in judgment, who has done 
something wrong, namely starting his car and driving off risking 
or possibly causing the death of someone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask a question.  Could anyone of us making 
this error in judgment live serenely after making the mistake of 
driving under the influence of alcohol and causing injury or even 
death?  I know no one here or where I come from or among the 
majority of the population who would say “Oh, that is nothing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not true.  Unlike habitual criminals who are part of a 
culture where crime is part of their daily life, and is in the 
end of no importance, most people facing a criminal charge for 
driving under the influence of alcohol and causing the death are 
people who repent.  Obviously, repenting is the first step 
toward wisdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques talked of the importance of prevention. 
I was young once. I remember that, at the tender age when I was 
fascinated by guys who drove cars, I went for a ride on July 14; 
I met my husband on that same day. I went for a ride with young 
people who were going to celebrate Bastille Day. In 
the early 1960s, Quebec was awakening and wine flowed freely as 
we celebrated France's national day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it was time to go home, I looked at the driver and I said: 
“My God, I will never get into this car”. I thought that my 
life was still worth something. I accepted something that could 
have been worse; I agreed to leave with a nice young man whom I 
had met on the dance floor and who appeared to be serious. I had 
noticed that he had not drunk too much, maybe a glass and a half 
of wine. In fact, he brought me back home safely and, three years 
later, I agreed to become his partner for life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prevention makes people more aware of the risks associated with 
some behaviours. In Quebec, prevention is valued and is now part 
of our life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another bill before this House that has been under 
discussion for a long time and that concerns young offenders. I 
do not need to, once again, go over the statistics from Quebec, 
which are self-explanatory. They show that crimes by young 
offenders is dropping and that prevention and rehabilitation are 
effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason, instead of deciding to send young delinquents 
to prison or to send reckless drivers guilty of injuring or 
killing someone to prison for life, we know that prevention 
works. This method helps make them more responsible people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, this debate should have been an opportunity to have an 
adult and mature discussion between people from all over Canada 
and Quebec on the subject of what it means to be responsible 
citizens. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we should be reflecting on. The House of Commons is 
an extraordinary forum to reflect on the notion of 
responsibility. Many members of the House are parents and have 
done their best to raise their children. I believe not too many 
parents would say “My kids are model and responsible citizens 
who are successful and fulfil all the duties that are entrusted 
to them because I beat them regularly and locked them up in their 
room”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is precisely what the government wants to do with Bill 
C-18. We believe that prevention is the way to go and that we 
must invest some money in schools. 
We know that young people start smoking around the age of 8 or 9 
and that some start drinking at a fairly young age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hence the need for education programs, with people who are 
knowledgeable and able to transmit values. We need education 
programs focussing on parents in order for them to promote a 
whole series of acceptable behaviours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that there is nothing wrong with having a drink with 
friends to mark a happy event or just because it is Friday and 
the weather is nice. On the contrary, I believe it is a sign of 
socialization, and God knows that we need this. However, the 
situation turns sour when one takes one, two or three drinks, 
then up to eight drinks, finally getting to the bottom of the 
bottle. I am obviously referring to wine. If it is scotch, the 
situation is different, because it does not take as much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another real problem I would like to address. I do not 
know if my colleagues have raised it. Among those who drive under 
the influence and cause serious accidents, we find the honest 
citizen implicated in an incident. He did not want it to happen 
and there was no premeditation on his part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another group of citizens comprised of all the 
individuals plagued by a very serious illness which is called 
alcoholism. At one time or another, every one of us has known a 
fine person who, sadly, had a serious alcohol dependency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard enough to get rid of a cold or the flu, but getting 
rid of an alcohol problem is nothing like getting rid of the flu. 
It is an illness of the soul, which caused awful physical 
dependence. We must help those affected, because they need both 
psychological and medical support. 
They must be helped to make their decision because this illness 
can be cured when there is no other choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 says “Here is the solution, we open the door, you go 
in, we close the door and that is that. You will come out feet 
first”. That is how we would treat honest citizens who were 
unlucky, or sick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, and I imagine that the chair of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, who is a reasonable 
man, a sensible man, will back my request that the government 
withdraw Bill C-18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will do nothing to improve the situation 
on highways. It will simply hurt some citizens more without 
lessening the pain of families who lose a loved one. That is 
clear. What is the purpose then? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, as I have said, the purpose is to seek the votes of those 
who, for one reason or another, tend to think that repression 
works and that this is the way to go.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a state has reached the stage of using repression as a 
standard administrative tool, it is not far removed from having 
something in common with a dictatorship.  I trust that Canada is 
very far from being a dictatorship.  I certainly hope so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make it perfectly clear to the members here in 
the House and those watching us at home that behaviour is never 
modified by repression.  Changes are brought about through 
education, prevention, and a serious investment by professionals 
who are capable of helping people in difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to read something that is absolutely fascinating.  I 
have referred to some journalists, but everyone knows that not 
all journalists are serious all the time. Who reads what they 
write?  Fortunately, we are allowed to quote them in the House. 
I am going to read something far more serious than that, an 
excerpt from the recent Gladue decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the context, and when I get to the part I wish to 
emphasize, I will point this out to hon. members. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of inquiries and commissions have been held in this 
country— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country being Canada. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to examine, among other things, the effectiveness of the use 
of incarceration in sentencing. There has been at least one 
commission or inquiry into the use of imprisonment in each decade 
of this century since 1914. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things have changed considerably since 1914.  The means of 
communication have nothing to do with it.  It is not that at all. 
Here is the part I wanted to emphasize: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An examination of the recommendations of these reports reveals 
one constant theme: imprisonment should be avoided [—] 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was true in 1914. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—imprisonment should be avoided if possible and should be 
reserved for the most serious offences, particularly those 
involving violence. They all recommend restraint in the use of 
incarceration— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a quality of the government opposite. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—and recognize that incarceration has failed to reduce the 
crime rate and should be used with caution and moderation. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This too seems to have escaped the members opposite. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imprisonment has failed to satisfy a basic function of the 
Canadian judicial system which was described in the Report of the 
Canadian Committee on Corrections entitled: “Toward Unity: 
Criminal Justice and Corrections” (1969) as “to protect society 
from crime in a manner commanding public support while avoiding 
needless injury to the offender”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If things have come to the point where a citizen who happens to 
commit an error of judgment and kills someone might be treated, 
as he will be if this bill is passed, like the hired killer who 
so neatly put away Dédé Desjardins in Laval ten or so days ago, I 
think that that is not treating society with respect.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before asking a question to my colleague from Laval Centre, I 
would like to congratulate her on her speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Laval-Centre has just brought us back down to 
earth by telling us what a lot of people in Quebec and elsewhere 
in Canada are living every day. She has just reminded us that 
driving a vehicle while impaired is not in and of itself a 
criminal act that should lead to a life sentence or require a 
person to be taken out of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She has just told us that coercion gets us nowhere. It does not 
solve anything and it only postpones the real decisions that will 
have to be made if we really want to solve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her wisdom, what does she think the government, which is so 
disconnected from everyday reality in Canada, should do? What 
should this government do with Bill C-18? How should people 
struggling with this problem be treated within the existing laws 
in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is always nice to be congratulated for a speech. I 
sincerely thank the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, there are two simple ways to deal with the 
problem of impaired driving. The two solutions depend on the 
federal government. I am under the impression that my colleague 
opposite is listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first way to deal with the issue is, of course, to use the 
media to get the message across. The Canadian government has huge 
advertising budgets. I must recognize that occasionally it does 
excellent work with ads for the good of the nation. It is not 
always the case, but when the government is concerned for the 
good  of the nation it is capable of offering constructive and 
interesting ads that will make viewers think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members will appreciate, the most efficient media is, of 
course, television during prime time. But advertising during this 
time slot gets very expensive. What is needed is investment, 
money invested directly in information on TV. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other solution is also money, but money directed to 
provinces. The federal government, and this is no longer even an 
open secret, is amassing surplus after surplus. I do not know how 
it does it, but the government is keeping its head above the 
water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not time, therefore, to restore funding for provincial 
transfer payments for education and health care—in my speech I 
referred to alcoholism as a disease—to their 1994 levels so that 
the provinces, which are well aware of the problem, can have the 
money they need to invest in effective prevention programs 
adapted to their clientele? The results could be worthwhile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I have no doubt that my colleague across will take my 
suggestion to cabinet, and I thank him in advance.

<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are dealing 
today with Bill C-18 which provides for tougher penalties for 
those who made the unfortunate decision to drive while impaired, 
causing death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, every commission that has studied that issue since 1914— 
and there has been one almost every ten years—has demonstrated 
that imprisonment does not deter offenders in such cases. Tougher 
penalties for those who make such a stupid decision, although not 
deliberately—it must be stressed—will not make these people 
think twice about it. Thinking is a good thing, not when we know 
the consequences of an act, but rather when we start thinking 
before making a mistake that might have dire consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Impaired drivers who caused death did not really want to kill 
anyone. What is the difference between two people driving while 
impaired, one who has the bad luck of hitting and killing 
someone, and the luckier one who does not meet anyone on his way 
and does not cause death? Both of them were in the same 
situation; they were out drinking and driving and both could have 
been in an accident. Their behavior could have had the same 
consequences. Yet, one would get punished less harshly than the 
other who had the misfortune of causing death because of his 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we want to accomplish by increasing sentences in such 
cases? Do we want to prevent such acts from happening again, or 
instead, do we not want to get revenge for an event that everyone 
finds deplorable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would we say if, in two separate cases, two people trying 
to kill another one would prepare a potion containing some 
poison, the same quantity in both cases, these quantities being 
known to be sufficient to cause death in most cases? These two 
people would prepare a poisoned potion, would mix it with the 
meal of the person for whom the poison is intended, and would 
wait for the results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if, in one case, the dose is enough to kill the person and, 
in the other one, the same quantity of poison that would normally 
have the same effect would not give the same result, for all 
kinds of reasons. In one case, the victim had probably a normal 
constitution and, in the other one, the victim had a sturdier 
constitution and resisted to the poison. Would the two people who 
committed the same act not deserve the same punishment? Would 
they not deserve the same sentence?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the law requires that we treat them differently. Why? 
Because in one instance the action caused death and, in the 
other, the same action did not result in death; however, the 
result was beyond the control of the two individuals who acted 
exactly in the same way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two individuals both did the same thing with the intent to 
cause death.  In one case, the individual succeeded.  In the 
other, he did not.  The courts will give these two persons 
different sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where I think this bill is not logical.  By increasing 
the sentences, we are not preventing anything.  We are avenging 
the victims of some dreadful action. 
Will such an approach improve the situation?  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best way to bring people to think about what they are doing 
is to apply a reasonable sentence to anyone who does something 
reprehensible.  What is the reprehensible part of  impaired 
driving causing death?  It is not the fact that someone was 
killed because that part was not intended by the individual who 
caused the death.  The reprehensible action is the act of 
getting behind the wheel under the influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When someone decides to drive while impaired, there is a 
decision being made.  Some people will tell me that decision is 
not a clear-sighted decision because the individual is drunk and 
unable to evaluate his condition and his ability to drive a car; 
nevertheless, a decision is made at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need to do, then, is to prevent people from getting 
behind the wheel when they are drunk. What is the best way to do 
that? It is certainly not to evaluate the consequences of driving 
after the fact and say “In one instance, the fault had serious 
consequences but in another one the consequences were less 
serious. We will then impose a penalty according to the 
consequences”. This way of doing things does not improve the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Society is punishing itself by reacting this way because, first, 
sending someone to prison does not increase chances for 
rehabilitation. In both those cases, the chances for 
rehabilitation are just not there. Second, keeping someone in 
prison entails huge administrative costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Keeping a criminal in prison costs about $62,000 a year in 
Canada. What is the point, for society, of sending someone to 
prison for 14 years at $62,000 a year, when that person does not 
need 14 years to realize that what he or she has done was bad? 
The only point is that it gives the satisfaction of revenge 
against someone who caused us prejudice by hurting our feelings, 
our family or our loved ones? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand the resentment of people who experienced such 
tragedies and who may have lost a spouse or a child. In my 
riding, there was the case of a doctor who lost his wife at an 
early age after she was hit by a drunk driver. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, this doctor campaigns in favour of improved legislation 
so these things do not happen again. I understand his sorrow. He 
will bear the scars left by that tragedy for the rest of his 
life. He lost a wife he loved, and the sadness he feels will be 
with him forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But by imposing a life sentence on the person who caused that 
situation, instead of 10 years, for example, will we make the 
sadness that man feels go away? Will we give him back his beloved 
wife? Will his children have their mother back? Not at all. It is 
unfortunate and we must not excuse such actions, but, at the same 
time, we must not respond to an abuse by an abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A society based on vengeance is going nowhere. If there were 
cases where society needed to protect itself, if the person found 
guilty of impaired driving were a repeat offender, if we had 
every reason to believe that that person would not get back on 
the right track and would continue to drink and drive and to 
endanger the life of people, then it would be logical to put that 
person in jail. Society has a duty to protect itself and its 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that what happens in most cases? Bill C-18 does not solve 
that problem. If this bill provided for harsher sentences for 
repeat offenders, it would be easier to understand the intended 
objective, but it is not the case. It could be a first offence, 
but if that offence resulted in death, the person would be put in 
jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine that it is your child. 
Imagine a fine young man or a beautiful girl of 16, 17 or 18 
years of age who, at the end of the school year, after the prom, 
goes out to celebrate the end of their secondary or college 
education. For the first time in his or her life, this young man 
or this young girl has too much of a good thing, hops in a—which 
is probably your car—and, while driving his or her friend 
home, has an accident and kills somebody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it were your children, how would you like them to be 
punished? Do you think these young people deserve life in prison 
for a lack of foresight or experience due to their age? Should we 
ensure that they waste their lives in prison, while depriving 
society of talents that it could have benefited from for 50, 60 
or 70 years?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be much more useful to impose on them a sentence that 
would make them think, that may bring them to dedicate the rest 
of their lives to the promotion of abstinence, to the promotion 
of security measures. This would help to ensure that such events 
do not happen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person in jail is of no help to anybody. If that young boy or 
that beautiful girl were sent to jail for the rest of their 
lives, they would be completely lost to society. 
Would our society find any satisfaction in being able to say: 
“This guy has killed someone, and he should be put behind bars. 
We are glad, we wash our hands, and he will not be seen around 
anymore”? Is this such a great and noble satisfaction that we 
cannot do without it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we try to be objective, we have to admit this kind of crime 
is beyond pardon, but we should also realize that people who 
have been involved in such a terrible experience have to be 
rehabilitated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking about a young man 18, 19, or 20 years old, but he 
could be even 25 or 30. It could also be a good family man, 35 
or 40 years of age, who goes out to celebrate a special 
occasion. It could also be somebody celebrating a wedding 
anniversary or the graduation of one of his children from 
university. 
This father or mother can get carried away, have one drink too 
many, drive and cause someone's death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did this person set out to kill somebody? Absolutely not. He or 
she was taking part in festivities, and when you celebrate, you 
are not out to kill anybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can happen that we behave in such a way that we accidentally 
cause death. But, for the sake of improving the situation, 
should we send a father or mother in prison for the rest of 
their lives? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would be telling them “Sir, we will take you away from your 
wife and kids because you have accidentally killed someone 
through your negligence and wrongful behaviour. 
Because of you, another family has lost their father”. Therefore, 
courts will say, from now on, that in order to repair the harm 
done to a family, it will cause harm to another family. That is 
not justice, but vengeance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A civilized society should not demand an eye for an eye. This 
course of action is a dead end. What we must do instead is 
educate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must educate the people to make them understand that their 
actions have consequences. The consequences can be serious, of 
course, but the act itself is even more serious. It is such acts 
that we must prevent from being committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Campaigns such as Nez Rouge during the Christmas holidays are 
much more useful than putting people behind bars. Because of 
these campaigns, more and more people understand that they must 
not drive their car while impaired. This type of public 
education ensures that society gains more by using this method 
than by crying out for vengeance when such a tragedy occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics show that Canada is second to the United States in 
terms of the incarceration rate. Not a commendable record. I 
hope the government will understand that its bill goes too far 
and that it must be withdrawn immediately.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my colleague from Joliette made some very good points regarding a 
long standing problem, which has existed from time immemorial and 
which every country is facing, namely how to ensure that the 
sentence fits the crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask him to comment on the following statement, which has 
long been considered as the common judicial wisdom of the ages: 
an appropriate sentence is the one beyond which the guilty party 
becomes a victim. It is the one which, should it be any harsher, 
would make the guilty party appear to be a victim in the eyes of 
the public. This is obviously the case if the sentence is too 
harsh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for this 
opportunity to elaborate on what I said earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is quite right. In other words, it is tantamount to abuse of 
powers. In my previous life as a teacher, when students did 
something wrong, we had to punish them of course, but the 
punishment had to fit the seriousness of their action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might tell a student “You broke a window. You are going to 
have to fix it. You are going to pay for it and we are going to 
give you a little extra work to do as punishment” or “Your 
parents are looking after it and you will serve your detention at 
home. You will be grounded for a few hours”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the corrective measure is appropriate and equivalent to the 
seriousness of the action, the child will benefit enormously and 
perhaps never repeat the action.  However, if the measure taken 
against him is twice as harsh as the seriousness of what he did, 
what will the child do?  He will start to revolt, because he will 
feel that he is being punished more severely than his action 
warrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a child is in revolt, what does he try to do?  He feels 
that people are taking revenge for what he did and, in turn, will 
seek revenge as well.  Things then begin to escalate and no one 
can say where it will lead.  The child grows older.  When he 
becomes an adolescent, he thinks the same way.  When he is an 
adult, he thinks the same way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the unfortunate consequences of an action that should 
be punished. It is the action itself and the seriousness of it. 
This is what I tried to show when I gave the example of the two 
people preparing the same quantity of poison for two different 
people. One succeeds and the other does not.  They would be given 
different sentences because one was luckier than the other. Yet, 
the action of each is as serious as the other's, and the intent 
was the same, to kill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in cases where the intent is the same, the law would not 
punish in the same way.  Why would the government do so in Bill 
C-18, when the intention of the person driving while intoxicated 
is never to cause the death of another person? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, there is a greater risk that he will, but that is not 
his intention. Yet, that person would be treated like a criminal 
who walks into a bank or a senior citizens home—there is intent 
here—and shoots people at point-blank range. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a person driving while impaired should kill someone, that 
person would be treated like criminals who kill people 
intentionally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its current form, Bill C-18 is more about seeking vengeance 
to please people who, unfortunately, whose lives were affected 
by such tragedies, either directly or indirectly, in their 
family. 
To show that we sympathize with their plight, that we share 
their grief, we will impose excessive sentences that do not fit 
the circumstances and have nothing to do with the justice that 
should be applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I urge the government to give this serious thought. 
Beyond the votes that the government may win by pleasing people 
who, understandably so, would like to see such a bill become 
law, there is more to consider, namely the interest of society 
in the longer term. Instead of locking up forever people who 
made a mistake and are willing to do something about it by 
playing a positive role in society, we have to consider how we 
can best help these people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak this afternoon following my colleagues from 
Laval Centre and from Joliette, who have both dealt in their 
remarks with the human side of the problem which should be taken 
into consideration before the government has this bill passed by 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will draw the attention of the hon. members and of the 
government to statistics that are relevant to this problem, 
because I feel it is important. Beyond the remarks of my two 
colleagues, it is important to tell the government that 
statistics currently available show that the courts have not 
used the full range of sentences allowed by the criminal code. 
Far from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stiffest prison sentence handed down for impaired driving 
causing death has been ten years. That is the maximum sentence 
imposed on offenders these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judges, who are in the best position to consider the specifics 
of each offender, have not been using the whole range of 
sentences allowed by the criminal code. The criminal code 
already sets at 14 years the maximum sentence for impaired 
driving causing death. The ratio of offenders sent to prison 
after a conviction for impaired driving has dropped from 22% in 
1994-95 to 19% in 1997-98. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prison sentences brought down in these cases are for the 
most part less than two years.  Hon. members heard correctly. The 
courts could sentence offenders to 14 years, but sentences are 
currently less than two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why then pass legislation to allow life sentences if the courts 
are not inclined to make full use of the tools available to them 
already? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to cite other statistics.  The offence of 
impaired driving causing death is not on the increase at the 
present time. In 1998, 103 people were charged with impaired 
driving causing death, the lowest figure for this offence since 
1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to what is stated in this bill, there are some 
preventive programs that have already had an effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has become a champion as far as imprisonment is 
concerned.  When something is going wrong, instead of looking 
into the problem, let's throw them in jail.  Good riddance, we 
don't have to deal with the problem any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To echo the words of my colleague for Laval Centre, take the 
person, put him in a box and lock him up, that is all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This runs counter to what the supreme court justices concluded 
in <I>Gladue</I>, where they faulted the federal legislator for being 
too quick to imprison delinquents.  These are not my words. It is 
what two honourable justices of the supreme court said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read a few excerpts from the decision in <I>Gladue</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a world leader in many fields, particularly in the 
areas of progressive social policy and human rights. 
Unfortunately, our country is also distinguished as being a world 
leader in putting people in prison. Although the United States 
has by far the highest rate of incarceration among industrialized 
democracies, at over 600 inmates per 100,000 population, Canada's 
rate of approximately 130 inmates per 100,000 population places 
it second or third highest. Moreover, the rate at which Canadian 
courts have been imprisoning offenders has risen sharply in 
recent years, although there has been a slight decline of late. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that everybody in this House knows it, but many choose 
to ignore the day-to-day realities of our society. Since being 
elected as the member for Jonquière, I have noticed that, in its 
ivory tower, this government unilaterally adopts bills that are 
totally out of touch with the realities faced by the people when 
it comes to taking action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is listening closely to the Canadian extreme 
right, which believes that the solution to any and every problem 
in Canada is the law of retaliation. These people believe that 
we should condemn first and then say “The longer you will stay 
in jail, the better it will be for you and for society”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not true. This is not the way Quebecers think. This is not 
what we think. I find that the Quebec society is ahead of its 
time in many areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prevention is required. What could be more beneficial to find 
solutions, to find an ideal way out and solve problems in 
society, than prevention programs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is ignoring the prevention means we are 
advocating to help people. I am not saying that driving a vehicle 
while impaired is not serious, especially when lives are lost. 
That is not what I am saying. I am saying that, right now, we 
should establish prevention and education programs. We must start 
educating our children when they are young. In Quebec, we have 
very good prevention campaigns, aimed at society as a whole, 
which that drinking and driving is a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is certainly true, but we must also consider the fact that 
nobody can say it will never happen to them. Everybody has 
surely had a drink or two when they were extremely tired and 
then got behind the wheel. An accident could happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such people are not criminals. I do not think that they are 
criminals. If something happens, it is just an accident. The 
notion of accident will have to be considered. 
In Quebec, we consider alcoholism a disease. We will have to 
invest a lot of money in research so people have places to go to 
be treated for alcoholism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques said earlier, there is an ignition interlock system with 
a breathalizer available in Canada, particularly in Quebec and 
in Alberta. The criminal code should be amended to allow judges 
to order an offender to have such a system installed on his or 
her vehicle as a condition of parole or in exchange for a 
reduction of the driving prohibition period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see in the document that was given to me by my colleague 
that this system has been proven effective. 
Why not require all car manufacturers to install such a system 
on all vehicles? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also give tax breaks to those who have such a system 
installed on their vehicle. It would be a way to reduce the 
number of people who drink and drive.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Joliette said, during the holiday season, 
in Quebec, we have Operation Nez Rouge. I do not know if there 
is such a thing in the other provinces of Canada, but Nez Rouge 
is an organization that tells people “You want to celebrate 
during the holiday season; leave your keys and your car where 
you are, dial this telephone number and someone will come and 
pick you up and drive you home.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of that, in Quebec, since Nez Rouge has been in 
operation, the number of people driving while impaired has 
significantly decreased during the holiday season. The success 
rate is extraordinary and I would like to say, incidentally, 
that this not for profit organization is manned by volunteers 
who provide the service. That is another way of saying that we 
have to deal with alcoholism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not through legislation imposing life imprisonment that we 
will deal with the problem. This is not the way to make people 
more responsible. I am not talking about people who have 
repeatedly driven while impaired, who have no social conscience 
and get behind the wheel even though they know they are not 
allowed to drive. I am talking about individuals who are doing 
it once in their life and whose families and fellow workers will 
be branded for the rest of their life. That is not the way we 
should act in Canada; that is not the way the government should 
act to improve the situation and make society more responsible 
with regard to this scourge, which is less prevalent in our 
society, according to the statistics I mentioned earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Minister of Justice to withdraw her bill.  It is not 
constructive, it is repressive.  I want to warn her and tell her 
that she is on the wrong track with the young offenders bill. It 
takes the same approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that right now this government 
is assuming that the people of this country are second-class 
citizens, that they lack judgement, that they are not aware and 
that they are not able to improve.  That is unacceptable.  The 
federal government has only one speed when it comes to criminal 
justice:  overdrive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill goes too far.  In both the young offenders bill and 
the impaired driving bill, the Minister of Justice reveals her 
inability to manage complex problems without resorting to 
dangerously repressive measures. There is no justification for 
this attitude, because crime, I repeat, has been on the decrease 
in Canada for several years now.  Furthermore, there are no 
studies showing that such an approach is effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must guard against inflated sentencing, which bears a 
dangerous resemblance to an eye for an eye and a tooth for a 
tooth.  Nobody will win in this mad race except the jailers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But law and order politics are very popular politically, as the 
Minister of Justice is well aware.  As for justice, and more 
specifically youth crime, there is also opposition to this bill 
because of the simplistic measures proposed by the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that this government will have to stop and think, that 
it will have to get back in touch with what people really 
experience every day, if our society is to improve and not be 
undermined by bills such as this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is still time for the Minister of Justice to withdraw her 
bill and I and my fellow members of the Bloc Quebecois urge her 
to do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
agreed to speak on Bill C-18 concerning the amendment to the 
criminal code, because it was impossible for me to remain silent 
in face of a somewhat hateful bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some reason that is totally unknown to me and that seems 
totally unfounded and nonsensical, the Minister of Justice 
strikes again, with a bill in which she wants to amend the 
criminal code to provide a maximum sentence of life imprisonment 
for an impaired driver involved in an accident causing the death 
of another person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill also wants to provide for the taking of blood samples 
for the purpose of testing for the presence of drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In looking at the nature of the debate we are having today, 
where only the Bloc Quebecois feels the need to speak out and to 
alert the people against this hateful bill, I realize once again 
that Quebec is a distinct society. If we were still looking for 
reasons to leave Canada, we just found a new one. Canada and 
Quebec are not on the same wavelength on such an important bill 
for society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly do not want to underestimate the importance of an 
accident involving an impaired driver who causes the death of 
another person. 
A death, no matter the circumstances, is always sad and painful, 
but when it is caused by an impaired driver, the loss seems even 
more terrible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, we do not want to diminish the gravity of the offence, but I 
want to pause to reflect on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Prime Minister introduced in the House his famous 
notion of a distinct society for Quebec—and he still blames us 
for voting against it—he was told “Mr. Prime Minister, what you 
are proposing is an empty shell”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is a distinct society, but it can never express its 
distinctiveness. It is not allowed to be distinct. There is a 
move toward increasingly centralized policies, toward wall to 
wall policies. Provincial jurisdiction is increasingly being 
encroached upon. In spite of all that, Quebec feels more and more 
distinct. The more we learn of the values of Canadian society, 
the more concerned we are about the future of Quebec's society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not wish to make an issue of this, but let me point out 
that the Minister is, first and foremost, a member from western 
Canada. In western Canada, the Liberal Party has a fierce 
opponent. It used to be called the Reform Party. It is now called 
the Canadian Alliance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, we in the Bloc Quebecois have seen how the Liberal 
government, which used to be a progressive government—not as in 
Progressive Conservative, but progressive in the real meaning of 
the word—which went ahead with forward-looking policies became 
backward-looking. It is turned more toward the 19th century, 
while we are steaming full speed ahead into the 21st century with 
all the tools the new technology has to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is asking the wrong questions. Let us try to 
find out which ones. What do Quebec and Canadian societies want? 
They want their politicians to give them laws that will ensure 
the betterment of society, and not laws that will make life in 
society increasingly difficult and stifling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened so far? We have the criminal code. Currently, 
when an individual drives a vehicle while impaired, and 
unfortunately causes an accident which results in a fatality, the 
criminal code provides that the judge may sentence this 
individual to 14 years in prison. To this day, no judge has ever 
sentenced anyone to more than 10 years. And it was such an 
accomplishment it made the headlines across the country, pointing 
out that, at long last, a judge had dared give 10 years for 
impaired driving causing death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why, when nothing more than a 10 year sentence has ever been 
imposed, suddenly come up with a measure expected to be more 
effective because it provides for life imprisonment? What does 
society want? What values underlie this specific measure? Is our 
role as politicians to find a way to avenge what happened to 
someone else in society? Must we only advocate a punitive, 
coercive approach? Is this really the reason why we exist as a 
parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Or do we not, on the contrary, want to educate our fellow 
citizens by teaching them a value such as moderation? Quebec's 
liquor board, the Société des alcools, sponsored a campaign to 
encourage people to drink with moderation. The campaign's theme 
“La modération a bien meilleur goût” was displayed everywhere, 
along highways, in newspapers and magazines and on the television 
and radio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While alcohol sales and profits did not go down, Quebecers' 
behaviour changed. Now, when you entertain guests at home, it is 
not rare to hear someone say “I will only have juice or Perrier 
water, because I am the designated driver”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Countries such as Sweden introduced educational and progressive 
measures to improve the situation. But here we want to punish 
people, we seek vengeance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That approach will not work, as evidenced by the research done. 
All the criminologists in the world will tell you that putting 
people in prison is not the solution. On the contrary, we should 
find ways and pass legislation that will help us create public 
awareness, and invest money in educational programs and 
initiatives designed to make people more responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does Operation Nez Rouge do in Quebec? It is a huge success. 
That initiative is now beginning to spread to Ontario and the 
maritime provinces. What does Operation Nez Rouge do? It tells 
people “Do not forget, it is important to celebrate, but if you 
drink, do not drive; we will drive you home for free”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can pass legislation to influence the public for the better. 
The goal of members of parliament should not be to use public 
funds to build more prisons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Minister of Justice doing now with her criminal code 
reform? She must be on the verge of sending kindergarten kids to 
prison. She is not pleased to see that our own reform in Quebec 
is successful with young offenders. She wants to undermine our 
efforts. It is just one more reason to get out of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 will lead us nowhere. 
If this bill is passed in its original form, we will negate the 
specific nature of this offence and create a serious imbalance 
in our criminal justice system. The most important question we 
should ask about this reform of the criminal code is whether we 
really want what is best for the offender who has a bad habit of 
drinking and driving, or if we want to fight the political right 
on its own turf and win more votes in the next election by 
promoting harsh punishments that are out of proportion with the 
offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let nobody be mistaken. I do think impaired driving is a serious 
offence. It is an action that cannot be rationalized. We have a 
hard time accepting it, but we should be helping people get rid 
of that bad habit instead of punishing them and locking them up 
for the rest of their life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me of the answer the solicitor general gave me this 
afternoon during question period when I asked how the public 
could understand what was going on. I said “Thanks to the parole 
program, about one hundred Rock Machine members will soon be 
released from prison. How can we possibly allow crime gang 
members to benefit from a reintegration measure such as parole, 
when we are well aware that as soon as they get out of prison 
they will go to war against another crime gang?”  The minister 
stood up and replied that I should not worry, that everything is 
under control, saying “My hon. colleague is well aware that 
whenever anybody receives parole, it is granted through the 
National Parole Board. This is an arm's length body that reviews 
all the information and public safety is always the number one 
issue”.  All is well; if they are out it is because they are not 
dangerous. Those are the regulations and we respect regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, everyone knows that any member of a crime gang who gets 
out of prison will be a worse offender than before, because a 
prison is no place for rehabilitation, and he will be very happy 
to resume his position within the gang and wage war against other 
gangs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they talk about life imprisonment for people who are in a 
car accident, we have to wonder why.  I am no expert on the 
criminal code or criminal law, but I know there are two things in 
the code.  There are people sentenced to 25 years imprisonment 
without eligibility for parole and there are people sentenced to 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be a difference. 
I hope somebody will explain the difference to me someday so I 
can understand, but I have been told that there is a difference 
between the two and that, in this case, someone who is sentenced 
to life imprisonment could, depending on the conditions set by 
the judge, serve only a few years because he would be eligible to 
parole after serving a third of his sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder why we go to so much trouble to pass such hypocritical 
bills. Although judges can now sentence people to 14 years, they 
usually sentence them to two, three or four years. There is one 
exception, a 10 year sentence.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also one thing one must not forget. The crime rate is 
dropping in Canada, as statistics show clearly. The proportion of 
individuals who were incarcerated after being convicted of 
impaired driving decreased in 1994-95 and 1997-98. Thus, 
within three years, the proportion of incriminated individuals 
went from 22% to 19%. Most prison terms in these cases are less 
than two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why legislate to allow life imprisonment, if the courts are not 
willing to fully use the instruments they already have? 
Although impaired driving causing death is an offence of 
considerable importance, it is wrong to claim that we are 
currently faced with a huge upturn in its figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, only 103 people in Canada were charged with impaired 
driving causing death.  Hon. members will respond that this is 
103 people too many, which it is, but putting those 103 in prison 
for 25 years is not the way to help the 100 more who will come 
along the following year and be found guilty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Educational measures must be found so that society can be 
changed rather than punished, so that there is education rather 
than revenge.  Canada has become a champion as far as putting 
people in jail is concerned, just behind the United States. This 
is hardly a record of which to be proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the incarceration rate is concerned, we rank second 
in the entire world.  I think our Prime Minister 
would be delighted if he were able to say we were 180th.  For 
once, being last would be a good thing.  Instead of being first, 
we are second, with no one higher than us but the Americans. It 
is a shame.  Canada uses imprisonment twice as often as most 
European countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, the supreme court was very clear, and I 
quote an excerpt from the judgment in G<I>ladue</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a world leader in many fields, particularly in the 
areas of progressive social policy and human rights 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I myself pointed this out at the start of my remarks.  I 
continue quoting: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, our country is also distinguished as being a 
world leader in putting people in prison. Although the United 
States has by far the highest rate of incarceration among 
industrialized democracies, at over 600 inmates per 100,000 
population, Canada's rate of approximately 130 inmates per 
100,000 population places it second or third highest.  Moreover, 
the rate at which Canadian courts have been imprisoning 
offenders has risen sharply in recent years, although there has 
been a slight decline of late. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the measures that the Minister of Justice has proposed since 
she assumed this position are such that we are looking at 
increasing numbers of incarcerations. 
Is it the aim of the Prime Minister to surpass the United States 
in numbers of prisoners?  It would be interesting to have him 
tell us in the next election that his aim is to put as many 
Canadians as possible behind bars and, if possible, not too many 
Liberals, because he wants to win his election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had prepared a much longer speech on this bill, which I find 
extremely painful and difficult to understand and which will 
long be hard to swallow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have an election campaign in which we will remind the 
people that this government is hateful and insensitive, right of 
centre and bringing us more violence than what we have at the 
moment, because its model seems to be the American society.  In 
matters of values, Quebec is apart.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
are enjoying the debate this afternoon on a subject that most 
Canadians regard as a top drawer issue; the way we deal with the 
criminal code offence of drinking and driving and causing death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member accept that the bill is not about 
incarcerating more people?  Rather, it is about articulating for 
Canadians that the offence we are dealing with, which it is so 
frequent now, killing as a result of drunk driving, has increased 
to the point where it is overshadowing all other serious 
offences.  Canadians want that type of killing offence numbered 
among the most not just serious offences in the criminal code but 
the most serious among the offences involving the taking of life, 
whether wilful or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this particular piece of legislation does is it moves up 
the range of sentencing.  It does not increase the bottom range 
but it does increase the top range.  By increasing the range, we 
effectively signal to the courts and the public that we regard 
this as among the most serious offences.  That is the reason for 
the bill.  It is not for the purpose of throwing more alcohol 
addicted drivers into prison.  Would the hon. member accept that 
as the purpose of the bill? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I sincerely wonder why my 
colleague does not consult the same statistics that we are being 
provided with. We do make these figures up. Why does he not go to 
the sources, the official sources which prove without a doubt 
that everything he has just said is far removed from reality? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that area, the crime rate is going down. It is not rising, it 
is decreasing. When I say that this government wants to 
incarcerate more people, it means that from the moment an 
individual is sentenced to life imprisonment, he will have to 
serve at least 25 years behind bars unless the judge takes into 
consideration other circumstances or unless the individual 
benefits from conditional release after a certain time, perhaps 
10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, the average length of imprisonment is about two years 
and even less. 
We all know that individuals sentenced to two years plus one day 
are sent to a federal rather than a provincial institution. We 
know very well what the results are at the end of the day. 
Individuals come out of federal prisons worst than before their 
incarceration because the federal government does not focus on 
rehabilitation or re-education, but on punishment and revenge. 
Those are not the values which guide Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been trying as hard as possible to rehabilitate people 
who have committed crimes, even young offenders. Our level of 
success is staggering. Some people who were involved in 
well-known situations, for example the FLQ, were able to study 
in prison and they became university professors. Today, they are 
unknown to anyone who has not seen their snapshots at the time 
of the FLQ crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want this kind of prison system. For us, Quebecers, 
Canada may be turning into a jail. Most of all, we do not want 
more Quebecers incarcerated by the federal government than we 
have now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton—Victoria—Brock, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I served some time on the Ontario parole board. I 
remember holding a parole hearing for a person who was an 
habitual drunk driver.  He did not own a car and did not have a 
licence.  Each time he was incarcerated, his time was served in 
the two years less a day housing at a provincial institution. The 
last time he was incarcerated, at which I did the parole hearing, 
there was no way he was getting out on parole.  He served his 
full two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After he had served his time, he refused rehabilitation and 
refused to deal with the fact that alcohol was the leading factor 
for his problems.  At that time I felt that he was a person in 
need of counselling, if not provincially then federally.  I felt 
that he needed more time in the prison system.  This was an 
individual who had never had a a licence, never owned a car, had 
seven impaired driving charges and he had no rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what we would do with a person like that other 
than to have longer incarceration periods so that public safety 
is taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all good conscience, what would the member tell the families 
of the two people that man killed in his last accident?  Would 
she tell them that longer incarceration was not necessary? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, there is no 
justice in this world. We know that from the day we are born. It 
is not by avenging the unfortunate death of these people that we 
will solve that person's problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what the member told us, the person in question had several 
problems: no driver's licence, no car, a drinking habit and he 
killed two people while driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who lent him a car when he had no driver's licence? That person 
is the one who should be sent to prison. That person is the one 
responsible. He either borrowed or rented a car from someone. 
Where did he find a car if he did not own one and had no driver's 
licence? It is a serious mistake to lend a vehicle to someone who 
does not have a driver's licence and who has been drinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bar owners see people who are already drunk continue drinking 
beer or scotch. All they can think of is the money they are 
making, not their responsibility in letting someone who is dead 
drunk get behind the wheel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should look at all the responsibilities. If that man was 
drunk and was able to steal a car, it may be that he had easy 
access to a vehicle that was running or unlocked. We should look 
at the whole, big picture before convicting an innocent man, even 
though what he did is unfortunate and two people suffered the 
consequences of his action. I agree that his two victims are two 
too many, but it is not by putting that man in jail for 25 years 
that we will rehabilitate him and help him get rid of his 
drinking problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like my 
colleague to comment on the following situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, the courts have the power to give sentences of up to 
14 years, yet no court has ever sentenced anybody to more than 
10 years for such an offence. Therefore, they still have 4 years 
to play with. Since the Criminal Code was amended to increase to 
14 years the maximum sentence for this type of offence, no judge 
has ever found the offence serious enough to impose the full 14 
year sentence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the mere fact of telling judges they can give a life 
sentence change anything? Up to now, they could impose sentences 
of up to 14 years, but they never did. What will Canadians think 
if we tell them that judges have the power to hand out life 
sentences but never use it? They will say there is even less 
justice than there was before, because the full life sentence is 
never imposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the bill not make our legal system even less credible? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
an excellent question. I regret not having enough time to give 
an answer more befitting the value of the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and the Minister of Justice should first and 
foremost think about the quality of the people appointed as 
judges and make sure they are competent. Once appointed, the 
judges should undergo refresher training every year to keep up 
to date in their way of thinking, be aware of the psychological 
conditions of life, reflect on the new situations in which 
families are living and gain a better understanding of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are judges who have been on the bench for 30 years and 
never stopped even for a moment to think about what they are 
doing and why they are doing it. It is not even clear whether 
they know the criminal code well enough to realize that they can 
give 14 year sentences. Refresher courses should be developed 
for judges and competitions held to make sure competent judges 
are appointed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-18.  As was clear from the excellent 
speeches given by my colleagues, the Bloc Quebecois is opposed 
to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel, however, that impaired driving causing death is a very 
serious offence.  Nonetheless, there are solutions other than 
revenge and punishment.  In the supposedly most wonderful 
country in the world, a democratic country, Bill C-18 boils down 
to a system of fear.  As my colleagues pointed out, the existing 
laws allow the courts to hand down adequate sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Bloc Quebecois explained, this bill is not the solution. 
Passing Bill C—18 would be to ignore the very characteristics of 
this offence and create a significant imbalance in our criminal 
justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not allow the courts to fully avail themselves of the leeway 
they now have under the criminal code? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one of my colleagues so eloquently said earlier, 10 years 
is the maximum sentence which has generally been handed down by 
the courts.  The maximum has been 10 years, when 14 was 
available.  This 10 year sentence has been imposed by the courts 
for impaired driving causing death.  Who is better placed than 
the courts to determine what sentence is appropriate?  We are 
questioning the competence of the courts by forcing them to hand 
down a stiffer sentence, a life sentence, when they had the 
opportunity to hand down a longer sentence and did not do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the courts and the existing legislation, impaired 
driving causing death has dropped from 22% in 1994-95 to 19% in 
1997-98.  It is incorrect to claim that we are now facing a sharp 
increase in this sort of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Supreme court justices Cory and Iacobucci were recently critical 
of the fact that Canada has become a champion of incarceration, 
and decried the overeagerness of federal lawmakers to embrace 
imprisonment as a solution to the problems of delinquency.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In calling for life imprisonment for people convicted of 
impaired driving causing death, the minister is ignoring the 
comments made by her own supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that prevention is the real solution. Imprisonment 
must be a solution of last resort with respect to crime. In 
fact, the justice minister has not shown that she has exhausted 
all means at her disposal to address the problem of impaired 
driving and protect the people. She has chosen the easy way out: 
to increase prison sentences. 
She has adopted least effort approach of the Canadian Alliance, 
but she could have acted otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are efficient tools other that incarceration to reduce the 
number of offences linked to impaired driving. In fact, in the 
last two years, in Quebec, we have seen a decrease of such 
offences because of the prevention campaign saying “Drinking and 
Driving is no Accident” and “If you drink, don't drive”. I think 
this campaign was successful, as evidenced by present results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ignition interlock system with breathalyser is a system with 
which Quebec and Alberta are presently experimenting. It is a 
system that can determine the concentration of alcohol in the 
blood by analyzing only a sample of the driver's breath and 
prevent ignition of the vehicle if the alcohol concentration is 
higher than a predetermined level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alberta and Quebec are currently the only provinces that impose 
ignition interlock systems as a condition for giving a 
conditional licence to drivers who have had their licence 
suspended by the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treating an impaired driver who caused death the same way as a 
hired killer who committed a premeditated aggravated crime, who 
prepared his crime, would be using a double standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should a friend, a relative who partied too hard and, through his 
negligence, caused a fatal accident, be treated as harshly as a 
killer who committed a premeditated and aggravated crime? Past 
experience says no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is impossible to treat this type of driver like a confirmed 
criminal. Should we treat him like a member of an organized 
crime group? I do not believe so. Certainly, both individuals 
have done something very wrong, yet their profiles are quite 
different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should an ordinary citizen who drank too much at a 
party, but is a good family man who was never involved with the 
justice system, be imprisoned for life? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister justify that an offender who killed in cold 
blood and in full control of his faculties be sentenced to a 
shorter prison term than a driver whose faculties were impaired 
by alcohol? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government knows only one thing when it comes to 
criminal justice: excess. The law and order policy is very 
profitable, politically, and the Minister of Justice knows this 
very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether on the issue of young offenders or on the issue of 
impaired drivers, the Minister of Justice has shown her 
inability to manage complex problems without having to resort to 
dangerously repressive measures.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are examining what seems today to be the most important issue 
in criminal law, the tendency of the legislator to misinterpret 
the public's state of mind and the belief that punitive 
legislation will satisfy those advocating dissuasion as the 
cornerstone of the criminal justice system as it applies to 
adolescents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Bloc Quebecois will vote against Bill C-18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not lose our sense of direction.  In 1998, there were no 
more road deaths and injuries, serious or light, in Quebec than 
there were criminal acts.  The statistics bear witness:  there 
were 47,000 criminal acts committed in Quebec in 1998, compared 
with 39,000 road accidents. 
On the 39,000 unfortunate accidents on the roads, the experts do 
not agree.  The figures cited vary between 5% and 50%, making 
these statistics useless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the worst case scenario, road accidents still represent fewer 
than half the crimes.  They say that there are 50% fewer crimes 
than there are accidents involving alcohol on the roads, and the 
government is proposing a bill to punish and to take vengeance 
out on the drunk drivers, ignoring the real criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can be said for sure, however, is that a road accident, 
even one caused by alcohol, is not the result of a conscious 
desire to do harm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has often been criticized for systematically 
causing obstruction in Ottawa, simply to show that the federal 
system does not function. 
This criticism will not apply this time around, for its stand on 
sentences for impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite the contrary. In this case, its firm position has helped 
curb the excessive zeal of those who promote zero tolerance. By 
the same token, it has helped set the whole debate in a more 
reasonable context where sentences for these offences will not 
be out of proportion, compared with crimes that are just as 
serious, but entail shorter sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a new problem for federal authorities. Year after 
year, they watch as the number of accidents caused by impaired 
driving reaches an alarming level. In 1997 alone, there have 
been in Canada no less than 193 fatal accidents caused by 
impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such statistics should have warned any responsible government 
that it had to examine how relevant its preventive and 
repressive measures and not vengeful measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was precisely the mandate of a House of Commons justice 
committee, which has been reviewing for the last few months all 
the legislation that could have an impact on this issue, in 
order to make recommendations to the minister before the 
introduction of a bill amending current legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when the government is facing, as is the case right now, an 
ultraconservative and populist opposition like the Reform Party, 
which keeps demanding stiffer sentences to impose law and order 
everywhere, we run the risk of getting extreme solutions that do 
not always take the whole picture into account. 
Their main advantage is that they tend to placate a frustrated 
population whose thirst for vengeance is constantly played on by 
many demagogues.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>SPECIES AT RISK ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK209">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (for the Minister of the Environment)</B> moved 
that Bill C-33, an act respecting the protection of wildlife 
species at risk in Canada, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the 
Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a real honour for me 
to rise today to speak in favour of the species at risk act, the 
first specific piece of federal legislation in Canada to ensure 
protection for all species of birds, fish, mammals, plants and 
insects at risk. This bill, an important part of a balanced and 
comprehensive package, will ensure that species and their 
habitats get the protection they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our top priority in drafting this legislation was to consider 
the needs of Canada's species.  Home to a rich diversity of 
plants and animals, Canada has over 70,000 known plant and animal 
species, many of which are only found in this country. Given the 
vast size of our land and the unique wildlife within our borders, 
the government believes that we have a moral responsibility to 
present and future generations to make sure that our precious 
diversity is protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Globally we are losing species at an alarming rate due to human 
activity.  In Canada today we have at least 352 species 
classified as being at risk.  We must all work to turn this 
around to ensure that species will not become extinct or 
endangered in Canada because of our human activities. With this 
bill we are choosing an approach which is already working on the 
ground where it means the most and where Canadians are already 
hard at work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-33 has been seven years in the making.  In 1992 Canada 
signed the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity.  In 
fact Canada was one of the first countries to ratify the 
convention, as was already mentioned in question period today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 governments across Canada supported the accord for the 
protection of species at risk and agreed to bring in species 
protection legislation in their own jurisdictions.  Many 
provinces and territories have already fulfilled this obligation 
and commitment.  Now it is time for the federal government to 
step up to the plate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protecting wildlife in Canada is not an academic exercise.  This 
bill will protect species currently endangered and it will 
prevent other species from becoming endangered.  The approach 
taken in this bill is balanced and practical.  It recognizes that 
we must all work together if we are going to maximize our 
successes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Introducing a Canada-wide comprehensive species at risk act was 
challenging.  It required listening to many voices.  The 
Government of Canada engaged in a thorough process of study, 
consultation and planning.  It involved environmental groups, 
landowners, aboriginal peoples, other levels of government and 
thousands of individual citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have examined and benefited from the experiences of other 
jurisdictions, other provinces and other nations.  We have taken 
what works and avoided what does not.  The result for forests 
today is a strong bill, a bill which balances many important but 
sometimes conflicting interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The species at risk act before us is an effective bill which, 
when passed, will ensure the job gets done.  Bill C-33 will help 
save species and protect their habitats on all lands in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quickly outline what is contained in the bill, the species at 
risk act provides for independent scientific assessments of 
wildlife species by the Committee on the Status of Endangered 
Wildlife in Canada, COSEWIC; an accountable listing process for 
species based on that scientific assessment; and a comprehensive 
process for planning and implementing species recovery. 
The bill also provides for strong prohibitions against the 
killing or harming of any species at risk and its residence, and 
the power to protect species' critical habitat on all lands, 
public and private, in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the act the assessment of wildlife species will be the 
responsibility of COSEWIC, the Committee on the Status of 
Endangered Wildlife in Canada.  COSEWIC is an independent body of 
scientists and other experts.  It will continue to operate at 
arm's length from the federal and provincial governments.   For 
the first time, however, COSEWIC is given legal status and will 
be given the budget to continue its work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>COSEWIC will assess whether a species is threatened or 
endangered and that COSEWIC assessment and the reasons behind it 
will be made public.  All Canadians will have access to that 
information.  There is nothing politicized about the assessment 
process.  When COSEWIC independently determines that a species is 
threatened or endangered, that decision is automatically 
reported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>COSEWIC's scientific assessment will be the basis for the 
government's list of wildlife species in Canada established under 
SARA, the species at risk act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once a species has been added to the legal list, prohibitions on 
the killing of individuals of a species designated as threatened 
or endangered immediately come into force, as does protection for 
the residences of individuals of the species.  A comprehensive 
process for recovery planning is initiated. The use of land that 
is part of a species habitat may be affected and a wide variety 
of other economic, legal and social consequences may come into 
play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Decisions taken under the act can have serious economic, social 
and legal consequences for many Canadians.  It is essential that 
there be political accountability for these decisions. That is 
why this act gives cabinet the legal responsibility to establish 
and amend the legal list of wildlife species at risk in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill recognizes that the destruction or the degradation of 
habitats is the main threat to these species. In the last 200 
years, we have completely transformed the environment. Wildlife 
habitats were not spared, be they wetlands, forests, lakes, 
rivers or prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Habitat lost threatens more than 75% of the species now 
classified as being at risk. Obviously, if we want to protect 
these species, we have to protect their habitat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill on species at risk provides for the necessary 
authority to prevent the destruction of these habitats. It 
provides for the necessary authority to prevent the destruction 
of habitats critical for the survival of species at risk across 
Canada. This bill allows us to take emergency measures rapidly. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a species is listed as threatened or endangered, the 
recovery planning process will identify what needs to be done to 
recover that species, including the identification of that 
species' critical habitat needs.  As I mentioned earlier, this 
act provides the Government of Canada the legal authority to 
ensure that all critical habitat areas are protected whether it 
be federal, provincial or private land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our first line of defence will be to protect habitat by 
encouraging landowners to undertake voluntary conservation 
measures often in co-operation with other governments.  The 
Government of Canada will provide incentives to promote habitat 
conservation because we know this approach works on the ground to 
effectively protect species.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last federal budget this government committed $180 
million over five years to implement our strategy to protect 
species at risk.  A sizeable portion of this money will fund 
habitat stewardship measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases the habitat important for species at risk will be 
in a province or territory, and we respect their authority.  We 
expect these governments to bring in habitat protection measures. 
This bill will complement existing or improve provincial and 
territorial legislation, not compete with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Make no mistake, where voluntary measures do not work, other 
governments are unwilling or unable to act, the federal safety 
net will be invoked.  If a province does not have complementary 
legislation the Government of Canada will act to protect Canada's 
heritage, to protect our species on provincial and private lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the federal safety net is used to protect critical habitat 
on private land there will be provisions to compensate for 
unexpected losses caused by unforeseen restrictions on the normal 
use of that land.  The compensation provisions, however, will not 
create perverse incentives to inhibit voluntary habitat 
protection measures in hopes of receiving future compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all a question of balance.  To find this balance the 
Minister of the Environment has asked a distinguished Canadian 
expert on conservation issues, Dr. Peter Pearse, Professor 
Emeritus of Resource Economics at the University of British 
Columbia, to review the issues and to provide him with advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people would say that this bill is an infringement on 
property rights.  They are misguided.  Their criticisms are based 
on horror stories about the very different experience of the 
United States endangered species act.  The Canadian species at 
risk act is fundamentally different.  While it certainly gives 
the government the power to protect species on private lands, we 
have gone a long way toward meeting the concerns of land owners 
and land users. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps what is most important about the bill is that it must be 
used and accepted by the people on the land who make decisions 
affecting wildlife every day.  The bill recognizes that while we 
need strong measures for those who would break the law, we need a 
co-operative approach on the front lines.  This in fact is what 
will protect our species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this legislation to be effective all affected stakeholders 
must be engaged.  Reality and experience dictate that to get the 
job done we need land owners, conservation groups and other 
levels of government working together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal communities in Canada are especially important in the 
effort to protect species at risk.  Many threatened or endangered 
species are found on aboriginal lands.  Aboriginal people will be 
involved in the species at risk act recovery efforts at every 
step.  The assessment and recovery processes will incorporate the 
wisdom of aboriginal traditional knowledge as well as local 
community knowledge.  We will work closely with and respect the 
role of wildlife management boards established under land claims 
and first nations agreements to ensure the protection of species 
on traditional native lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from experience that all governments and stakeholders 
working together can help species recover.  Already we have made 
progress on the swift fox, the white pelican and the peregrine 
falcon.  We have learned from these successful efforts and now we 
must focus our efforts on saving species still in danger, such as 
the beluga whale, the Vancouver Island marmot—the minister's 
particular favourite—the burrowing owl and the leatherback 
turtle.  To prevent other species from being added to that list, 
as a government, as citizens and as stewards our goal must be to 
protect species on the ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new species at risk act is part of a comprehensive approach 
to accomplish this goal.  Combined with the accord signed with 
the provinces and territories, and extensive stewardship 
activities already under way, we are confident that species and 
their habitats will be protected in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite all hon. members and all Canadians to join with the 
minister in taking this important step toward protecting wildlife 
species and their habitats in Canada.  After seven years of 
debate it is time to focus our attention on protecting and 
recovering wildlife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-33 is designed to work not merely in the courtrooms and 
the classrooms, but where it counts, in the fields, forests, 
wetlands and open waters of Canada.  Effective species 
protection, not costly litigation, must be our primary goal.

<A NAME="LINK214">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 7 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-206, an act to amend the Access to Information Act and to 
make amendments to other acts, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise to speak to Bill C-206, an act to amend 
the Access to Information Act by defining more precisely what 
records held by governments are to be disclosed and providing 
more severe penalties for those who would wilfully circumvent the 
intent of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I am very supportive of this legislation, as is our 
party.  It is a step in the right direction.  The updating of 
this act, which was introduced and served its purpose well during 
less complicated times, is long overdue.  Clearly the act needs 
to be updated and strengthened at this very critical time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is notable that the government of the leader of my party, the 
Right Hon. Joe Clark, first introduced the freedom of information 
legislation in Canada in 1979.  It is in that tradition that we 
are supportive of improvements to the act at this time to bring 
it up to date with today's circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current Access to Information Act the government 
almost got away with what was perhaps the most egregious abuse of 
government power recorded in a long time, perhaps even at any 
time during the country's history, and that was the HRDC scandal. 
There was an obvious abuse of the public trust and mismanagement 
of public funds, which ultimately uncovered innumerable counts of 
unethical or at least dubious uses of taxpayer money to buy 
electoral support.  The improvements brought forward in Bill 
C-206 would help to guard against this and perhaps bring to light 
these types of abuses earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing we have to consider is the degree to which the 
government is privatizing many of the government services which 
previously were the exclusive purview of government departments. 
Whether this is within the new Revenue Canada agency, the new 
money laundering agency or any of the new arm's length agencies 
that are separate from government, we have to ensure that we are 
being vigilant in ensuring that we continue through the Access to 
Information Act to have an opportunity to seek information that 
should be in the public domain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fear which I have and which others validate that 
sometimes when we see these new agencies access to information 
may be compromised. 
That is something we have to be awfully careful of, particularly 
given the degree to which the trend in government service 
provision in Canada is to that sort of agency model.  I would 
urge all members of the House to consider this very carefully to 
ensure that as this trend evolves we do not see a compromising of 
the access to information mechanism.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most glaring concerns with the legislation is that it 
proposes to prohibit access to information to users who make 
frivolous and abusive requests.  As a member of the fifth party 
in the House of Commons I would certainly hope that the hon. 
member, or any member of the governing party, would not see 
requests coming from my party as being frivolous or abusive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Suspicious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Suspicious perhaps, but never frivolous 
or abusive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever we get into nebulous descriptions there is the 
potential to use what I refer to as weasel words to benefit 
perhaps the governing party.  I think we have to be clear that, 
by and large, any request for information through the Access to 
Information Act should be considered to be more important than 
would be deemed frivolous or abusive.  Clearly a sound opposition 
on any number of issues has been based on access to information 
and the ability to receive information that perhaps other parties 
were not smart enough to ask for.  There are some concerns about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also pose as some concern the requirement of payment from 
individuals who use the ATI service frequently.  Again, clearly 
we do not want to create a system whereby ultimately access to 
information is more achievable by people with means than people 
without means.  That is something we should consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supportive of Bill C-206.  I commend the hon. member for 
Wentworth—Burlington for his continued diligence in bringing to 
the House erudite and well thought out contributions. While I 
differ with him periodically—in fact often—I generally respect 
his opinions, even when those opinions are frivolous or abusive. 
I commend the hon. member for a well thought out piece of 
legislation which is very constructive at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Resuming debate, the 
hon. member for Haldimand—Victoria—Brock. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton—Victoria—Brock, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is Haliburton—Victoria—Brock.  When you start 
dealing with the member for Wentworth—Burlington you will be 
talking about Ancaster, Dundas, Flamborough and Aldershot, so you 
will have to work on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of things the House has to learn other than 
finding out where a member actually resides.  Do not worry, the 
name of my riding will change shortly because Victoria has been 
changed to the City of the Kawartha Lakes.  I will probably have 
to change that also because it does not exist.  When I get around 
to running a survey in my next householder I will ask people what 
exactly they want the riding to be called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-206 was introduced by my colleague from 
Wentworth—Burlington.  As the member for Kings—Hants has noted, 
we sometimes disagree.  Probably the only reason he does not 
heckle me is because I am on his side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allowing private members' business, in general, to be debated in 
the House is something which I think the public does not quite 
understand.  I think it should be pointed out that any debate or 
negotiating, or anything that is allowed in private members' 
business should be looked at very seriously. 
People should understand that private members do a great deal of 
research into what they feel is perhaps an injustice or perhaps 
is not.  If something is being left out of legislation that 
affects the people on the street with whom we deal as backbench 
members of parliament, sometimes the only way to create debate is 
to bring a private member's bill forward.  I compliment the 
member for Wentworth—Burlington for doing so.

</I></B></P><P align=left>First reading is an important stage because it introduces the 
bill to the House.  That in itself allows members to read the 
bill and to discover the very thoughtful discussion that has gone 
into it, the commentary and the amendments that it would make to 
the act.  After that it receives second reading and goes to 
committee.  Then it comes back to the House for report stage and 
amendments, if necessary, and concurrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people do not realize that it takes a long time for that to 
happen.  It takes a great deal of gumption on behalf of a member 
to follow it through and to try to deal with the various 
amendments from other members.  Then third reading debate and a 
vote will send it on to the other place, or the Senate as it is 
known.  That is the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should keep in mind that there are, I think by design, 30 
private member's bills on the order paper.  The number is never 
less than that.  As one is dealt with another is brought forward. 
I am not sure of the exact number that are actually waiting to 
get into that stream, but there are quite a few of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the subcommittees that I sit on is the one formed by the 
central Ontario caucus.  We as group looked at ways to improve 
the way parliament works.  That report is making its way through 
the system.  It has some 24 recommendations.  Some are doable. 
Some are not.  Some will die from partisan politics, although we 
tried to make it extremely non-partisan.  It deals entirely with 
backbench members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the recommendations was Friday sittings.  Some members 
have said that this is the only place that sits on Fridays in the 
world wherever there are parliaments, wherever there are 
democratic systems that work under the British model.  If it is 
not in the government's interest to sit on Friday, I thought we 
could compromise and move Private Members' Business to Friday and 
make Friday a day when all Private Members' Business would be 
dealt with.  Then members know exactly when it would be dealt 
with.  We would not have to change the clock.  This is the only 
place in the world where it is 6.05 p.m. and the Chair can 
declare that it is 6.10 p.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event certain things need some work around here and that 
may be one of them.  A Friday sitting for Private Members' 
Business would highlight it and give it the precedence I believe 
it deserves in parliament.  I would like to see us go ahead with 
that.  We could allow for government bills to be introduced so 
that we would not lose a day and so on, but there would be no 
dilatory motions, no surprise votes, and private members would 
have a day of their own on Fridays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one recommendation for improvement.  When I come to the 
recommendations for improvement on Bill C-206 I notice that 
changing the act from the Access to Information Act to an act to 
allow for more open government would make perfect sense to the 
public and should make perfect sense to all of us.  In fact the 
more open the government is, the more trustworthy it becomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as politicians could actually move up the scale a little, 
which would be quite a change from some of the ways we are 
treated.  In particular, we are in a more adversarial position 
with many members of parliament trying to find the party that 
they are in, some trying to find the party they are not in, and 
some working away at trying to carve out their niche. 
It is more confrontational.  The agenda seems to move forward, 
whether it is the Bloc trying to bring its agenda forward by high 
profiling everything, whether it is the Canadian Alliance Party 
trying to bring its leadership debate to the front, or whether it 
is the Conservative Party trying to bring its leader to the 
front.  There seems to be a spirit of less co-operation in this 
place.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This affects backbench members of parliament, no matter whether 
they are in the government or in the opposition, more than it 
affects members who sit on the frontbenches or those who hold 
positions in official opposition and have functions which give 
them things such as a parking spot.  It would be nice to have 
some place to park our cars around here but this is not allowed. 
We would not have to bunk in with other people because we do not 
get enough money to cover our apartments.  I do not know of a 
company in the world that would send some one to Ottawa and say 
that he or she has to bunk in with three or four people to afford 
to be here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we deal with an open government act, I believe the right to 
access to information is the right to democracy.  I believe we as 
democratically elected politicians should allow the government to 
be more open.  I see in the legislation a spirit of compromise. I 
see a spirit of change.  I believe we all feel that this act 
needs to be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the only time, as this is Private Members' Business, 
that I can speak against the government.  If I were moved back 
any farther I would get into curtain burn.  I cannot be moved 
back any farther so I am allowed to speak my mind on Private 
Members' Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not support the bill for a couple of 
reasons, but it recognizes that the issues of access reform are 
controversial and complex.  Those diversions of opinion are 
legitimate so Private Members' Business has been legitimized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, either I have two minutes left or you are a Roman 
ordering five beer.  I always try to inject a little humour into 
this place because sometimes it is very hard to find.  Whenever I 
see a response that uses the word stakeholders, which I never 
learned until I came to Ottawa, and the phrase at the end of the 
day, I know the government is in trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the bill has a good chance. I compliment the member for 
Wentworth—Burlington, soon to be 
Ancaster—Dundas—Flamboro—Aldershot, for his initiative in 
bringing it to our attention and highlighting the importance of 
Private Members' Business.  It does move the agenda forward, 
although not necessarily on this particular day.  However it will 
move the agenda forward and bring it to the forefront, which 
perhaps will cause the government to improve an act that needs 
improvement, as the member has so rightly pointed out.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in debate on Bill C-206 as I have 
had some involvement in it in terms of how it got on the order of 
precedence and came up for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party would not argue that there is a real need to review 
and make changes to the Access to Information Act to make it work 
better for members of parliament.  Our recent experience with the 
human resources department and its non-compliance with the act 
gives us great concern about how the issue of access to 
information is being handled and how members can get the 
information they need in a timely manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes some changes that might help.  In my view, 
from the time I originally signed the bill until the bill was put 
on the order of precedence, it has been substantially softened to 
obtain the support of a sufficient number of backbench Liberals 
to get their signatures.  That was too bad.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original intent of the bill was to change the Access to 
Information Act to open up access to information from crown 
corporations and to information around the issue of Canadian 
unity.  It was a pretty good change and was important to our 
members.  That was reflected by the number of our members who 
signed and supported the bill.  However, for whatever reasons the 
sponsor of the bill changed it and got into all the trouble about 
changing it after getting the 100 signatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  You know that is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  No, I do not think that.  I think it 
is the absolute truth.  Having got into this issue since sitting 
on a subcommittee of the procedure and House affairs committee, 
we are the midst of studying the entire process of 100 named 
sponsors of a bill.  It is becoming more clear that the whole 
system of 100 names to force a bill on to the order of precedence 
is not working, probably never will and will have to be scrapped. 
Then we will have to go back to the traditional lottery draw on 
bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This process has been in place for some time now.  This is the 
first bill that has ever been in the House under the process of 
the 100 signatures.  There are nine other bills on the order of 
precedence with 100 signatures waiting to come on.  The truth is 
that any member who wishes to have a private member's bill 
debated in the House statistically has a better chance of getting 
it drawn in the lottery and debated than he or she would by 
getting the 100 signatures.  I am sure that the system will not 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many of our members said and as the member who sponsored the 
bill said, being one of the 100 signatories to the bill means 
nothing more than that we thought the issue should be debated in 
the House of Commons.  If that is all it means, why would a 
member not sign any other member's bill to come to the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the 100 signature rule was that if there were 
extraordinary issues the government refused to deal with which 
the general public or opposition members felt warranted serious 
debate, there should be a process by which the bill could be 
brought to the House.  That was the purpose of the 100 signature 
rule.  If it means nothing more than a member signifying a 
willingness to debate the issue in the House by signing the bill 
then the process is not achieving the purpose everyone envisioned 
it might and should be scrapped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the subcommittee will make its recommendations and some 
time in the future the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs will make its decision to either change it to make the 
process meaningful in some way or scrap it and go back to the 
lottery draw where a certain number of bills are drawn.  Then, if 
we are lucky enough to have our bills drawn, we get to debate 
them.  Probably that is the fairest system and probably why it 
evolved over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised it does not appear that the government will 
support the bill in its present form even after the member 
softened the bill to get support of the government backbenchers 
and to get the 100 signatures.  The member has been chirping away 
over there, but he has to remember that we have a $100 bet that 
this bill will actually be proclaimed into law. 
In fact, if the government is not supporting the bill, I think my 
money is a pretty sure thing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the 100 or 113 people who supported and signed the bill 
were simply supporting the concept that there would be an 
extensive review of the Access to Information Act, with 
substantive changes made so that we could get information, 
particularly on crown corporations and other organizations that 
are arm's length from government, that is not now available 
through access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from my constituents about some of their 
experiences dealing with access to information.  Under the Access 
to Information Act a person can apply for information and remain 
anonymous even to the people from whom they are acquiring the 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A small businessman in my riding got a notice from the 
information office that someone had applied for some very 
privileged information on his business, information that would 
have put him in a non-competitive position if it was released. He 
objected strongly to the release of that information but was told 
by the office of the information commissioner that it had 
overruled his objections and had released the information anyway. 
The office told him that it had no obligation to reveal the name 
of the person who was asking for that information and that if he 
objected he had access to the courts to protect himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A process where one has to hire a lawyer and go through a court 
to protect privileged information about one's business seems to 
be a strange process.  This to me does not seem reasonable. 
People should be able to protect information about their business 
or at least be apprised of who is looking for that information 
and why when the office asks if they are willing to let that 
information go.  It is very difficult to understand why anyone 
would let any information go when the content of the request is 
not known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there are some real problems for us as opposition 
members in getting information in a timely manner and within the 
rules.  Our constituents also have major problems dealing with 
access to information and want some changes.  Unfortunately I do 
not think the bill goes nearly far enough to solve those 
problems. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth—Middlesex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Access to Information Act came into force on July 1, 
1983.  At that time it was a revolutionary piece of legislation 
and represented a significant leap forward for the right to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By enacting the Access to Information Act, Canada joined a group 
of elite countries whose governments had opened their files to 
their citizens.  Prior to the Access to Information Act, access 
to government information could be granted or denied according to 
the whim of the government official who responded. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, after the coming into force of that legislation, 
Canadian citizens could not be denied access to information 
without proper justification. Parliament had established the 
principle that Canadians citizens and landed immigrants were 
entitled to have access to documents held by the government, 
subject only to specific and limited exceptions provided for in 
the act. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1820"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These exceptions were established after considerable thought in 
order to maintain a balance between the right of access to 
information and privacy, business secrets, national security and 
the need to maintain a climate of open communication for policy 
making purposes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To further emphasize the commitment to openness, most of the 
exemptions contained in the act were made discretionary.  There 
is no harm or injury to the interest protected by the exemption, 
then the institution is not prevented from releasing the 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Access to Information Act also provides applicants with an 
appeal process if some or all the information they have requested 
is denied or if they are unsatisfied with the processing of the 
request.  Complaints may initially be made to an independent 
officer who reports directly to parliament, the information 
commissioner and then, if the applicant is still unsatisfied, to 
the federal court. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Access to Information Act represented a major commitment to 
openness by the Government of Canada. Since then, most provinces 
have passed legislation providing access, to varying degrees, to 
government information. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This right to know embodied in legislation is one means of 
giving Canadians an insight into what their government is doing. 
It also enables citizens to access and use the information that 
their government holds on their behalf. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians agree that the machinery of government has become more 
complex over time, its responsibilities are broader and its 
decisions have a direct impact on their lives. This is why it is 
important to be accountable to the population and to constantly 
ensure that the government systematically releases information 
on its activities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore important to remember that the Access to 
Information Act was intended to supplement other traditional ways 
of making government information available to the public. I 
believe that the Access to Information Act has encouraged 
institutions to identify many categories of information that can 
be released without formal requests. Many institutions have, on 
their own initiative, placed useful information on their 
websites, in their libraries or in their reading rooms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1983 the environment in which the Government of Canada 
operates has changed.  Technology has had a tremendous impact on 
the way government delivers programs and services to Canadian 
citizens, and on how information is collected, processed, and 
managed within the government. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following these changes, some argued that the provisions of the 
Access to Information Act are now outdated and require a major 
update to take into account the new information technologies. 
Consequently, many individuals and interest groups propose 
changes touching on specific aspects of the act and some more 
general changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians are among those who want to change the act. 
While some members used the Access to Information Act to get 
government information, others introduced private members' bills 
to amend it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, section 67.1 was the most recent amendment to the 
act.  This section was added when Bill C-208 was proclaimed on 
March 25, 1999.  This was a significant amendment to the act as 
it made it a criminal offence for any person to wilfully obstruct 
the right of access provided by the Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-208 received all party support in the House, sending a 
clear message that all parties strongly support the concept of 
openness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another private member's bill is the bill we are debating today, 
Bill C-206 which was re-introduced by the hon. member for 
Wentworth—Burlington.  This bill proposes a variety of 
amendments to the Access to Information Act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this bill is a good start.  The member is to be 
congratulated for his leadership on this important issue.  He has 
demonstrated his commitment to the concept of openness by 
proposing 33 amendments to the act which he believes will improve 
the act and will increase that openness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, while I commend my colleague in his efforts, I 
believe that before we vote on these significant amendments to 
the Access to Information Act, we must seek the views of all 
stakeholders who will be affected by them:  Canadian citizens, 
the information commissioner, special groups, representatives of 
the media, government officials and so on.  There are widely 
differing views as to the impact this bill would have on the 
Access to Information Act, and the consequences that would emerge 
from the it.  In order to properly assess the contents of the 
bill we need to hear more, both from those who support the bill, 
or portions of it, and from those who oppose the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these individuals or groups who use or have an interest 
in the Access to Information Act must have an opportunity to make 
representations or bring forward their own proposals to amend the 
act before we take any further steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must open the discussion and invite all stakeholders to 
participate in the important debate concerning what adjustments 
are needed and how the objectives of the act can best be 
accomplished.  While I am among those who support the overall 
thrust of the bill as laudable, there are a number of outstanding 
concerns on which there needs to be full and wide consultation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to make some comments on the 
private member's bill, Bill C-206.  I appreciate the efforts made 
by the hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington to look at access to 
information.  I guess I am just a little jaded in my feelings on 
access to information and having any kind of legislation that 
allows the head of a government department or the Prime Minister 
to make a decision on whether information will be released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My experience with access to information with government 
departments has not been a pleasant one.  I find that whenever 
there is information that might embarrass or undermine the 
government's agenda, the department makes every effort to ensure 
that any information that is released is either highly blacked 
out, whited out or completely removed from the documentation that 
one receives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not like the idea that someone can consider an access to 
information request to be frivolous.  It may be frivolous to the 
people in the department or to an individual in a department but 
it is probably not frivolous to the person who is making the 
request.  I cannot support the idea that a person in any 
government department can decide on his or her own that something 
seems to be frivolous, or that somebody seems to be asking for 
access to information more than somebody in a government 
department deems necessary, or that he or she personally does not 
think that the person requesting the information is acting on 
behalf of a group or organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to information should be very clear.  When a citizen of 
Canada asks for information it should be provided to them.  The 
gathering of the information is done using taxpayer dollars.  The 
people who are overseeing the spending of taxpayer dollars are 
paid by taxpayer dollars.  If an individual is concerned enough 
about an issue to ask the government for the information in order 
to do research, to support a position or for whatever reason, 
nothing should be blocking the flow of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I particularly do not want the head of some government 
department being able to say “I think that is frivolous. I think 
that may be a secret or an issue that we cannot release because 
of national security”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have found, in my research and in my position, that buying a 
case of toilet paper for a government department can be 
considered a national security.  I do not want the head of any 
government department able to say that the request is frivolous 
or that it might be a danger to the welfare of the country if 
that information is released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation, although it is a private member's bill and it 
does reach into some of the corners, it is still basically 
protecting the government from having to release information that 
it does not want anybody to know.

</I></B></P><P align=left>All we have to do is look at the human resources department and 
the boondoggle of the waste of government money. That fact is it 
is through access requests that we get little tidbits of 
information which lead to other tidbits of information instead of 
getting full documents released, instead of getting audits 
released without access to information.  A government can use any 
legislation that it wants to hide facts and information from 
embarrassing itself or from coming clean with Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect, I do not think think this legislation will 
make it any easier for people to get information from government 
departments that do not want that information released.  It 
points out a number of areas that could be cleaned up, but on the 
whole it does not deal with completely opening up access to 
information for ordinary citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it does do is if an ordinary citizen is concerned about 
issues and digs deeper and deeper and asks for more and more 
requests, the citizen can be asked to pay more and more money for 
it.  In other words, instead of a simple $5 fee it can be deemed 
that a request is frivolous, is of a personal nature or whatever 
and the individual will have to pay not only the cost but an 
extra 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is good enough.  Either the government will 
come clean and release information or it will not.  I am not 
convinced that this legislation will make it any better for 
Canadians to get access to information that the government would 
just as soon not share because it is trying to hide its 
mismanagement of government funds.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
maybe not today but at some point I would like to have the 
opportunity to respond to the comments of the hon. member across 
the way with respect to the freedom of information act and how 
the government deals with it.  For the time being I will confine 
myself to Bill C-206, an act to amend the Access to Information 
Act introduced by the hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to acknowledge at the outset the tremendous amount 
of work involved in putting together a private member's bill as 
extensive as Bill C-206.  It is evident that a great deal of 
thought and effort has gone into the preparation of the bill. The 
hon. member certainly deserves much recognition and appreciation 
for his hard work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that the government values 
openness and transparency. It recognizes the role of the Access 
to Information Act in ensuring that these values of openness and 
transparency animate every aspect of institutional behaviour, 
subject of course to certain restrictions that are intended to 
protect private and commercial information as an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's bill was originally introduced in November 
1997 as Bill C-264.  It was reintroduced last fall as Bill C-206. 
It is an extensive bill that proposes a major reform of the 
Access to Information Act. It has opened a much needed discussion 
on the subject of access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the bill was first introduced in 1997, government 
departments and agencies have had an opportunity to consider the 
proposed changes to the act that the bill contemplates.  These 
government departments and agencies have some concerns about the 
impact the bill would have on third party information provided to 
the government by both individuals and businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the proposals in Bill C-206 would result in the automatic 
disclosure of a wide variety of information that has been under 
the control of the government for 30 years.  Many departments are 
concerned that the automatic disclosure of personal information 
that the government has held for 30 years could lead to an 
infringement of an individual's right to privacy under the 
charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the bill does permit some exceptions against disclosure of 
information such as the safety of an individual, Bill C-206 does 
not recognize that in some circumstances individuals expect their 
confidentiality to be maintained.  In fact they will have 
provided the government with their personal information with the 
expectation that government will keep that information 
confidential.  Generally speaking, personal information should 
not be disclosed except for the purpose for which it was 
originally given to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privacy commissioner also has expressed grave concerns about 
the impact the bill would have on the privacy of individuals and 
on the confidentiality of personal information particularly with 
respect to the income tax returns of Canadians. 
Income tax returns by their very nature contain a lot of private 
and personal information that should continue to be protected. No 
one should want his or her income tax information to be 
accessible at any time.

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada has advised that it is extremely worried about 
the impact of Bill C-206 on its ability to maintain the 
confidentiality of information which Statistics Canada collects 
from individuals and businesses. For example the information 
collected by the Statistics Canada census on lifestyle and from 
pension managers is personal. The confidentiality of information 
provided by businesses is also put at risk as a result of the 30 
year rule I mentioned earlier and as a result of the proposed 
repeal of section 24 which supports confidentiality clauses in 
other statutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry Canada has pointed out that the proposed changes to the 
act could have a chill effect on the information provided to the 
government by businesses.  There would be no guarantee to 
businesses that their commercially sensitive information and 
trade secrets would be protected.  This would make it difficult 
to administer regulatory schemes and government programs that 
rely on information supplied by businesses to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada has also confirmed that the bill may cause a chill 
effect on drugs being sold in Canada.  Drugs cannot be sold in 
Canada without a pharmaceutical company filing a new drug 
submission.  The submission includes trade secrets.  Businesses 
may be unwilling to risk their competitive position by filing new 
drug submissions in Canada if there is a risk that their trade 
secrets could be released to third parties.  This I am sure will 
be a major cause of concern for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The discussion prompted by Bill C-206 has highlighted how very 
complex and controversial access reform can be.  In fact it may 
be possible to improve government openness and transparency 
through administrative reform.  However, if the better choice is 
to reform the act in order to enhance openness and transparency 
in government, then major reform of the Access to Information Act 
such as that proposed in Bill C-206 should not be undertaken 
without first conducting broad public consultations that would 
allow all interested stakeholders to express their views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a view that was expressed by the information 
commissioner when he appeared before the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights last November.  The information 
commissioner stated that proposals for access reform should be 
informed by a variety of perspectives and that it would be 
preferable for consultations to be conducted on a broad scale 
allowing all stakeholders to have a say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by reminding the House that Bill C-206 would 
make major changes to the Access to Information Act.  Concerns 
are emerging from many quarters about the implications of the 
proposed changes.  This raises an important question and a note 
of caution.  Will the government be able to continue to protect 
personal information provided by individuals to the government 
for various purposes as well as confidential commercial 
information and trade secrets provided by businesses?  Much 
consultation must be undertaken to effectively answer many of the 
outstanding questions and concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless I would like to once again congratulate the hon. 
member for his efforts in this area.  I think it is extremely 
important. He has made a very significant contribution to the 
debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is my opportunity to speak on private members' business 
which is not a choice opportunity.  The member for 
Wentworth—Burlington is a member I have watched and I find him 
sensible and thoughtful.  I think sometimes he is a thorn in the 
government's side and I always chuckle when I see that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would start off by saying that access to information and 
opening up access to information as far as an opposition 
politician is concerned is just perfect.  I am vigorously pro the 
process of opening up access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention a procedural concern with the bill.  The 
member I hope will take this in the spirit that it is intended. 
There was a brand new process brought in where we could hasten 
private members' business and have 100 signatures. Some members 
of the alliance signed, having gone over the basic premise of the 
bill, and enthusiastically supported it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some changes that were made to the bill.  I believe 
that if the member had come openly to those who had signed and 
said, “These changes have been made.  I believe that these 
improve the bill.  Would you reassess it and take a look at it”, 
there would not have been the procedural harangue and kerfuffle 
that went with the bill.  I think the hon. member would say that 
honestly. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1840"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT102"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that the member did this with any negative 
feelings or with any bad motives, but it really would have helped 
the process.  Because I supported the idea of 100 signatures on 
an important private member's bill, I would hate to see that lost 
to us because of this procedural concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has been reintroduced with 100 signatures so that there 
still is support of at least 100 members and it is votable.  This 
will be an opportunity to have a debate on an issue which I think 
is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private members' business in general has been an interesting 
thing to me as a relatively novice politician.  Not very many 
private members' bills get passed.  There are significant 
hurdles.  It has been interesting to watch the changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The voting has changed.  The cabinet no longer votes first. 
Voting comes down the rows which gives those who do not have 
cabinet solidarity at mind a little bit more of an opportunity. 
I have seen a little bit of a change in attitude toward private 
members' business because of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am always fascinated to listen to the various members speak to 
a bill that has some controversy to it.  I will watch this 
process with interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why am I so supportive of access to information opening up?  I 
would like to go over a couple of examples in my own career here 
to talk about why it needs improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back to the tainted blood issue. I consider that issue 
one of the dark days.  This is not a partisan comment because the 
government opposite was not the only government involved in it. 
There was a mixed accountability line or thread for the Red 
Cross, the Canadian Blood Agency and the federal and provincial 
governments.  During the meetings that went on with tainted 
blood, and in their minutes, some very important decisions were 
made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judge Krever in his report said that the line of accountability 
was partly to blame.  He was hampered in his investigations 
because some of the minutes and processes that were undertaken 
during that period of time were destroyed.  They were destroyed 
on purpose.  They were destroyed by individuals whom I felt had a 
public trust and they have gotten off scot-free.  Their names 
were mentioned but there was no sanction or penalty for 
destroying public documents that would have and could have in my 
estimation made the process of compensation for those victims of 
hepatitis C much easier for the government to have undertaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, in this bill I see penalties for destroying 
documents. That is quite significantly appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How has access to information been handled on issues where I 
think individuals in the government have done things that are 
inappropriate?  Not so long ago I remember some documents 
surfacing that showed expense accounts were not being used 
properly by a minister of the government.  Although one could 
look through the whiteout and find enough information to make 
suppositions, the whiteout was like a blizzard.  Skiers who have 
gotten into a whiteout cannot see where the crowd is or where 
their feet are.  They are disoriented.  The whiteout process used 
on those access to information requests reminded me of skiing in 
a whiteout, a blizzard in the snow.  There is an indication for 
me that access to information was not working properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally on HRDC, there was an audit that had been available to 
government department resources which I feel was not released 
publicly. 
Audits are public information, and with an access to information 
request, suddenly, that audit was made available.  I presume that 
it would have been hard to hide.  It contained some information 
which makes grants and contributions, that process of government 
activity, unsavoury.  We have spent a lot of time in the House in 
the last three or four months on that issue.  Looking back, we 
can find similar audits with similar complaints made for a long 
period of time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to information requests on this same subject are now 
being held up.  Departments are saying that the requests are too 
voluminous.  There is a 30 day point in time when that 
information is supposed to be provided, but it is not being 
provided in that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given those three examples, I say that the ATI does need 
improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this bill do for white-out?  I do not see anything.  I 
am not sure what I would do about white-out.  I will listen to 
the debate.  I think that white-out, somehow, could be improved 
in this whole process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One other improvement I would like to see would be an expansion 
to include crown corporations with regard to access to 
information.  The member says that it is in this legislation.  I 
have not found it in a form that I could say I am completely 
comfortable with, but I know the member would not mislead me, so 
I will presume that an expansion to include crown corporations is 
in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a principle, open and accountable government is strongly 
supported.  In practice, does this bill move us far enough down 
that road?  I will listen to the balance of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to compliment the member opposite for doing what I 
think is an excellent job regarding private members' business.  I 
will be supporting or not supporting this bill, according to some 
of the concerns and comments I have just made. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
colleagues will accept that we will not get a thorough discussion 
of any element of the bill in three minutes, but I certainly do 
want to put my views on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to recognize the huge effort and investment undertaken by 
the hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington in drafting this bill 
and bringing it to the House as an item under Private Members' 
Business.  Some members have noted the procedural difficulties 
and challenges faced by the hon. member as he brought his bill 
forward.  He has succeeded in overcoming those difficulties and 
has presented a bill of great importance and complexity for us to 
consider in Private Members' Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worthwhile pointing out that this bill was not drafted 
over months and months by a government department in consultation 
with other government departments.  It was essentially put 
together by the hon. member himself, in consultation with a 
number of parties inside the loop.  The bill reflects 
difficulties perceived in the process used for obtaining 
information from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government as well as previous governments have accepted 
the importance of access to information and freedom of 
information.  That template was put in place 10 or 20 years ago 
and is working reasonably well in achieving the intended 
purposes, but there are some discontinuities, some obstacles and 
some ways in which we could make it better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reference was made to the penalty sections for destroying 
documents. I recall the House adopting another private member's 
bill about two years ago which did put in place penalty sections 
for destroying documents under this statute.  The hon. member's 
bill recapitulates them and streamlines them.

supporting the bill.  I point out for the record that the 
government refrains, conspicuously refrains, from indicating 
support or non-support for private members' initiatives and 
generally leaves matters to members in the House of Commons. 
That does not mean that government ministers do not, from time to 
time, indicate preferences and create documents for guidance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see, Mr. Speaker, that you are indicating that my three

this huge initiative.  There will be further debate on the 
subject.

Speaker, I want to return to my question of February 24 to the 
Minister of Natural Resources on the issue of energy costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February gasoline, diesel and home heating fuel prices 
skyrocketed to record levels for two reasons:  OPEC cut back oil 
production, and a bitterly cold winter in the northeast U.S. 
hiked the demand for crude just at the minute it reached over $30 
U.S. per barrel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a net exporter of oil.  That means we produce more oil 
than we consume and, therefore, we export the difference.  These 
reasons which were given to us back in February, which are now 
still affecting our price of energy, are very unacceptable. 
There is no information which can prove that is driving up the 
prices. I think it is a result of unjustified price increases by 
oil companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians were badly hurt by the resulting record price 
increase, in particular those on the east coast and truckers who 
already struggle with very thin cost margins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised this issue many times in the House to almost nothing 
but blank stares from the Liberal government.  It was as if the 
Liberals were completely unaware that Canadians were hurting, 
completely oblivious that Canadians were hopping mad.  This is 
another example of how little the Liberal government is in touch 
with Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess that is what happens when we give cabinet ministers a 
government car and a government driver.  They have no idea what 
the price of gas is any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, south of the border, the U.S. administration was 
convening energy summits in the northeast with refineries, 
trucking associations, suppliers, consumer groups and industrial 
users.  President Clinton said that his administration found the 
problem “deeply troubling” and was monitoring it daily.  He 
announced a 17 point plan to help consumers, truckers and 
business people get through the crisis.  He defended his economy 
and dispatched his energy secretary, Bill Richardson, to meet 
with OPEC ministers around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, a New York <I>Times</I> story some weeks later 
pointed out that Bill Richardson, the energy secretary I 
mentioned, earned very high marks for his decisive action on this 
file and is now a leading contender for the vice-presidential 
candidacy on the Democratic ticket.  This is a lesson on how to 
listen to people and take their concerns seriously, one the 
Liberals could learn a lot from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in Canada, the provinces and territories were not having 
much more luck with the government than we in the opposition 
were, as it turns out.  They tried to convince the federal 
government that it was only reasonable, if it was going to 
conduct a credible study on gasoline retailing, to do it with 
someone other than just the integrated oil companies.  They 
finally agreed to go in on a study with the federal government, 
but then the feds let the contract out and it wound up going to 
the same contractor that the big oil companies use, M. J. Ervin, 
so half of the provinces, plus the independent gas retailers 
pulled out again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the moment at which I put my question to the Minister 
of Natural Resources.  Would he finally call an energy summit of 
affected parties to consider urgent assistance measures and 
consider some long term preventive measures to ensure such price 
spikes and supply problems do not threaten our economy again? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister indicated that he would canvass his provincial 
colleagues.  I would like to know tonight what the result of that 
canvass was, fully three months after the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the federal government has subsequently announced a 
new study of the oil industry.  Initially I thought that if it 
contributed some independent data and had some real teeth, it 
might be worthwhile in terms of contributing to the debate, but 
then I learned that the price tag was $750,000.  That is 
outrageous, since the study is going back to the same consulting 
firm which the big oil companies use, M. J. Ervin, which the 
provinces and the independent gas retailers raised concerns about 
previously and rejected.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the cost is not going to research.  Most of it, 60%, is 
going to public relations.  I quote from the terms of reference 
for the study:  “A highly structured/facilitated session of only 
invited stakeholders to conduct a dialogue on the intransigence 
of the public's perception on gas prices”.  They are going to 
Calgary, Toronto and Montreal.  They should go to Whitehorse, 
Regina and St. John's, Newfoundland instead and let the doors be 
open wide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The entire premise of the study by the Conference Board is that 
the issue has been studied to death but the public just does not 
understand the research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I think we have a different problem in this country. 
First, the refineries have a monopoly.  Second, the Liberals rely 
on the integrated oil companies for campaign contributions. 
Third, the public is paying higher prices at the pump now when 
crude is at $26 a barrel than it was during the gulf war when 
crude hit $35 U.S. a barrel.  What is the answer?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
with respect to the hon. member's previous suggestion, the issue 
of petroleum product pricing is a regular agenda item at the 
federal-provincial-territorial meetings of energy ministers. 
Natural Resources Canada officials also maintain an ongoing 
consultation with their provincial colleagues on issues relating 
to petroleum product markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increases in crude oil prices are the result of increasing 
world oil demand, due largely to economic recovery in Asia and 
production restraint by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries, also know as OPEC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>OPEC members agreed to increase production at the OPEC 
ministerial meeting in March.  This should ease some of the 
pressures, although not entirely, due to the demand for fuel and 
the status of inventories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inventory situation is one that should improve somewhat over 
the year.  Reduced inventory levels throughout North America 
since last summer have kept prices high on spot markets. However, 
in the early part of 2000 the increased demand for distillates, 
diesel and furnace oil resulted in price spikes to record levels 
in certain centres in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation was the result of additional heating demand due 
to frigid weather and the North American and European refineries 
purchasing large volumes of low sulphur distillate on the spot 
market to conform to environmental regulations that became 
effective January 1, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal and provincial governments have some shared 
responsibilities in relation to crude oil and petroleum product 
pricing.  Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia are the only two 
provinces which currently regulate retail gasoline prices.  The 
provincial governments are responsible for the regulation of 
retail pricing.  The federal government has the authority for 
competition law and policy and for international and 
interprovincial trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal government regulated crude oil prices during 
the 1970s and 1980s it was in response to very large and 
persistent price increases.  Under the western accord of 1985 the 
governments of Canada, Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia 
agreed that domestic crude oil prices should be deregulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best option before us is to continue to defend primary 
reliance upon competitive markets to set prices, even as we work 
with other members of the International Energy Agency to promote 
oil market stability.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>IMPORTATION OF PLUTONIUM 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
February 24, I raised the issue of the importation of plutonium 
based MOX fuel from United States and Russia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Moscow summit, in 1996, the Prime Minister unilaterally 
undertook to allow this dangerous product into Canada. The issue 
having been referred to it, the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs tabled, in December 1998, a unanimous report that 
clearly stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Committee recommends that the Government reject the idea of 
burning MOX fuel in Canada because this option is totally 
unfeasible— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, this committee was constituted of a majority of Liberal 
members, that is, the hon. member for Chatham—Kent Essex, the 
hon. member for Scarborough Centre, the hon. member for Brampton 
West—Mississauga, the hon. member for Toronto Centre—Rosedale, the 
hon. member for Halton, the hon. member for Etobicoke—Lakeshore, 
the hon. member for Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant and the hon. member 
for Brampton Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early last fall, Atomic Energy of Canada Limited held public 
consultations, but for only 28 days. It is important to note 
that these consultations were not on the principle of the 
importation of plutonium but only on the route that the Russian 
and American shipments would follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Atomic Energy of Canada Limited report tabled on November 
4, 1999, it was decided that the American MOX would be carried 
by truck and the Russian MOX by ship.

<A HREF="#LINKT106"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, on January 10, the federal government changed 
unilaterally its initial plan and decided to import American MOX 
by air four days later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will not have me believe that Transport Canada had 
the time to assess this new plan in only four days, to make sure 
that the process was consistent with the regulations of the 
Atomic Energy Control Board, the regulations concerning the 
packaging of radioactive materials, the regulations of the 
International Civil Aviation Organization and the regulations of 
Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that the transportation of plutonium by air is 
illegal in the United States. 
Moreover, in a January 1999 report on the Parallex project, that 
is the plutonium importation project, the American Department of 
Energy said the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is considered to be more dangerous to transport plutonium by 
air than by land, because accident risks are higher. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is indecent for the natural resources minister to candidly 
declare in the House that this danger is non-existent north of 
the 49th parallel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The American position is clear on this issue: no plutonium 
container is safe enough to withstand a plane crash. 
According to them, the 4H BUF containers used by Transport 
Canada last January could not withstand an impact at more than 
30 miles an hour or a fire of more than 15 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the plans for the transportation of MOX fuel were 
changed unilaterally is a slap in the face of democracy. The 
minister should recognize that the importation of MOX fuel is a 
national issue affecting all Canadians and Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government tells us that this is done in support of 
international nuclear disarmament. However, the government 
should consider the fact that 50% to 66% of the initial mass of 
MOX fuel will remain in the form of waste. Therefore, it will no 
longer be a world problem, but a strictly Canadian problem. I 
doubt that the Americans and the Russians will agree to take 
back their waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the Minister of Natural Resources never took the 
people's concerns into account in this matter. The 149 
resolutions from municipalities and RCMs located along the St. 
Lawrence River opposing the project to import plutonium should 
bring the government to give in on this issue, as should the 96% 
negative comments from the general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unacceptable for the government not to ask the people if 
they approve of importing plutonium.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
with respect to the import of the MOX fuel test sample from the 
United States to Canada and the helicopter flight in Canada, I 
want to assure hon. members that the shipment complied with all 
Canadian legal and regulatory requirements.  The shipment 
complied with the Atomic Energy Control Act, the Transportation 
of Dangerous Goods Act, the Transportation and Packaging of 
Radioactive Materials Regulations, the requirements under the 
International Civil Aviation Organization, and the standards set 
by International Atomic Energy Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MOX test sample shipments are safe.  The trace amount of 
radiation is so small that it poses no significant risk to 
health, safety or the environment.  The fuel is in a stable, 
solid, ceramic form inside a sealed zirconium alloy element and 
transported in a container.  As I stated earlier, it meets 
Canadian and international standards.  It is not soluble and 
cannot spill, ignite or explode.  It is not a powder that can be 
inhaled.  The transport of the fuel samples is subject to all the 
requirements of Canada's regulatory system, which fully protects 
public health, safety and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MOX fuel test shipment from the United States was safely 
transported to Chalk River Laboratories on January 14, 2000.  The 
U.S. Department of Energy has clearly stated that this is a one 
time shipment of a small quantity of used mixed oxide nuclear 
fuel to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mixed oxide fuel, MOX, test project is part of an 
international non-proliferation initiative to find a safe and 
secure manner to render surplus Russian and American weapons 
grade plutonium inaccessible for future use in nuclear weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plutonium that has been declared surplus by the U.S. and 
Russia already exists and will continue to present a real 
proliferation danger until it can be reduced to a form that 
cannot be readily used for weapons purposes. 
The use of MOX fuel in a nuclear reactor is one of the methods by 
which the plutonium can be rendered effectively inaccessible for 
weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has agreed, in principle, to consider the use of MOX fuel 
in Canada as part of its contribution to international 
disarmament initiatives.  The Government of Canada believes that 
Canadians share a common desire to create a safe and secure world 
for future generations and are prepared to take appropriate 
action, provided that public health, safety and the environment 
are not compromised in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I must stress that undertaking this test does not 
oblige Canada to agree to the large scale use of MOX fuel in 
Candu power plants in the future.  Should any such program be 
proposed at some point in the future, stringent conditions will 
apply, including full public participation prior to entering into 
the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It being 7.05 p.m. 
the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
