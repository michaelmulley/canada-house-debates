Davie Fulton, who died on May 22, was elected to parliament as a 
member for Kamloops in 1945, while still an officer in the 
Italian campaign in World War II.  He served in the Diefenbaker 
government as an imaginative and reform-minded minister of 
justice.  He was joint author, with U.S. Attorney General Rogers, 
of the Fulton-Rogers Agreement, restricting the extraterritorial 
application of U.S. anti-trust law against Canadian companies 
without prior consultation with the Canadian government.  He also 
developed a plan for an all-Canadian amending machinery for the 
Canadian constitution, which later provided a scientific-legal 
base for the Trudeau Constitution Act of 1982, chapter V. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Fulton's post-parliamentary career involved further public 
service as a justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia and 
as a respected jurisconsult on major Canadian constitutional 
issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canada is a country of immigrants, 
enriched by diversity, a peace-loving nation willing to help out 
our neighbours and celebrate our freedoms.  Canadians oppose any 
form of terrorism anywhere.  They are particularly opposed to 
terrorists using Canada to finance their killings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tamil tigers raised $22 million in Canada last year alone. 
The Minister of Finance and the Minister for International 
Cooperation made a mistake.  They attended an event sponsored by 
an internationally known front for the tigers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tamil New Year should be celebrated as much as any other 
cultural holiday around the globe.  However, celebrating it with 
an organization that finances terrorism is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of apologizing, the ministers attack, calling us racist 
and anti-Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not anti-Canadian to condemn terrorism, nor is it racist 
to identify terrorist organizations from a particular country. 
What is anti-Canadian is ministers of the crown who refuse to 
admit their mistakes and attack those who defend and demand 
accountability.  Canada is still, after all, a democracy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Sunday, June 4, 2000 marks the 13th anniversary of National 
Cancer Survivor's Day.  This event honours survivors who are 
living with and beyond cancer.  It also recognizes the important 
role played by family, friends and community in the lives of 
cancer survivors, as well as that of the many health care 
professionals and researchers who devote their lives to making 
life more comfortable for those faced with the disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Approximately one in three Canadians will be diagnosed with 
cancer during his or her lifetime.  However, thanks to the 
improved detection, more available information and enhanced 
methods of treatment, over half of all people diagnosed with 
cancer today go on to achieve a full recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently one of my staffers was diagnosed with cancer.  I admire 
her courage and her determination and would like take this 
opportunity to tell her that we are all rooting for her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, with the Canadian Cancer Society, I salute and celebrate 
the survivors.

</I></B></P><P align=left>World No-Tobacco Day is a global event created by the World 
Health Organization to raise the awareness about the use of 
tobacco and its devastating effects on human lives.  Tobacco use 
leads to breast and lung cancer, heart disease, disability, death 
and high health care costs. 
This year over 4 million people, more than 45,000 of whom will be 
Canadians, will die as a result of tobacco use.  By the year 
2030, they tell us, the annual global death toll from tobacco use 
is expected to reach 10 million.

Speaker, as Canadians we are known for our willingness to welcome 
immigrants and refugees with a wide range of ethnic and cultural 
backgrounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have a failing though it would be our tendency to assume 
that every new entrant will leave behind any long held prejudices 
and deeply held feelings related to conflicts in their previous 
homelands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, as the experience with the Babar Khalsa charity in B.C. 
taught us, criminals and undesirables do infiltrate our society 
from overseas and use our willingness to embrace other cultures 
as a way to raise money for wars and terrorist activities abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took years to get the Babar Khalsa deregistered as a charity, 
even though CSIS had identified the group as raising money in 
Canada for terrorism, because those who spoke out about the 
problem were unfairly labelled by political opponents as 
intolerant and racist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not make the same mistake again.  Let us begin listening 
to authoritative warnings about terrorist fundraising activities 
in Canada.

<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the 
past 12 years, May 31 is World No-Tobacco Day, a date set by the 
World Health Organization to invite us to encourage those around 
us to stop smoking, at least for one day, or even to give it up 
permanently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also an opportunity to encourage all authorities 
responsible for health to continue their research on the harmful 
effects of smoking, to disseminate information on the subject, 
and to engage in concrete actions against smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proportion of health problems affecting the world's 
population that is related to smoking is not to be 
underestimated. 
According to World Health Organization estimates, there are 
approximately 4 million tobacco-related deaths every year and, if 
the trend continues, within 30 years smoking will become the top 
cause of illness in the world.  One in eight deaths could be 
linked to smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the immediate and long term harmful effects of tobacco on 
health, it is essential for there to be clear and firm support 
to any antismoking measures and to co-ordinate worldwide efforts 
in this connection, in order to enhance the effectiveness of our 
response to the public health hazard tobacco represents.

the cost of gasoline has jumped by 10 cents.  A litre of regular

Montreal.

at the floor price established by the Quebec energy board, that 
is, by the government of Lucien Bouchard.

</I></B></P><P align=left>No retailer wants to sell below floor price, which is dictated 
by the Government of Quebec and which is the wholesale price 
plus transportation costs and taxes.  Some would have broken the 
rule.  In Montreal, profits usually range between six and seven 
cents a litre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government of Lucien Bouchard maintaining this floor

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, remember when the Prime Minister said that lowering 
taxes was the not the Canadian way, and if people did not like it 
they should move out of the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have the finance minister saying that any criticism of 
his support for what CSIS claims is a front for a well known 
terrorist group is also not the Canadian way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would Joe Canadian say in response?  I think it would go 
something like this.  I am a Canadian and it is about time the 
federal government started to treat my tax dollars as funds held 
in trust, not a personal slush fund for a political party.  I 
believe that a dollar held in the hands of a family or business 
person is far better than sending it in to the finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of the finance minister, I also reject the idea that 
criticizing supporters of the Tamil tigers who go to public 
schools dressed in army fatigues and packing replica assault 
weapons is somehow not the Canadian way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Canadians believe in noble ideas like the equality of all 
people, respect for diversity and freedom to express oneself, it 
is about time we gave up on the politically correct notion that 
criticizing a terrorist group is somehow equal to criticizing 
someone's culture.  It is not unCanadian to be against terrorism.

changes to the criminal code to hold corporations and managers 
accountable for putting workers in undue danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House has passed a motion calling on the government to act 
on Justice Richard's recommendations.  Last Monday the justice 
minister tried to pass the buck to the justice committee by 
telling the House that the committee was looking at the issue. 
What the minister said was wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corporate responsibility is not on the justice committee's

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

attempt to get the HRDC minister off the hook, but I read from 
the Employment Insurance Act, section 127, which states:  “The 
following information shall be made available only to the 
Commission and the employees of the Department”, and that is, 
“any information obtained by the Commission or the Department 
from any persons under this Act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole section is titled “Confidential information”, yet we 
find out, to the shock of Canadians, that all of this is being

<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

available for a very long time in hard copy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These decisions, as is the case with many, many others, be they 
administrative tribunals or court decisions, are available on the

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely nothing improper in relation to that.  In

<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

explanation about why she has made them vulnerable by putting 
personal details of their lives on the web, including their 
address, work situation, living arrangements and family 
circumstances.  This information is published on the web.  It is 
not kept in a file somewhere; it is out on the worldwide web.

were always closely observed by the CIO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister therefore explain to us why 21% of the $22.5

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
talking about calls for tender—these are not necessarily

</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the government therefore explain to us how it is possible 
under the contracting-out guidelines to award $258,000 in various 
contracts to Stratégies et Communication, and to Groupe Cible, 
without any calls for tender?  Is it because these two outfits 
are directed by a former Liberal candidate or for reasons of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government

that, in January 1998, the firm of Tremblay-Guitett was awarded a 
$105,000 contract without any call for tenders, to provide

through a competitive bidding process, through a call for

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Right Hon. Prime Minister, who was a 
colleague of Monique Bégin when she brought in the Canada Health 
Act in 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former minister of health has now called on the Liberal 
government to bring in amendments to federal legislation 
governing health care in this country to stop the privatization 
of medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister is not willing to listen to the NDP, would 
he be willing to listen to his former colleague and do what we 
have been asking for a long time, bring in legislation to stop 
privatization? 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Madam Bégin did not suggest amending, she suggested new 
legislation, parallel legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I met with her the other morning and we had an 
interesting discussion.  She is a person whose views I very much 
respect.  I reminded her that we are in the process of working 
with provincial partners to renew medicare to find an answer to 
make sure the principles of the Canada Health Act are respected 
as we go forward with a sustainable health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We welcome good ideas from any source, and I will work with my 
provincial partners to make certain that we do what is right to 
keep public medicare safe in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I do not care what it is called, whether it is called 
parallel or new or amendments.  The fact is that the former 
minister of health has called for changes to the legislation 
governing medicare in this country, which is exactly what we have 
called for, changes that would stop privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the minister waiting?  Is he waiting for the federal 
election?  Is he waiting to put a package in place as part of the 
strategy for the Liberals?  Medicare needs to be saved now, not 
at the convenience of the Liberal Party.  Let us have some action 
now, as the former minister of health has asked for. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we did not wait to have a health budget in February 1999.  We did 
not wait to increase by 25% the transfers to provinces for health 
over the last four years.  We did not wait to invite health 
ministers from across the country to join me at the table to talk 
about concrete action to save medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has no lessons to learn from the NDP on health. 
The NDP has come into the House with no constructive ideas on how 
to change medicare.  We will see to it that public medicare is 
safeguarded in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we all

been taken from files and we have serious breakdowns in the chain

</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask him what the privacy policy of that party would be.  Would 
he agree with his colleague, the member for Yorkton—Melville, 
who thinks that even those who are found not guilty or have their

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Minister of Finance said that although he 
had Irish blood running in his veins that did not mean he was a 
member of the IRA, but if the finance minister started attending 
IRA cultural events, you can bet we would have some pretty tough 
questions for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is CSIS, the U.S. state department and security 
analysts in Australia and Scotland all say that the FACT is a 
fundraising front for the Tamil Tigers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister continue to defend his attendance at a FACT 
event in the light of that evidence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I do not know how that fits in with the 
administrative responsibility of the government or the minister. 
I ruled this type of question out of order yesterday.  The 
minister stood to answer it.  I see another minister is standing 
to answer.  This question is out of order but if she would like 
to respond, the hon. minister. 
<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes, I do want to answer because neither 
I nor the Minister of Finance attended a Tamil Tiger event.  We 
attended a cultural event of the Tamil community of Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I lived for decades under the accusation that the Italian 
Canadian community was Mafiosi and part of the Mafia.  I will not 
tar the whole of the Tamil community in the same manner. 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, during the 35th parliament, this government was told 
repeatedly by CSIS and by the Reform Party that the Babar Khalsa 
Sikh charity in B.C. was raising money— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  We will hear the question from the 
hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, during the 35th parliament, 
this government was warned repeatedly by CSIS and what was 
formerly the Reform Party that the Babar Khalsa Sikh charity in 
B.C. was raising money for terrorist activities overseas.  It 
took years to get the Babar Khalsa charitable status cancelled. 
Now it looks like the finance minister is repeating history, this 
time in connection with the Tamil Tigers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the FACT has done nothing wrong, will the Minister of Finance 
please stand now and say that he supports an inquiry into the 
activities of that group in Canada? 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Tamil Canadians are making a contribution to this 
country in virtually every segment of our society.  We will build 
Canada only by embracing new communities, not by shunning then. 
Until the Reform Party understands that, all the name changes in 
the world will not help them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member is quite right.  Health Canada has been vigilant over

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some years ago we did a survey across the country to make sure 
we understood the nature of the challenge.  Since that time 
Health Canada has been working closely with aboriginal

safe drinking water.  That effort continues.  We have challenges

Mr. Speaker, there was a different government in place in 1990,

</I></B></P><P align=left>A process was put in place with respect to improving the quality 
of gasoline, reducing the sulphur in gasoline, reducing the 
sulphur in diesel, improving the quality of the vehicles, and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, actually the hon. member is somewhat mistaken.  The

with respect to automobiles and with respect to Imperial Oil. 
He may have heard of the discussions between Imperial Oil and

<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Minister of Labour, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-12, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code (Part II) 
in respect of occupational health and safety, to make technical 
amendments to the Canada Labour Code (Part I) and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, be read the third time 
and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, it feels very good to rise today to 
begin third reading of Bill C-12.  It feels good because we are 
coming to the end of a long journey.  I want to express my 
gratitude to my friends on all sides of the House for their hard 
work on Bill C-12 and for the quick manner in which they handled 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members recognized that we are not dealing with just another 
labour bill but we are in fact talking about people's health and 
safety on the job.  Their input was serious, their questions 
thoughtful, their concerns valid and their suggestions helpful. 
Further, I want to thank previous ministers who supported the 
review of part II. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to acknowledge with gratitude the effort of the 
labour and management people who were charged with extremely 
demanding and complex tasks, first, to review the existing 
legislation and identify the issues that needed to be addressed 
and second, to come to a consensus on possible reform to part II. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They did their jobs exceptionally well and were able to devise 
consensus based proposals.  That could not have been easy. Again 
I want to thank them for their perseverance, their seriousness of 
purpose and their openness to alternative approaches.  They 
demonstrated as I have said numerous times that this country is 
blessed with durable and effective labour relations institutions 
and organizations and with professional, dedicated and prudent 
labour relations practitioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have learned over the years that progress in occupational 
safety and health comes only when we, the government, employers 
and labour, work together. We have also learned that working 
together, teamwork, co-operation and partnership building are not 
just warm and fuzzy concepts but absolutely essential ingredients 
for effective action.  We need each other's experience, resources 
and wisdom if significant declines in work related accidents, 
injuries and diseases are to be achieved. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past couple of decades, many profound changes have 
occurred in the workplace, in the workforce and in the economy. 
The fundamental objective of our reforms is to ensure that the 
primary federal labour law responds to those changes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-12 represents the second phase of our three-phase 
initiative to modernize the Canada Labour Code.  Amendments to 
part I of the code, which deals with the conduct of industrial 
relations, received Royal Assent last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part III of the code—dealing with labour standards—is being 
reviewed now. I hope to be able to bring forward amendments 
early next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever since 1985, when the last significant amendments to part II 
were passed by the House, there have been important changes in 
the way we organize and do our work.  Some were welcome changes 
and some were very worrisome. 
The law cannot ignore those new realities.  I know we made a 
good start with our amendments to part I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel very positive about the bill before us today to amend 
part II, and the review of part III is proceeding well.  It 
seems to me that the updating of the Canada Labour Code is a 
fitting way for legislators to launch the second century of the 
federal labour program. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part II of the code is based on basic principles.  One is that 
employees have certain rights when it comes to their health and 
safety.  They have the right to know about workplace hazards, the 
right to participate in health and safety matters and the right 
to refuse dangerous work.  In recognizing these rights, part II 
also takes care not to unduly infringe on the employer's right to 
manage the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second principle is that the government must empower employees 
and employers to assume responsibility for the regulation of 
their workplaces.  Employees and employers ought to be equipped 
with the means to identify and deal with health and safety issues 
in their own backyard, so to speak.  Of course, this is not to 
say that the government has no responsibility for the health and 
safety of employees, or that there is no room for direct 
government intervention, but the obligation for achieving a safe 
workplace rests with both the employer and the employee.  Those 
people ought to have the authority and the primary responsibility 
to address those issues because they are the ones who will feel 
the consequences of inaction on health and safety issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-12 not only adheres to but also gives further expressions 
to these fundamental principles.  How it does so will become 
evident as I review its main features. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill brings in several important changes to part II, but 
there are four that I think are especially noteworthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the legislation provides for an innovative, new internal 
complaint resolution process, by which the parties themselves, 
not a government officer, will solve their workplace health and 
safety problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this new process, if an employee has a complaint, the 
employee and the supervisor are required to try to resolve the 
matter between them as soon as possible.  If they cannot do so, 
they can refer the problem to the workplace health and safety 
committee or, in the case of smaller organizations, to the 
health and safety representative, and the matter will then be 
jointly investigated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the parties cannot come to an agreement, or if the employer 
does not accept the results of the investigation or fails to act 
on the matter, then and only then will a government official 
intervene.  When appropriate, he or she may intervene simply by 
requesting that the parties try again to resolve the issue 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the health and safety officer retains the authority 
to act decisively if a danger exists or if the parties cannot 
come to an agreement.  But I think we can all see the wisdom in 
giving the parties every opportunity to settle their problems 
themselves.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, the bill also strengthens the local workplace health 
and safety committees in a number of ways.  For instance, they 
will be able to do workplace inspections and to participate in 
the implementation of changes that might affect health and 
safety, including changes that pertain to work processes and 
procedures.  Where there is no corporate health and safety policy 
committee, they will be involved in the development of 
occupational health and safety policy.  If this is not local 
empowerment, I do not know what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third important feature of this bill is the requirement to 
establish a joint health and safety policy committee at the 
corporate level in enterprises with 300 or more employees.  These 
committees will meet at least quarterly to address issues that 
have company-wide application.  They will participate in the 
development of health and safety policies for the organizations. 
They will deal quickly with matters referred to them by the 
workplace committees.  They will participate in studies, 
inspections and investigations pertaining to occupational health 
and safety and they will assist in planning changes to enhance 
workplace health and safety.  They will also be able to request 
from the employer any information necessary to identify actual or 
potential workplace hazards, and they will have full access to 
all of the government and employer reports, studies and tests 
related to the health and safety of employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The range of issues that the policy committees can deal with is 
very wide and includes prevention and awareness raising 
activities.  By requiring these committees we will ensure that 
health and safety issues receive the attention they deserve from 
the people who have the authority to make things happen.  The 
committees will see to it that health and safety priorities make 
it to the corporate agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their existence will also be tremendously reassuring to 
employees who, for whatever reason, feel that the safety of the 
workplace is of little concern to the higher ups.  For the local 
health and safety committees, the new policy committees are 
likely to be a motivating factor because they will see that 
senior people in the organization take occupational safety and 
health just as seriously as they do. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fourth change to the bill is consistent with the Government of 
Canada's plans to encourage family-friendly workplaces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This change expands the employee's right to refuse dangerous work, by 
giving to a female employee who believes that her job conditions 
pose a danger to her, the fetus or the baby she is nursing the 
right to leave the workplace until she has had a reasonable 
opportunity to obtain a medical certificate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While she is seeking this certificate, her employer will have 
the right to assign the woman to other duties or require her to 
remain at work in a safe location, and she will still be 
entitled to the normal pay and benefits attached to her job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If her physician determines that there is no danger to her, the 
fetus or child, the woman's right to cease her work will no 
longer be in force.  If the physician confirms the risk, she 
will be able to turn to the protection of part III of the code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the major reforms that Bill C-12 makes to part II of 
the Canada Labour Code.  I believe they are sound, progressive 
and meaningful, and that they will be effective and help to 
restore the downward trend in workplace casualties in the 
federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude, I would like to draw the members' attention 
to some of the other important changes that this bill will make 
to part II. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the right to refuse will be clarified in a couple of 
ways.  All employees who have been prevented from working 
because a colleague has exercised a refusal will be paid until 
the end of the shift. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employee exercising the right of refusal will be paid until 
the matter has been resolved  In addition, to ensure that the 
right to refuse is not used frivolously, the employer will be 
able to discipline an employee if he can demonstrate that the 
right to refuse was abused.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last several years, we have become aware of the 
importance of ergonomics to the prevention of a wide range of 
physical ailments.  Those of you who have spent time in front of 
a computer monitor will know what I mean here.  We have, 
therefore, inserted a provision in the bill that will allow us 
to address ergonomic standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, in response to the growing problem of workplace rage, 
we have included a clause that requires employers to take the 
necessary steps to prevent and protect against violence in the 
workplace. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will inject new energy into our efforts 
to reduce workplace casualties.  It provides important new 
mechanisms to address health and safety issues.  It reaffirms the 
faith of the federal government in the capacity of labour and 
management to solve the health and safety problems that they 
encounter in their own workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Occupational health and safety is a very important matter.  The 
extent to which we succeed in protecting our employees from 
hazards and diseases is a measure of our social progress, our 
civility and our sense of what is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>History seems to show that progressive workplace health and 
safety policy is also good economic policy.  Let history show 
that, as this country soared to new economic heights, its record 
in reducing workplace casualties was second to none.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to address Bill C-12 finally at third 
reading, a bill which may have become known as the Friday file 
because of its habit of coming up on Fridays every time it came 
before the House.  I would like to thank my colleagues who stood 
in for me from time to time to make sure that someone from our 
party addressed the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at third reading of Bill C-12, which will amend part II 
of the Canada Labour Code.  It deals specifically with workplace 
health and safety for employees and businesses which fall under 
federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Workers, managers and even federal bureaucrats I am sure will 
all breathe a sigh of relief when Bill C-12 receives third 
reading and goes to the other place.  Bill C-12 is an example of 
a consensus agreement that has been some 10 years in the making. I 
do not know why it should necessarily have taken 10 years.  I am 
sure that the process could have been hastened a lot.  I would 
admonish the government for taking so terribly long to get this 
done.  We have heard about the possibility of amendments to part 
II of the labour code for some time, and finally we see that it 
has come to fruition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that labour legislation should ever be changed on 
a whim.  I am pleased that the government, when it decided to 
change it, went to the stakeholders, who realized that since 
these amendments were needed to reflect a changing workplace they 
should all work together to develop a viable solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also a bit disappointed that the government refused to 
negotiate on the labour-management consensus that called for a 
two tier appeal process.  The appeal process in the bill does not 
meet their needs.  This came through loud and clear during 
committee hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the current statute, decisions made by the regional safety 
officer can be appealed to the Canada Industrial Relations Board. 
Under the streamlined provisions set out in this bill, the 
mandate of the appeals officer has been strengthened.  Any 
decision rendered by the appeals officer will now be final, and 
the only recourse is to take the issue to the Federal Court of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance supports the removal of unnecessary red 
tape, but in this case a two tier appeal process could save the 
parties the hassle and expense of bringing a disputed directive 
to the Federal Court of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister's officials appeared before the committee 
studying Bill C-12, they indicated that over the last 10 years 
about 1,800 directives had been issued by their officers.  Of 
those there were only 179 appeals, or about 10%.  Fifteen of them 
were appealed to the federal court and only two were because the 
appeals officer's ruling was overturned by CIRB.  In light of the 
small number of appeals, the burden on the CIRB certainly would 
not be an onerous one.  Yet the government chose to deny the 
stakeholders a second level of appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If only 10% of the directives are ever appealed to the federal 
court, the inclusion of a two tier appeal process could cut the 
number of appeals to the federal court considerably.  It may not 
be as lucrative for the lawyers, but it could save labour and 
management considerable time and expense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The successful tripartite consultative process that spawned this 
legislation will hopefully bring about regulations that are 
equally acceptable to all parties.  Indeed, when we were 
researching the bill and when we talked to stakeholders, we found 
very little resistance to what was in the bill from anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consultation with stakeholders does not just mean that the 
government gives a few representatives a chance to present their 
concerns and then unilaterally imposes the Liberal will. 
Unfortunately this is what happened in the case of the 
trucking industry.  The government decided 
that this safety apparatus was essential and would be implemented 
according to its timetable without concern or regard for the 
impact on truck owners, drivers or operators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All too often government consultation is just as one-sided as 
that.  For instance, when the minister decided to implement the 
fair wage schedules it made little difference that the schedules 
were not necessary and had not been activated in years. 
Apparently it also made little difference that the consultation 
process was flawed.  The fact that the surveys were botched did 
not seem to matter much to the minister either.  In the end, it 
is the Canadian taxpayer who will pay the higher cost for 
contracts carried out at federal sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The success of the consultative process employed in developing 
Bill C-12 should be extended to all legislative and regulatory 
areas under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Labour.  Bill 
C-12 is now on its way to the other place.  The focus now turns 
to the much anticipated overhaul of part III of the labour code. 
The minister mentioned that in her speech.  We could only hope 
that the minister and her officials will endeavour to reach the 
same kind of consensus obtained with the health and safety 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part III of the code may perhaps have the greatest impact on 
everyday lives of workers in the federally regulated sector. 
Amendments to this part of the code should stand as a model for 
the provinces to emulate.  They should not be rushed into the 
House as a pre-election ploy as we saw with the health and safety 
amendments back in 1997.  The government tabled those changes in 
April 1997 just days before the election was called.  I cannot 
understand why it would take more than two years before Bill C-12 
was introduced again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the minister will learn from Bill C-12 that she can bring 
in whatever it is on part III of the code and that we can discuss 
it and repair it where it needs to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the groundwork laid by the tripartite group Bill C-12 
was reasonable.  It met with little opposition from any party in 
the House.  We in the Canadian Alliance willingly co-operated at 
all stages of the debate.  I ask the minister to ensure that it 
be proclaimed without further delay.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, some speeches 
are uniquely important and meaningful.  The speech I am making 
today in this House is in fact one such important speech. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, and clearly, the federal government does not see 
it that way.  For the Minister of Labour and the government 
opposite, Bill C-12 is just one bill among many, period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will remember that Bill C-12 is the in-depth reform of part II 
of the Canada Labour Code and, more particularly, as it concerns 
occupational health and safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will no doubt recall that at first reading the Bloc 
Quebecois supported Bill C-12, since it is the practice of the 
Bloc Quebecois, in its great wisdom, to give the government the 
benefit of the doubt when it introduces bills that are 
constructive in spirit and intent. 
I nevertheless added, however, that it was vital the federal 
government be open-minded so that certain amendments to Bill C-12 
to be proposed by the Bloc Quebecois could be made.  Absolutely 
nothing happened.  Utter nothingness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois introduced very reasonable amendments that 
substantially improved the bill.  These changes took nothing 
away from the substance of Bill C-12, on the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois introduced amendments so that the process for 
hiring health and safety officers and filling many other 
positions could be neutral under the Public Service Employment 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, we also presented amendments to enable pregnant and 
nursing women to take preventive withdrawal worthy of such a 
name.  We introduced many other amendments as well. 
But, as I said earlier, the minister sat idly and remained 
unmoved by our amendments. Yet, our goal was only to make Bill 
C-12 better suited to the new realities of the workplaces 
governed by the Canada Labour Code. But, as is its habit, the 
government turned a deaf ear. It just wanted to go it alone 
through the legislative process. This is what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, for all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois will, at third 
reading, have no choice but to oppose Bill C-12. I will get back 
to these reasons and provide more in depth explanations later on 
in my speech. But first, I would like to paint a picture of the 
situation regarding occupational health and safety for workers 
subject to part II of the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin this gloomy account by quoting from the brief 
submitted by the Canadian Labour Congress, the CLC, to the 
Standing Committee on Natural Resources and Government 
Operations, when it reviewed Bill C-12. Here is what it says on 
page 5 of the French version: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is the only jurisdiction where the rate of injury has in 
fact increased during most of the last decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ratio of federal inspectors to the number of workers being 
inspected is among the worst in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government waited over 15 years before reforming 
part II of the Canada Labour Code. 
Meanwhile, however, every year in Canada some 800,000 people 
experience a work-related accident or illness.  Of that number, 
more than 750 die, which represents an average of three deaths 
per day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, an average of one in sixteen employees was hurt on the 
job, the equivalent of one every 9.1 seconds of working hours. 
One in thirty-one was injured seriously enough to be off work at 
least one day, which means that there is one accident with lost 
time every eighteen seconds in the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, 38 deaths from occupational illness or accident were 
reported in industries under federal jurisdiction.  The figure 
was the same in 1995.  One death from an on-the-job accident 
occurs every seven days on average, or approximately one worker 
in 20,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rate of accidents resulting in disability rose from 15 per 
million hours worked in 1995 to 15.24 in 1996.  The 1996 level 
was not as high as the 15.44 recorded in 1994, and is markedly 
lower than the 1993 level of 16.99. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economic cost of these accidents is very high.  Compensation 
payments to victims or their families total some $5 billion per 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we add on the indirect costs of accidents, the figure doubles 
to close to $10 billion. We are very much aware that these 
figures do not take into account the incalculable pain and 
suffering experienced by victims and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the light of these statistics, it is high time the Minister 
of Labour did something.  I do not know how the present 
government feels to have so many deaths on its conscience. It 
would appear that this reality does not overly disturb the 
Minister of Labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, since the beginning of the legislative process for Bill 
C-12, the minister has shown very little interest in the reform 
of Part II of the Canada Labour Code.  We know that the 
minister, for personal reasons, was unable to appear before the 
committee to explain her bill.  We understand that perfectly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what explanation is there for the fact that the 
minister did not take advantage of report stage in the House to 
come and explain her bill in order to make up for her absence 
before the parliamentary committee?  Instead, it was her 
parliamentary secretary, who is in the House now, who spoke at 
report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To top it all, and this really shows how interested the Minister 
of Labour and the government are in this whole reform of Part II 
of the Canada Labour Code, the member for Rivière-des-Mille-Îles 
had to make a point of calling the Minister of Labour to order 
here in the House because she was not listening and was showing 
no interest at all in the remarks of my colleague, who was in 
the process of offering some very enlightening explanations 
about Bill C-12, specifically with respect to pregnant and 
nursing women and the bill's serious deficiencies in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this federal government, one more bad move will not make 
any difference.  Taking Bill C-12 as an example, I am going to 
show just how illogical the federal government is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During one of the committee's meetings on Bill C-12, the Bloc 
Quebecois presented an amendment to improve the definition of 
the word “danger”. 
We took absolutely nothing away from the definition.  On the 
contrary, we improved it and made it more precise by setting out 
in it that the sources of danger should not affect pregnant or 
nursing women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To our great surprise, the Bloc Quebecois amendment was passed 
at the stage of clause by clause examination in committee.  The 
Liberal member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik even supported the 
Bloc Quebecois amendment with great pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, imagine my surprise at learning that the minister also 
introduced an amendment at report stage thereby destroying the 
Bloc Quebecois amendment in order to reinstate the original 
definition of “danger” in Bill C-12.  Does that make sense to 
you? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One day the Liberals say yes and a few days later, on the same 
issue, they say no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to a question by my colleague, the member for 
Longueuil, the Minister of Labour said—and note the insipid, 
meaningless and uninterested explanation the Minister of Labour 
gave to my colleague—and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois amendment concerning the definition of 
“danger” is addressed by part III of the Labour Code, and this 
will be discussed by employees and employers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, how can the minister claim that the definition of 
“danger” is covered in part III of the Canada Labour Code, when 
she said later on in her answer that employees and employers 
will discuss it?  That is in the future.  Are we going to have 
to wait another 15 years to discuss it, as was the case with the 
reform of part II? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This response proves just how little the Minister of Labour 
knows her Canada Labour Code, since part III contains absolutely 
no reference to danger for pregnant and nursing women.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is totally disinterested and uninformed about the 
reform of part II of the Canada Labour Code, and of the Canada 
Labour Code as a whole. I would advise the minister to do her 
homework as quickly as possible, because she is misleading the 
House, and this is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois also proposed amendments to clause 132 so 
that pregnant or nursing women would be eligible for a true 
preventative withdrawal. Again, the minister misled the House in 
a reply to my colleague, the hon. member for Longueuil. The 
minister said, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—this is available to pregnant and nursing women under section 
132 of the Canada Labour Code (Part II). It was negotiated for 
seven years with employees and employers. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is clear and the minister knows it full well: there is 
a consensus on clause 132 of Bill C-12, which deals with pregnant 
and nursing employees, but that consensus is clearly to the 
effect that clause 132 is largely inadequate, and I will 
demonstrate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the hearings of the committee, various interest groups 
invited not only by the Bloc Quebecois but also by the 
government came to express their views. Here is what these 
groups had to say about clause 132 of Bill C-12, entitled 
“Pregnant and Nursing Employees”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its brief, the CAW, one of the major unions representing 
workers at the federal level, described clause 132 as “not going 
far enough, however, and lacking clarity”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Public Service Alliance of Canada's brief, the 
amendments to clause 132 “do not go far enough to provide the 
necessary health and safety protection for these workers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CSN, which represents more than 235,000 workers in Quebec, 
said the following about clause 132 “This text is incongruous 
and renders the entire provision meaningless”.  Further on in 
its brief it adds “This text does not create a right but rather 
a problem for pregnant workers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Association des médecins du réseau public en santé au 
travail du Québec submitted a brief over the signatures of 13 
occupational health and safety specialist physicians in which 
the following comment was made about preventive withdrawal under 
the federal legislation “In our opinion, clause 132 of Bill C-12 
is much too timid and will not protect the workers who need 
protection most”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Katherine Lippel, a law professor at the Université du Québec à 
Montréal, and one of the leading Canadian specialists in 
preventive withdrawal from the workplace, commented “Bill C-12 as 
it now stands does not provide for protective reassignment that 
includes the right to benefits when reassignment is not 
available. In failing to do so, it proposes a right that is 
really an empty shell”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same consensus was present at a symposium on the health of 
women in the workplace held from March 26 to 28, 1998 at the 
Université du Québec à Montréal. 
Health Canada was one of the sponsors of that event, which was 
attended by experts and organizations from Quebec and from 
Canada.  The following is a partial list.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Equally credible experts and organizations came from Manitoba, 
Saskatchewan, Ontario, Newfoundland and even Sweden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the conclusion of the conference, the participants agreed on 
a plan of action entitled “Improving the Health of Women in the 
Workplace”.  Everyone supported this action plan and reached the 
same conclusion.  It warrants attention.  I quote the document: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation in all jurisdictions, federal and provincial, should 
provide for the protective reassignment of pregnant or nursing 
women, if their working conditions are hazardous to their health 
or that of their fetus or nursing infant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such programs should draw on Quebec legislation, which provides 
for reassignment to a job presenting no hazard...They should 
include, when worker reassignment is not possible, the right to 
compensation equivalent to that related to incapacity as the 
result of an accident on the job. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, Quebec is at the forefront in social policy. 
Unfortunately, this cannot be said of the Minister of Labour and 
her government.  However, with Bill C-12, the minister could show 
her open-mindedness and her concern for the health of women and 
more particularly those who are pregnant or nursing.  But this 
is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is asking the minister to follow the example 
of the Health Canada officials and the various women and 
agencies present at this conference and to allow pregnant or 
nursing women covered by the Canada Labour Code the same 
benefits as pregnant women covered by Quebec's occupational 
health and safety legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This request comes not just from the Bloc Quebecois, but from 
the vast majority of occupational health and safety agencies and 
experts in Quebec and in Canada.  The consensus is there: now 
the minister must take action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can safely say that the real consensus around clause 132 has 
to do with the fact that it falls short, requiring the minister 
and her senior officials to go back to the drawing board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through its proposed amendment to clause 132, the Bloc Quebecois 
seeks to end this two-tier regime, which leaves women in Quebec 
who work under federal legislation less well protected than 
those who work under Quebec's legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women working under Quebec's legislation who withdraw for 
preventive reasons are paid during the first week by their 
employer, and thereafter by the CSST at 90% of their net salary. 
All workers are thus not treated equally in Quebec.  This is a 
good example of the problems encountered by Quebec when it tries 
to establish a comprehensive occupational or family strategy, or 
when it tries to reconcile occupational and family 
considerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Minister of Labour say that pregnant or nursing 
women have the right to preventive withdrawal with financial 
compensation?  This is just smoke and mirrors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 132 of Bill C-12 gives a woman the right to refuse to work 
if she believes that this may constitute a risk for herself or 
the unborn child.  She will continue to be paid and to retain 
all benefits until such time as she obtains a medical opinion as 
to whether or not there is a risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As soon as this is obtained, she can no longer make use of 
clause 132(1).  That is it.  From that point on, the expectant 
mother has two unacceptable choices: shorten her maternity 
leave, or work in conditions that are a danger to her health or 
her baby's health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the only real financial compensation to which pregnant 
or nursing workers are entitled under federal legislation is the 
maternity leave given under employment insurance.  Comparing 
this to the CSST program, this is a pittance. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This employment insurance program discriminates against pregnant 
women as far as maternity leave is concerned.  Employment 
insurance provides protection for maternity leave but access to 
the program is tied to hours worked.  The requirement is a 
minimum of 600 hours worked over the past year; as well, the 
amount will be between 55% and 50% of her earnings, as opposed 
to Quebec's 90%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, it must be kept in mind that, if a pregnant woman has 
to take several weeks of maternity leave prior to delivery 
because her workplace is dangerous for her and her fetus, those 
weeks will be deducted after the birth, which means that the new 
mother will not only have to face a substantial loss of income, 
but she will also have a shorter time to be at home with her 
beloved new-born. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Labour states in this House that clause 132 
of Bill C-12 provides withdrawal from the work place for 
preventive purposes with financial compensation equal to that 
available in Quebec, this is quite simply misleading the House. 
Nothing more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not the only one who thinks so.  All unions and all experts 
who appeared before the committee said the same: the preventive 
withdrawal allowed at the federal level is far from sufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is impossible to understand the position of this government 
on the treatment of pregnant and nursing women when we realize 
that 800,000 people annually are injured or become sick in the 
exercise of their duties.  Of this number, over 750 die as a 
result, a figure that represents an average of three deaths a 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why then make a point of swelling the statistics?  According to 
Statistics Canada, in 1993, women represented 43% of paid 
employees, compared to 35% in 1971.  From this fact alone, the 
number of women who are victims of accidents on the job has also 
increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, pregnant women tend to stay at work longer before 
they give birth, because their financial situation is more often 
than not precarious.  In addition, they return to work earlier 
after the birth of their child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another consequence of this new reality is that women today tend 
to have fewer children and at an older age.  The government is 
well aware of this fact.  So why is it insisting on pushing 
future mothers governed by the Canada Labour Code into totally 
unacceptable misery? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will this government assume its responsibilities and do 
what the interest groups have been asking, namely, provide 
pregnant and nursing women covered by the Canada Labour Code 
working in Quebec with the possibility of protective 
reassignment as Quebec has? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois was not yet even in the House of Commons when 
our leader, the member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie, tabled, on June 
1, 1993, an amendment to Bill C-101 introduced by the Progressive 
Conservative government then in power.  This bill was also a 
reform of the Canada Labour Code. The purpose of the amendment 
was to ensure that federally employed pregnant or nursing 
workers would have the right to preventive withdrawal under the 
legislation of the province in which they work.  This is exactly 
what the Bloc Quebecois is seeking in this amendment in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the irony of fate, or power, the Liberal Party of 
Canada, which was then in opposition, supported the amendment 
brought forward by the member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie, the future 
leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  When I say that this government 
is basically dishonest, and I would even say acting in bad 
faith, here is the proof today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the Liberal Party is in power and the idea of actually 
giving pregnant or nursing employees the right to preventive 
withdrawal—a right they have in Quebec—does not come from within 
the Liberal Party, the federal Liberals have voted against. 
This is unjustified and unjustifiable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois amendment is a completely reasonable motion, 
which imposes nothing, because it is clearly stated in our 
amendment that there should—this is an obligation—be negotiations 
between the federal and provincial governments. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that the Bloc Quebecois wanted was for pregnant or nursing 
employees governed by the Canada Labour Code to be able with 
complete dignity and safety, not just physical but financial, to 
experience one of the most extraordinary events imaginable, that 
being pregnancy and the birth of a new being.  Unfortunately, 
for the federal government, pregnancy is something that is 
completely trivialized, not to say neglected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bad faith and lack of conscience is all the more evident 
because what the Bloc Quebecois is asking for in its amendment 
to clause 132 is nothing extraordinary or unusual, nor any 
special privilege for pregnant workers.  No, what the Bloc 
Quebecois is calling for is fairness and equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, moreover, like to remind hon. members that, between 
1981 and 1988, employers under federal jurisdiction were paying 
the portion that corresponded to the CSST preventive withdrawal 
allowance, since the courts had not yet reached a decision on 
the constitutionality of that program.  Some women who came 
under federal jurisdiction even received CSST benefits for 
preventive withdrawal.  The system does work.  It has proven 
itself several times in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another proof that there can indeed be agreements between the 
federal and the provincial levels as far as financial 
compensation is concerned: in Quebec, people employed by the 
federal government who have an occupational illness or injury 
are referred to the CSST for compensation purposes.  I would 
invite the Minister of Labour and all of the hon. members across 
the way to look at section 4 of Quebec's government employees 
compensation legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-12, clause 140(2) reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>140.(2) The Minister may, with the approval of the Governor in 
Council, enter into an agreement with any province or any 
provincial body specifying the terms and conditions under which 
a person employed by that province or provincial body may act as 
a health and safety officer— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could cite a lot of other examples where agreements have been 
signed between the federal government and the government of a 
province on a given provision of law.  Well, then, with the 
government talking about its flexible federalism, why is there 
no flexibility on the preventive withdrawal of pregnant or 
nursing workers under federal jurisdiction?  What is the federal 
government afraid of? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a consensus among interest groups clearly advocating 
substantial improvement in federal preventive withdrawal 
conditions.  As I have just shown, the system works.  The Bloc 
Quebecois amendment now permits the federal government and the 
provinces to negotiate in good faith an administrative and 
financial agreement giving female workers under federal 
jurisdiction recourse to the legislation on preventive 
withdrawal of the province they work in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the elements are in place to permit Quebec women working 
for in federal jurisdiction to be on the same footing as their 
colleagues covered by Quebec legislation on occupational health 
and safety.  The federal government no longer has an excuse.  So 
why this inaction on the part of the Minister of Labour and the 
federal government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's attitude is not only shameful, it may turn out 
to be criminal, since this government is threatening the life of 
certain women and their unborn children.  And this is 
unacceptable.  Count on me and the Bloc Quebecois to remind the 
people of Quebec and my riding of the Laurentides of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has now been fighting seven years on behalf 
of pregnant and nursing women.  This issue is important to us. 
I can assure you that the Bloc Quebecois will continue 
determinedly to fight for just and equality. 
Women of Quebec and Canada, the Bloc Quebecois is behind you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fight continues, and I invite you to join us in getting this 
Liberal government and its Minister of Labour to understand that 
pregnant and nursing women under federal jurisdiction are also 
entitled to work in an environment free of all danger.  This is 
a matter of humanity, health, respect, fairness and justice.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to enter this final stage of debate on Bill C-12, a bill 
that we have all watched with great interest.  There has been 
great interest from labour, management and government in a truly 
tripartite way to deal with the issues of the bill and to move it 
forward within this session.  I am very appreciative of that and 
of having the opportunity to debate the bill today, prior to the 
House adjourning for the summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians agree that no one should be injured, butchered, 
maimed or killed in a workplace on behalf of some arbitrary 
production schedule.  It would be crazy to indicate otherwise. 
Canadians are justifiably shocked and horrified when they hear of 
people being injured, butchered, killed or poisoned on the job. 
They feel very passionately about this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all agree that Canadians get up in the morning and go to work 
to earn a living, not to be killed.  “It is your life and you 
should not leave work without it” is the motto we use in the 
labour movement.  Yet, given that commonly shared sensibility, in 
Canada three people per day are killed at work.  Almost 1,000 
people per year die an avoidable and needless death in the 
workplace.  Beyond that, every year over one million people 
suffer some form of lost time due to accident injuries which 
prevent them from doing their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from all the moral and ethical reasons for cleaning up the 
workplace and putting an end to this carnage, there is an 
economic side to it.  There is a very practical side to why 
Canadian industry, Canadians in general and the Government of 
Canada should be very concerned about lost time due to accidents 
and injuries, and that is productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada is so concerned about being competitive 
internationally and keeping the levels of productivity high, 
surely we would want to address the issue of lost time due to 
injuries and accidents in the workplace.  We are seeing a shared 
interest in addressing that concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of illustration, in my province of Manitoba we lose 
approximately 50,000 person days per year due to strikes and 
lockouts, due to labour unrest.  During that same period of time 
we lose 550,000 person days per year due to injuries incurred 
from accidents on the job.  If we are serious about productivity 
and lost time as an issue, surely we are better to address that 
concern and clean up the workplace when, clearly, ten times as 
many days are lost due to injuries than to any kind of labour 
unrest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-12, as has been pointed out by other speakers today, was 
the result of many years of broad consultation by business, 
labour and government.  The lamentable thing about us dealing 
with it today is that it should have been dealt with years ago. 
The tripartite working group that arrived at the recommendations 
to amend part II of the Canada Labour Code prepared its consensus 
document years ago and was just waiting for the government to 
move it forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these issues were dealt with at the committee, and I 
believe there was a lot of goodwill at that committee.  I know 
people who sat on that committee for many years.  People were 
very generous in their co-operative approach. Like any 
negotiations and bargaining sessions, people arrived with firm 
opinions on each side, but they tempered their demands with 
reason and, over a period of time, over an exhaustive series of 
meetings and a huge contribution made by all who took part, they 
honed down those positions to round out the package which we now 
see before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were negotiations in the truest sense of the word.  I think 
that serves as a model for creating legislation like this.  This 
kind of legislation should be non-partisan.  It should be dealt 
with in a way that is non-confrontational.  What could be more 
important and what could be more realistic than the safety of 
Canadian workers in the workplace? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This process certainly should be commented upon and should be 
applauded.  This is how this type of legislation should be 
crafted in the future.  It should stand as a model.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-12 has many good qualities.  I sit as a member of the 
executive council of the Canadian Labour Congress.  All of the 
affiliate members of the Canadian Labour Congress have had a 
great deal of input and opportunity to review these amendments. 
They feel that for the membership they represent this bill has a 
great deal of merit and it will make Canadian workplaces safer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the qualities have been pointed out by other speakers. 
I do not think it is necessary for me to itemize on a clause by 
clause basis what we like about the bill, but I will say briefly 
that the bill really emphasizes three things about workers in the 
Canadian workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it emphasizes, establishes and augments a worker's right 
to know about hazards in the workplace.  That is key and 
fundamental.  Workers have a right to know what they are dealing 
with, what products they are dealing with, and any inherent 
dangers they may be faced with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond that, because of the increasingly complex workplaces we 
are representing, sometimes the compounding of materials 
influences the different properties they are dealing with.  For 
instance, a person may be working with chemical <I>A</I> which is 
completely benign and chemical <I>B</I> which is completely 
benign, but when the two of them are mixed together in the 
kidneys they blow up into chemical <I>C</I>, making for a very 
sick person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Workers have a right to know and that is why, under this 
legislation, there is a system called WHMIS, the workplace 
hazardous material information system.  Any worker has the right 
to ask for and be given the exact composition of the materials 
they are dealing with and any inherent problems that may arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing which Bill C-12 will establish in part II of 
the Canada Labour Code is the right to take part in correcting 
those hazards.  In other words, the right to sit on workplace 
safety and health committees.  It is mandated by the Canada 
Labour Code that these committees will be formed and that they 
will be charged with a mandate.  Their powers and their authority 
have been augmented by Bill C-12, which is a very positive step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third fundamental employee right that is recognized and 
institutionalized in part II of the Canada Labour Code is the 
right to refuse.  A person has the right to know what the hazards 
are, the right to participate in correcting those hazards, and 
the right to refuse unsafe work.  It is one of the most basic, 
fundamental rights and freedoms that we have to withhold services 
if we feel strongly enough that something will pose a danger to 
ourselves and our fellow workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-12 strengthens and emphasizes the worker's right to 
refuse and the protections for both the employer and the 
employee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sought amendments to Bill C-12.  The spirit of co-operation 
extended beyond the tripartite working group to those of us who 
came later as critics in this field.  We agreed that we would not 
introduce any amendments which went beyond the tripartite 
agreement and consensus building process.  The only amendments we 
sought were where we thought the language was unclear or 
ambiguous, or if in our opinion the article did not accurately 
reflect the consensus position of the committee, and there were 
some cases like that, or if the article was brand new and we felt 
it was arbitrarily put in place by government without ever going 
by the tripartite process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We found it necessary to ask for amendments in two or three 
areas, and I am pleased to report today that we got co-operation 
from the committee to amend Bill C-12 in three important areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We eliminated the definition of health altogether.  We felt it 
was better off to rely on standard definitions of health found 
elsewhere than it was to have what we thought was poor language 
in the definition of health within the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We managed to delete a clause which dealt with mandatory medical 
examinations and testing.  We felt this was an infringement of 
basic human rights and workers' rights, that they do not have to 
participate in those things unless they are voluntary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We succeeded in clarifying when an employee would be disciplined 
for making a right to refuse unsafe work action when it was not 
warranted. 
In other words, if it can be demonstrated that the employee acted 
in a malicious or vexatious way and was pulling a right to 
refuse, or misusing his or her right to refuse, then we agree 
that some discipline would be warranted.  However, we want it 
clarified that the burden of proof and the onus has to be on the 
employer to demonstrate that the employee willingly and willfully 
abused his or her right and that there was malice and mischief 
associated with it.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All three of those amendments add to the quality of Bill C-12. 
We have probably saved ourselves a fortune in arbitrations and 
court challenges based on the language of those three amendments 
that we made.  All of them would have been challenged extensively 
had they gone through unamended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it is an example of how the system works.  If we bring 
things to the attention of people who genuinely care about a 
bill, they will respond in a reasonable way.  We are very pleased 
that the committee co-operated with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some things still need to be done.  Unfortunately we are very 
critical that we were unable to amend the appeal process.  The 
joint labour-management working tripartite committee all agreed 
that there should be a two stage appeal process and an arm's 
length process to distance it from the bureaucracy and the 
department.  We did not achieve that.  What went forward in Bill 
C-12 is an appeal process which we believe is flawed and we hope 
there will be an opportunity to revisit this process in the very 
near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that Bill C-12 will be passed so that its many good 
qualities will be implemented, but we look forward to and serve 
notice that we will be seeking to improve the appeal process at 
the earliest opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another poignant issue comes to mind when we are dealing with 
the issue of workplace safety and health.  It may be beyond the 
scope of Bill C-12, but our legal opinions have it that it could 
have been addressed within the purview of Bill C-12; that is, the 
recommendations of the Westray inquiry as they apply to 
introducing the concept of corporate accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, if there is gross negligence in a workplace to 
the point where it kills Canadian workers, if corporate greed 
leads to corporate murder, then there should be corporate 
accountability.  This was the recommendation of Justice Peter 
Richard of the Westray inquiry in November 1997.  This ruling is 
almost three years old and we have been calling upon the 
government to take action to implement the recommendations of the 
Westray inquiry along those lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that in the next two weeks every member of 
parliament will be visited by members of the United Steelworkers 
of America who are on the Hill, to their credit, to represent the 
families of the 26 Westray miners who met their death at the 
Westray disaster.  They, too, are here to appeal to parliament to 
do this one thing.  Our goal and objective is not to put 
executives into prison.  It is to make them take note that for 
any enterprise over which they have direction and control, they 
have an obligation and responsibility to do at least the minimum 
required by law to ensure that their enterprise is clean, safe, 
healthy and does not pose a threat to Canadian workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were joined at our press conference with the steelworkers on 
Monday by Robert Ellis, a businessman from Burlington, Ontario, 
whose son, 18-year old David Ellis, was killed on his second day 
at work in a bread mixing machine at a small privately owned 
bakery.  It was a high school job and he would have gone to 
university the following fall.  He was pulled into the mixing 
machine and killed in a tragic accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in that case, where such gross negligence killed a 
Canadian worker, that it was corporate manslaughter, and we are 
not afraid to call it that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another example in my own riding where a chop shop or 
scrap metal yard often hires young summer students.  One summer 
student was hired, given an acetylene torch and told to cut some 
45 gallon drums in half.  You and I know, Mr. Speaker, if a 45 
gallon drum has any fumes left in it then it is not an oil drum 
anymore, it is a bomb.  This kid was killed also on the second or 
third day on the job. 
These things do happen in the workplace.  I am not raising them 
to be romantic or to make the argument with any kind of cheap 
points.  I am just saying that three times a day these things 
happen in Canadian workplaces and sometimes there is negligence 
that warrants criminal charges, not just charges under the Canada 
Labour Code but charges under the Criminal Code of Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The analogy we often use is that if we drink a bottle of whisky 
and jump behind the wheel of our car and kill somebody, we are 
not just charged under the Motor Vehicle Act, we do not just pay 
a fine and lose our licence under the Motor Vehicle Act, we will 
be charged under the Criminal Code of Canada for gross criminal 
negligence.  The same, we argue, should apply in the case of the 
workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians were horrified when 26 miners died at the Westray 
disaster, but I think most of us were even more horrified to 
learn that under the current criminal code the crown prosecutors 
in Nova Scotia had no choice but to stay the charges.  They could 
not make the charges stick because under the current criminal 
code it does not contemplate the idea of corporate manslaughter 
or corporate killing, and this needs to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 79 put forward by the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough clearly articulated this in a 
very brief and straight to the point manner.  His motion called 
for the House of Commons to implement the recommendations of the 
Westray inquiry as put forward by Justice Peter Richard.  The 
motion passed in the House by a vote of 216 to 15, all party 
support.  Everyone, except for 15 individuals, agreed that was 
exactly what the House of Commons should do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That motion was agreed to months ago and now the Minister of 
Justice tells us that it is before the justice committee. Between 
members, myself and the fence post, it is not before the justice 
committee.  I have talked to all members on the justice committee 
who I could track down and the motion has never been mentioned at 
the justice committee.  It is not on the agenda and there is no 
plan to put it on the agenda as far as anybody can ascertain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Steelworkers of America are on the Hill today and 
will be on the Hill for the rest of this week and all of next 
week.  They will be visiting every member of parliament urging us 
to show the collective will to implement or introduce these 
changes during this session of the House so that they can bring 
some closure to that tragedy.  Hopefully we can motivate boards 
of directors and heads of corporations to take more of an 
interest in workplace safety and health of any enterprise under 
which they have direction and control to at least go through the 
basic motions of providing a clean, healthy and safe work 
environment for the workers they represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians deserve the protective umbrella of workplace 
safety and health legislation.  Parliament Hill has the only 
group of workers who are specifically denied by legislation the 
right of access to any workplace safety and health legislation. 
These workers are covered by the Parliamentary Employment Staff 
Relations Act.  The Mulroney government allowed these employees 
the right to collective bargaining during their tenure but failed 
to proclaim part III of the Parliamentary Employment Staff 
Relations Act.  Part I received proclamation, which gave 
employees industrial bargaining rights.  Part II received 
proclamation. Part III, the chapter dealing with workplace safety 
and health, was never proclaimed.  These employees now have no 
workplace safety and health protection whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wrote the Minister of Labour asking her to bring to cabinet 
the idea of giving part III of the Parliamentary Employment Staff 
Relations Act royal proclamation or recommending it, completing 
it and making it law.  This would provide parliamentary 
employees, the ones we deal with everyday, the guys who drive the 
little green buses, access to workplace safety and health 
legislation as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important for us to do that and I think most 
members, if they were made aware of the situation, would also 
agree that it is important.  I am only talking about 500 or so 
individuals but it is 500 people who have been specifically 
denied any kind of workplace safety and health committee, any 
avenues of recourse if they are injured on the job, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-12 is a worthwhile piece of legislation.  Every 
industrial sector in the federal jurisdiction welcomes it.  We 
want speedy passage of it, but all of the best legislation in the 
world is completely useless without enforcement, enforcement, 
enforcement.  It is like real estate:  location, location, 
location.  It has to be enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that workplace inspections are way down.  The number 
of workplace inspectors in the field are way down and therefore 
prosecutions are down.  All of that has been allowed to slide a 
great deal.  We would call for the government to not only pass 
Bill C-12 but to show a real commitment in the enforcement of 
Bill C-12 when it enters into the federal sector.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, The Environment; the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Winnipeg Centre mentioned that there should be a two 
stage bill process.  Could the member be a little more specific 
and describe what the first and second stages of the bill process 
should be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the tripartite joint 
labour-management-government working group recommended that there 
be a two tier system and that the system should be as follows: 
the first stage of appeal would be to the RSO, the regional 
safety officer.  In other words, the RSO would make a directive 
to an employer or an employee.  Either of those could then appeal 
and ask them to review the direction that was given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the directive still stands, then the next stage of appeal 
would be to the CIRB, the Canada Industrial Relations Board, 
where a three part panel would then review the matter, and 
hopefully that panel would have expertise in workplace safety and 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently in Bill C-12 that whole process has been tossed to the 
side.  It put in place an appeals officer who works for the 
department and is in fact an employee of the department.  What we 
really have, in a way, is the fox watching the hen house, because 
we are filing our appeal in a single stage to the same people who 
issued the directive that we are appealing with no further 
outside arm's length appeal option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody involved, from the FEDCO federal employers, to the 
Canadian Labour Congress and all the unions affiliated, agree 
that they want an arm's length appeal heard by a third party like 
the CIRB not by an appeals officer who actually works for the 
department.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time with my good friend and colleague from 
Saint John. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives me great pleasure, on behalf of the PC Party, to say a 
few words on Bill C-12, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to confess that I have very little new to say about this 
bill given the fact that this will be the third time, I believe, 
I have spoken on it.  We are generally in support of the bill 
because the goal of the legislation, as we are all very much 
aware, is to promote safety consciousness in the workplace and 
the boardroom, and to establish the rights and responsibilities 
of workers and management with regard to real and potential 
hazards in the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what could be more important for workers today 
than for those of us who come to parliament to bring in good, 
sound laws and regulations for the workers.  A few minutes ago my 
colleague mentioned a few accidents that happened in the 
workplace.  I know he has quite a great deal of experience in the 
construction industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember, having worked in that industry for a number of 
years, the kinds of hazards that workers generally are exposed to 
today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important for us to be cognizant of those facts and 
to make sure that the laws we bring in address the very important 
area of safety for people who work not only in the business or 
office environment but in the construction environment as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All in all I think the bill is a very good one.  One sign of 
that is that we only had two amendments to vote on yesterday at 
report stage.  Motion No. 1 was put forward by the minister to 
provide clearer definitions of health and the real and potential 
dangers to health, which my party supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other amendment was from the Bloc Quebecois to allow a 
pregnant or nursing mother to avail herself of the provincial 
health and safety legislation where the legislation is better or 
more comprehensive.  That amendment did not pass. Quite a number 
of concerns were voiced about it, but I will not go into them at 
this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Key to the bill is an expanded role for health and safety 
committees in the workplace, which envisions identifying and 
dealing with potential hazards and related refusals to work 
quickly and efficiently in the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill seeks a better balance among the roles of government, 
employers and employees in dealing with workplace problems and 
more emphasis on establishing rules and procedures to deal with 
such matters at the local level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a bill like this one is vetted through a number of bodies 
there is more likelihood that the bill will be acceptable to a 
broad range of people.  The bill came about as a result of 
consultations among government, business and labour in an effort 
to modernize our health and safety legislation, which 
incidentally has not undergone an overhaul since 1985.  In 
general the bill has significant support among the groups of 
people involved.  As I mentioned before we support it as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time the bill came before the House I pointed out a few 
of our concerns.  I know the minister will not be speaking again 
on the bill.  I think there is a part III of the code to come. 
When the minister comes to the House with part III perhaps she 
could address some of the concerns we have put on record for her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our concerns is the whole area of ergonomics.  It is a 
bit vague in detail, as we said before.  To the layperson 
ergonomics is a strange and very sophisticated sounding word.  As 
I understand it, it is the art or science of designing or 
changing the workplace to minimize the risk of injury to an 
employee in the course of his or her normal duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would assume it is based on the old adage that an ounce of 
prevention is worth a pound of cure.  It is an area we are 
hearing quite a great bit about today.  It is an area in which 
the minister probably should have been more detailed.  Perhaps 
the government intends to bring in regulations or guidelines on 
ergonomics, but the press kit we received on Bill C-12 is 
essentially silent on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area of workplace safety not covered in the bill is the 
notion of the psychological protection of the worker in the 
workplace: the right to work in an environment free of harassment 
or various types of discrimination. 
Such matters can cause a great deal of grief in the workplace 
just as easily as physical injury or the threat of physical 
injury.  While there are protections against a worker being 
unfairly disciplined for reporting a potential workplace hazard, 
there appears to be no provision in the bill to provide for a 
safe psychological work environment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not continue too long as the member for Saint John has 
some concerns with regard to appointments to various boards which 
the bill addresses.  I commend and compliment the minister for 
bringing in the bill.  It is a good one.  I compliment her as 
well on the fact that labour, environment and management have 
been consulted widely in this regard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the hon. member from St. John's, Newfoundland, for the 
opportunity to speak to the bill.  I also compliment my colleague 
in the NDP from Winnipeg on his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's society not too many people speak out for the men and 
women who work with their hands.  I can relate to that.  A number 
of workers come to see me back home.  They are under tremendous 
stress in the workplace today because of the cutbacks that are 
taking place.  Some of them have to work longer hours because of 
the cutbacks.  They are having most difficult times and it is 
difficult for their families as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Westray mine was referred to.  That issue has tugged 
at the hearts of just about all of us.  The wives of those miners 
have been to see me a number of times.  Had there been proper 
legislation in place, possibly what happened in the Westray mine 
could have been prevented, and those men would still be with 
their families and their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague spoke about ergonomics.  He was absolutely correct. 
It sounds great when subsection 125(1) states that an employer 
shall: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—ensure that the machinery, equipment and tools used by the 
employees in the course of their employment meet prescribed 
health, safety and ergonomic standards— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit vague on detail, as was said by my colleague, and we 
have to look at it.  We support the bill, but as my colleague 
from St. John's, Newfoundland, stated, there is a need to 
elaborate on different areas of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk about stress and what has happened to some workers. 
I know of a gentleman with a wife and four children who was hurt 
at work.  He is not an old man.  He is in his late thirties.  His 
wife brought him into my office because of what had happened to 
him.  He was working on a piece of equipment way up in the air 
that broke off.  He went flying through the air. He was in a 
wheelchair and all his body shook.  His little children were 
crying about their dad.  He could not work any more with his 
hands.  Could he walk to work?  Could he do anything?  I was 
happy to have helped him to obtain a disability pension.  He is a 
man in his thirties who was injured because the equipment he was 
working on to do his job was not safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned that a complaint made under this provision cannot 
be referred to arbitration or adjudication. Subsection 141(1) 
states that the minister can appoint an appeals officer to 
adjudicate a decision made through a local health and safety 
process.  To some extent this is a political appointment. 
We have no guarantees that all ministers will be as circumspect 
as our current minister.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 146(3) says that the appeal officer's decision is 
final and cannot be reviewed by the court.  I have big problems 
with any bill that consistently denies a citizen full access to 
due process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the minister could take a second look at it.  We need 
that.  The government should take a second look at it because it 
takes away the democratic process in Canada when people do not 
have the right to go to the court.  The court is there for all 
Canadians.  There is no process that should remove their right to 
go there for a final decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 135(1) indicates that a workplace with 20 or more 
employees must have a workplace health and safety committee. That 
is good.  Yet subsection 135(2) exempts ship from being required 
to have such a committee.  Be there 20 sailors or 200 sailors, it 
does not apply to ships.  We have ferries.  We have other ships 
out there.  We have our coast guard.  We should make sure that it 
applies to all of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection 137(1) calls for the establishment of a coal mining 
safety commission.  This commission is to be appointed by the 
minister.  If the safety of coal miners deserves special 
attention, I am not sure ministerial appointments is the way to 
go, especially when their remuneration and expenses are to be set 
by cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should take the politics out of health and safety and do what 
is right by putting the people in place who have the knowledge 
and the experience to do the job and do it right.  That is what 
we should do for people.  That is why people put us in the House 
of Commons.  They want us to do what is right for all people. I 
would like to see that kind of respect for our men and women who 
have to work their hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They can make complaints to the board, which I assume means the 
Canadian Industrial Relations Board or the Public Service Staff 
Relations Board.  I also assume that these boards are filled by 
order in council and as such are once again political 
appointments of the government in power.  I hope the minister can 
provide us with the listing of the individuals involved so that 
we can judge for ourselves if they are appointed on the basis of 
merit or, heaven forbid, only on the basis of political 
affiliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated before, we should do what is right.  It does not 
matter which party is in power.  It does not matter where we sit 
in the House of Commons.  We should put in place the people who 
can do the job, the people who have the ability and knowledge to 
do it.  We are talking about the lives of people who work in 
environments where there must be safety in order to protect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the House for having the opportunity to say a few words 
with regard to our concerns.  We will support the bill.  It is on 
record how we feel about the bill and the changes we feel very 
strongly about that should be in place in order to make the bill 
the one and only bill that will protect men and women in the 
workplace.

There have been discussions between all the parties concerning

Bill C-12 followed by the recorded divisions on Motion No. 30.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance is bringing these two motions forward 
because we are concerned that in approving this, we would simply 
be handing the government and the people at Revenue Canada 
another weapon to go out and wring ever more tax dollars out of 
taxpayers' pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not very efficient at many things.  One thing 
it is exceedingly efficient at and becoming more efficient at 
every day is using the hammer of Revenue Canada to go out and 
collect money from people's pockets. These two clauses grant the 
Minister of National Revenue the power to obtain judicial 
authorization to assess and collect GST and HST deemed 
remittable. 
We argue that it already has sufficient tools to do this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the government will say that it needs symmetry between 
what there is now in the Income Tax Act and the Excise Tax Act. 
We agree, but it should be the other way.  We think we should be 
reducing the tools the government has to intrude on people's 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can barely think of a time when there was not someone in my 
office complaining about unfair treatment from people in the GST 
department or at Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly starting in 1995, the year we saw the government bring 
in an important budget, one of the things it did was to hire more 
auditors.  It hired tons of auditors.  I cannot prove this, but 
anecdotally I think we all know it is so, that starting at that 
point Revenue Canada and the GST folks got a lot more aggressive. 
Those auditors are trying to justify their existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot count the complaints that have come into my office 
where people have said that they went to the GST people to ask 
for a ruling on such and such and they were given a ruling. They 
submitted their papers.  They did it the way they were told to. 
All of a sudden they found out that they did it wrong. They did 
it the way the GST people said to do it, but they did it wrong. 
Someone else at the other end interpreted the whole thing 
completely differently.  Then all of a sudden the GST auditors 
would descend like locusts, go through the people's books and tie 
up their businesses sometimes for days on end.  In the meantime, 
people were struggling to keep their businesses afloat.  They 
found that in some cases their accounts had been frozen. All 
kinds of things occurred that made it impossible for them to do 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very last thing we should be doing in this place is to hand 
more ammunition to the people at Revenue Canada and the people in 
the GST department.  That is the last thing we need to do.  That 
is effectively what these two clauses in Bill C-32 do.  We do not 
want that anymore.  We do not want to see that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have a problem in Canada with people paying their fair 
share of taxes.  We have a problem with the government wringing 
too much money out of people's pockets.  We have an Income Tax 
Act which is 2,000 pages thick and extraordinarily complex GST 
legislation and all the amendments and circulars that flow from 
it.  With all of that there are a lot of grey areas.  People 
inevitably end up in those grey areas, sometimes unavoidably. 
When the government produces legislation as complex as this, it 
ends up causing situations the consequences of which it cannot 
see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who are trying to earn a living fill out all the GST 
forms they have to fill out every month, and lo and behold, 
inevitably some of them wander into those grey areas.  What 
happens when that occurs?  The GST people come down not only like 
a swarm of locusts, but with a hammer.  Very often people are in 
a position where they feel they are on the right side of the 
issue and that the law is with them. Their accountants will tell 
them that they are on the right side and according to their 
understanding these people are within the spirit of the law.  But 
they end up fighting the folks at GST and guess who can outlast 
whom in a situation like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone who owns a cornerstore or whatever may have a few 
thousand dollars to fight a legal battle.  But on the other side 
is the Government of Canada with its battalions of lawyers and 
experts of all kinds and all the resources the government has 
including deep, deep pockets with all kinds of money. The 
government basically freezes people out or makes it impossible 
for them to proceed. As a result, although these people are very 
often on the right side of the issue, they cave in.  They have to 
cave in because they cannot afford to wage the battle. 
The government knows this, so it always comes out on top.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It means more revenue for the government, more revenue coming in 
all the time.  We see it when we look at the GST revenues.  They 
have gone through the roof since 1993.  They have gone absolutely 
through the roof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will say it is economic growth.  I will concede 
that some of it is economic growth, but I think my friends across 
the way have to concede that some of it, a not insubstantial 
chunk of it, is due to this new unrealistically tough attitude at 
the GST office.  They are crawling all over businesses trying to 
wring every cent out of hardworking business people across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the members across the way in an honest moment 
will deny that they have had probably dozens of cases each in 
their offices where people have said, “Here is my 
correspondence. Here is what was sent to me saying I could do it 
this way or that way”, and then they got pounded.  Someone on 
the other end did not have the same message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how many times people have said to me that they 
phoned the GST office and got an interpretation of what they were 
supposed to do from someone who very often does not have a last 
name; it is Mary or Bill or whomever.  Getting the last name from 
someone on the other end of a government telephone line is like 
pulling hen's teeth; it is virtually impossible.  Then finally at 
the day of reckoning when they try to explain to the GST people 
why their paperwork is not done right, they say that Bill or Mary 
told them to do it.  The GST office asks for the person's last 
name and they say, “Well, I do not know.  They would not give me 
their last name”.  If I had a dollar for every time I have heard 
that story, I would be a wealthy, wealthy man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that it is crazy to arm the government, which 
already has all those tools, with even more tools to wring more 
money out of people's pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want symmetry too.  I want symmetry between the Income Tax Act 
and what we are seeing in the GST, but I want it in a different 
way.  I want fewer powers for Revenue Canada.  I do not want it 
to have the ability to turn people's homes upside down like it 
currently does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples.  Probably one of the most egregious 
ones is in my part of the world, in southern Alberta. A woman 
finally took her own life because of the harassment from the tax 
people.  This is quite a famous story now, unfortunately.  It is 
part of a trend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not empower the people in the government to go even 
further than they already go.  Life is miserable enough for a lot 
of people because of the intrusive behaviour of people who 
collect taxes.  We do not need to give them more tools.  They 
already have all of the resources on their side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to say that in the Canadian Alliance my colleagues 
have moved things like the taxpayers protection act, which would 
give real rights to people who are facing this sort of outrageous 
behaviour from the people at Revenue Canada.  It would reverse 
the onus so that Revenue Canada would have to prove that it was 
in the wrong, instead of putting this chill over things by 
threatening all kinds of legal action and threatening to drag it 
through the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People on this side of the aisle, members of the Canadian 
Alliance, understand the sort of difficulties business people 
have to go through when they deal with the folks at Revenue 
Canada, the GST office, the income tax folks, or whomever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my colleagues across the way to support the motions to 
get rid of clauses 35 and 36.  If they do, they will be sending a 
powerful and a very good message to taxpayers across Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it was an honest mistake. 
Sometimes I forget, and I think the majority of Canadians tend to 
forget, that this is a different political entity.  I guess my 
confusion comes from the fact that reform is still in the name. I 
do not understand why there is a difficulty in referring to the 
Reform Party.  It is the same as calling the Progressive 
Conservative Party the Conservative Party, periodically, or the 
Tory Party.  It was an honest mistake, Mr. Speaker, and I assume 
that Canadians will make that honest mistake in the next 
election, as well, in forgetting that the Canadian Alliance is 
nothing more than a corporate re-imaging or a revamping of the 
Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure today that I rise to support my 
hon. colleague's motions to remove clauses 35 and 36 from Bill 
C-32, the budget implementation act.  I share with my colleague 
his concern that the revenue agency already has more than ample 
power to enforce tax policies in Canada, and that in fact it has 
too much power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not had one constituent come to me seeking help to 
strengthen the abilities of Revenue Canada in collecting money 
from Canadians.  I have, however, had numerous constituents come 
to me citing egregious examples of abusive practices being 
performed by Revenue Canada.  People, particularly those in small 
businesses, are being clamped down on by Revenue Canada at a time 
when it is difficult, with our level of taxation and regulatory 
burden, to have a successful small business to begin with.  To 
have as one of their greatest enemies the federal government, 
through the revenue agency, which is on the attack and out to 
destroy them if unwittingly they fall into one of those grey 
areas because of the complexities of our tax codes, is clearly 
unfair and not consistent with the government's efforts to 
supposedly create an environment within which business can grow 
and prosper in Canada.  The best way to have a small business in 
Canada is to start a big one and wait. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen numerous examples of the abuse of small business 
people over GST issues in my riding.  The heavy handedness of 
Revenue Canada, now the new Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, is 
consistently unfair and has created a situation of fear across 
Canada in the small business community and with ordinary 
Canadians who live in fear of that call or that letter from 
Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago there was a study which evaluated the 
psychological impact of a number of events in people's lives. The 
fact is that people receiving a letter telling them they are 
being audited by either the IRS in the U.S. or by Revenue Canada 
has the same psychological impact as the death of a close 
relative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that none of us would want to see the death of a close 
relative, but compared to a full audit by Revenue Canada there 
are probably some relatives we would trade in quite easily.  All 
kidding aside, this is a very serious issue and I intend to 
support the motions of my hon. colleague, my unreformed 
colleague, in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax tinkering that I see in the budgets coming from this 
government, whether it is on the enforcement side or in terms of 
general tax policy, is clearly unacceptable.  Other countries are 
using tax policy as a vehicle to create greater levels of 
economic growth and opportunity for their citizenry.  Here we are 
in Canada with this government continuing its pathetic, anemic 
tax tinkering which will not really do anything that will have a 
major impact on the future of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government boasts of progress in the recent budget and of 
steps in the right direction because of the fact that there was 
some level of tax reduction.  These are baby steps.  Baby steps 
in the right direction do not help Canadians if other countries 
are taking gigantic leaps.  The finance minister is bragging of 
these small steps in the right direction, but a tortoise on the 
autobahn that is moving in the right direction is still roadkill, 
because the cars are moving faster.  We as a country cannot 
afford to be that tortoise moving in the right direction on the 
autobahn. 
We have to be moving ahead of the pack and we have to provide our 
citizens and our businesses with the tools to not just compete 
globally, but to succeed globally.  That means not just tax 
tinkering, but significant levels of tax reform.  I do not mean 
reform in a party sense; I mean tax reform in a more generic 
sense.  I would not want to be accused of tomfoolery in the House 
of Commons.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of tax reform is extraordinarily important.  I am sure 
my hon. friend would agree with me that we need a greater level 
of tax reform in the upcoming years.  One of the most important 
areas of tax reform would be the elimination of the personal 
capital gains tax in Canada, which represents one of the single 
largest impediments to growth in the new economy of any of our 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see my colleague in the New Democratic Party shaking his head 
because he believes that the capital gains tax reduction would be 
a tax cut for the rich.  He could not be more wrong.  Over half 
of personal capital gains taxes in Canada are paid by people who 
are making less than $50,000 per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the new economy, there is no form of taxation that 
is any more deleterious in terms of its impact on the new economy 
than the capital gains tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are, through our capital gains tax disadvantages, driving 
entrepreneurs, driving venture capitalists, driving the 
innovators whom we need to strengthen the new economy out of 
Canada.  There is a consensus on this issue.  The Senate banking 
committee and the House of Commons industry committee have spoken 
of the significant need for a reduction in capital gains taxes. 
We have seen a movement in the right direction, but our capital 
gains tax is still 13% higher than that of the United States. A 
13% disadvantage is a signal to our innovators in Canada that we 
do not want their innovation.  These people could build a 
stronger country.  They could build stronger businesses.  I want 
those businesses.  I want that country to be Canada.  I do not 
want it necessarily to be the U.S.  We are driving people out of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The capital gains tax issue is particularly important based on 
the degree to which the new economy uses stock options to 
compensate employees.  In the new economy the beneficiaries of 
stock options will not just be the fat cats on Bay Street, but 
the ordinary people:  the receptionists, the innovators, the 
software engineers and the assembly people.  All employees will 
benefit from these types of initiatives.  We would be far better 
served as Canadians if the government and parliament were to 
focus on these types of issues as opposed to trying to strength 
Revenue Canada's ability to pillage and burn the private fiefdoms 
of Canadians.  We should be trying to reduce the tax burden and 
impediments that the government places on Canadian entrepreneurs 
by changing our tax system and by reducing not just the tax 
impediments, but also the regulatory impediments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government hears the need for tax reform, I suggest 
that its emphasis is on the wrong syllable.  The government 
thinks that tax reform means strengthening Revenue Canada so it 
can collect more taxes.  We in the Progressive Conservative Party 
suggest that tax reform means reducing and simplifying the 
Canadian tax system such that more Canadians succeed and 
ultimately do not have to pay as much tax when they choose to 
build their futures here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  It is wonderful to have the support of the pathetic 
Conservatives.  However, I want the House to know that it is a 
disappointment that it is always a day late and a dollar 
short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Medicine Hat is good with the puns, but usually in debate, not on 
a point of order.  We cannot let that slip through. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am quite amazed at the 
alliance member for Medicine Hat who introduced two motions which 
will effectively delay the enactment of Bill C-32, a bill that 
will deliver $2.5 billion in increased payments under the CHST to 
the provinces and territories for their health care systems and 
post-secondary education. 
It will ensure that students receiving assistance under the 
Canada Student Financial Assistance Act will have a seamless 
transition in the fall and that their student loans will be 
protected.  I am amazed they would introduce these spurious 
motions to delay the implementation of this bill, which Canadians 
want.  Canadians have responded very favourably to budget 2000.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can stand in the House to debate tax cuts and the pace at 
which we are making tax cuts.  Of course, the alliance would like 
a flat tax, a tax which would move the tax burden from higher 
income Canadians to middle income Canadians.  We could debate 
that and unveil the fact that the tax is not progressive and that 
it would hurt middle income Canadians.  We could also demonstrate 
quite clearly that the tax would not be more simple.  It would 
not be a simpler tax.  Many Canadians think that a flat tax would 
be a simpler tax, but it would not be.  When we put questions to 
members opposite as to whether there would be exemptions for 
health care, medical expenses over a certain amount, child care 
expenses, et cetera, they say yes to all of that.  Yes, we would 
have a flat tax of 17%, but Canadians would still have to fill in 
the same forms.  And, by the way, if those deductions were 
allowed, it would not be affordable in any case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Medicine Hat talked about poor citizens 
being trampled upon by Revenue Canada, or the new revenue agency. 
I would point out that these measures are meant to allow the 
revenue agency to take action after having been to a court. A 
judge has to determine whether there is enough evidence presented 
by the revenue agency to allow it to collect the taxes.  It is 
not the revenue agency acting on its own volition; it is getting 
a court order to do that.  It is done only in exceptional cases, 
those very rare cases.  Most taxpayers are honest, taxpaying 
citizens.  To stand in the House and try to protect those people 
who are evading taxes is increasing the tax burden on all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have cases where people are collecting the GST and, because 
there is a delay in the remittance period, they are taking 
advantage of that.  They have no intention of remitting the GST. 
What does that mean?  That means that every one of us pays more 
tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that this member and the member from the Progressive 
Conservative Party would stand and try to protect tax evaders I 
find scandalous.  They know full well that people have the 
protection of the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk to the specifics of these particular 
measures.  The hon. member opposite said that he understands 
these measures bring GST and HST collection into line with the 
Income Tax Act, but he says we should be moving the other way. 
We should be moving the measures under the GST and the HST the 
other way.  In other words, we should be removing these 
provisions from the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians do not try to evade taxes.  They expect to pay 
their fair share of taxes.  If taxes are not being remitted, I 
think that Canadians look upon the government to collect those 
taxes.  The motions proposed by the hon. member for Medicine Hat 
do not take into account the fact that the government has that 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST and the HST are collected by businesses and are held in 
trust on behalf of the people who paid that tax in good faith in 
the expectation that it will be remitted to the government. 
There are cases in which these taxes are not remitted.  These 
people have no intention of remitting that money, and the hands 
of the revenue agency are tied under the current provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions under this bill would allow the revenue agency to 
go to a judge, demonstrate that there is a good case and collect 
the taxes that are owing on behalf of all Canadians.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take 
immediate steps to implement a labelling process that will make 
consumers aware of all genetically modified produce and 
components in processed foods. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have an opportunity 
to present a motion to the House on a matter of great 
significance, a public policy area that has serious ramifications 
for all society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have to tell any member of the House how seriously 
Canadians regard the issue of food safety and genetically 
modified produce.  The matter weighs heavily upon the minds of 
Canadians and has certainly become a matter of intense debate, 
discussion and organizing right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hour allocated for debate on this motion will hardly permit 
an indepth review of this issue.  However, I am grateful that we 
have this hour because it will give us an opportunity to air some 
issues that are of grave concern to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am mindful of the fact that this is not the only opportunity 
we have had to debate this issue.  As a result of work by other 
opposition members in the House, we have had recent opportunities 
to debate this very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago, on May 2 in the House, an entire day was 
devoted to discussing genetically modified foods and the need for 
a labelling process. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, I would like to sincerely thank the hon. member 
for Louis-Hébert, who worked on this issue for over a year. She 
moved an opposition motion in the House on May 2. She also moved 
a motion under Private Members' Business. I want to apologize 
for my French, but I want to speak it for a moment to recognize 
the work of the Bloc Quebecois member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that there are two motions on the same issue at the 
same time before the House clearly indicates the importance of 
this issue for all members of parliament and for Canadians 
across the country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is so apparent from the proceedings in the House is that 
the initiative to have this critical matter of food safety and 
genetically modified produce discussed publicly and openly has 
come from the opposition parties in the House.  It has come from 
individual, non-Liberal members.  This is truly an effort on our 
part as well as on the part of members of the Bloc to fulfill an 
obligation that we hold as elected representatives to ensure 
open, democratic debate, public consultation and open, 
transparent government on something as important and fundamental 
as food safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is really an attempt—and I know it is grating some of the 
Liberal members present today but it has to be said—to fill a 
vacuum left by the Liberal government, which has a well 
established pattern of secretive, less than democratic decision 
making around this important issue and on many of the important 
issues facing health protection and health safety systems in the 
country today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work of private members is very important in that regard. At 
least we can provide a venue for public debate on this important 
issue.  At least we can be a conduit for the concerns our 
constituents are bringing to our attention, not having been able 
to penetrate the walls of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for us to have this time and opportunity, and 
hopefully out of it will come some pressure on the Liberal 
government to rethink its current position of inaction and 
passive response to something as important as food safety, 
particularly when it comes to genetically modified produce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work of a private member is no substitute for government 
action.  The government has initiated no parliamentary debate, no 
public consultations and no democratic process for resolving a 
controversial and far-reaching public policy.  There has been no 
leadership at the community level where, as members of the House 
know, the voices of Canadians have been heard loud and clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us have received hundreds of calls and letters on this 
issue.  We have all presented a number of petitions to the House. 
We all know the number of times this issue has been raised either 
in Oral Question Period or in debate.  Yet, there has been no 
proactive movement on the part of the government to address this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again it was suggested in the health committee 
that this should be a topic of research and study.  The matter of 
a joint study between the agriculture committee and the health 
committee was never even brought to the health committee. Motions 
and recommendations that individuals brought to the health 
committee to have this item placed on our agenda were dismissed, 
disregarded and ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who has seen the recent coverage on the developments at 
the health committee will probably have a good understanding of 
why this has happened.  On every major issue facing Canadians 
today when it comes to health care, our health committee has had 
its hands tied.  Our committee has become almost dysfunctional 
because of our inability to crack through the wall of control 
that the Liberal government has placed around our committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a committee have not been requested or challenged to 
investigate the crisis in our public health care system.  We have 
not been given the opportunity to discuss the crisis in our 
health protection system.  All the while, developments are taking 
place, decisions are being made behind the scenes and policies 
are being initiated without any kind of parliamentary scrutiny, 
public consultation or sensitivity to the impact those policies 
will have on Canadians' health and safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question, I believe, on the part of everyone in the 
House that the issue of genetically modified foods is a high 
priority for Canadians.  I do not think there is any doubt about 
where that concern comes from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  When we resume the 
hon. member will have six minutes remaining for her remarks.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the concern of Canadians when it comes to genetically 
modified foods is legitimate and must be taken seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a flood of genetically engineered products on the 
market in the last number of years. Some 30 to 40 products are 
now available on the grocery shelf.  Some 60% of processed foods 
contain genetically modified foods. Large numbers of acreage are 
taken up with genetically modified crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very significant development in the history of this 
country and it certainly causes Canadians legitimate concern. 
This has all happened without much knowledge on the part of 
Canadians.  These decisions were made by governments some years 
back.  There was no public consultation process. There is no 
policy framework in place to deal with the long term effects of 
this kind of development in our society today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told time and time again not to worry.  We are told that 
genetically modified foods are substantially equivalent to 
non-genetically modified foods.  We are told there is no need to 
worry.  Don't worry, be happy as my colleague for Palliser has 
said.  That is the message from the government.  We are here 
today to try to change that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not good enough to tell Canadians not to worry and that 
the government will take care of their interests.  Canadians have 
been faced with too many examples in the past where governments 
have taken shortcuts and Canadians have paid the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have learned anything from the Walkerton water tragedy, it 
should be that there can be no shortcuts when it comes to the 
safety of the food we eat, the water we drink, the blood 
transfusions we may require, or the drugs that are necessary for 
our medical conditions.  To do anything less is to put people at 
the whim of the marketplace without any guarantee of safety. As 
someone once said to me, it is playing Russian roulette with the 
lives of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP are saying the precautionary principle should be 
that products should only go on the market when they have been 
proven to be safe.  That is what should guide us through all of 
the developments in biotechnology.  We are saying that if the 
science is unavailable or has not been completed, then surely we 
should not allow things on the market unless we know they are 
safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the government to hear the message.  It has a 
responsibility to prove safety and ensure that the companies 
prove safety as opposed to the individual Canadian consumer 
proving harm.  What creates the possibility of serious problems 
and disastrous consequences is when precautionary steps have not 
been taken. That is what we are asking to be done when it comes 
to genetically engineered food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot stand here and say that genetically engineered food is 
unsafe.  However, I can say with absolute certainty and authority 
based on everything I have read that no one can say that there 
will never be any deleterious effects from genetically engineered 
food.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot say at this point that there will be no long term 
effects on human health, on soil conditions or on the state of 
our environment.  We do not have the ability to say that because 
we do not have the science.  In fact, we have all kinds of 
science which suggests otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All kinds of studies say there could be lethal effects from 
genetically modified seeds on insects such as the monarch 
butterfly. We know that Roundup resistant crops may result in 
increased residue to the consumer, possibly causing non-Hodgkins 
lymphoma.  We know that genetically modified seeds could render 
antibiotics useless.  We know from news as recently as today that 
genes used to modify crops can jump the species barrier and cause 
bacteria to mutate.  We know from the recent example of the 
company Advanta based in Winnipeg that problems occur when seeds 
spread from one crop to another.  That is causing all kinds of 
ramifications in the European market.  It is having a major 
impact on farmers in this country today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here today to say that when we do not know all the 
answers and we do not have the science then we have to do 
something.  We have to take steps.  There are some things we can 
do.  One is suggested in the motion today.  It has been suggested 
as well by the member for Louis-Hébert that we could at least 
begin with a labelling process. We could at least guarantee that 
consumers have the knowledge they need to decide whether or not 
to consume genetically engineered food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the best of all worlds if we had taken all the precautionary 
steps, had the science in place and made sure that we knew what 
we were dealing with, maybe that would not have been necessary. 
At least at this point in time when the horse is out of the barn, 
we should be doing that which consumers are expecting us to do 
and that which is absolutely essential given the changing nature 
of the field.  We should give consumers the information they need 
to make a decision, give them the right to know and the right to 
make an informed choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is certainly something that is elemental.  It is basic and 
something the government should be doing immediately.  It should 
not set up one more biotechnology committee, not create an 
illusion of consulting while it spends $25 million on fancy 
booklets trying to tell Canadians that everything is safe and 
fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want open consultation.  They want to be involved in 
the decision making process.  All of parliament wants to be part 
of this process because what is fundamentally at stake here is 
human health, environmental health and the future of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without exaggerating the point, let us simply say that in the 
absence of sufficient knowledge to answer all of those questions, 
let us not take any chances.  Let us put human health first.  Let 
us put public safety ahead of the needs of the industry.  Let us 
ensure that with every step forward we provide consumers with the 
right to know and with the information they need in order to make 
informed decisions.  Let us also ensure that from this day 
forward all of our decisions are based on independent scientific 
expertise.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to address the motion by the hon. member for Winnipeg 
North Centre. The motion calls for the compulsory labelling of 
genetically modified food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset I want to make one thing very clear. When it comes 
to biotechnology issues, including genetically modified foods, 
the Government of Canada's number one priority is to act as a 
responsible steward for the health and safety of Canadians and 
the environment.  I would like to quote from a recent speech by 
the premier of Saskatchewan, the Hon. Roy Romanow: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Food created from genetically altered crops grown on the Canadian 
prairies didn't originate from some madman's spiderwebbed 
laboratory; it passed through one of the best government 
regulatory systems in the world.  The products that make it 
through the Canadian biotechnology regulatory system have met 
demanding protocols that require conclusive research into the 
products' impact on human health and the environment.  Almost 
universally, peer review of research data by scientists with 
extensive knowledge in the biotechnology field has supported the 
safety of products before they are allowed into the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Province of Saskatchewan has long been a supporter of 
carefully regulated biotechnology. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous premier of Saskatchewan, the hon. Allan Blakeney, 
was responsible for beginning the biotechnology centre at the 
University of Saskatchewan.  Maybe the province of Manitoba 
should catch up with the province of Saskatchewan when it comes 
to its support for biotechnology research in food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me emphasize that the Government of Canada's commitment is 
always to safety first:  safety for the protection of Canadians, 
safety for animals and safety of our environment.  That is what 
Canadians expect of their government.  It is a mission that the 
government takes very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that the government undertakes very strict 
scientific evaluations of all food products including those 
derived from biotechnology.  Before any new agricultural biotech 
product can be produced and marketed in Canada, it is subjected 
to comprehensive safety assessments to ensure that humans, 
animals and the environment will not be adversely affected by it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada maintains responsibility for establishing policies 
and standards related to the safety of food sold in Canada.  This 
department sets the data requirements for the safety assessments 
of all foods and undertakes comprehensive pre-market reviews of 
all foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of labelling, Health Canada sets the specifics for 
labelling of all foods.  Current labelling regulations in Canada 
require that all food products, including those developed through 
biotechnology, be labelled when the potential human health or 
safety issue has been identified or if foods have been changed in 
composition or nutrition.  Therefore Health Canada determines if 
and when labelling is required based on scientific food safety 
evaluations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, CFIA, is to 
carry out inspection and enforcement activities relative to the 
food safety standards set by Health Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recognizes that Canadians want to be heard on the 
issue of labelling.  We are actively engaged and consulting with 
Canadians to explore how labelling can best serve the public. 
There is need for informed discussion on the issue of labelling 
genetically modified products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is responding to the public's interest in the 
area and has carefully encouraged the establishment of a Canadian 
standard for the labelling of foods derived through 
biotechnology.  The Canadian Council of Grocery Distributors has 
been working with the Canadian General Standards Board to develop 
this labelling standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A committee composed of representatives and individuals from a 
broad range of Canadian interests has been established.  This 
committee has already met for three intensive working sessions 
since it inception in November of last year.  A number of working 
groups have been established to examine various components of the 
standard.  These groups are focusing on the scope of foods to be 
covered under the standard, label statements and mechanisms to 
verify the truthfulness of these statements.  A completed 
standard is expected within the next six to twelve months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is fully immersed in developing its own national standard 
in full consultation with the shareholders and in a way that is 
open and transparent to all Canadians.  Because of the leadership 
of the government, we are the first country in the world to 
actively engage such a broad range of stakeholders in this issue. 
Earlier this month the U.S. food and drug administration 
announced similar plans to prepare labelling guidelines that will 
ensure that labelling is truthful and informative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The development of a comprehensive Canadian standard for the 
labelling of foods derived from biotechnology allows consumers, 
health care professionals, other levels of government, 
processors, distributors and producers to work together in 
establishing a single national standard.  I believe the 
government has done the right thing by taking this approach.  As 
consumers, we have the right to clear, concise and understandable 
information that allows us to make knowledgeable choices about 
the foods we eat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, Canada is assuming a leadership role in the search for 
international standards that would govern how and when 
genetically modified foods are labelled.  In fact, Canada's food 
regulatory system is held in such high esteem internationally 
that the Codex Alimentarius committee on food labelling asked us 
to chair the working committee to revise the proposed draft of 
the Codex standard for the labelling of food biotechnology 
products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remind the House that last year the ministers of health, 
the environment, and agriculture and agri-food asked the Royal 
Society of Canada to appoint an expert panel on the future of 
food biotechnology.  This past February the Royal Society named 
its expert panel, which consists of scientists who have widely 
recognized expertise in specific areas of knowledge. 
This panel is carefully balanced with respect to the various 
points of view on biotechnology issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proactive, forward thinking body will advise Health Canada, 
the CFIA and Environment Canada on the science capacity that the 
federal government will need to maintain and enhance the safety 
of new foods being derived through biotechnology in the 21st 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we can see that the Government of Canada is committed 
to maintaining the highest scientific standards.  We strive to 
ensure that scientific advice is broadly based and that Canada's 
regulatory assessments keep pace with the latest scientific 
innovations and discoveries.  This type of proactive thinking 
underlies our efforts to make sound policy decisions that will 
continue to protect Canadian consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also recognizes there are a number of challenges 
and opportunities associated with biotechnology that require 
detailed consideration and public discussion.  Food biotechnology 
presents Canadians with unprecedented challenges but also 
unprecedented opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recently formed Canadian Biotechnology Advisory Committee, 
CBAC, will bring stakeholders and interested parties together to 
advise the government, to raise public awareness, and to engage 
Canadians in an open and transparent dialogue on biotechnology 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CBAC will deal with tasks such as the issues surrounding 
regulation and stewardship of emerging applications of 
biotechnology, with public education about biotechnology, and 
with the social, economic, environmental, legal and ethical 
issues relating to food biotechnology.  CBAC will monitor 
scientific developments that underpin new developments in the 
field of biotechnology and the application of those new 
developments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important initiative is that of the Standing Committee 
on Agriculture and Agri-Food.  This committee raised labelling as 
a key issue in the 1998 report entitled “Capturing the 
Advantage: Agriculture Biotechnology in the New Millennium”. 
This report recommended that parliament consult with stakeholders 
to review labelling policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recommend that report to the hon. member.  She thinks that 
opposition members are the ones who are filling the void.  She is 
missing the two years of activities of this government, in 
conjunction with six other departments besides the Department of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, to put together the Canadian 
biotechnology strategy.  I recommend that she pick up that 
strategy and read it.  The present standing committee has already 
begun a series of hearings on the labelling of genetically 
modified foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that during the debate on the same issue 
earlier this month my hon. colleagues from the Canadian Alliance 
called for a joint study by the health and agriculture committees 
of the issue of labelling.  Such a review would add considerable 
information and raise the level of dialogue on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House owes it to the people who are working so hard to study 
the issue of food biotechnology to wait until we hear what they 
have to say.  The message we are sending to Canadians is this: 
our priority is health, safety and the environment.  We have 
incorporated these values into a regulatory system and will 
continue to ensure that we have a regulatory system in place that 
is rigorous, thorough and scientific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada considers the issue of labelling of 
genetically modified foods to be very important.  We want to hear 
what Canadians have to say.  We want to hear what the experts 
have to say.  We remain committed to the exchange of ideas on the 
issues surrounding biotechnology. 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
certainly it is a pleasure to speak to this private member's 
bill.  I congratulate the member for bringing it to the House. We 
get very frustrated, as she pointed out, in the health committee 
where we really cannot deal with any of the issues with which 
Canadians want to deal.  We are forced instead to toe the line 
and simply go along with one little aspect of the health issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue for Canadians.  It is one that they care about. 
It is one on which they want information.  The government would 
be wise to learn that if information is provided an awful lot of 
the hearsay and scary stuff will be eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The age that we came from was much simpler when it came to 
biology.  I cannot help but think back to my days in biology 
classes at the University of Saskatchewan when our professors 
would talk about what the future might be when it came to 
genetics, eugenics and all those sorts of issues. 
I cannot help but remember back to their talking about issues 
like Dolly and that sort of science ultimately being applied much 
further.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the failure of the government to provide 
information is that it is left open to emotion.  It is left open 
to using non-scientific information that can frighten people 
including farmers, consumers and those who care about their 
health and the health of their families.  It can scare them in 
terms of the new technology which they do not understand.  By 
having that information in place and talking about it in detail 
we prevent the scary stuff from entering into the discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen what can happen when we deal with non-science, when 
we deal with what people think might happen.  I encourage the 
government and the House to force the issue of GMOs in the whole 
area of biotechnology.  We should force it to be transparent.  We 
should involve the participation of as many groups including 
citizen groups as we can.  We should go an extra distance with 
the consultation process and base all our decisions on scientific 
evidence, not hearsay evidence and the fear some might have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The safety assessment of biotechnology is critical.  We must 
look at it in our foods.  We must ask what it does.  We must know 
that using this technology is for the benefit of humanity, as 
opposed to a danger to humanity.  We should not jump into what we 
will do.  Information is key.  The information available to our 
citizens is what we should be concerned about in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Canadian Alliance have developed a position which we 
have discussed at some length with our agriculture critic, our 
health critic, and our membership in general.  We came up with a 
position I certainly want to read into the record.  It is much 
more reasonable than what we have heard from the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The alliance supports using scientific information to determine 
if an agricultural or food biotechnology product meets Canadian 
health and safety requirements.  If it does, the acceptability of 
the product in the marketplace should be determined by consumer 
choice and not by political interference.  The alliance supports 
increased consumer awareness and choice in the voluntary 
labelling of these products.  The alliance also supports 
labelling of foods that are not genetically modified.  This 
should be on a voluntary consumer driven basis, which would go a 
long way toward solving some of the problems of today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we come out somewhat in between where the hon. member 
stands in terms of genetically modified foods and where the 
government is at, the ends we would go to would be much the same 
and would accomplish the same for Canadians.  That is what should 
be important when it comes to an issue like this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are reasons to label everything.   We can look at them, 
but we must ask some questions.  Why would we do that?  The 
obvious answer is for people with allergies and different genetic 
make-ups.  There could be a peanut in something that they would 
not expect it to be in.  That is an obvious reason.  That is 
science and a reason for labelling.  People are developing 
increased resistances and increased allergies.  All kinds of 
medical issues should be dealt with, which we need a lot more 
information on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could simply respond to our trading partners.  I particularly 
point to the European Union. 
In many respects, from the little bit I know about what the 
European Union has done, it seems that it has been stampeded into 
opposing genetically modified foods without the science that is 
there.  We could point fingers at why that happened but we can 
understand the politics involved.  Some of it would be justified 
and some would not.  We should have learned from that however 
that we had better not get in that same category of being 
stampeded into labelling or not labelling just based on 
scientific fearmongering.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The obvious disadvantages we have think about when we talk about 
labelling, and the one that would be most significant to me, 
would be the cost to our agricultural community which is already 
under severe strain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past week I was in my riding talking to farmers at 
farmers' markets and at town hall meetings.  One morning I met 
with a group of farmers and they told me that they were growing 
canola that was roundup resistant and that they were worried 
about what would happen if we started to overregulate.  They said 
that it would hurt an industry that is already hurting.   We must 
consider that and look at the consumers and the food 
manufacturers.  We must tell the farmers that we will not get on 
the bandwagon of anti-GMO just because someone else is pushing 
us.  We must make sure that we consider the farmers and all the 
others who are affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How would we enforce the labelling of genetically modified 
foods?  I read an article once that said “If a chicken eats 
genetically modified grain does that mean you are going to label 
the chicken as being genetically modified?”  My biology says 
that we have been eating chromosomes and genes for an awfully 
long time and that I will not become what I eat in terms of 
genetics.  I am not likely to have canola growing out of my ears 
or a cob of corn under my neck or whatever.  That is not science. 
It will not what happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but think of some of the bills we have passed in 
this House.  I cannot for the life of me imagine how we will 
enforce Bill C-23, which might be the most recent example.  We 
will have sex police checking out couples. We will spend $4.5 
million on health police to make sure Alberta follows the law. If 
someone in Alberta is extra billed or jumps the queue it will be 
on the front page of every newspaper in that province.  We do not 
need police to do that.  We also have the gun police for Bill 
C-68.  I guess we will now have GMO police checking out what 
chickens are eating.  I am not sure where all this stops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main point, as my time is running short, is that we should 
base things on science.  We should have voluntary labelling based 
on consumer demand and we should let the consumers decide.  We 
should base everything we do on science.  We should also ensure 
that consumers are informed.  The government must take a lead 
role in making sure that this information gets out to all 
Canadians who are concerned about this issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would need 
an hour to refute some of the things that were said by members 
who spoke before me; yet I only have ten minutes, but I will 
surely have other opportunities to do so. 
First and foremost, I want to express my support to the hon. 
member for Winnipeg North Centre and to thank her for tabling 
Motion No. 252, asking the government to take immediate steps to 
implement a labelling process that will make us consumers aware 
of what foods are genetically modified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far from being an attack on biotechnologies, the hon. member's 
motion is a serious initiative asking that light be shed on the 
scientific process used to approve these foods and to evaluate 
their potential long term effects on health, on the environment 
and now on culture, agriculture and international trade.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is great is that the more we look at this issue, the more 
components we must take a stand on as members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell the House that we are not scaremongers, that we 
are definitely not sheep, and that we do not belong to any sect. 
Let us be very clear. The fact that we want to inform our fellow 
citizens and to get to the bottom of things does not put us in 
any of these categories, on the contrary. We are members of 
parliament with a responsibility for what goes on in society, 
and it so happens that GMOs are a new and growing phenomenon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say, particularly, in response to my honourable 
colleague from Egmont, that we read everything that has been 
written, everything that has been said, everything we can get 
our hands on about the subject.  What was done two years ago in 
committees, what was produced by the government two years ago, 
we also read.  I should point out, however, that this is a 
constantly evolving field and so a person has to be constantly 
updating.  What was being said two or three years ago is very 
quickly out of date, I believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one other thing I would like to add.  There is talk of 
labelling. and there is an  adjective I really feel must be 
added to that, mandatory.  I will explain why.  In the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-food, we received some people 
responsible for voluntary labelling.  We came to realize 
immediately that this was a problem: no two organizations share 
the same definition of what a GMO is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clearly evident from our readings, whether from the USA or 
Japan—in translation obviously—or from Europe, that there is 
near-complete agreement on reference to GMOs as relating to the 
mechanisms of recombinant DNA, and procedures for detecting 
genes that have been created in a laboratory in order to confer 
new characteristics to organisms to which they are transferred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now another totally different subject is cropping up very 
regularly: mutagenesis, which is something completely different. 
It is a totally different process, one which refers to chemical 
or physical actions on genes which result in certain progress 
changes in the organism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now they are trying to lump these two 
together.  The resulting whole is something that no one can 
grasp.  The result: confusion in both scientific and consumer 
communities. 
All this confusion gives us more time to do nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of doing nothing, I listened very politely to the 
government member.  Ways must also be found to centralize action 
and information.  I did a small calculation and came up with 
eight ministers responsible for this issue.  I often say that 
having one minister and one agency to deal with is already a 
lot; but if this is multiplied by eight, action is sure to grind 
to a halt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we are thus being given more time, and on this issue, more 
time is not what we want.  What we want is to inform consumers, 
the public, as quickly as possible and to reassure ourselves 
about the effects of genetically modified organisms, especially 
on health and on the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can hear certain members asking whether I know of anyone who 
has died from eating GMOs.  I find talk like that so simplistic 
that I have a tendency to become annoyed, although I am usually 
even-tempered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell members why I get annoyed:  I get annoyed because we 
must not minimize this issue.  We must be wise enough to tackle 
it head on and examine it thoroughly.  All sorts of things can 
happen: there are environmental diseases, which we are hearing 
about with increasing frequency, allergies, resistance to 
antibiotics.  Perhaps there is no connection with GMOs, but what 
we do know is that, right now, nobody is studying this or has 
proven otherwise.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very simple.  We always met with representatives of Health 
Canada in the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food. 
They told us they were there merely to obtain budgets to start 
assessments on humans, in other words on us, the consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thought is that there must be medium and long term 
evaluations, but the budgets are just starting to come through. 
When the government talks of budgets, believe me, that does not 
mean that the studies are begun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not take the precaution of taking time to do these analyses 
before getting into an evolution that cannot be reversed, 
because it moves ahead too rapidly?  The hope is that the 
consumer will be well informed. 
As we begin a new century, one so anxiously awaited, we ought to 
have labelling that is readily understood, quick to be 
inaugurated, and mandatory.  We have seen that making it 
voluntary opened up all manner of opportunities for getting 
around it and for not holding this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is part of what we are calling for, and we will continue 
the debate in all possible forums until we have that certainty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a year now—this almost feels like an anniversary to me— 
since I started the tour, petitions on GMOs and the demands for 
mandatory labelling.  I also called for the public to be 
informed and trained, not to send out a little propaganda 
pamphlet to people's homes telling them to wash their hands 
before they eat, on the right hand page, while on the page 
opposite treating GMOs as if there were nothing to worry about, 
no questions to be asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers have questions.  Without wishing to contradict the 
member who spoke before me, we know that consumers have 
questions.  There have been surveys for years.  The results are 
always the same.  We all want the same thing—information—and 
information means mandatory labelling of transgenic foods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is so much going on right now.  Last week, I was listening 
to a greenhouse grower who produces tomatoes.  He tried to label 
his tomatoes as not containing GMOs. Major food stores, which I 
will not name but which can be found throughout the region, 
would not let him label his tomatoes “not transgenic” because 
apparently if the other tomatoes were not labelled, it might 
have given the impression that they were transgenic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers do not have much leeway, but consumers do not have any 
at all.  That is why I am supporting my colleague's motion and 
why we are pushing for results on this issue, because we want 
everything to be analysed: the effects on health, as well as the 
effects on ethics and on the economy, social and environmental 
effects and, of course and above all, for me, the effects on 
agriculture because that is my particular concern.  I will be 
following this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
first let me thank hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre for 
bringing forward once again the issue of genetically modified 
foods and that of mandatory labelling.  I appreciate that her 
motion does not speak to mandatory labelling. It simply speaks to 
implementing a labelling process that will make consumers aware 
of all genetically modified produce and components in processed 
foods.  I do understand the motion that is before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to thank the hon. member for Louis-Hébert, in 
particular, who sits with me on the agricultural committee. In my 
estimation, she is probably one of the most knowledgeable 
individuals in the House when it comes to debating, talking about 
and certainly understanding the ramifications of genetically 
modified organisms.  I do thank her for educating me on a number 
of occasions at the agricultural committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre will recognize, the 
members speaking to this motion are the ones who have the most to 
gain or the most to understand with respect to agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two or three members of the agriculture committee are here.  The 
member for Palliser is here as well as is the parliamentary 
secretary, who is not only on the agriculture committee but also 
represents the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a member here who sits on the health committee who has 
brought forward the motion with respect to genetically modified 
produce.  I do feel some compassion for the member for Winnipeg 
North Centre and the fact that she could not get her committee to 
debate this very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, at one point in time we had hoped we could 
get the health committee and the agriculture committee together 
in a joint committee to debate this very complex and important 
subject on which Canadians are asking for a resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot speak to the hon. member's inability with her own 
committee, but I will give her some assurance right now that the 
agriculture committee takes this situation extremely seriously. 
The committee is now dealing with this very issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not be supporting the member's motion as it stands.  It 
is not that I do not agree with a lot of what the hon. member has 
said, but simply because I do not understand this very complex 
situation well enough to be able to say that mandatory labelling 
or labelling of any sort will be the best resolution for this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about biotechnology.  First of all I will not take a 
long time, even though I know the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food would like to stay and 
listen to me for as long as possible because he learns an awful 
lot.  I know that the Speaker would love to stay here a little 
longer and learn a little bit about genetically modified 
organisms, but I will very briefly and succinctly try to explain 
the Progressive Conservative Party's position on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Progressive Conservative Party accept biotechnology 
and genetically modified organisms as being a very major 
opportunity for Canadian agriculture.  We have always supported 
biotechnology and genetically modified organisms and believe that 
agriculture and Canadians as consumers are the beneficiaries of 
strong, very good science, and we will continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary referred to comments by Mr. Romanow 
in Saskatchewan.  Right now Saskatchewan has one of the world's 
most renowned biotechnology centres. That is very positive. 
Canadians are on the leading edge of biotechnology. This is very 
good for consumers because consumers, and producers to a degree, 
can take advantage of the changes in biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to make sure that Canadians can protect their 
position in world markets right now with biotechnology.  We 
believe that the consumers must have the proper knowledge and 
information available to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saying to the member for Winnipeg North Centre that yes, I 
agree that the government, we as the opposition and we as a 
parliament must be able to give consumers what it is that they 
want, unlike some other parties in this House that will remain 
unnamed who wish to turn a blind eye, stick their heads in the 
sand and simply say, “Never mind what the consumers want.  We 
will simply say it is safe as predicted by science and continue 
to go on with biotechnology”.  That will not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the real world consumers are demanding more information and 
knowledge when it comes to biotechnology and that is a very good 
thing. We have to make sure we listen to all the stakeholders, to 
all those organizations and groups that are demanding that 
knowledge and information.  We must make sure we put forward that 
information in a logical and knowledgeable way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not have fearmongering, as some may wish to suggest.  Let 
us make sure we do it logically.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre 
for bringing this motion forward.  My party and I will support 
her in certain movements toward information based genetically 
modified organisms with information given to consumers as they 
demand it.  It may or may not be mandatory labelling, but it will 
be—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  A Manitoba solution?  Quite possibly, 
but it will be based on what consumers require from the 
government and parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Resuming debate, the hon. member for 
Winnipeg North Centre.  I should advise the House that if the 
hon. member speaks now, she will close the debate.  She has five 
minutes for reply. 
<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have a few more minutes to speak on this 
important issue.  Before doing so, I would like to thank members 
of all parties in the House for participating in this debate and 
ensuring that we had a very comprehensive discussion in the brief 
amount of time allocated for a very important topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to some of the comments, I wish to say four things. 
First, this debate is about ensuring that the concerns of 
consumers as well as farmers are addressed.  There is no doubt 
that the uncertainty in this field is wreaking havoc not only in 
terms of individuals' concerns about their own health and 
well-being but also the grief and anxiety caused to farmers 
everywhere in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely apparent to me and I am sure to the hon. member 
for Brandon—Souris and others, that farmers and consumers, 
Canadians everywhere, want from the government a clear public 
policy, an open consultation process, a tough regulatory regime 
and decisions based on scientific evidence and independent 
research.  That is absolutely clear. That is not happening today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal spokesperson suggested that there was a wide open 
consultation process involving Canadians.  That is not the case. 
There has been little opportunity for individual Canadians, 
citizens groups and farmers organizations to participate in an 
open discussion about where we go in the future with respect to 
biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the government statement around in-depth 
research and scientific investigation of this matter, I want to 
tell the hon. member that he is not portraying the situation as 
it actually is.  There is now very little capacity in government 
in terms of in-depth research to determine the long term impacts 
of genetically modified food on health, soil and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one example, I want to mention to the hon. member that his 
own Minister of Health promised back in 1997 to reopen a lab in 
the health protection branch to study genetically modified foods. 
Three years after that, the lab is still not open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to mention to him that I actually tried to inquire 
of the government how much money is spent on research in terms of 
genetically modified foods and how much of that $65 million it 
keeps touting as being assigned to food safety has been spent on 
genetically modified foods.  What did I learn in a recent 
response to my question?  There is currently one ongoing research 
project on a topic related to genetically modified foods with a 
planned expenditure in 1999-2000 of $166,389.  There is no secret 
around the fact that the government has neither the capacity nor 
the will to do the ongoing research that is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I want to say that no one in the debate has ever 
questioned the fact that there are benefits in terms of 
biotechnology.  We are bringing to this discussion the issue of 
human safety and the right for consumers to know. What we are 
proposing today is very clearly a process that will allow 
individuals to know what they are eating and to make decisions 
based on the knowledge they are able to acquire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to go beyond that.  Hopefully there will be time 
for another debate in the future to get the government to be more 
proactive and not to be bound so much by the needs of industry. 
It should not restrict its actions to blue ribbon committees 
which are very closely tied to the industry and not linked to 
consumer groups.  We would like it to broaden the approach, be 
proactive on this issue, involve citizens and create exactly what 
I think every member of the House wants, which is a regulatory 
and policy framework that takes into account the impact on human 
health and the environment, and that it be done on the basis of 
ethical determinations that are agreed to by all Canadians. 
I do not think that is unreasonable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a final comment, I want to put on the record some thoughts 
from the New Democratic Party in terms of where we would like to 
see the government go with respect to biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have said that biotechnology as applied to food production is 
poised to expand significantly in the next millennium.  That is 
no surprise to anyone.  That is why we are having this debate 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have said that agricultural biotechnology contains both the 
promise of increasing production and adding value to agriculture, 
but also poses potential risks to production patterns, food 
safety and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have said, and it is intrinsic to this whole debate, that 
preserving the health and safety of Canadians should be given the 
highest priority in evaluating and regulating new technologies in 
food production.  This safety should be determined through 
science based decision making and independent sources of 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We bring to this debate the sense from Canadians that they have 
grave concerns over the safety of genetically modified foods but 
lack the means to identify those products and make an informed 
choice about their purchase and consumption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the concerns that we bring to this Chamber and hope 
they form the basis for government action.

<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to speak this evening about the importation 
of toxic waste into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House may recall that Canadians were stunned about a month 
ago when they learned that 90 tonnes of toxic waste from an 
American military base in Japan was bound for Canada.  In fact, 
this shipment of PCBs was on a boat bound for Vancouver.  From 
there, this waste was to be shipped across the country to 
northern Ontario where it was going to be concentrated and then 
shipped back across the country to Alberta to be burned.  It is 
really quite remarkable that this material was going to be 
shipped back and forth across the country and it was not even 
produced in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians were shocked to learn that their health was going to 
be put at risk to take care of someone else's toxic waste, in 
addition to the fact that tonnes of toxic waste of our own, PCBs 
for example, sit untreated at thousands of storage sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite clear that Canadians do not want their country 
turned into someone else's toxic waste dump.  Yet, we are 
importing this waste more quickly than we can take care of of the 
waste we produce ourselves.  We should not be importing toxic 
waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans have refused to import PCBs from other countries 
and I believe Canadians should be worthy of the same protection. 
The government is not taking the necessary measures to ensure 
that the importation of toxic wastes into Canada, whether it be 
PCBs or others, is legal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a new development on this front.  Yesterday a 
report was released by the commissioner for the Environment and 
Sustainable Development.  He had some startling things to say.  I 
will quote briefly from the report.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is still a problem in detecting hazardous waste illegally 
entering or leaving Canada.  The extent of possible damage to 
human health and the environment is unknown.  As well, Canada 
does not know whether it is fulfilling its international 
obligations to prevent the illegal traffic of hazardous waste at 
the border.  Enforcement continues to be a problem. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment commissioner is telling us that we do not know 
what is coming across our border.  We are not looking for it, not 
finding it and not enforcing it.  This is not the first time the 
commissioner has talked about this.  A report in 1997 came to the 
same conclusions.  Two years later he is looking at what 
improvements have been made.  He has a report card and there are 
only a couple of check marks and many <I>x</I>s.  He has failed 
the government on this one.  He is saying that we do not know 
what is going on and we have to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years after the auditor general told the government it was 
not protecting Canadians from illegal shipments of toxic waste, 
he is telling us that we are still not doing so.

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have signed the Basel Convention, but we still refuse to get 
serious about ending the global trade in toxic waste.  This 
government refuses to sign a sidebar to that agreement which 
would put an end to the deadly practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened to date on the whole subject of toxic waste is 
really quite startling, it is quite frightening and it is just 
not good enough.  The kind of crisis management we have seen on 
this issue is no substitute for good regulation and good 
administration.  Canadians are not getting that today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report from the independent Commissioner of the Environment 
and Sustainable Development proves that.  It is not simply things 
that the opposition parties are saying.  The government's own 
watchdog is blowing the whistle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go into more detail about the government's sorry record 
on the environment, but I do not have the time to do that.  This 
is simply one more case where Canadians are being let down when 
it comes to environmental and health protection. 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the 
Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report that 
the shipment of waste containing PCBs from U.S. military bases 
was not in fact off-loaded in Vancouver, but went on its way back 
to Japan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pleased that the U.S. government has taken responsibility 
to dispose of this cargo outside Canada.  Throughout we have 
maintained and continue to maintain that the cargo and its 
disposal are the responsibility of the U.S. department of defence 
and Trans-Cycle Industries.  As a result of this incident we have 
asked the U.S. department of defence to inform us in advance of 
any shipments of PCB contaminated waste intended for Canada, no 
matter what the PCB concentration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would ensure that our obligations under the Basel Convention 
and all federal and provincial regulations were complied with 
before any decision on allowing such a shipment would be 
rendered. Under our regulations Canada ensures that hazardous 
waste imports and exports are handled in a manner that protects 
the environment and human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new CEPA provides enhanced authority to control imports and 
exports of hazardous waste.  We will continue to introduce new 
regulations to implement specific criteria to assess the 
environmental soundness of proposed imports and will refuse any 
import if these criteria are not met.  The criteria will be 
developed in co-operation with the provinces and other 
stakeholders and will take into account the guidelines developed 
under the Basel Convention and the controls applied by the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to honour all of our international obligations 
and will take steps to continuously improve the standards for 
hazardous waste, whether these wastes are domestic or 
international in origin.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in the House today to speak to the issue of 
employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March the Minister of Human Resources Development tabled a 
report which showed that only 30% of unemployed women qualify for 
EI benefits.  At the same time the Prime Minister and the Liberal 
caucus from the Atlantic provinces called for changes to the 
unemployment insurance system so as to ensure more seats for this 
federal Liberal government in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather clear that the government recognized there were 
problems with the EI system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recently made changes to EI in order to reduce 
unemployment rates in the country.  The problem is that it did 
nothing to actually reduce the number of unemployed in Canada. 
The government is simply playing a shell game with Canadians.  It 
is easy to fool people with numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to address the growing unemployment rate in Canada the 
government redrew the boundaries for EI economic regions.  In 
Nova Scotia, for example, there are currently five regions and 
soon there will only be three.  With the old boundary system, 
Cape Breton Island was in its own region with Guysborough County. 
Now Cape Breton has been lumped in with an even larger part of 
the region, all the way to Halifax County.  This new boundary 
reduces the unemployment rate for Cape Bretoners and, in doing 
so, reduces the benefits which Cape Bretoners can receive.  This 
was just another devastating blow from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the numbers used for the unemployment rate do 
not reflect the reality of unemployment across the country.  I 
know for a fact that on Cape Breton Island the unemployment rate 
is incredibly high.  In some areas it is as high as 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a real shame that this could happen only a few short weeks 
after the House adopted a motion introduced by my colleague from 
Acadie—Bathurst and seconded by myself which called on the House 
to restore EI benefits to seasonal workers.  The motion set out 
to urge the House to undo the damage that was done back in 1996. 
Now what do we get?  Even more damage.

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Liberal government has destroyed the fish.  It is 
presently in the midst of destroying the coal industry.  This is 
all due to the mismanagement of our resources by the Liberal 
government.  What do Cape Bretoners get in return?  Less access 
to EI than they had before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The devastation is even worse for women.  As I said earlier, 
only 30% of unemployed women qualify for EI benefits.  If we turn 
the numbers around it means that 70% of unemployed women do not 
qualify for EI benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is this possible?  The finance minister is praising the 
so-called wonderful surplus budget.  He also tells us how great 
the economy is.  If the economy is so great, why is there still 
so much economic devastation?  Why do women have to pay such a 
high cost? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has acknowledged that the EI system does not 
treat women fairly.  Why can the government not address the issue 
by taking a step forward rather than taking two steps back?  Why 
will the government not do something for Canadian women?  It 
knows its own programs have shown discrimination as they relate 
to Canadian women, so my question is very simple.  Why is the 
Liberal government refusing to do something about it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
difficult to respond to the charges laid by the member opposite, 
particularly the ones about the federal government destroying the 
fish in the fishery and destroying the coal industry.  Even if 
the federal government had the power to do such things, there is 
absolutely no logical reason why any government would set about 
to accomplish it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance reform she refers to cannot be looked 
at in isolation from what is happening in the economy and the 
labour market.  The decline she referred to in regular claims by 
women reflects improvements in the labour market rather than 
changes to the rules.  In fact, the unemployment rate for adult 
women is now at 5.8%, its lowest level since 1975.  Perhaps that 
is one reason why the number of claims has lowered.  Women have 
enjoyed the best job growth in a decade at 3.2% per year. 
Furthermore, strong employment growth means fewer claims and 
longer periods of employment for women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>EI also has features that are important to women such as the 
small weeks adjustment projects which provide workers in high 
unemployment regions such as Cape Breton with higher benefits. 
Women qualified for 61% of the claims under these projects. Also 
the family supplement for low income Canadians with children has 
been increased to nearly $150 million.  Six out of ten recipients 
of that program are women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is working to ensure that all Canadians have 
access to jobs and to employment insurance when it is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The motion to adjourn the House is 
now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly the House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1).
