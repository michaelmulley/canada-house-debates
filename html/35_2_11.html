	<B>The Speaker:</B> I have received notice of a question of privilege 
from the hon. member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege with regard to the 
actions of a member of the House which I believe constitute a 
contempt of Parliament.
<P>
	I cite Joseph Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I>, 
page 210:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the sense that the House may discipline members for improper conduct, the 
practice relating to taking up the conduct of members is a matter of privilege.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Beauchesne's sixth edition citation 50 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In any case where the propriety of a Member's actions is brought into 
question, a specific charge must be made.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Page 206 of Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I> 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The conduct of a member may only be discussed in the House of Commons 
by way of a substantive or a distinct motion, i.e. a self-contained proposal 
submitted for the approval of the House and drafted in such a way as to be 
capable of expressing a decision to the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, I have a specific charge and a substantive motion. I 
will submit it to you to determine whether it should be given 
privilege:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the member for Charlesbourg, acting as the defence critic for the 
Bloc Quebecois and supported by the then Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal 
Opposition, released a communiqué on the letterhead of the office of the leader 
of the official opposition on October 26, 1995 before the referendum in Quebec 
inviting all francophone members of the Canadian Armed Forces to join the 
Quebec military in the event of a ``yes'' vote supporting separation from 
Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That in the opinion of this House, this action by the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg and the then leader of the official  opposition should be viewed as 
seditious and offensive to this House and constitutes a contempt of Parliament; 
and consequently, the House refer the matter to the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs for examination.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Beauchesne's sixth edition citation 28 refers to the Speaker's 
ruling from June 19, 1959:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-it is clear that many acts which might offend against the law or the moral 
sense of the community do not involve a Member's capacity to serve the 
people who have chosen him or her as their representative nor are they 
contrary to the usage nor derogatory to the dignity of the House of Commons. 
Members of the House of Commons, like all other citizens, have the right to 
be regarded as innocent until they are found guilty, and like other citizens 
they must be charged before they are obliged to stand trial in the courts. 
Parliament is a court with respect to its own privileges and the dignity and the 
privileges of its Members.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The member for Charlesbourg has not denied sending the 
communiqué. This is a matter of fact. It is not something we have 
to prove. It is prima facie. The question to be answered is whether 
the member is guilty of offending Parliament. In the opinion of the 
House is the hon. member for Charlesbourg guilty of sedition?
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	This issue is being debated in the media and in the public. It is 
not going away. Many of us have received letters, faxes and phone 
calls concerning this matter. Canadians from coast to coast to coast 
have been contacting me as the Reform Party's defence critic 
objecting to the action taken by the separatist party in the House.
<P>
	Retired Major-General Lewis MacKenzie recently told Diane 
Francis, the editor of the <I>Financial Post</I>: ``Only in Canada could 
someone get away with something like that. In some countries 
people would be in jail. In Canada the attitude is ignore it, it will go 
away, there are more important issues''.
<P>
	I repeat that in June of 1959 the then Speaker of the House 
pointed out that Parliament is a court with respect to its own 
privileges and dignity.
<P>
	Beauchesne's sixth edition citation 46 states clearly:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The House has, on occasion, examined the activities of Members to establish 
if they were fit to hold their seats.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We have the right and the duty to examine these activities of 
members. I am not recommending that we do this on a regular 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="558"> 558 </A></B>
<P>
basis. However, a case such as the present one warrants our 
examination. In the present  case we have a member of Parliament 
encouraging members of the Canadian Armed Forces to choose 
sides on the secession debate. This should be examined by the 
House.
<P>
	Page 188 of Maingot's states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A prima facie case of privilege in the parliamentary sense is one where the 
evidence on its face as outlined by the member is sufficiently strong for the 
House to be asked to send it to a committee to investigate whether the privileges 
of the House have been breached or a contempt has occurred and report to the 
House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The evidence here is black and white. It is in the form of a 
communiqué the hon. member sent to the military.
<P>
	With respect to whether this constitutes a contempt of 
Parliament, Erskine May's 21st edition at page 115 states that an 
offence of contempt:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-may be treated as a contempt even though there is no precedent of the 
offence. It is therefore impossible to list every act which might be considered 
to amount to contempt, the power to punish for such an offence being of its 
nature discretionary.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Maingot's, page 191:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While privilege may be codified, contempt may not-there is no closed list of 
classes of offences punishable as contempts of Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On October 29, 1980 a Speaker of the House said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The dimension of contempt of Parliament is such that the House will not be 
constrained in finding a breach of privilege of its Members or of the House. This 
is precisely the reason that, while our privileges are defined, contempt of the 
House has no limits.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, if contempt has no limits, if there need not be a 
precedent for the offence, if contempt cannot be codified and if the 
House shall not be constrained in finding a contempt of Parliament, 
how can you do anything else but allow the members of the House 
the opportunity to decide if the actions of the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg are offensive and constitute a contempt? How can 
you decide this matter offends us or not? The evidence is more than 
sufficiently strong. The evidence is conclusive. The member sent 
the communiqué. We must therefore go to the next step. We must 
determine by due process in our opinion the member's innocence 
or guilt.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	I would like to table the evidence in this case, which is the 
communiqué dated October 26, 1995 from the office of the official 
opposition.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I ask that you find this matter to be a prima facie 
question of privilege. I believe that this matter should be reviewed 
to determine whether or not the dignity of the House has been 
violated by the hon. member's actions.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, on your behalf I do take this as a 
very serious situation. It is probably one of the more serious 
situations that I as your Speaker have been confronted with since I 
was chosen as your Speaker.
<P>
	We do have on the floor a specific charge of one member to 
another member. Before I declare whether or not this is a prima 
facie case, I would make a passing comment.
<P>
	This communiqué is dated October 26, 1995. I mention that 
because although contempt can stand by itself, it comes under the 
aegis of privilege. In privilege members are admonished and 
encouraged to bring up such a matter at the earliest possible 
moment. I mention that only to put this matter into perspective.
<P>
	I will now recognize the House leader of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all I would like to point out that there was no 
unanimous consent for tabling the document referred to my 
colleague, and it is not consented to. Second, the crux of the 
problem is that the member for Charlesbourg did indeed contact 
members of the Armed Forces in this letter in order to indicate to 
them that-I have the text here-if the yes side won in the October 
30 referendum, the rights, salary levels and ranks of Quebec 
members of the Canadian Armed Forces would be recognized by 
the Government of Quebec which would have its own armed 
forces, like any other country, although obviously of limited size.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	The reason this came up is that, during the referendum 
campaign, the federalists referred to precisely that matter, saying 
``People will be losing their jobs, losing their jobs because they are 
Quebecers and Quebec will become a sovereign country. And 
either there will be no armed forces in a sovereign Quebec or 
Canada will refuse to keep citizens of Quebec on as members of its 
armed forces''. If one camp is entitled to discuss such matters, 
there are no grounds here for accusing the other of sedition, of 
rallying people against Canada or the Canadian Armed Forces. 
This was merely a response to arguments-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crawford: </B>Bull!
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, the Liberals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe: </B>I imagine some of the Liberals are Reformers 
without knowing it, considering their attitudes, behaviours, ideas.
<P>
	I see this as just part of a political debate, nothing to do with 
contempt of Parliament or calls to sedition. All it represents is 
asking a question: What will happen if sovereignty is declared by 
the people of Quebec?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="559"> 559 </A></B>
<P>
	Some people on one of the sides were examining various 
scenarios and were entitled to do so, to voice their opinion, to form 
hypotheses. Those of us on the other side feel equally entitled.
<P>
	The letter in question was not in the least against the law. Not in 
the least.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> They are quick to yell ``treason''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Exactly, the Leader of the Opposition says they 
are quick to yell ``treason''. And they are quick to do other things 
also. This certainly does not reflect any serious intent in this 
House. I feel this Parliament ought to be examining fundamental 
problems, and giving up proposing populist rabble rousing 
solutions, the stock in trade of the Reform Party.
<P>
	I would submit, Mr. Speaker, that there are no grounds for a 
question of privilege and that the motion must be rejected, not only 
because they have become aware of this letter just today. I imagine 
they are following the advice of one of their gurus, Diane Francis 
of the Financial Post, which speaks volumes, when one has some 
knowledge of the individual in question.
<P>
	There is nothing serious in any of this. Mr. Speaker, I realize you 
are faced with a serious situation, but the serious nature of the 
situation is not because they have anything serious to say. It is 
altogether different. Sometimes a serious problem arises because 
of some people's foolish behaviour. This is a clear example of 
foolish behaviour.
<P>
	Mr.Speaker, I call on you to reject any claim to a question of 
privilege.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is no doubt the question you will have to deal with is 
serious. I am sure you will deal with it in a very serious manner as 
you always do.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I believe you will have to consider mainly what 
constitutes privilege as being defined in citation 24 of Beauchesne 
which reads in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Parliamentary privilege is the sum of the peculiar rights enjoyed by each 
House collectively as a constituent part of the High Court of Parliament, and by 
Members of each House individually, without which they could not discharge 
their functions and which exceed those possessed by other bodies of 
individuals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In that regard Mr. Speaker will have to judge whether the action 
in question as alleged today constitutes an act which prevents other 
members from conducting their duties as defined in the definition 
of privilege we have before us.
<P>
	The second thing Mr. Speaker might want to consider is in 
relation to the accusation made, whether the accusation was 
delayed or whether it was brought forward to the House at the 
earliest opportunity and given the gravity, whether the delay is 
justified under the  circumstance. Mr. Speaker will have to decide 
on all those things.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker will have to rule on the importance of the issue 
itself.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	In a related matter, I ask Mr. Speaker to look at the issue of 
illegality which was raised today. I believe that one is outside the 
jurisdiction of Parliament. In addition and as an aside to the alleged 
illegality there is the issue of whether or not the action in question 
was unparliamentary and whether the issue was inappropriate for a 
member of Parliament to engage in. If that action were to be 
inappropriate, was it sufficiently inappropriate to deem an action 
by the Speaker and deem it to be a prima facie case of privilege?
<P>
	There are actions from time to time that are inappropriate but 
Mr. Speaker rules that they may not necessarily be of such 
importance as to deem them to be prima facie cases of privilege. 
On the other hand, other accusations meet that test and have been 
deemed to be so by the Speaker and have been referred to the 
parliamentary committee.
<P>
	The committee undertakes the second step of determining 
whether the prima facie case of privilege constitutes a true case of 
privilege as determined by peers of the House, members of 
Parliament sitting on the parliamentary committee on procedure, 
privilege and election.
<P>
	The committee over recent years has seldom exercised its role in 
regard to privilege as it generally deals with issues involving 
procedure, amending our rules, and elections as was done recently 
in terms of electoral redistribution and so on. Nevertheless that 
residual power does belong to that committee, once having had 
referred to it by Mr. Speaker a prima facie case of privilege.
<P>
	I believe those are the issues Mr. Speaker will have to address in 
making his determination. Then Mr. Speaker will bring that prima 
facie ruling back to the House for the House to refer the matter if it 
is deemed necessary to the appropriate committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, the point was raised whether or not this 
matter came to the attention of the House at the earliest possible 
convenience.
<P>
	I would like to give the House my assurance that I brought this 
matter forward at the earliest possible convenience. The Speaker 
knows that the House was prorogued for some 10 weeks. That was 
not the fault of this party or myself. It took some time for the 
research to be done. I know the Speaker will take the time to read 
the blues and he will see we have quoted from Erskine May, 
Maingot and also parliamentary privileges from Beauchesne's as 
pointed out by the Liberal whip. There was a tremendous amount of 
research. This is a complex issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="560"> 560 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to assure members of the House that it is in the purview 
of the powers we have in the House of Commons to determine 
whether these actions of the member were in fact a contempt of 
this place. We ourselves must determine that. That is why I have 
brought this forward today.
<P>
	The main purpose of my effort is to draw the line on what is 
unacceptable behaviour with respect to trying to get members of 
the Canadian Armed Forces to take sides in the secession issue. 
That is the purpose of this motion: to draw the line and say what is 
acceptable and what is unacceptable in the eyes of this House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> I have 
three short comments to make, Mr. Speaker. First of all, regarding 
Reform's claim that they did not have the time to raise this question 
of privilege because of prorogation, I should point out that the 
referendum was held on October 30. Between the months of 
October and February, we were here for two whole months back in 
November and December. At least we were. I do not know where 
they were, but they certainly had enough time to raise the question.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	Second, since my colleague argued that members of the military 
were asked to participate in an act of secession, I should remind 
you that they were sounded out because they had the right to vote, 
like any other citizen of Quebec. There are not two separate votes, 
one for members of the military and one for other citizens. Third, 
they wanted to know what would happen to them just like all 
federal public servants, to whom the Bloc Quebecois and the whole 
sovereignist movement had explained what they could expect after 
a yes vote in the referendum.
<P>
	We feel that public servants working for the departments of 
labour, agriculture or human resources development are just as 
important as their defence colleagues and vice versa. We had a duty 
to answer their questions and not to leave it entirely to federalists, 
who were anticipating the worst and saying that sovereignists 
would not meet any of their commitments.
<P>
	The document clearly specifies that all soldiers wanting to would 
be invited to transfer to Quebec's armed forces in the event of a yes 
vote. I went to enough meetings and I even saw television 
programs making it clear that Quebec soldiers would have the 
choice of staying in the Canadian Forces or switching to Quebec's 
armed forces.
<P>
	I know that Reform members were against Quebec soldiers' 
being allowed to stay in the Canadian Forces. So today we hear two 
different tunes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as many of my colleagues on all sides of the House have 
done, we had taken note of the action of the member opposite at 
about the time of the referendum.
<P>
	I want to make two or three points that I think might be helpful to 
you, Mr. Speaker. First, we have already made an attempt to 
distinguish the functions of the House of Commons from the 
functions of the ordinary courts of law. Most of the material facts 
lying in the background I would have thought would have been 
disposed of by those public authorities whose job it is to look at 
these things.
<P>
	In dealing with the background facts one notes that it is an 
arguable counselling of a member of the armed forces which has 
taken place contrary to the National Defence Act. One notes that it 
is arguably a seditious act which has taken place, being a 
subversion of the federal sovereignty tending to public disorder or 
a disorder. It is arguable that that outcome could have occurred.
<P>
	One fact should be taken note of, and I am responding to the 
remarks of the House leader of the Bloc Quebecois. It was fairly 
clear to me as a member of Parliament that in the event there had 
been a majority yes vote in the province of Quebec, that would not 
by itself have created the Quebec national sovereignty that has 
been discussed here. Even in the statute, as I understand it, in the 
province of Quebec there was a significant material lag time 
between the result of a referendum and any decision on sovereignty 
or secession.
<P>
	The leader of the Bloc Quebecois has attempted to describe what 
his colleague has done as some kind of a quasi-job creation 
program for orphaned members of the Canadian Armed Forces. I 
suggest that as a respectful member I cannot accept that and I 
respectfully suggest that you, Mr. Speaker, should not either.
<P>
	I believe there has been a substantial lapse of time involved. In 
addition to the reasons put forward by the member moving the 
motion, the House was prorogued for a period of time and 
adjourned for a period of time. There was also a period of time 
when the public authorities that I mentioned earlier were looking at 
this with reference to the Criminal Code and the National Defence 
Act. They, in their good judgment, have decided not to proceed to 
deal with those background underlying facts by laying any charges.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	At the end of the day you, Mr. Speaker, are being asked to take 
note of the actions of a member who has used the House of 
Commons facilities and stationery in taking action which may 
bring the House into disrepute and may involve the House in some 
prima facie illegality either in relation to the Criminal Code or to 
the National Defence Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="561"> 561 </A></B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it is not an easy decision for you. I go back to 
my opening remarks when I said that I tend to believe this is a 
matter that should be dealt with, for the most part, by the ordinary 
courts and not by the court of Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to make a very brief submission with respect to this matter.
<P>
	To all intents and purposes this is a question of the rule of law 
and respect for the rule of law. Because a member of Parliament is 
alleged to have breached the Criminal Code, the issue becomes, as 
well as the other issues, whether or not members of Parliament 
should be above the rule of law.
<P>
	My recollection is that this matter has not been considered by 
either the Attorney General for the province of Ontario or his 
counterpart in the province in Quebec. There are two issues here; 
one with respect to a breach of the Criminal Code of Canada and 
the other with respect to the matter raised by the hon. member, a 
breach of the privileges of the House.
<P>
	Surely, Mr. Speaker, you would agree that the first is the more 
important issue, whether or not the Criminal Code of Canada has 
been breached with respect to the laws of sedition. It is clear that 
there is a general reluctance on the part of authority, whether it is 
here in Ottawa or at the provincial attorneys general level, to 
pursue this issue because of the political consequences of a 
prosecution.
<P>
	I do not believe that Parliament or the attorneys general of 
Quebec or Ontario should not prosecute because of potential 
political consequences. You either have a criminal law to which all 
the citizens of the country are subjected or you do not. In order for 
there to be respect for the rule of law there has to be a perception 
that nobody is above it, not even members of Parliament and not 
even judges.
<P>
	I would recommend or urge you, Mr. Speaker, not to dismiss this 
matter on the basis of a technicality which is whether or not the 
matter has been brought to the attention of Parliament at the 
earliest opportunity. I think that would be a cop out and would be 
seen as summarily dealing with a matter of grave national 
importance.
<P>
	I would urge you, Mr. Speaker, to refer the matter to the 
appropriate committee of the House so that the committee will be 
charged with investigating all aspects of this matter. That 
committee, in my respectful submission, should be urging the 
attorney general for the province of Ontario and the attorney 
general for the province of Quebec to review the matter. If in their 
wisdom they decide that there are no grounds for criminal 
prosecution then so be it.
<P>
	However, if there are grounds for a criminal prosecution the 
criminal prosecution should proceed and  the attorneys general, 
either one of the two, should not take into account political 
consequences of the rule of law or a potential breach of the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	We are not talking about a minor or summary conviction 
offence. We are talking about an indictable offence under the 
Criminal Code. Therefore, I would urge you, Mr. Speaker, to refer 
this matter to the committee for complete consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the essential thing we are discussing here is a breach of 
parliamentary privilege.
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to point out that it goes beyond that: this House is 
representative of the people of Canada. The issue is of national 
importance. It is incumbent on us to discuss it here. But when we 
do so, we are doing so on behalf of all Canadians. All Canadians 
have been sitting by for months looking at the issue and asking: 
``What is happening?''
<P>
	I would suggest that many of us as members of Parliament have 
received words, letters, protests from citizens asking: ``What are 
you doing?''
<P>
	I suggest that in addition to addressing the privileges of 
Parliament in this issue we are also addressing offences, if not in 
law as pointed out by the last member, in the privileges of the 
Canadian people.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the House 
has spent enough time on this point of privilege this morning. We 
had some important problems to discuss. The real problems are 
those of the bills we should be debating, those of the unemployed. 
We are digressing; the government and the other opposition party 
are digressing from the discussion we should be having on the real 
problems at hand.
<P>
	We asked for an allotted day in order to talk about those 
problems and not to find out if the Bloc Quebecois had the right to 
tell the truth to people during the referendum campaign.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I call on you to declare the debate concluded on this 
question of privilege. I think you have heard enough to have a good 
idea and that you will be able to hand down a fair ruling in the near 
future.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> The House today is being faced with one of the 
more serious matters we have been faced with in this 35th 
Parliament. As a matter of fact, in my view it is so serious that the 
matter's being raised at the first opportunity, which I have brought 
up in passing, is moot.
<P>
	The ultimate act in which one member may confront another 
member is by making a charge against that member. Mr. Speaker 
Michener noted that there should be no investigation of any 
member's conduct unless there is a specific charge. This specific 
charge must be made by way of a substantive motion.
<P>
	I am of the opinion that nothing will be gained by delaying 
consideration of this issue to a later date.
<P>
	I believe the charges are so grave against one of our own 
members that the House should deal with this accusation forthwith. 
I invite the hon. member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt to 
put his motion before the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the member for Charlesbourg, acting as the defence critic for the 
Bloc Quebecois and supported by the then Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal 
Opposition, released a communiqué on the letterhead of the office of the leader 
of the official opposition on October 26, 1995 before the referendum in Quebec 
inviting all francophone members of the Canadian Armed Forces to join the 
Quebec military in the event of a ``yes'' vote supporting separation from 
Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That in the opinion of this House, this action by the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg, and the then leader of the official opposition should be viewed as 
seditious and offensive to this House and constitutes a contempt of Parliament; 
and consequently, the House refer the matter to the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs for examination.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Who will be the seconder for this motion? The 
honourable member for Saanich-Gulf Islands.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, my main purpose of this effort today is 
to draw the line on what is unacceptable behaviour with respect to 
trying to get members of the Canadian Armed Forces to take sides 
on the secession issue.
<P>
	Canadians from coast to coast have been contacting me as the 
defence critic for the Reform Party of Canada objecting to this 
action taken by the separatist party in the House.
<P>
	Retired Major-General Lewis MacKenzie recently told Diane 
Francis, the editor of the <I>Financial Post</I>: ``Only in Canada could 
you get away with something like that. In some countries people 
would be waiting in jail. In Canada the attitude is ignore it, it will 
go away, there are more important issues''.
<P>
	Many Canadians share my view that there are no issues more 
important than the one the House faces today.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	We in this place have tried to behave accordingly, waiting for the 
people of Quebec to say no to separation. For example, many of us 
did not agree with the fairness of the referendum question. Many of 
us had problems with many things surrounding the activities of the 
separatists in Quebec, the government and the words of the 
separatist party in this House.
<P>
	However, Canadians are strongly objecting to what was done to 
our Canadian Armed Forces personnel during the pre-referendum 
debates. The call to defect from the Canadian military is more than 
Canadians can accept as acceptable behaviour by parliamentarians. 
It is more than our armed forces personnel should have to accept as 
acceptable behaviour from elected representatives in this place.
<P>
	We must not be forced to sit on our hands in the face of this 
incident. We must protect the integrity of this institution and have 
it seen by all Canadians that we are doing everything we can to 
ensure that hon. members conduct themselves within the limits of 
acceptable behaviour.
<P>
	We have tried to deal with the attempt to break up our country. 
We have met every argument head on in our attempts to keep the 
country unified.
<P>
	It is not fair to Canadians that this incident has no remedy. It is 
not fair that this thing has happened without any form of authority 
or debate to respond to it. Canadians want this House to deal with 
what many describe as seditious and offensive behaviour to this 
House.
<P>
	All hon. members of this House are trying to respond to their 
constituents, asking for an explanation of how it is that our military 
can be meddled with by those attempting to break up our country. 
This House owes Canadians the right to pursue offensive actions on 
behalf of every person represented in this place. This House owes 
our Canadian Armed Forces personnel the right to have this matter 
investigated by us. We owe it to ourselves to make sure that this 
incident is not offensive to the Parliament of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="563"> 563 </A></B>
<P>
	Media reports advise me that the call to arms printed on the 
letterhead of the Leader of Her Majesty's Official Opposition was 
faxed to national media outlets and to every Canadian forces base 
in Quebec. The communiqué reached our peacekeepers in Bosnia. 
The Liberal defence minister called the plot shocking and 
outrageous. The Liberal defence minister has told the media that 
he sought legal advice from the top echelons at the Department 
of National Defence. Since then we have heard nothing from the 
Liberal defence minister.
<P>
	Canadians know that the minister has once again mismanaged 
his duties of his cabinet portfolio. Canadians wanted something to 
be done about what many people believe to be a criminal act. 
Canadians are proud of our military establishment and we are 
anxious to speak up on behalf of the men and women serving in the 
Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	No one, no one can meddle with the Canadian Armed Forces and 
brag about it. Brag about it; that is what they have done. I have 
been told that the Bloc Quebecois voted on this intention in its 
caucus. The Bloc Quebecois caucus voted in support of releasing 
this communiqué and then the Leader of Her Majesty's Official 
Opposition certainly supported sending the communiqué.
<P>
	As of today Canadians perceive no apologies, no regrets and no 
Mr. Bouchard. The people of Canada have tried to take this thing to 
the courts because the Liberals have decided to do nothing about it. 
Everyone knows that for political reasons the Liberals have advised 
themselves not to touch this one. The Liberals did not ask Lucien 
Bouchard to retract the communiqué, discipline his caucus 
colleagues or apologize on behalf of the separatists. The 
appropriateness of this kind of behaviour should be debated in 
public.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	The release of the communiqué calls into question the integrity 
of certain Quebec separatists. How can these same political leaders 
declare that they intend to engage in peaceful negotiations with the 
rest of Canada? A yes vote in the referendum was supposed to 
mean that negotiations were to begin. However, it is very clear 
from the actions of the Bloc Quebecois defence critic that a yes 
vote would have been treated by some separatists as some sort of 
immediate declaration of independence and sovereignty.
<P>
	The people of Quebec were supposed to be voting yes to 
negotiating a new deal with Canada. With the release of the 
communiqué-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The member for Chambly on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of privilege please. The member 
said earlier that the House of Commons is a court. The member just 
made some declarations based  on hear-say, without any evidence. 
If this is really a court, then the appropriate rules still apply.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, the House of Commons is the 
highest court in the country. As members, we have the privilege of 
debating in this House. We are now debating a motion which was 
tabled. Maybe you have a point, but not a point of order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, the people of Quebec were supposed to 
be voting yes to negotiating a new deal with Canada. With the 
release of the communiqué it seems that the people of Quebec were 
misled. They were being asked to vote yes to the undermining of 
the Canadian Armed Forces starting the day after a yes vote. How 
can we allow special briefings by the defence department to the 
Bloc member in question or indeed his separatist caucus when we 
know that they are capable of this type of activity?
<P>
	By November 11, 1995 the Toronto <I>Star</I>, an unimpeachable 
Liberal source, reported that the Bloc's whip denied knowing 
details of the communiqué. In my view this points to the reckless 
disbandment of the hon. member for Charlesbourg. Another 
explanation of the Toronto <I>Star</I> report would point to the 
possibility that the Bloc whip himself honestly did not understand 
the significance of the communiqué. Again I must question the 
prudence of providing these minds with the information contained 
in special briefings on the Canadian Armed Forces which are given 
to members of Canada's Standing Committee on National Defence.
<P>
	On a related matter, Quebec Deputy Premier Bernard Landry 
wrote a quick note to all foreign diplomats in Canada encouraging 
them to recognize Quebec's new independence from Canada the 
day after a yes vote. The deputy premier sent his quick notes off to 
diplomats the night before the referendum.
<P>
	I come to the controversial word ``lendemain'' which was in the 
communiqué. Some people say it means the ``next day'' in English.
<P>
	As with the action of Quebec's deputy premier, what we are 
watching here is the action of a very few excited men. One is the 
deputy premier; the other is the Bloc's defence critic. The actions 
which these men took were without a doubt wrong. They were not 
thought through completely. They were damaging and regrettable. 
They are mistakes.
<P>
	It was a mistake for the deputy premier to insult Canada by 
encouraging foreign diplomats to interfere with Canadian politics. 
It was a mistake for the Bloc's defence critic to contact Canadian 
Armed Forces personnel and coerce them into choosing sides in the 
secession debate. Again, there are no apologies for these seemingly 
sinister actions. Having said that, what we are talking about may be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="564"> 564 </A></B>
<P>
truly mistakes. No one knows  because we have not dealt with these 
matters. Mistakes can be corrected.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	Many people have been hurt as a result of the efforts of the 
Quebec separatists. Canadians have been killed.
<P>
	We still remember the previous premier of Quebec blaming the 
loss of the referendum on those voters in Quebec who were new 
Canadians, Canadians of different cultures, anglophones and 
allophones. Mistakes hurt people. These mistakes must be 
addressed. There should be no apologies for these actions and no 
apologies are volunteered.
<P>
	We must bring these matters to the attention of the proper 
authorities. Today, as if I had the power of the proper authority, I 
raise the matter of the communiqué. The Government of Canada 
has the authority to deal with this matter. Our courts have tried it. 
The Liberal Party of Canada has chosen not to exercise the 
authority of our federal government with respect to this 
communiqué.
<P>
	The constituents of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt sent me 
to Ottawa because I am not a Liberal, yet I have the power of our 
federal government. The people I represent have vested this power 
in me. They have entrusted it with me. They have asked me to 
come to Ottawa and see that our federal government protects 
Canadians and the integrity of this House.
<P>
	I am raising this matter in the House and I am raising it in the 
defence committee later today. I have some serious problems with 
the Liberal members sitting on the defence committee who vote in 
support of members of the Bloc Quebecois to serve as vice-chairs.
<P>
	The Liberals I have no doubt are greatly relieved that last week I 
made public my plan to force them to draw the line in the sand on 
what is unacceptable behaviour by parliamentarians. The Liberals 
are sure that the member for Charlesbourg will not stand for 
re-election as the vice-chair for the defence committee. The 
Liberals under the auspicious eye of the Liberal whip, a man to be 
feared if one is a Liberal, plan to elect a different Bloc Quebecois 
member as vice-chair. The same Liberal Party whip described the 
communiqué using the terms ``dangerous'' and ``mutiny'' in the 
same sentence. This must have been following his public statement 
that he knew very little of the details of the communiqué.
<P>
	I hope the new vice-chairs will know that the Canadian Armed 
Forces personnel are only released after a six-month period and not 
the next day.
<P>
	The communiqué cannot be described as a job offer. I would like 
to point this out. What we are talking about here is not Zellers 
asking the people from Wal-Mart to come over to the new firm. He 
asked members of the Canadian Armed Forces, men and women 
who have  pledged allegiance to this country, to move to a new 
armed forces-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> To desert.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> -to desert the Canadian Armed Forces with their 
arms. That is the difference. It is not a job offer. It cannot be 
construed as a job offer.
<P>
	In conclusion, I urge that the actions of the member for 
Charlesbourg and the then Leader of the Official Opposition be 
referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs. I urge the defence committee members to seriously 
consider casting a vote supporting the Bloc Quebecois members for 
any chairmanship position offered in this House of Commons.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, thank you very much for your time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to shed some light on the matter raised by the Reform 
Party today and to ensure all Canadians are clear about what we 
said to Quebecers, I will read the press release. You may then 
accuse me of sedition if you want.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Ottawa, Thursday October 26, 1995. The Official Opposition Critic for 
National Defence, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee on National 
Defence and MP for Charlesbourg, Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob, put forward his 
position today concerning the national defence policy of a sovereign Quebec. 
According to him, ``Quebec will have the moral obligation to participate in 
collective security by means of international alliances. Obviously,'' he said, 
``because of its financial constraints, Quebec should not aim to equip itself with 
an army capable of protecting the integrity of its immense territory. It is 
unrealistic to think of maintaining or creating a costly military (army, navy and 
air force) similar to the Canadian structure, given the current economic 
situation,'' he added, ``especially in light of the Quebec population's marked 
tendency to favour a more peaceful option than the rest of Canada in defence 
matters''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	No doubt he was thinking of the Reform Party, when he said that.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Jacob recalled that Quebecers have never questioned the value of UN 
peace missions. All the same, he considers that in order to participate and 
collaborate in international security ``Quebec must devote itself to having an 
adequately trained defence force''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Quebec's participation in collective security could never be compared with 
that of the United States, France or England and ``a realism dictated by financial 
logic will lead us to determine our priorities and possibilities'', emphasized the 
MP for Charlesbourg, who believes that the government of a sovereign Quebec 
should made the best use of the resources already deployed on its territory ``in 
order to allow all military responsibilities to be carried out at the least cost''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Jacob believes that Quebec needs a defence force, especially to watch over 
and intervene on its territory, to participate in strategic international alliances and 
in certain peace missions as well as to respond to all civil security needs, such as 
natural disasters and search and rescue. The MP for Charlesbourg  believes that to 
properly carry out its functions, Quebec will have need of all Quebecers presently 
enlisted in the armed forces. As well, he added that Quebec will be part of NATO, </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="565"> 565 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``which has standards of democracy, respect for civil and human rights that we 
share''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
At least I hope it is shared by everyone here.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``The day after a yes win,'' he says, ``Quebec should immediately create a 
Department of Defence, the embryo of a major state, and offer all Quebecers 
serving in the Canadian Forces the chance to integrate into the Quebec Forces 
``while keeping their rank, seniority and retirement funds as a means to ensure a 
better transition,'' he assured.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Jacob explained that Quebec already pays 23.5 per cent of the Canadian 
military budget, being more than $2.6 billion a year. It will not spend more upon 
becoming sovereign, he says, even predicting a saving of approximately $700 
million since ``Quebec will no longer have to pay for Canada's extravagances, 
buying too much for too high a price''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Bloc Quebecois MP continued by emphasizing ``the professionalism and 
the quality of officers who are Quebecers, the exploits of the 22nd Regiment and 
the 5th Brigade from Valcartier, as well as the air force from Bagotville who 
were able, with brilliance, to fulfil the peace missions with which they were 
entrusted''. As well, he pointed out, the St-Jean Military College, which had 
acquired an international distinction, should re-open. ``All of this expertise will 
not disappear with Quebec's accession to sovereignty and, personally, I think 
that soldiers of Quebec origin will respect the people's decision and will transfer 
their loyalty to the new country whose security they will ensure'', Mr. Jacob 
concluded.</BLOCKQUOTE>
This is the end of the press release.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, where is there a call to arms in this 
text? Nowhere. I imagine there was interpretation, so they must 
have understood in their own language. There is no call to arms in 
this text. Nowhere.
<P>
	It is suggested that we had discussions or dealings with Quebec 
members of the Canadian Armed Forces. We did, because we 
consider them full fledged members of our society. The men and 
women of the Canadian Armed Forces are citizens, first rate 
citizens, and, as such, they have a say. It is our duty to come to 
them with a plan that is not a secret plan, a plan that was outlined 
during an election campaign which culminated in the election of 
some of our people and a plan that was explained in this House on 
many occasions.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	There is nothing to hide. We were just explaining to them what 
their rights would be in the event of a yes vote. That is basically 
what we did-and it was our duty to do so-and we did the same 
thing for other public servants, who also have an important role to 
play in our society, in Quebec and Canada. We did our duty.
<P>
	Same thing with the diplomats-reference was made to 
diplomats that Deputy Premier Bernard Landry contacted. Indeed, 
matters were dealt with peacefully.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. I would like 
clarification from the Chair that this is questions and comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> I though we had resumed debate.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> No, we were on questions and comments, so I 
thought the hon. member might have a question to ask.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, continuing with my question, I 
wonder if this whole argument, these tactics, will not just go to 
show their inability to become the official opposition, their 
inability to win an election, their inability to sit on committees and 
their inability to carry out normal, and I stress the word normal, 
political-and I would add democratic-duties in this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member has approximately two minutes 
to respond.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
intervention. I thank him for again reading the communiqué into 
the record of the House.
<P>
	I point out that this is the evidence and what he said today is in it. 
There are quotes from the hon. member for Charlesbourg who says 
in the communiqué: ``We will have to use and rationalize the 
resources already deployed in the territory of Quebec''.
<P>
	The evidence is in black and white. The member sent the 
communiqué. The communiqué was on the loyal opposition's 
letterhead. It is a black and white case. The evidence is that they 
sent the communiqué. It was done.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> There are only about 60 seconds left. Does the 
member have a question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my comments call attention to the fact that in my time of 35 plus 
years in the military, the most serious offences were sedition or 
mutiny from within the ranks of the military. For it to come from an 
outside authority such as a parliamentarian makes it an even more 
serious offence.
<P>
	The second point I have to make is that the Bloc is trying to give 
the impression that this was only going to take place eventually.
<P>
	I quote from the press release:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	``The day after a yes win''. Does this mean the very next day, the 
day after or several weeks later? I do not know. ``The day after a 
yes win, Quebec should immediately create a Department of 
Defence''. Right away.

	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the

have had an opportunity to review the motion that the hon. member 
has put forward and I see some problems with the recitals in the 
motion.
<P>
	We need some time to consider the text carefully and perhaps 
offer some amendments or suggestions to the motion. For example, 
the recitals prejudge the reference that the hon. member is making.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	Is the hon. member asking that this matter be sent to the 
committee? In his recital he is prejudging the decision that might 
be considered by the committee one way or another. The recital 
finds guilt or assigns blame. Rather than debate the merits of the 
matter in the House today, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the debate be now adjourned.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Kamloops for

<P>
	This is the identical bill I introduced on March 17, 1994. 
Pursuant to special order of the House passed on March 4, I am 
requesting this bill be reinstated to the position it was in prior to or

The effect of this reintroduction will be that the justice committee 
will once again be seized with this bill.

	This bill would repeal section 745 of the code, which allows 
convicted killers to apply to have their parole ineligibility reduced.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ) </B>moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-234, an act to amend the Criminal Code (genital 
mutilation of female persons).
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, this bill is in the same form as Bill C-277 
was at the time of prorogation of the first session of the 35th 
Parliament.
<P>
	This bill seeks to prohibit any direct or indirect involvement in 
the practice of genital mutilation of female persons. It makes it a 
criminal act liable to a maximum imprisonment term of five years. 
The object is to make sure that there is no doubt in anyone's mind, 
whether relatives, friends, doctors, community stakeholders, 
lawyers or judges, that genital mutilation is absolutely not 
justifiable and that, on the contrary, such practice must be severely 
punished so as to deter anybody from trying to circumvent the law.

EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IN CANADA</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House require the Minister of Human Resources Development to 
withdraw Bill C-12, an act respecting employment insurance in Canada, from 
the Order Paper immediately and go back to the drawing board, since this 
reform hits young people, women, seasonal workers and immigrants hard.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, if this House had any sensitivity 
whatsoever to the situation of the unemployed, we would have been 
involved in discussion of this extremely important motion for three 
hours by now. The House has taken up three hours with discussions 
of something far removed from the motion we have tabled. This 
clearly shows a lack of sensitivity to those Canadians who will be 
bearing the brunt of the severe cutbacks to the unemployment 
insurance system. I believe it also demonstrates how tenuous a 
grasp the people involved have of the realities in their ridings and 
their regions, whether in Quebec or elsewhere.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	The matter under discussion will have dramatic repercussions all 
across Canada. The Minister of Human Resources Development, 
backed up so kindly by the Minister of Finance, has decided 
unemployment insurance needed reforming. There had been 
feelings that yes, perhaps the plan did need some modernizing, 
perhaps to make sure the money invested in it was used in the 
workers' best interests. Perhaps the time might have come for the 
government to review the use of the  billions of dollars in the 
unemployment 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="570"> 570 </A></B>
<P>
insurance fund, so as to get better use from it. We are open to 
looking at an unemployment insurance system aimed at returning 
people to the work force, helping workers retrain, adapting the 
labour force to market needs. Well, we are open to considering this. 
No one can be against progress.
<P>
	However, when this government came to power, two years ago, 
right from the start, on the pretence that it was going to overhaul 
the system, it announced a major social program reform. It said that 
it was going to issue a document explaining to Canadians how 
social programs, including unemployment insurance, were going to 
be modified. The then minister kept on postponing the release of 
drafts and, eventually, began to hint at an unemployment insurance 
reform that was going to hurt.
<P>
	I remember how my colleague, the member for Mercier, would 
rise in this House and ask the then minister: ``Is it true that the 
government is getting ready to cut the unemployment insurance 
system in such and such a way? Is it true that the government is 
getting ready to hit young people with its reform?'' The only 
answer we ever got from the minister was that the member was ill 
informed. He never let on to what was being planned. The 
documents coming from his office were working papers, mere 
scraps of paper on which suggestions had been haphazardly 
scribbled for the minister's attention, recommending cuts here or 
there; but the minister claimed they were without foundation.
<P>
	We were kept waiting. We were patient. We asked questions. We 
warned the government. Finally, a bill was introduced, then 
withdrawn and reintroduced, unchanged; its main objective is 
essentially to make cuts. Indeed, after cuts of $2.4 billion overall in 
the unemployment insurance system in 1994, current numbers 
show that within two years an additional $1.5 billion dollars will be 
cut from the program.
<P>
	Granted, these days, we must expect cuts, and some reduction in 
benefits. But what really shocked us when we scrutinized the 
numbers was to find out-people might not believe this-that the 
federal government has not paid one penny into the unemployment 
insurance fund since 1990. Is it acceptable for a government which 
has not been paying one penny into the unemployment insurance 
fund to use employers' and employees' contributions to finance its 
deficit?
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Yet, this is precisely what the federal government is doing. It is 
unacceptable that a government, a Minister of Finance-the figures 
are now known because the budget has been tabled-dare write in 
their budget papers: ``Surplus of Unemployment Insurance Fund 
1994-95, $4.1 billion; 1995-96, $5 billion; 1996-97, $5 billion; 
1997-98, $5.3 billion''. And the figures are not yet available for 
subsequent years.
<P>
	What makes people mad in rural Quebec, or rural Canada for 
that matter, is that they must get 10, 12 or 15 weeks of employment 
per year if they work in a seasonal sector. Is it not appalling to 
realize that you might lose your unemployment insurance benefits 
because the Minister of Finance decided, right in the middle of an 
employment crisis, that he would take $5 billion out of the fund to 
help reduce the deficit?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> This is horrible. This is disgusting.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Shame, shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, there have been demonstrations just 
about everywhere. And there will be more, because the people who 
are victimized, who understand what the government is doing, 
refuse to accept and cannot understand. How can you understand, 
when your total income is $10,000, $12,000 or $15,000 per year, 
maybe less? How can you understand that the federal government 
is going to ask you to help pay for its poor management? How can 
you accept, when you are reduced to survive on the pittance 
provided under the unemployment insurance program, how can 
you accept with equanimity that the federal government will reduce 
your benefits? Especially when you know that the fund has a 
surplus.
<P>
	This is the first time that we encounter a situation like this one. 
Some people might say: ``Well the opposition is against it, this is 
its role, it has to oppose every project and every reform''. This is 
not the case. This is the first time, as far as anyone can remember, 
that such a thing is being done during an employment crisis. All 
members have to do is find out what is happening in their ridings. 
We have an employment crisis, the unemployment rate is very high 
and the economy is not picking up, yet, this is the time that the 
government is choosing to take surplus money out of a fund to 
which it does not contribute. It takes the money and reduces the 
benefits provided through the fund. That is unprecedented.
<P>
	You may recall the time when the Liberals were dashing across 
Canada to condemn the heartless changes made to the UI plan by 
the Tories. They were up in arms, making speeches in this House to 
explain how loathsome it was for the Conservative Party to dare 
tamper with the UI fund.
<P>
	Today, they are the ones who are dealing with the deficit in the 
UI fund by taking $1.5 billion over two years away from the 
unemployed and taking back with both hands the $5 billion a year 
the finance minister needs to compensate for his government's 
mismanagement. This is unacceptable.
<P>
	The minister is proposing a reform. I hope he will become more 
sensitive to the demonstrators, as well as to the motion we put 
forward today. I hope he will regain a little compassion for those 
who will be his next victims. I hope he will stop accusing those 
who demonstrate because they are being deprived of their liveli-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="571"> 571 </A></B>
<P>
hoods of  being lazy and reluctant to look for work and of being 
professional protesters.
<P>
	The minister should change his attitude, as it is unacceptable. He 
should be a little more open to people in need and understand that 
his reform is not wanted. It is not wanted in the regions of Quebec. 
It is not wanted in the Maritimes. It is not wanted in Ontario either 
because it is unfair. It is regressive. It creates unemployment and 
poverty.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	The proposed reform is hardest on young people. Unfortunately, 
they are the first to be affected, as is often the case. It hits young 
people hard by reducing their benefits and those of all other 
workers. Students working less than 15 hours a week will now have 
to pay premiums, which they did not have to do before. In any case, 
they will never manage to accumulate enough hours to collect 
benefits. I have plenty of examples that I cannot help using. A 
student working 15 hours a week for 52 weeks will have 780 hours 
accumulated at the end of the year. Do you know how many hours 
will now be required to qualify for benefits under the minister's 
bill? A total of 910 hours. Someone who works 15 hours a week 
will not accumulate enough hours to collect benefits. And there are 
many other examples.
<P>
	The plan contains nothing for young people. Not only does it not 
support them, but it also takes benefits away from them. This plan 
also hits women hard because they often have to make do with part 
time work, and God knows how hard this reform is on part time 
employees. As for seasonal workers, they are the ones in the 
regions now trying to alert public opinion. They cannot even begin 
to imagine the adverse effects this reform will have on their 
everyday lives, but they do know one thing-as fishermen, forestry 
workers or people working in the tourist industry, whether in the 
Gaspe Peninsula, in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region or in 
any other part of this country, they know that they need this system 
to earn a decent living. And the only alternative available to them, 
with this insensitive government dipping into the fund, their only 
way out will more than likely be to go on welfare.
<P>
	There are examples galore. Virtually all classes of workers will 
be affected by this reform. But what is important to notice is that, 
while attacking these people in their very dignity, the government 
is telling the provinces: ``Your transfer payments will be reduced. 
The Canada social transfer providing funding for social assistance, 
health care and so on will be cut''. So much cutting has taken place 
that the Minister of Finance saw a need, in his budget speech, to set 
a threshold, realizing that the Canada social transfer had all but 
disappeared, which would have made it very awkward for the 
federal government to keep constantly interfering in jurisdictions 
that are not its own. But that is another story, and we will come 
back to it later.
<P>
	By making cuts to the Canada social transfer, the Minister of 
Finance is attacking the provinces' budgets. He is shifting his 
responsibility onto provincial governments.
<P>
	Did you know, Mr. Speaker, that the provinces will have to look 
after not only those workers whom the federal government will 
have deliberately kicked out of the UI system, but also individuals 
who will be forced onto social assistance, for which federal funding 
has been cut. Just imagine in what kind of predicament this 
government is putting the provinces and the regions. This is totally 
unacceptable.
<P>
	The motion reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House require the Minister of Human Resources Development to 
withdraw-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Not that he make a few minor amendments here and there and 
change this or that to keep helping himself to the fund, as he is 
doing now.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-withdraw Bill C-12, an act respecting employment insurance in Canada, 
from the Order Paper immediately and go back to the drawing board-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Because there is no way that the opposition, and the central 
labour bodies and organized labour groups, could agree to let this 
government feed on funds that belong to the workers.
<P>
	Instead of attacking the workers, the government should-and 
we urge it to do so-go after those high income earners who do not 
pay any taxes and companies that take advantage of tax havens, the 
financial implications of which have not even been assessed by 
Finance Canada.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	These would make interesting goals for the government, if only 
it believed in social justice. But no, the easiest and most obvious 
thing to do is to go after society's most disadvantaged, to try to take 
away from them the dignity of work, and the dignity of a system 
designed to provide support when they lose their jobs. We will not 
stand for that, Mr. Speaker. We will stop them.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to call upon the minister once again 
and warn him that it is certainly not with the kind of inflexible and 
arrogant attitude he has had from the outset that he will succeed in 
selling his plan to the people. The Liberal members opposite 
should think twice before supporting a minister who calls people 
lazy and professional demonstrators, and tells them that they lack 
motivation.
<P>
	Our Liberal colleagues should think about it before associating 
with a minister who uses such language to describe individuals who 
face the harsh reality of life in their regions. When this minister 
visited his region and met real people faced with real problems that 
he is responsible for, we saw how it went.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="572"> 572 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to tell the Liberal members of this House that we from 
the Bloc Quebecois will not let you go ahead. We will not give 
you any respite. We hope that your constituents will not give you 
any either and that they will treat you the same way the Minister 
of Human Resources Development was treated by his constituents 
when he visited his riding.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want to apologize to the 
Leader of the Opposition for what happened this morning. I had a 
commitment at noon and I regret not having been able to listen to 
all his comments, which, no doubt, were very interesting.
<P>
	Today, we are debating the motion tabled by the official 
opposition asking that Bill C-12, formerly known as Bill C-111, be 
immediately withdrawn from the Order Paper. I regret to have to 
tell my hon. colleagues, from the outset, that the government has 
no intention whatsoever of doing that.
<P>
	The important thing here is to recognize that we will now have 
an opportunity to get constructive proposals from the members of 
the parliamentary committee that will review this legislation. The 
importance that the government and, I am sure, all the members of 
this House attach to employment insurance must not be 
downplayed.
<P>
	Regardless of where we come from, there is no doubt that this 
bill will affect a lot of people, many of whom are among the most 
vulnerable ones in our society. This is why my predecessor, Mr. 
Axworthy, indicated shortly after introduction of the bill last fall, 
that it was his personal intention, as well as that of the government, 
to look at possible changes in certain areas of the legislation, 
particularly the formula used to calculate benefits, which is based 
on what the bill defines as continuous work weeks.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	There is also the whole issue of how far we can go. In any reform 
of this type, we have a duty, as parliamentarians, to ensure fairness, 
that is a balance between what is proposed in a budget planning 
outline, including job creation measures, and the impact of such 
measures on men, women, families and children.
<P>
	What struck me almost since the moment that we introduced this 
bill is the very widespread and well-founded support enjoyed by 
the reform throughout the country. Every poll, every indicator of 
public opinion shows support, in every province, for a 
comprehensive reform of the whole UI system as we have known it 
for a long time.
<P>
	I have also been aware for some time now that there is a feeling 
of compassion and sympathy among Canadians from all regions, 
who want to ensure that we look after those who need to be 
protected, those who are most vulnerable.
<P>
	As I explained yesterday in this House to my hon. colleague, the 
critic of the member's party on this issue, I am convinced that the 
committee, under these circumstances, will come up with 
proposals to help us respect the will for change as expressed 
throughout the country, but also to meet the needs of those who will 
be the most directly affected by all of this.
<P>
	I would like to take a minute to talk about the protests taking 
place lately and about the people who use all the means at their 
disposal to voice their concerns about this bill. Some would go as 
far as to imply that these protesters are talking on behalf of the 
majority of the population. Having had the honour to be elected 
several times to the New-Brunswick legislature, as representative 
of my native area, in Acadia, and to be elected and re-elected to this 
House of Commons, I think I am well aware of the needs of the 
citizens of my riding.
<P>
	I also understand the concerns these people have. I respect my 
constituents and I do think that they also respect me, generally 
speaking. This is why I felt the need to say openly, without any 
spitefulness, that when we see the same people week-end after 
week-end, in various areas in northern New-Brunswick and near 
the Quebec border, the same faces, and hear the same speeches, we 
are aware of the impact they can have throughout the country on 
the people who watch them on television or read about them in the 
paper; they wonder about this situation. They wonder why these 
people who called themselves community leaders do not ask for 
more jobs, economic development, changes to the act to promote 
training programs or subsidies to employers, but keep asking 
vigorously and unequivocally for this bill to be withdrawn.
<P>
	This came as quite a shock to me, since no one in the last five or 
ten years had told me that the Unemployment Insurance Act, as it 
stood, was perfect. Quite the opposite. Not a week or a day has 
gone by without my riding office receiving requests from 
concerned citizens or groups who thought the program did not 
work and that changes needed to be made.
<P>
	Of course, our predecessors made some changes a few years ago. 
But what is surprising and even frustrating is to see some people 
telling us: ``You have to withdraw this piece of legislation.'' Very 
few recommendations were made on ways to improve not only Bill 
C-111, now known as Bill C-12, but also the existing system.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	No one came up with proposals or changes that we could 
consider seriously and that would have made us say: ``Yes, maybe 
what our government has put forward is not the perfect solution.'' 
But, in terms of the existing program, has anyone made proposals 
that would have improved the situation of the people who have 
come to us throughout the years, as I said earlier, with all kinds of 
problems?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="573"> 573 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One of the things that is essential is we have to have some equity 
and fairness in all the things we do, particularly as we deal with 
social programs.
<P>
	A major attempt had been made by people who are employed 
full time, who make very good salaries. Everybody is told on a 
regular basis what members of the government make, what 
members of Parliament make, what members of the opposition 
make, what the Leader of the Opposition earns as a salary. It is a 
constant public discussion.
<P>
	I had a guest in my constituency a couple of weeks ago who is 
the head of the Canadian Labour Congress. It would be interesting 
to know how much Bob White makes a year, what his salary is, 
what his working conditions are, what kind of situation he is 
involved in, how many times he has been on unemployment, how 
many times he has been into fish plants, how many times he has 
gone into the woods to see how people work.
<P>
	When I discuss this issue, I discuss it as a person who has lived 
all of his life in an area where seasonal industries are a reality. They 
are not a choice. They are imposed by climate. They are imposed 
by government legislation. Whether it applies to total allowable 
cuts in the forest, whether it is total allowable catch in the sea, 
whether it is the tourism industry which is heavily influenced by 
our climate, whatever the circumstances, the situation is the result 
of conditions far beyond the capacity of individuals or their 
families to influence.
<P>
	When we look at the changes I hope we will be able to discuss as 
we consider Bill C-12, I hope there will be constructive suggestions 
that reflect the need for equity and fairness across the country.
<P>
	The unfortunate thing is that Bob White is a perfect example of 
someone constantly bringing up the problems on the Gaspé coast, 
in northern New Brunswick, in Shippegan, Tracadie, Caraquet, and 
talking about the impact of these changes in Atlantic Canada and 
Quebec.
<P>
	I say to my friends in the Bloc Quebecois: Do you think Bob 
White is your friend? Do you enjoy having him come in with his 
colleagues or cohorts-it depends on how I feel as to how I 
describe them-to tell people in our areas in Quebec and northern 
New Brunswick what their problems are? Think about who the 
messenger is when analysing the message.
<P>
	I looked through the information available in my department as 
to what the impact of employment legislation is on real people, real 
men, real women, real families, real problems. I realized we were 
talking about an act of this government that would impact on 
construction workers, that would impact on single mothers, that 
would impact on low income families. It would have an impact on 
people who work in British Columbia, in Manitoba, in Ontario, in 
many other parts of the country.
<P>
	Is it the climate in Atlantic Canada that attracts the likes of Bob 
White in midwinter to walk in the streets of Bathurst? We would 
think he would be walking in the streets of Victoria. Or is it 
because, as is often the case, people who have an agenda exploit the 
vulnerable, the weak, the people who do not understand the 
implications of what is being done to them?
<P>
	I have confidence in the parliamentary process. I believe that 
where I stand in this place today for over decades and for more than 
a century women and men who have been elected to serve in this 
place have found ways to provide solutions for people with 
problems. That is why I have been constant in my belief since the 
day I was asked to take on this responsibility that the women and 
men who sit on the parliamentary committee, as a result of input 
from members of Parliament on both sides of this House, will be 
able to provide us with some assistance.
<P>
	I do not want to pass on all of the responsibility. I recognize the 
government introduced the bill originally and that we will have to 
deal with it. The hon. Minister of Finance also made undertakings 
in last year's budget on the fiscal requirements he put forward that 
will have to be respected. I recognize all of that.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	When we have come to the end of the day, when the 
parliamentary committee has considered what needs to be done and 
has made its recommendations, I believe we will have addressed 
the question of how to calculate benefits and how to deal with 
consecutive weeks of work. I am confident we will have dealt with 
the intensity rule. It was meant to avoid disincentives for people to 
go back to work. We will make sure that disincentive is removed 
but that fairness is maintained.
<P>
	The system we can construct together will be one that will 
respect the needs of men and women and their families across the 
country. We will also have to make sure that we respect the fairness 
and equity which is inherent in any program where millions of 
Canadians work every day of the working week every month of the 
year. They are saying, and I agree with them, that they are prepared 
to be compassionate and they are prepared to make their 
contributions so long as the system is fair and equitable and not 
exploited unduly.
<P>
	In that context I want to make it clear today that I look to my 
colleagues from all parties to make suggestions which I hope will 
be forthcoming soon. We must have the legislation, however the 
final form may evolve, through Parliament and implemented by 
July 1 this year.
<P>
	I want to make one contribution today. Although there will be 
changes that will be respected, Canadians can be assured we will 
make every effort that there will be no abuse of this system to the 
extent that we can control it.
<P>
	Canadians are fair and equitable. It is essential that we go to a 
basis of zero tolerance of anyone who wants to  take advantage of 
their peers. When employment levels are high enough in the 
country, this money is a fund that comes from the employer and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="574"> 574 </A></B>
<P>
employee. The Government of Canada plays a role in the 
unemployment insurance fund only when it is in deficit. It was in 
deficit until a very short time ago.
<P>
	People are now talking about surpluses. There is no doubt that if 
we are fortunate enough to continue to build up surpluses we will 
have to control what is happening to premiums, to employers and 
employees and make sure there is no undue surplus accumulating. 
However, I do not think we want to go back to a situation of there 
being a deficit and the spectre of having the taxpayers of Canada 
make a major contribution. It has also been our experience in the 
past that there was a huge increase in premiums which have been 
very difficult to handle as we try to rebuild the economy.
<P>
	There will be a balance. There will be fairness between those 
people who need to be assured that the employment insurance 
system will be there for them when they need it and those people 
who continue to contribute in good faith because they believe it is 
the proper way to ensure that those who are vulnerable in our 
society are taken care of.
<P>
	There is a great deal of potential for divisiveness, depending on 
how we approach the bill. For example, I hope Canadians will note 
that I never use the term seasonal workers. Every man and woman I 
know in this country, practically without exception, when given the 
choice between a full time year round job and a full time seasonal 
job will always go for the maximum amount of benefits they can 
get for their families, which is to work as much as possible.
<P>
	Some people are confronted with the inevitability of working in 
an industry where the Government of Canada says, for example: 
``Sorry, you can only fish certain times of the year because of 
environmental reasons and we want to protect the species'', or the 
provincial governments say: ``Sorry, you cannot cut wood because 
you have a total allowable cut. We cannot afford to have clear 
cutting; we have to make sure that we practice good silviculture 
and forestry practices''. We cannot tell those people when we are 
imposing a set of rules that we are not going to take those rules into 
account when we look at a program like employment insurance.
<P>
	There is the potential for divisiveness when people in different 
parts of the country are provided with misinformation or are 
exploited. We can turn people against each other; not just looking 
at whether somebody is happy with the way the program works in a 
given clause.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	The same phenomenon occurs in a given city where people work 
12 months of the year in the traditional type of job activity. Other 
people work, for example, in the  construction industry where 
through no fault of their own, but by the nature of the work they do, 
from time to time are not able to work, not because they are not full 
time workers.
<P>
	Do not tell a plumber, an electrician, a mason, an iron worker 
and people in the construction industry that they are seasonal or 
part time workers. That is their profession, that is their job. They 
are faced with the unfortunate reality that the nature of the work 
they do has been impacted on by all kinds of situations beyond their 
control.
<P>
	I hope we will be able to look at Bill C-12 together. We have to 
recognize we are not working in a vacuum. We have decades of 
experience with unemployment insurance. We have a bill that is 
working right now, for better or for worse, that is in place.
<P>
	I am frustrated by those who say that this bill should be repealed, 
should be withdrawn, should be scrapped, as though somehow we 
could go back to what some people apparently think is the 
appropriate situation where you work for 10 weeks and you get 
unemployment for 42 weeks. That is not in the cards for anyone. 
Canadians would not accept the kind of a system that was prevalent 
in the seventies and through part of the eighties.
<P>
	We have to work together. The law that is in place now has to be 
changed. I hope that when we come back to this place to deal with 
the recommendations of the standing committee that those 
recommendations will be compared to what is in place now and not 
what was proposed last fall.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I may have one 
thing in common with the Minister of Human Resources 
Development who has just spoken, namely frustration, but we 
certainly do not have a common reason for that frustration. He says 
he is frustrated by lobbyists and by us in the opposition calling for 
withdrawal of his bill, while I am frustrated by his refusal to listen 
to what is being said at the grass roots level. Again this morning, 
there were 5,000 people in Amqui, in the riding of 
Matapédia-Matane, out demonstrating in order to get the message 
across to the minister. That figure represents more than 100 per 
cent of the working population.
<P>
	The basic premises of the minister's bill, as presented by his 
predecessor, are unacceptable to those concerned most directly by 
unemployment insurance, that is the victims of job shortages.
<P>
	And why do I say that the basic premises are wrong? Because 
they are not related to the need for reform. Many have expressed 
their support for the need to review and reform the system. But to 
those of us in the opposition-and for the present minister when he 
was in opposition-reforming something means changing it for the 
better.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="575"> 575 </A></B>
<P>
	What we are faced with now is a bill which seeks to make a 
10 to 12 per cent cut, in order to satisfy the financial constraints 
of the Minister of Finance, a reduction of $1.5 billion. And the 
gap between employees' and employers' contributions will mean, 
in terms of benefits paid out, that the government will have an 
additional $5 billion in its back pocket.
<P>
	On these assumptions, we clearly cannot agree. The minister 
mentioned two irritants, because we helped make people 
understand what they were. He said he was interested in hearing 
ways of softening the intensity rule, which I call the penalty rule. I 
really want to see how it is calculated, so I am sure it is eliminated. 
We do not want it to be calculated over the set period of 14 weeks. 
The minister seems to be saying the same thing. I want to see if that 
is really going to be the case.
<P>
	What he does not mention is the entitlement rule in the 
regions-be it the Gaspe or Acadian region. The requirement for 
eligibility is 910 hours, which is equivalent to 26 weeks. He has 
just said himself, in fact, that it is hard for people, and that fishing 
does not give them more than 10 or 12 weeks' work.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	How are those newly arrived on the labour market going to be 
eligible for unemployment insurance, if they have to have worked 
910 hours or 26 weeks? In his answer later, I hope he will correct 
the remarks of the member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine 
in the paper last week to the effect that a minimum of 700 hours 
might only be required in the Gaspe. Either the minister confirms 
this change or the hon. member retracts. At some point we need to 
know what is happening.
<P>
	I would also like to include another point in my remarks. When 
the minister-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> This is the period set aside for questions 
and comments. I know that government members are anxious. If 
there is unanimous consent, maybe an extra 10 minutes could be 
added to the period for questions and comments.
<P>
	The minister mentioned earlier that Canadians all over the 
country feel that the unemployed should be protected. If, indeed, 
people in the rest of Canada want social peace and want everyone 
to have a place in the sun, why would they not exert some pressure 
in their own way? They may not have time to take part in protests 
because, as the minister said, their agenda may not be the same. 
But the rest of Canada should pressure the Minister of Finance into 
giving some room to manoeuvre to the Minister for Human 
Resources Development, because he does not have any right now.
<P>
	How can the government come up with true job creation 
initiatives when money is taken from the  unemployed, only to be 
used, at least partly, to implement minor employability measures? 
The federal government is again starting to fight with the provinces 
over manpower training.
<P>
	I wish the minister would say loud and clear that he needs the 
co-operation of the rest of Canadians to put pressure on his 
colleague, the Minister of Finance. Some tools are required.
<P>
	I can make a few suggestions to the minister. Why is it that the 
number of insurable weeks is based on the unemployment rate? 
Here is a good suggestion for the Minister of Finance. Given the 
lack of catalysts in our regions, why not create investment 
corridors, that is regions where tax credits would be available? The 
unemployment rate in my region is currently at 18.9 per cent. Why 
not start a pilot project in our region to help its economic recovery?
<P>
	Worse still is the fact that in the Gaspe Peninsula, only 43 per 
cent or so of the active population actually does work. This means 
that only 4 adults in 10 work. The others have given up. People 
need hope. They need messages of hope. They do not need to get 
hit on the head.
<P>
	Provided there is unanimous consent, I would appreciate it if the 
minister had an extra 10 minutes to answer these questions.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. minister will have the same time 
as the hon. member who put the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Mr. Speaker, when the hon. colleague speaks of 
frustration, that is of course something not easily eliminated, since 
he proposes no changes to us in his comments. He wants us to 
withdraw the bill, and talked about this and that. He wants to know 
what I will be doing, what we will be doing, to settle the issue of 
benefit calculation, how we will make use of the rule on intensity, 
which he considers a penalty.
<P>
	What I would like to see, however-and I hope that we will be 
informed of it in committee-is what is being formally proposed. 
If you do not like Bill C-12, tell us what you would do with the 
present bill to improve it. Give us some ideas. That would be one 
way of showing that you are equal to the task.
<P>
	When we refer to those who contribute to the employment 
insurance program throughout the country, it must always be kept 
in mind that one of the reasons why we always want to describe the 
system as employment insurance is that 80 per cent of people 
across the country who are generally employed are actually 
working. That is a minimum figure at all times across Canada.
<P>
	What is very hard to understand is that the 910 hours to which 
the hon. member refers are, as he knows very well, for new 
workers. He did not say whether the calculation was during one 
year, that is 910 hours over 12  months, or whether there is a carry 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="576"> 576 </A></B>
<P>
back to the year before in meeting the number proposed by my hon. 
colleague, the gentleman who wanted to be sure the figures were 
accurate.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	It is very easy to deform facts, to get people off track, if that is 
what one wants to do. For example, when reference is made to the 
surplus, to the Minister of Finance's ability to pocket the 
unemployment insurance fund surplus, no he cannot. This is a 
surplus that belongs to the employment insurance fund to which 
employers and employees have contributed. It cannot disappear 
into the government's general revenue fund. This business of 
bending the truth somewhat is what we find a bit frustrating.
<P>
	I have one final point to make. Only someone from the Bloc 
Quebecois could tell us that $800 million, the reinvestment fund of 
$800 million at maturity, is small change. Three hundred million 
for the transition fund over the first three years, to be allocated to 
those regions most affected by the reform: small change? For the 
Bloc Quebecois it is easy to understand that this is nothing, when 
we see how their Quebec cousin is managing the affairs of the 
Quebec government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to address the motion proposed by 
my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate my 
colleague from Mercier for her leadership bid. I may disagree with 
her politics but certainly I admire her ambition and tenacity.
<P>
	I did not get an opportunity to speak to this bill under its former 
name of Bill C-111 because the government rammed it through to 
committee before Christmas. I remind my colleagues of how the 
government rushed the House legislative agenda, ramming the bill 
through in its haste. Then what did the government do? It 
prorogued the House. That shows me what kind of manipulation 
the Liberals undertake to give the appearance of integrity of 
process.
<P>
	The government gave us a new throne speech. It wanted to wipe 
the slate clean, to start anew, to make amends for all the mistakes 
made, especially during the referendum. Now we have a new 
session and the government has the opportunity to demonstrate it 
means what it says and will work to implement responses and 
responsible legislation.
<P>
	Unfortunately instead of working with us, the government has 
chosen to ram this bill through the House of Commons once again. 
Only four days ago this monster bill was tabled and we will spend 
only 50 hours with witnesses at committee.
<P>
	The bill is the single most important piece of social policy 
legislation the Liberals have yet introduced. They want to rush it 
through committee. I am well aware we have had this bill, in its old 
form, for months. The Canadian public were lead to believe that the 
bill died on the Order Paper at prorogation. The public took the 
Liberals at their procedural word and assumed that the bill died. In 
typical Liberal fashion they pulled their old tricks, and by invoking 
closure managed to bring the bill back, this time through the back 
door.
<P>
	The Liberals want it all and will do anything to have their cake 
and eat it too. They want both a clean slate and to keep the bill. The 
only way for them to accomplish this is to use the crass closure 
measures on their peculiar motion to reintroduce bills at the same 
stage as they were at prorogation.
<P>
	In short, they abused, stomped on, ignored, rigged, manipulated, 
fudged and grossly took for granted the established democratic 
practices of the House. Ironically, in a typical Liberal hypocritical 
fashion they reintroduced the bill in the same manner as the 
Progressive Conservatives after they prorogued. Liberal, Tory, 
same old story.
<P>
	The Liberal government demonstrates not only its disinterest in 
job creation but also a lack of innovation in this bill. The bill will 
not create a single job. Let us face up to the fact that the 
government has given up its job agenda because it knows how 
much of a failure it has been.
<P>
	Let us look at its broken promises. From January 1995 to 
January 1996 there was a net loss of jobs in the Canadian economy 
totalling 227,000. This is a lacklustre performance at best. This is 
not job creation. Due to the Liberal government policy a total of 
227,000 jobs were killed last fiscal year. This is the true reality of 
the Liberal jobs agenda. They may not like to hear the truth over 
there but the fact is my source of information for this sad statistic 
is, ironically, Statistics Canada. It comes from their employment 
trends survey, January 1996.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	We know the government will tell us that by ramming the bill 
through committee it will be able to implement more quickly the 
necessary changes needed to better serve Canadians in the area of 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	I can tell by the heckling over there that these are comments that 
hurt.
<P>
	The government has consistently abused its power to limit 
debate in the House and as a mechanism to speedily move 
controversial legislation through the parliamentary process in a 
manner which minimizes opposition. The best way to help 
Canadians with UI would be to return to the principles of true 
insurance, a true insurance plan.
<P>
	During debate prior to second reading I stated I believe every 
member of Parliament should have an  adequate opportunity to 
speak to this bill in the House of Commons. To date they have not. 
There have been a great number of demonstrations around the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="577"> 577 </A></B>
<P>
country on this bill, particularly in the maritimes, and we have had 
a total of only three hours of debate. Members must have the 
opportunity to both pose and respond to questions from their 
colleagues and opposition members. By drastically limiting debate 
on this bill the government is demonstrating its complete disdain 
for the parliamentary process.
<P>
	Remember, the process is not about our scoring points or 
ramming through bills simply to brag to the media that we have 
accomplished something. The process means more than that. The 
process allows members to reflect with their colleagues here in 
Ottawa what their constituents are telling them in their ridings 
about the legislation in question, which is important.
<P>
	That is the issue. This is especially significant when working 
with a bill which has such a profound impact on the lives and 
welfare of millions of Canadians. The Liberals have never allowed 
us to do that in the House. They do not even believe their own 
rhetoric. They are hypocrites who say one thing and do another.
<P>
	The heritage minister stated: ``I have already said personally and 
very directly that if the GST is not abolished I will resign. I do not 
know how clear you can get. I think you have to be accountable on 
the things you say you are going to do and you have to deliver on 
it''. As a Liberal candidate, the Prime Minister stated in 1993: ``We 
will scrap the GST''. The have very clearly broken that promise, 
and yet the heritage minister has not resigned. It shows us how 
good her word is. Scrapping the GST means scrapping the GST.
<P>
	On October 18, 1993 the Prime Minister stated: ``The Liberal 
Party is committed to maintaining old age security'', but last week 
in the budget the government killed it. Maintaining means 
maintaining, not killing. The Liberals said they would make 
unemployment insurance more like true insurance. Instead they 
have made it more like welfare. I warn all not to succumb to the 
misleading line the government has taken on unemployment 
insurance with its pompous intention to get input from the 
Canadian public.
<P>
	First, it is clear the government has little interest in hearing the 
views of Canadians when it comes to legislation. For example, the 
former chairman of the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development refused the request to have witnesses at committee to 
express their concerns over the new powers given to the 
government in Bill C-96. Instead, by some executive fiat he 
decided that each party would be limited to only one witness and 
that all witnesses would appear simultaneously as a panel. This is 
not exactly inclusive policy development.
<P>
	The second reason we should be rather circumspect about the 
intention of the government to seriously review  the bill has to do 
with a broken promise by the former parliamentary secretary of 
human resources development and the former chairman of the 
HRD committee.
<P>
	During deliberations on future business of the committee, in 
response to my inquiries, they committed to all those present that 
neither of the UI bills would be referred to committee prior to 
second reading. The question was put to them clearly and without 
ambiguity. The response by them was that the bills would not be 
referred to committee prior to second reading.
<P>
	It is clear the government did exactly what it had confirmed it 
would not. The intentions of the government most often are the 
exact opposite of what it would like the public to believe. It is this 
kind of hypocrisy, inconsistency and insincerity that the 
government has come to expect from the political hack dictating 
the government agenda.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	The third reason for being circumspect to the government's 
rhetoric of inclusive policy development is quite simple. The 
government limited debate to three hours before referring the bill 
to committee. Even if we had defeated the government's motion to 
refer the bill to committee prior to second reading there would still 
have been ample opportunity for extensive witness consultation at 
committee which would have allowed members to speak to the bill.
<P>
	I fail to comprehend why the government wishes to preclude 
members of Parliament from speaking to this bill. The only reason 
I can surmise is that the dissension in the backbenches of the 
Liberal Party is so great with the members, especially from 
Atlantic Canada, opposing this bill so vigorously that the 
government cannot afford to give them the opportunity to criticize 
it before the House.
<P>
	Thanks to the motion put forward by the Bloc Quebecois those 
Liberal backbenchers will now be able to tell the House how their 
constituents feel about this misguided legislation.
<P>
	Let me address some components of the minister's so-called 
reforms of UI. The former minister advised the House to read 
<I>Hansard</I> from the time at which UI was originally introduced. It is 
clear that such a request by him demonstrates that he had not done 
so himself. If he had, he would have been embarrassed that his EI 
program is diametrically opposed to what the original framers of 
this legislation intended back in 1940 or even in 1919 when the 
idea was first discussed in Canada.
<P>
	I only hope the new Minister of Human Resources Development 
takes the advice of his colleague, who was so free with it, and that 
he takes the trouble to learn about the original intention of UI. 
Maybe then he would quickly ascertain what he should do with this 
legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="578"> 578 </A></B>
<P>
	Ironically, when the Liberal government of Mackenzie King 
introduced unemployment insurance legislation in July 1940, he 
too tried to ram it through Parliament at the end of a session. It 
would appear this trick of ramming important legislation through 
the House is one with a long tradition.
<P>
	Our side of the House is not motivated by the calendar or the 
clock. We have a responsibility to fulfil, a duty to the Canadian 
people. I believe no one in this assembly is more anxious than any 
other to perform that duty. There is no monopoly on the desire to 
accomplish a public good. If by giving the House full debate at 
second reading it takes a few additional days to pass a measure of 
legislation which affects millions of Canadians, then this is my 
challenge: why have the Liberals been so averse to giving extra 
time to debate this bill?
<P>
	The employment insurance bill which we debate today has taken 
us very far away from what UI was intended to be when its framer 
originally designed it. Today EI is thought of by the Liberal 
government as an income supplement, not as insurance. Let me 
quote from the Liberal minister of labour in 1940, who in 
supporting the concept of individuals caring for their own 
unemployment situations quoted from the report penned by Mr. 
Justice Mathers, chief justice of Manitoba in 1919:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We recommend to your government the question of making some provision 
by a system of state social insurance for those who, through no fault of their 
own, are unable to work, whether the inability arises from a lack of opportunity, 
sickness, invalidity or old age. Such insurance would remove the spectre of fear 
which now haunts the wage earner and make him a more contented and better 
citizen.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I agree with the then minister of labour who was concerned that 
UI be used to get people from one job for short periods of time into 
another job. The minister of labour of the time was also concerned 
that UI never become a way of life for people and that measures 
should be taken to avoid people's ever coming to rely heavily if not 
completely on UI as a way of life or a continual subsistence.
<P>
	To make his point he quoted from a report by the Civil War 
Workers of Great Britain:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-how much unemployment there will be and over what period it will last is 
impossible to forecast. But, whatever it be, there must be a great deal of 
unemployment which can only be dealt with in one of two ways: either by a 
considered scheme of insurance-or by state doles, hurriedly and 
indiscriminately issued when the moment of crisis arrives.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There can be no question which is the better way. State doles may lead straight to 
pauperization. A well devised scheme of insurance preserves the self respect of 
the workers and assists and encourages them to supplement it by provision 
made industrially through an association.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	It is exactly this original intent which the minister has allowed to 
slip away. UI today is for too many people a way of life. For too 
many people UI is the dole to which the then minister of labour 
referred.
<P>
	With the new changes to UI the Minister of Human Resources 
Development announced over $1 billion in training programs for 
areas of high unemployment. This is exactly the kind of dole that 
the government of Mackenzie King argued against. Look at what 
these programs have done for the areas for which they have been 
targeted: nothing but force people to perpetually rely on the state.
<P>
	We need only look at the colossal failure of the TAGS program 
to know what these mega social engineering projects fail to create, 
long term sustainable jobs.
<P>
	I will acknowledge that EI changes made some very small baby 
steps in the right direction such as rolling back payroll taxes and 
maximum insurable earnings and tightening eligibility 
requirements. However, the steps are so tiny and slow that the 
creeping of a glacier seems like the pace of a greyhound in 
comparison.
<P>
	Let me address the issue of payroll taxes for a moment. The 
government states it will stimulate job creation by reducing taxes 
to both employers and employees. Would it not follow then that if a 
tax roll back of 5 cents creates some 25,000 jobs, a bigger roll back 
would create more jobs? If the government cared about job 
creation, in the budget last week would it not have rolled back 
payroll taxes? Instead it is continuing to gouge wage earners. It is 
running an annual UI surplus of over $5 billion which it is just 
sucking into its major deficit reduction plan.
<P>
	As well, if the government believes that rolling back payroll 
taxes creates jobs, when it introduce the 7 per cent payroll tax on 
part time workers, will it not be choking off job creation?
<P>
	The government only appears anxious to provide against the 
future ill effects of unemployment. There is a real question here as 
to whether part time employees should be asked to bear at this time 
a new charge against their wages in addition to those currently 
imposed.
<P>
	These two fundamental logical contradictions demonstrate that 
either the government is not sincere about its jobs, jobs, jobs 
mantra or that it does not really understand what it is doing when it 
attempts to reform UI.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I understand question period will starting in a few 
moments. How much time do I have left?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member will have three minutes left on 
her debate and there will be 10 minutes of questions and comments 
at the end.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member, because we are close to two o'clock, if 
she would hold any further comments until after question period. 
She could then wrap up without interruption.

	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, newspaper reports indicate that the minister is to enter 
into an agreement for $10 million in compensation for 17 Inuit 
families that were voluntarily relocated to the high Arctic in the 
1950s. Although the move was not without its hardships, the new 
community is reported to be among the most successful in the high 
Arctic.
<P>
	Contrary to documentary evidence and the good reputation of 
government officials at the time, the politically predictable Royal 
Commission on Aboriginal Peoples condemned the move and 
recommended compensation. The <I>Globe and Mail</I> suggested that 
this would apply a retroactive morality, satisfying a need to assert 
the contemporary cant of political correctness.
<P>
	Rather than engaging in historical revisionism and settling old 
grievances, imagined or real, the government would be better 
advised to focus on contemporary needs.

<P>
	Hastings county is home to four fine cheesemakers: Eldorado 
Cheese, Ivanhoe Cheese, Maple Dale Cheese and Riverside 
Cheese. These cheesemakers make fine, distinctive products that I 
am proud to recommend to you.
<P>
	In addition to the pleasure experienced by our taste buds, each 
company contributes to the local economy, from utilizing milk 
produced by dairy farmers, to providing jobs for production staff in 
their plants and jobs for retail staff in their stores.
<P>
	The fine cheesemakers of Hastings county continue a long and 
esteemed tradition of fine cheesemaking in central and eastern 
Ontario.
<P>
	I would ask hon. members to please join me in congratulating 
four Hastings county processors and the county of Hastings in 
gaining the designation of cheese capital of Canada.

	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
riding of Huron-Bruce was saddened by the recent passing of a 
very prominent community figure, Simon Peter Hallahan. He was 
in his 96th year.
<P>
	Simon was hard working and dedicated not only to his family but 
also to his community. He was always deeply involved in 
community and farm organizations in the township.
<P>
	His accomplishments were many, as a member of the Wawanosh 
Federation of Agriculture, the township council, township reeve, 
active in the Huron County Ploughman's Association, Huron 
County Milk Producers, Huron County Pork Producers, Huron 
County Holstein Association, the Knights of Columbus and the 
Blyth Fire Board, just to name a few.
<P>
	Simon was also a lifelong member of the Liberal association and 
was honoured by a visit to his family farm by the Prime Minister 
during his 1992 tour of Huron county.
<P>
	Throughout Simon's life he truly lived. He gave his best for his 
family, his community and his country.

	The government has already launched initiatives that will work 
directly with countries to reinforce these programs but it is not 
enough. Through measures such as these, as well as labelling

Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of Canadians from across the country

	<B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a statement in 
the Minister of Finance's excellent budget of March 6 reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the present restriction on banks selling insurance will be maintained. The 
present framework for selling insurance through agents and brokers will be 
preserved. The white paper concerning this and all other aspects still under review 
will be released in the coming weeks.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The reaction of members of the House and Canadians generally 
shows that this was one of the most popular measures of the entire 
budget.
<P>
	This prohibition of banks selling insurance to their branches 
should be followed by a prohibition of banks entering into the 
automobile leasing market. Due to the role banks play in the 
financing of present leasing operations they would enjoy an almost 
insurmountable advantage over existing automobile leasing 
operations.
<P>
	In 1994 banks financed over 40 per cent of car leases, giving 
banks the additional right to be commercial lessors. This would 
allow them an unfair advantage over consumers, as well as 
seriously disadvantaged private companies involved in the vehicle 
leasing market.
<P>
	Members of Parliament from both sides of the House should 
ensure that this not be allowed to happen.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the events in China at the moment are extremely 
perturbing. The Minister of Foreign Affairs yesterday met with the 
Chinese ambassador for the second time in three days in order to 
express Canada's deep concern over the crisis between China and 
Taiwan.
<P>
	My question is for whoever can answer on behalf of the 
government. With the crisis in the Taiwan Strait escalating daily 
and the United States' decision to deploy a number of ships there, 
would the minister or the secretary of state inform this House of the 
discussions between the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the 
Chinese ambassador and of the Government of Canada's position 
in this matter?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased the opposition has asked this 
question.
<P>
	The foreign affairs minister has met with the Chinese 
ambassador in Ottawa to express our deepest concerns about the 
situation in the Taiwan Strait. We continue to advocate that the 
political differences between Taiwan and China should be resolved 
politically and peacefully.
<P>
	Because of our strategic importance in the Asia-Pacific region 
any escalation of tensions in that region would impact on Canadian 
interests. This is why we have advocated to the Chinese and the 
Taiwanese that any miscalculation of actions on either side would 
be very harmful to the situation in the strait.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, given the upcoming presidential elections in Taiwan, to be 
held on March 23, and the strong warning given the Chinese 
authorities by the American secretary of state, what position will 
the Canadian government take should the Chinese government 
continue its intimidating manoeuvres?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B> We understand, Mr. Speaker, that the tension is continuing to 
build up.
<P>
	We have expressed our concern to the Chinese government. 
Hopefully it could start winding down those tensions in the strait. 
The United States deploying vessels to stand by in areas of interest 
is no reason to interpret this as anything but a cautious and prudent 
move.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr.

between Canada and its allies in the coming days in an effort to find 
ways to make the Chinese officials listen to reason? Does the 
Government of Canada intend putting this matter before the 
Security Council?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific),

any discussions we are trying to have with our allies. It is important

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
The minister said yesterday that those who protest against the UI 
reform are being led on by bored and lazy seasonal workers. Bored 
and lazy. He added, and I quote the press release:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``These guys have to find something to do every Sunday. Some 
people drive around the block, some people go to the movies, some 
go to demonstrations. I guess it just depends on what turns them 
on''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is what the minister thinks of the unemployed.
<P>
	Given the current situation, how can the minister make such 
comments on protesters and unemployed workers? Does he not 
realize that his primary responsibility is to understand them, help 
them, protect them, including within cabinet, and not to belittle 
them, or worse, to despise them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the first responsibility of any 
member of this House is always the same: to be honest and tell the 
truth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="584"> 584 </A></B>
<P>
	This is a principle which I have been applying for a long time. 
I have so much respect for the hon. member that I know she 
believes the comments attributed to me are truly what I said.
<P>
	The hon. member should read the report published by the 
Canadian Press in the paper <I>L'Acadie nouvelle</I>. The comments 
reported in that article are absolutely accurate. The comments that I 
made yesterday to the media and that were reported in <I>L'Acadie 
nouvelle</I> truly reflect my opinion.
<P>
	And my opinion is this: the professional agitators who organize 
protests-and I named the two gentlemen in question, Yvon Godin 
and Mr. Basque-have been known for a long time. These people 
should find better things to do on a Sunday afternoon than going 
from protest to protest and raising the emotions and concerns of 
people who are being exploited by union leaders. I am also deeply 
concerned that the hon. member wants to do the same.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Because the quote was read in English, I want to be absolutely 
accurate. I have said that I understand the problems faced by people 
who have concerns about the reform to the unemployment 
insurance legislation.
<P>
	The report in the Canadian Press, the report in the <I>Telegraph 
Journal</I>, the report in <I>L'Acadie Nouvelle</I> were accurate. I know the 
hon. member would want to check the facts before she attributes 
statements to me where I would allege that anybody on 
unemployment who was walking in those demonstrations was lazy 
or not doing their job properly. What I said was that well-paid 
people like Bob White, Basque and Godin who work the year round 
agitating the poor and the unemployed should stop exploiting 
vulnerable people in our society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> They are upset. Mr. 
Speaker, government members are all worked up following this 
call from a labour confederation president to condemn the 
government. Yet, this person does his job just as honourably as the 
minister.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	If it were not for labour confederations and organized groups, we 
would not often hear about the hardships and problems of the 
unemployed. We would not hear anything about their plight.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I ask the minister to retract his comments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very, very important when 
we are dealing with people in our society. Real men and real 
women with real families and  real problems every day are 
concerned about what they have to face when they are unemployed.
<P>
	I will spend my political career and my political capital 
defending the people I represent. The hon. member can spend her 
time with her friends like Bob White who makes more money than 
she does and more money than I do going around exploiting the 
poor people of northern New Brunswick.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the last election the Liberals went around promising to 
abolish, scrap and kill the GST. It was a cornerstone of their 
campaign. When Liberal candidates went from door to door they 
were not talking about harmonizing the GST; they were talking 
about abolishing and scrapping an iniquitous tax.
<P>
	The government has clearly broken its promise. It is making 
matters worse by denying that it broke that promise. Now when 
that is not working, the Minister of Finance has the nerve to blame 
the provinces for his failure to keep that promise.
<P>
	Why will the government not simply admit that it has no 
intention of ever scrapping, abolishing or killing the GST?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, must we repeat again 
that we promised to replace the GST. The GST and the provincial 
sales tax, according to consumer groups, business groups and all 
consumer advocates is not a good system. What we need is a 
harmonized system. That is what we said we would do and that is 
what we will do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is not an argument about semantics or interpretation, 
it is a matter of credibility.
<P>
	On October 18, 1993 the Deputy Prime Minister publicly 
promised to resign if the GST was not abolished. That cannot be 
denied. Over two years later it is quite obvious that the government 
has no intention of getting rid of either the GST or the Deputy 
Prime Minister. It is stuck with both of those millstones around its 
neck.
<P>
	Why did the government ever make a promise, especially on the 
vital subject of taxation, that it had neither the will nor the political 
courage to keep?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, not only did we say 
we would replace the GST and not scrap it, we asked the Standing 
Committee on Finance to examine the various options for reform. 
The committee consulted with Canadians and with tax experts and 
recommended a national harmonized tax, which I might add the 
Reform Party members on that committee endorsed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="585"> 585 </A></B>
<P>
	I repeat that business, consumer advocates and consumer groups 
have all said a harmonized system would be best. Is the Reform 
Party now going to say we are better off with the system we have?
<P>
	We want a harmonized system. We will work toward that and we 
will get it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is about a broken promise and the finance minister 
attempting to download the responsibility onto the provinces.
<P>
	The government has perfected the art of passing the buck. When 
it almost lost the country in the last referendum, it blamed Daniel 
Johnson. When it cannot deliver on its promise of jobs, jobs, jobs, 
it blames the private sector. Now when it cannot deliver on the 
promise of revoking the GST, it is the fault of the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	Why does the government not accept responsibility for these 
events, starting with the broken GST promise instead of always 
blaming others for its own failures?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are not blaming 
others, but the fact is it does take two sides to make an agreement.
<P>
	Again, business groups and consumer groups have said that a 
harmonized tax system is best. That is what we promised in the red 
book. That is what I promised when I went door to door in my 
constituency. I said we would harmonize it and that is what we will 
do.

	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Acting Prime Minister.
<P>
	The mayor of Montreal informed the local Armenian community 
that he had been forced to abandon plans to build a memorial to the 
victims of the genocide because of pressure from the Minister for 
International Co-operation and Liberal candidate in the riding of 
Papineau-Saint-Michel. Moreover, clients of the firm for which 
Mr. Pettigrew used to work are currently conducting business 
negotiations in Turkey and, strangely enough, Turkish officials are 
said to have also brought pressure to bear to make this project fail. 
Great job for a human rights advocate.
<P>
	How can the Acting Prime Minister justify the involvement of 
his colleague, the Liberal candidate in Papineau-Saint-Michel, 
who made representations directly to the mayor of Montreal to stop 
this project commemorating the Armenian genocide of 1915?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my hon. colleague knows full well that the erection of 
monuments falls under municipal jurisdiction and that the Minister 
for International Co-operation had no involvement in this. In fact, 
that is what the minister himself told the press. And he no doubt 
reiterated the federal government's position, namely that 
monuments come under municipal, not federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the mayor 
of Montreal did confirm that the minister himself had told him so, 
which puts this government on the oppressors' side in this matter.
<P>
	What assurances can the Acting Prime Minister give to this 
House that, as a former vice-president of a firm courting Turkey, 
his colleague, the Liberal candidate in Papineau-Saint-Michel, 
did not cave in under undue pressure to wreck this project in 
Montreal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know that this is an attempt on the part of the hon. 
member to bring this House to discuss the election campaign in the 
riding of Papineau-Saint-Michel, Incidentally, he is his party's 
organizer.
<P>
	But what did the Minister for International Co-operation tell the 
mayor? He clearly outlined the federal government's position, 
stating, first of all, that the erection of monuments comes under 
municipal jurisdiction and, second, that it was not a federal matter.
<P>
	Therefore, there is no connection between the fact that former 
associates of the Minister for International Co-operation are 
involved in business dealings and the position taken by the federal 
government, the Minister for International Co-operation or the 
Liberal candidate in Papineau-Saint-Michel. If the hon. member 
wants to play politics on the backs of the Armenian people, he 
should do so in the riding in question; he will see the result on 
March 25.

<P>
	With respect to the Helms-Burton bill our Prime Minister no 
less, as well as the Minister for International Trade and our 
ambassador in Washington have expressed very clearly the 
objections of the Canadian government to that bill. We continue 
to consult with the leaders in industry who may be adversely 
affected by the bill, as well as some of our allies in the Caribbean, 
Latin America and the European Union to try to get a consensus 
to put pressure on the United States to abandon the bill. We believe 
the bill is extraterritorial. We believe the bill will have the 
unwanted impact of slapping American allies in trade for an action 
they had absolutely nothing to do with, which was the unfortunate 
and condemnable shooting down of the two planes by the Cuban 
government.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have

<P>
	The government is telling Canadian businesses that it is up to 
them to create jobs. Yet, at this moment many of them are being 
forced to choose between doing business with the United States or 
doing business with Cuba. If the government really wants to create 
jobs, will it show some backbone and assure Canadian businesses 
that it is going to fight this bill on their behalf?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps the hon.

<P>
	For the record, it is very clear that the Canadian government has 
taken the lead, not just with foreign governments, by trying to 
ensure that the American government knows that the bill is 
inappropriate but also by consulting with Canadian businesses that 
could adversely be impacted by the bill. After consultations are 
completed and we get an indication from the U.S. as to if and when 
it is going to implement some provisions of the bill, we will take 
the most appropriate action possible to protect Canadian business 
interests.

	Justice Krever said no one is in charge. The various groups, the 
Canadian Haemophilia Society, the Canadian Blood Agency, the 
Canadian Red Cross, the various consumers and stakeholders

	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of the Environment. Just a few hours 
ago, a new report on the <I>Irving Whale</I> incident was made public. 
This study indicates that the barge should have been refloated last 
summer despite the fact that it contains enough PCBs to pollute a 
fairly large portion of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The report 
concludes that the refloating operation should be done next 
summer.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us if he intends to follow up on the 
recommendations made in this report and, if so, can he give us the 
assurance that no PCBs will be spilled during the refloating and 
transportation of the barge?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question. As he knows, 
the lifting of the barge was put on hold last summer so my 
department and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans could 
conduct another environmental assessment. This would be the 
fourth  because we wanted to err on side of caution, on the side of 
the health of Canadians as well the environment.
<P>
	This morning the report from that assessment was tabled. It is 
important to note that rather than making a lot of comments in the 
Chamber now about this report, we should allow the 30-day public 
consultation to take hold.
<P>
	Seven different public meetings both in Atlantic Canada and in 
the province of Quebec have been organized. I think we should 
allow for the public to have a say in response to this fourth report. 
As soon as the public has made its representations, the government, 
between me and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, will 
certainly take hold of the situation and make the right decision.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a 
supplementary, considering that the government has already spent 
$12 million on this, does the minister intend to uphold the polluter 
pays principle and charge the total costs to the Irving company, 
Canada's second richest family?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the question obviously has a price tag but the member 
tries to suggest that it is an easy problem without any complex 
issues being involved. He is absolutely incorrect in that. It is a very 
complex situation.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	A number of individuals have suggested leaving the barge there, 
and that would have problems. A number of individuals suggest the 
oil should be pumped from the chamber of the barge to the surface, 
and that has its complications. There seems to be a majority 
opinion that lifting the barge with the proper safeguards and 
technology is the way to go.
<P>
	With respect to the member's question, all matters are under 
negotiation. The Government of Canada will make the right 
decision for the best interest of the people in the area as well as for 
the environment.

Egypt is a very important event in the name of peace in the world. 
Canada is very pleased to have a role in trying to promote that 
peace. We have been very involved in the Middle East peace

that as Canadians we have a large stake in the success of the 
continuing peace process in the Middle East.

<P>
	Serial child killer Clifford Olson becomes eligible on August 12 
of this year to have a sentence review hearing by virtue of section 
745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Does Clifford Olson still have the support of the solicitor general 
and that of his government for this review or will the solicitor 
general and his cabinet move immediately to scrap section 745 
from the Criminal Code?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Clifford Olson has never had and does not have the support of the 
government for anything.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice with my support is actively looking at 
ways of dealing with concerns about section 745.
<P>
	I look forward to the Minister of Justice's being in a position to 
present the results of his work to the House before too long. If my 
hon. friend is serious, we will put him to the test and see if he 
stands up to support the changes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we stood in 
the House and we remember how the cabinet voted. We remember 
what happened with the private member's bill to scrap section 745 
over a year ago.
<P>
	The Liberal government has indicated that it is committed to 
maintaining the 15-year review for some first degree murderers. 
Can the solicitor general please give us an example of a first degree 
murderer who in his  view deserves an opportunity to get parole 
after serving only 15 years of a so-called life sentence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I remind the House that the section in question which, as I have 
said, is being studied from the point of view of change, leaves it to 
a jury made up of members of the community to see whether there 
should be an earlier parole eligibility and any decisions are made 
by the arm's length independent parole board.
<P>
	I repeat, we understand community concerns and we are working 
on what could well amount to changes to section 745 to respond to 
these concerns.
<P>
	I remind the House when it came to the private member's bill in 
question the government for the first time established in the House 
the principle that these measures when they come to a vote are 
dealt with on a free vote basis.
<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
	It is because of the policy of this government that the bill went to

the bill was restored. If it had been up to the Reform Party that bill 
would not have been restored; it would be dead today.

<P>
	The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration cannot make a 
distinction between an official report and public condemnation of 
specific violations. Allow me to help her: the mandate of former 
Deputy Minister Roger Tassé applied only to deportation 
procedures and practices and not to specific cases. This does not 
mean that his oral allegations are unfounded and that there were no 
bribes.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that, during the investigation, Mr. Tassé 
referred several well documented complaints of a special nature to 
Assistant Deputy Minister Georges Tsaï, who has not yet bothered 
to respond?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and

with the Department of Citizenship and Immigration must comply

<P>
	The Prime Minister obviously is concerned with the issue, as he 
is currently in Egypt attending an anti-terrorism conference.

Canada chaired a meeting of the P-8 countries last December to 
work out a plan of action against terrorism.
<P>
	One of the points in that plan of action was to deal with the flow 
of funds across international borders for terrorist purposes. We are 
working on measures in Canada to implement that part of the 
action plan against terrorism and part of it is working on measures 
to deal with the flow of funds.
<P>
	We hope to have something ready before too long. I would be

<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley,

	Last year when I asked the former Minister of National Revenue 
if he would rescind the charitable status of the Babbar Khalsa, a 
terrorist organization responsible for the 1985 bombing of 
Air-Indian and last September's assassination of the chief minister 
of the Punjab, he did not appear to be overly concerned with the 
issue.

	If the government is truly serious about combating terrorism 
why is it asking Canadian taxpayers to subsidize terrorist groups? 
Will it at least revoke the charitable status of terrorist organizations 
in Canada forthwith?

Canadian trade without compensating environmental benefits''.

	The MMT bill has a number of different venues and different 
thoughts. Currently there is a 30-day period for the government to

	He rightly mentioned that trade is one issue. I am appreciative 
that my colleague, the minister of trade, advised me of his position 
through the <I>Financial Post</I>. Unlike him, I think I will take some 
quieter soundings because there are many different opinions 
vis-à-vis MMT. One of them is the motor vehicle community

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister would have us believe that his changes to UI would 
provide over $2 billion in savings to the government. However, 
during our briefings on the bill, when we asked for projections, 
actuarial analyses and economic effects, nothing was available. 
Further to that, the bureaucrats who briefed us assured us that the 
information did exist and that it would be forwarded to our offices.
<P>
<B>(1505)</B>
<P>
	Here we now find ourselves debating the bill in the House and 
the information has never been made available. Let us hope that the 
economics of these changes have indeed been analysed. This 
scheme must rely on a sound actuarial basis and we must have 
concrete evidence that such is the fact.
<P>
	It will not do to adopt any scheme or plan which is simply a 
device for transmitting money raised by taxation or borrowing. In 
essence, any such scheme would be a dole, pure and simple. 
Without any evidence to the contrary especially when the auditor 
general is so condemnatory of job creation schemes, the minister's 
transitional jobs program will simply waste $300 million.
<P>
	I have expressed my concern about the actuarial soundness of 
these changes to UI, not only because the government refuses to 
provide us with its analyses but also because of a Liberal sentiment 
that was espoused by the Liberal government which introduced UI. 
Paul Martin Sr. on July 19, 1940 stated: ``While it is laudable to try 
to make UI actuarially sound, we must not be unmindful of the fact 
that it is impossible really to make it actuarially sound''. I certainly 
hope that no present member of the cabinet shares this scary 
sentiment. Let us  hope that the finance minister disagrees with 
what his father, Paul Martin Sr. had to say in 1940.
<P>
	These new employment insurance measures clearly indicate that 
the government evidently expects unemployment to be a 
permanent problem. We realize and this group has directed 
attention to this fact time and time again that thanks to its status 
quo policies, the order of low unemployment has passed away and 
we have reached a high state of progress where the Liberal machine 
is continually putting people out of work and keeping them there.
<P>
	Let me finish my remarks by quoting Mackenzie King who 
managed to get UI passed in the House. Let me remind the Liberals 
what their Liberal ancestors thought about social policy and UI and 
just how far from that original intent we have gone.
<P>
	In 1935 before he became Prime Minister, Mackenzie King said: 
``Looking at the question of social legislation, it is necessary to 
take a bird's eye view of the whole. One must realize that what the 
provinces could do depended more than anything else upon the 
government's policies with respect to trade and those other policies 
which had to do with the revival of industry and business. To 
restore prosperity was the great objective which the Liberal 
government has before it''.
<P>
	King did not say it then, but if he were here today and I dare say 
if he were sober, he would probably tell us that to revive business 
and to safeguard social programs we should balance the budget 
more quickly than we are and we should make plans to address our 
crushing debtload, a task this government fails to understand 
because it just seems to be way beyond it.
<P>
	In conclusion, let me reiterate that the Liberals are attempting 
once again to ram this bill through the House, to hide just how inept 
the bill really is in addressing the real issue of unemployment and 
job creation. More important, the changes to EI from UI really will 
make UI more like welfare than a true insurance plan. This is where 
in principle the bill goes drastically wrong and where the Liberals 
simply fail to comprehend what UI should do for Canadians.
<P>
	Having said that, I move:

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Colleagues, upon reflection 
and consultation with our table officers, the amendment is in order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, prior 
to question period while the member was speaking, I contemplated 
rising on a point of order because of a statement she had made a 
number of times in her speech. She said that the government 
deliberately misled. As we know in this place, to suggest there is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="592"> 592 </A></B>
<P>
deliberate  misleading or not telling the truth is contrary to 
parliamentary actions.
<P>
	As a result, I would simply comment to the hon. member that I 
understand in debate it is important to make the points. Perhaps the 
hon. member might preface her remarks that it is in her own 
opinion or in her own assessment the government is misleading and 
not make judgments in such a stark way.
<P>
	Another point I wanted to make had to do with the whole aspect 
of the provision of statistical data, analyses and actuarial numbers 
with regard to the proposals under this bill.
<P>
	The member will well know that the bill had been introduced by 
the then Minister of Human Resources Development in a particular 
form and had been published and circulated for discussion 
purposes. It had not, at the time of prorogation of the House, moved 
at any particular point. As a result of the motions passed by this 
House, it has been reintroduced in exactly the same format.
<P>
	The member will also know that the bill, now to be referred to 
committee, is at a very important point in the legislative process. 
This is particularly so considering the vast amount of changes the 
member well knows can be made in committee with regard to 
proposed legislation, whether it be with regard to items such as the 
gun control bill or Bill C-7 on controlled drugs and substances 
which was before the committee I chaired and to which 70 
amendments were made.
<P>
	The member will well know that the possibility of providing 
extensive actuarial and precise data certainly is possible. However 
it is certainly more relevant once the specifics and the principles of 
the bill have been exhaustively reviewed by the committee. 
Information particularly with regard to the consensus items would 
then be provided by the research staff and the resources available to 
the House.
<P>
	I simply suggest to the member that maybe this request for an 
answer to all the questions at the beginning of the process is 
unreasonable and unrealistic on her behalf.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate 
the comments from my hon. colleague.
<P>
	On the first point his comments are well taken. However, with 
respect to the point he made about misleading, I do believe if 
someone is intentionally misleading and those comments are 
directed to a person in debate, that it is cause for question. I believe 
that misleading and using that term within debate and in reference 
to government is not a point of order nor should it be taken to mean 
anything other than exactly what I stated. It is a personal opinion of 
mine and it is probably carried by many others as a matter of fact.
<P>
	The member's second point was a little bit rambling and I will 
try to extrapolate from it what exactly he was  getting at. We have 
been dithering around for months on the whole question of 
unemployment insurance. I know everyone was waiting throughout 
last year for some substantive items to be put on the government 
agenda. It is rather unfortunate that the hon. member chose to cite 
gun control as an example of legislation. Gun control legislation 
took up the agenda of the House of Commons for months and 
months and months. We are going to go into committee and we will 
have only 50 hours in our committee to deal with witnesses on one 
of the most important pieces of social policy legislation this 
government has put forward. Therefore, I really have to question 
his comments in that regard.
<P>
	The other thing is about the analyses we requested. It is our 
understanding when we go into a briefing by and with government 
officials that if the questions we ask are not answered on that day, 
that at least they are going to be followed up on at some future 
point.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	These are questions of a fiscal nature and are very important for 
the analyses, especially when we are looking at such job creation 
programs as the $300 million one that has been put forward in this 
bill. I do not think those requests were out of line or out of order in 
any way.
<P>
	Those are my comments to the hon. member. Once again, let us 
hope we can leave off the dithering and actually get down to some 
very basic work in this extremely important area of social policy 
reform.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am both 
pleased and proud to second the motion by our leader to have the 
Minister of Human Resources withdraw the bill now numbered 
C-12.
<P>
	During Question Period, the minister informed us that, during 
the work to be done, in the coming months, he would call for 
constructive proposals but would brook no criticism. I have news 
for him. He will have to listen to criticism, because the only 
constructive proposal he could make, in committee and in the 
House, to help those who really need an unemployment insurance 
program, would be that there be no cuts.
<P>
	Why did the Minister of Finance, in order to achieve his 
objectives, decide to cut 10 per cent more from unemployment 
insurance? Why in this country does it have to be those who need 
UI benefits between jobs who service the debt? Do they have some 
special responsibility for coming up not with hundreds, but 
thousands of dollars as a rule? Why is it that a young person, a 
woman re-entering the labour market, an immigrant, or someone 
who had to stop working because of illness and is re-entering the 
labour market should not be entitled to unemployment insurance 
under reasonable conditions?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="593"> 593 </A></B>
<P>
	They are required to have worked 910 hours, or 26 35-hour 
weeks. Anyone the slightly bit familiar with the labour market will 
know how difficult it is to find right from the start a job that 
provides 35 hours a week for 26 weeks in a row, not to mention 
a first job in the case of someone re-entering or entering the labour 
market.
<P>
	This is the kind of cut provided for by the bill. The question 
applies to everybody targeted by this bill. And I will ask it again: 
Why is it that, in Canada, the additional $1.9 billion in budget cuts, 
or the interests on the debt, should be paid for by the unemployed? 
Somebody will have to pay.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development had better not 
say: ``Suggest an itty bitty reform. What might suit your fancy?'' 
We do not want to have to chose among those who are going to be 
deprived even more of already meagre resources.
<P>
	Do you know that of all the OECD countries, Canada is one of 
those lagging behind with regard to social expenditures? This, 
according to the latest statistics I found in a 1994 OECD document 
using 1990 figures, that is before what I would describe as the 
drastic cuts made cumulatively by our conservative and liberal 
governments. Already, Canada was behind New Zealand, a country 
everybody is looking at with fear, according to their point of view, 
mine anyway.
<P>
	Although Canada has nothing to brag about in terms of social 
spending, it has decided to make the unemployed pay for what it 
calls an additional deficit reduction effort. Millions of people are 
affected. Even if we fail to do our job and mobilize in sufficient 
numbers to prevent the minister from going a little crazy, he should 
at least be forced to withdraw his bill because it cannot be properly 
redrafted. There are just too many major changes compared to the 
legislation now in effect.
<P>
	If we fail to mobilize, Canada will let the burden of the debt and 
the interest on it fall on those who are least able to afford it.
<P>
	However, if the minister agreed that the system's effectiveness is 
just as important and that the UI plan should not be cut any further 
but that we should sit down with businesses and organizations in 
order to get the most out of the money invested, he would be taking 
a step in the right direction, and we would have proposals to make.
<P>
	The current situation is totally unacceptable not only because of 
the millions of people who will be affected but also because of the 
social and economic impact of these cuts.
<P>
	We will never say it often enough: since the Liberals, who were 
tearing up their shirts over the two cuts made by the 
Tories-which, compared to the cuts made or proposed by the 
Liberals, were rather minor-came to  office, they have deprived 
the Quebec economy of $735 million a year for 1995-96, 1996-97 
and every subsequent year.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	How much was cut in the Atlantic provinces? Funding has been 
cut by $640 million each and every year starting in 1995-96. This 
bill adds to these cuts, these reduced benefits, this shortfall in 
money required to pay rent, to buy groceries, to feed the children, 
to provide ordinary people with an ordinary standard of living.
<P>
	This new bill adds $630 in cuts to Quebec and, according to the 
minister's own figures, $344 million in cuts to the Atlantic 
provinces, for a total-and this will be this Liberal government's 
legacy-of $1.375 billion per year in UI cuts by the time the 
program ends in the year 2000. It will be $974 million in the 
Atlantic provinces, whose economy is flourishing, as we all know.
<P>
	Earlier, a minister asked if the opposition thought the $300 
million allocated over a three-year period to assist with 
implementing the system is small change. My answer is: that is 
right. Indeed, as far as the Atlantic provinces are concerned, I fail 
to see the connection between taking $974 million out of the local 
economy every year and the fact that the provinces would receive 
40 per cent of $300 million over three years. It is really not the 
same thing.
<P>
	You know, in a region, when a business that used to pay $5 
million in wages closes down, one wonders how this will affect the 
local economy. So, when I learn that the Atlantic provinces will 
receive $975 million less every year, I dare say that the government 
did not weigh the economic impact, or the social impact, of its 
decision. What are those individuals who will have to do without 
UI benefits because they do not qualify or are being cut off 
supposed to do?
<P>
	They will spend less, naturally. That is an economic impact in 
itself, a radical impact. But they will need a minimum of money. 
They may turn to their parents for assistance, for a while, turn to 
their friends, for a while, live off their savings, for a while, but 
eventually, they will be forced onto welfare. Someone must always 
pay the price; in this case, it will be the individuals and their 
families. And it will not be those who are the wealthiest or who are 
best able to pay the price, and the same is true of the provinces.
<P>
	If all those who worked seriously on this bill came out and said 
that the government should withdraw the bill and start over, they 
would be right. The whole UI system, which was built over many 
years and, to a great extent, by the federal Liberals, in their early 
days-let us call this period phase one-this whole building is now 
being blown away.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="594"> 594 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	It was blown up, like in the movies. The building was blown up 
and then the government started all over again. There is still a pillar 
here and there. Therefore, it is difficult in these conditions to say: 
``We will make an amendment here or there''. It is unfortunate that 
the government does not listen more.
<P>
	This bill will be harmful to the country's economic and social 
life. It will hurt. It puts Canada into a mould which, based on what I 
have seen, a large number of Canadians do not want. This is a fact. 
So, I ask again: why set these additional $1.9 billion cuts as a 
deficit-related objective? Why do it on the backs of those people?
<P>
	Instead, why not ask how to make the program more effective, 
how to help those regions where there is concern that people will 
end up relying on UI benefits? There is indeed a real danger, but the 
real issue is: how can we change current economic conditions?
<P>
	When I first joined the human resources development 
committee, some senior officials showed us the findings of their 
research on how the unemployment insurance program was used in 
the various provinces. I guess I am not allowed to show these 
findings here, but it would be interesting for all Canadians to see 
these documents, since the two successive reforms are explained 
through the use of graphs.
<P>
	In fact, it is an open secret that the eastern provinces, starting 
with Quebec-but not as much nowadays-and mostly the Atlantic 
provinces, ``get more'' from the unemployment insurance system 
than they put in, especially because of seasonal work and of the ups 
and downs of the economy. Throughout the world, the economy 
seems to be shifting from east to west. This is occurring in the 
United States and elsewhere.
<P>
	There was a sort of redistribution, which had gained some 
acceptance, but which some economists have vehemently decried. 
However, the cuts made under this accelerated decrease in the 
redistribution process taking place through the unemployment 
insurance program, without the investments needed to create more 
jobs-and I am talking about the situation in the Maritimes, in 
Montreal, in the lower St. Lawrence district and in all the areas 
with a high unemployment rate-will result in the weakening of 
our social and economic fabric.
<P>
	There is no short cut. None at all. The provinces are unable to 
take up all the slack. Families will not invest their savings. As we 
know, Canada has a serious debt problem. Savings have decreased. 
The people who are not yet getting their pension but will soon be 
are increasingly worried. With the unemployment rate remaining 
high, everyone is feeling insecure and quite worried. These cuts 
will only increase our sense of insecurity and make the work of 
those who fight crime even more difficult.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	Canadians must face reality. This is the challenge here. The 
problem is not with the protesters who earn too much, or with Bob 
White who earns too much and organizes protests. That is not the 
problem.
<P>
	The problem is that the minister does not seem to realize the 
long-term and very serious economic and social consequences the 
decisions he is about to make will have. So, when I see him get mad 
at the protesters, not to mention the prime minister who, in a very 
unfortunate incident, actually assaulted a man who was protesting 
against this so-called reform of the unemployment insurance 
system, I cannot help but feel sad. This is not the right way to do 
things.
<P>
	The right way is to find out how we can, with the resources at our 
disposal, help to ensure the usefulness and social well-being of our 
fellow citizens. This is what a country should be about. This is why 
I want to build my own country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the member for Guelph-Wellington.
<P>
	I want to first thank the opposition for an opportunity to talk 
about something I consider a very important issue. That is, of 
course, the reality and honesty of making laws and going forward 
with decisions that affect a lot of people.
<P>
	It is a pretty curious scenario we find ourselves in. The Bloc 
members say that they are sovereignists. They talk about how 
everything needs to change and how the status quo in Canada is a 
failure. At the same time, there is a motion before us that argues, in 
most cases, for the status quo. They do not have a proposal but they 
want the government to withdraw the bill. They do not want to put 
proposals on the table because they would just like us to listen to 
the people who will come before the committee.
<P>
	As a member of the committee, we are certainly going to be 
listening to the witnesses. However, we are also asking the people 
across the way to give us some ideas and proposals of their own. 
The minister said that he looks forward to members of Parliament 
doing their jobs and putting forward proposals.
<P>
	I find it quite curious that the Bloc wants to break up Canada 
because it does not work, but, on the other hand, does not seem to 
have any ideas about UI reform.
<P>
	We have seen all sorts of polls and results from the department 
and people who have gone across the country asking Canadians 
about the proposals and what they reflect. The consultations, of 
course, do reflect a consensus in the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="595"> 595 </A></B>
<P>
	I am not a big fan of polls, as one might imagine, because they 
are just a snapshot of what people are  thinking. However, these 
polls are so overwhelming that I thought I had better lay them out 
for the House this afternoon. For some reason, members across the 
way seem to suggest that 90 per cent of Canadians are opposed to 
UI reforms, when in fact some 77 per cent are in favour of UI 
reforms and in favour of major changes.
<P>
	I have mentioned in the House many times that I come from 
rural northern Ontario where there is a very high unemployment 
rate. It is as high as that of some places in Quebec and in Atlantic 
Canada. We have not had any of the demonstrations that the people 
across the way talk about.
<P>
	I asked myself why that was. There are as many seasonal 
workers in Ontario as there are in Atlantic Canada. As a matter of 
fact, there are more. We have to ask if the people of Atlantic 
Canada are different from those in Ontario. Are they different in 
Quebec than in Ontario? Are they different in B.C.? Quite frankly 
the answer to that is probably, yes. We are all different because we 
have different needs, objectives and different economies.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	I can understand why the minister would bring up one of my old 
friends, Bob White, who is a unionist. As you know, Mr. Speaker, I 
am a unionist and have been one for many years. I worked in the 
railway industry and I had a lot of friends in the union.
<P>
	The problem with the Bob Whites of the world and one of the 
reasons I get very distressed about the role of labour in Canada is 
the fact that people like Bob White have moved the union 
movement into a corner from which it cannot escape.
<P>
	People have stopped listening to some of the union leaders 
because they are now involved heavily in political parties. There 
are groups in Quebec which are supposed to be representing 
workers but are more interested in representing the separatist 
movement and its cause than about whether individuals have jobs.
<P>
	There are unionists who spend half of their time at NDP 
conventions and less time negotiating with government and 
business in trying to help solve some of the problems.
<P>
	No wonder people such as myself and the Minister of Human 
Resources Development become frustrated with the union 
movement.
<P>
	Of course, now Bob White and his friends have organized a 
demonstration which suggests this bill is not good, that we should 
scrap it and start all over. That is the furthest from the truth. There 
are some improvements which need to be made. However, when we 
asked the majority of Canadians: Do you think we need to make 
these changes, their answer was overwhelmingly, yes.
<P>
	The issue that concerns people the most is increasing the 
qualifying period for new entrants. Youth are a major concern. 
Hopefully the committee will receive proposals, not only from the 
folks across the way but also from government members, on how 
that issue might be dealt with.
<P>
	Sixty-seven per cent of Canadians agree with reducing benefits 
for frequent users. Seventy per cent of Canadians believe it would 
be a good thing to move from weeks to hours. Seventy-four per 
cent of Canadians believe that part time workers should be allowed 
to qualify.
<P>
	Then there is the question of implementing job transition funds. 
The suggestion was made this morning that it was not a big issue 
and that we were just trying to buy people's silence by putting 
forward a transition fund. Try telling that to the 80 per cent of 
Canadians who believe that a job transition fund is a a very good 
idea.
<P>
	With respect to low income Canadians, 82 per cent of people say 
that assisting low income families should be a priority. That is 
reflected in the bill.
<P>
	I am having a difficult time, not only with what the Bloc is 
suggesting, but also with the lack of ideas from the Reform Party. 
The only Reform suggestion so far was that it should be a true 
insurance program. In the survey results we have received from the 
majority of Canadians, that is not what they want. They want a 
progressive package which helps Canadians get back to work in 
one fashion or another.
<P>
	I can understand why the Reform Party is so low in the polls. It is 
far away from the reality of what people really want. Every time 
the Reform Party brings a suggestion to the House it is basically 
refuted by Canadians who argue that it does not make any sense.
<P>
	For the first time 500,000 part time workers will be insured. Is 
that a bad thing?
<P>
	The Bloc leader suggested today that first hour coverage, which 
would be for part time workers, is a bad thing. I am quite surprised. 
The unionists are trying to protect part time workers. Society is 
revolving around part time workers more and more every year. I am 
surprised that they would be opposed to that. I wonder who they are 
representing: their union bosses or the people who are going to be 
stuck in the situation of working part time.
<P>
	Two hundred and seventy thousand workers will receive, on 
average, three extra weeks of benefits. The Bloc does not care 
about that. Bill C-12 will create up to 150,000 new jobs because of 
behavioural changes within the bill. Again the Bloc does not seem 
to be concerned about the unemployed whether they are in St. 
John's, Vancouver or Rimouski.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="596"> 596 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-12 reduces premiums by $1.3 billion this year alone, 
money that can be used to create jobs. The Bloc does not seem to 
care about that either. Bill C-12 allows women who have left the 
workforce to raise families to access employment benefits for the 
first time. The Bloc does not seem to care about these women 
either.
<P>
	Quite frankly, I am amazed at how little Bloc members seem to 
care about the important aspects of this bill. Bill C-12 will refund 
premiums for $1.3 million low income workers, including 920,000 
who pay premiums today. The Bloc does not care about increasing 
their take home pay either.
<P>
	In the few minutes I had, I wanted to mention these issues. The 
minister has said publicly to all members of the House that there 
are areas of concern with the intensity rule, with the gap, with low 
income Canadians, with the divisor rule. All those issues have been 
targeted as something to which the government is prepared to find 
better solutions or answers if people can come up with some 
proposals.
<P>
	I ask the members opposite this. Instead of playing political 
games for the sake of trying to break up Canada for their own 
political gain they should come up with some proposals that can be 
looked at in committee and will hopefully improve the bill even 
further than it goes already.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There are five minutes for 
questions and comments. I would like to get both members on the 
record so-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore, I would like the questions to be as precise as possible 
in order to give every member an opportunity to ask a question or 
to make a comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, following 
the speech just made by my colleague from the government, I will 
say that, in the riding of Charlevoix as in the rest of Quebec, people 
do want a reform of the unemployment insurance program, but not 
at the expense of the most disadvantaged. The minister is 
confirming what the Bloc Quebecois has been saying, namely that 
the government intends to reduce its deficit at the expense of the 
most disadvantaged.
<P>
	Members will recall that, last year, the unemployment insurance 
fund had a $5.5 billion surplus and that, this year, the government 
anticipates a surplus in the order of $5.3 billion. It is not true that 
there is less unemployment; in fact, there is more. The problem, 
and the reason why there is more and more money in the 
unemployment insurance fund, is the increasingly difficult access 
to the program. With the new reform, seasonal workers who work, 
for example, 15 hours a week will have to work 45 to 50 weeks in 
order to be  eligible for UI benefits. In other words, these workers 
will no longer have access to the program.
<P>
	People find it increasingly difficult to qualify for unemployment 
insurance and are forced to go on welfare.
<P>
	Also, with this unemployment insurance reform, the benefit 
period for people who are eligible is reduced. Therefore, over a 
52-week period, with a qualifying period, a person often has to rely 
on welfare before he or she goes back to work. And not everybody 
is eligible for welfare. Often times, people have to sell assets that 
they have accumulated over many years.
<P>
	Does my colleague recognize the fact that the unemployment 
insurance fund is entirely paid by workers and employers and that 
the government cannot appropriate that money since it is there to 
help people in case they lose their jobs? Does the member 
recognize that the UI fund is an insurance for workers and that, if 
the government uses it to reduce its deficit, it is taking something 
that does not belong to it?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will answer quickly so my friend from 
the Reform can ask his question.
<P>
	The Bloc continues to perpetuate a myth. First, we all know that 
the UI fund is not general revenue. It does not go into the general 
revenues of the government. In fact last year it was in a deficit. 
When the Tories were defeated, the fund was in pretty rough shape 
and was in deficit by some $3 billion or more. This year finally that 
deficit has been turned into a surplus. It is projected there will be a 
fairly large surplus this year.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will recall because you were here-I am sure 
some of these members that were not here would not have read the 
<I>Hansard</I> as closely as they should have-that premiums had to be 
increased significantly during the last recession because there was 
no surplus in the EI account. It is our intention not to let that 
happen this time.
<P>
	There is no interest or legal capability of the government to take 
that money and pay off its deficit. It is used as a benchmark for how 
the EI account is doing, whether it is in a deficit or a surplus 
position.
<P>
	For the Bloc to continue to say that the government is paying off 
the deficit on the backs of the poor is completely false and 
erroneous.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to point out that this member has made some 
statements that are totally false.
<P>
	For two years I was the critic and dealt a lot with the 
unemployment insurance fund. When he says that we do not make 
sugges-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="597"> 597 </A></B>
<P>
tions I would like to refer him to  <I>Hansard</I> and have him read 
<I>Hansard</I>. He says that the Bloc is not reading it; neither has he read 
<I>Hansard</I>.
<P>
	If he would go back to 1994 and 1995 he would see the speeches 
I delivered in the House. There were 14 to 17 points in some of 
those speeches that provided the government with suggestions of 
what it could do to reform the unemployment insurance fund. To 
my knowledge very little of that advice was ever taken. If it had 
been taken the unemployment rate would be 1.5 per cent to 3 per 
cent lower that it is today. Those were excellent suggestions which 
have fallen on deaf ears. The government should take heed.
<P>
	Has the unemployment fund not become a slush fund for some 
other government projects that have very little to do with 
insurance? We Reformers have a problem with this. The 
government was taking funds from EI and using them for things 
other than insurance. I do not think it can be denied that is the case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> No, Mr. Speaker, I do not deny it. Quite frankly I 
welcome it. Any worker who understands a global economy, any 
worker or any parliamentarian who has spent time looking at our 
major competition in the world, will know that every labour 
adjustment program in the world is funded by its workers and its 
employers; every major labour adjustment program in the world is 
very progressive, not passive, not a straight insurance program 
where somebody is just given a cheque to stay home.
<P>
	They are given a helping hand to try to retrain, to prove 
themselves and get back into the workforce. If the member calls 
that some kind of slush fund for friends of the Liberals, he should 
talk to the people about how they feel about that part of it.
<P>
	I know Reform members have made a couple of suggestions. I 
heard them today: straight insurance program, nothing else to it; 
take it out of the hands of the government, give it back to the 
employers and the employees; government should have nothing to 
do with it. As a unionist I can say that I would be scared to death if 
it was taken out of the hands of the government and given to the 
private sector because there would be no insurance program if that 
was ever done.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to speak to the motion introduced by the hon. 
member for Roberval. While I am pleased to have this opportunity 
to share with the member and the House the accomplishments of 
the Liberal government, I am disappointed that once again the 
opposition's only effort is to ignore the positive and focus on the 
negative.
<P>
	I would hope that prior to introducing this motion for debate the 
hon. member and his colleagues had discussed the proposed 
changes to unemployment insurance with their constituents. I have 
worked closely with the people of Guelph-Wellington in offering 
constructive proposals for genuine change in unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
	I am particularly grateful to Jerry Wilson of the International 
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and Joseph Maloney of the 
Building and Construction Trade Department who have worked 
with me in this regard. Their suggestions, proposals and guidance 
have been of great assistance to me and I thank them for their work 
on behalf of workers across Guelph-Wellington and all of 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	I would suggest that any member in the House take the time to 
meet with some of these people. They have lot that they can help 
and share with each of us.
<P>
	Let me remind the hon. member that it was a Liberal government 
that first introduced unemployment insurance in Canada. In July 
1940 the Minister of Labour, the Hon. N. A. McLarty, guided the 
bill through Parliament. It was established to provide insurance 
against unemployment and to form an employment service.
<P>
	The bill was introduced during a time of war following the great 
depression. It responded to the changing times of the 1940s and it 
gave protection to workers and their families that never existed 
before.
<P>
	It is this Liberal government, with the work of Minister of 
Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Human Resources 
Development that wishes to afford better protection and we have 
offered concrete proposals which respond to the same difficult and 
changing times which faced the government of Mackenzie King.
<P>
	I find it ironic, however, that the opposition parties criticize the 
government for its work on behalf of young people, women, 
seasonal workers and immigrants. Let us examine their record on 
behalf of these Canadians they seek to protect in this motion. Let us 
look closely.
<P>
	We know that introducing employment insurance eligibility 
based on hours worked will help Canadians working in the building 
and trades industry, students and young people who rely on part 
time work for their employment.
<P>
	Most important, we have made concrete proposals to assist 
young people in all of Canada, every province. 
Guelph-Wellington is the home of the University of Guelph. 
Many of our young people stay in our community to study and we 
attract hundreds of students from across Canada. This government 
is offering them more flexibility in repayment to make 
post-secondary education more accessible. We have introduced job 
focused internship programs and Youth Service Canada in 
co-operation with the private sector which has provided much 
needed assistance in the transition from the school to work.
<P>
	What have the opposition parties offered? The Bloc tells young 
people that their future lies in the uncertainty created by a divided 
country. The Reform tells young  people that their future will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="598"> 598 </A></B>
<P>
better by destroying the social programs that make Canada great 
and some day our future will be brighter.
<P>
	Young people in Guelph-Wellington realize and they tell me 
that they have hope in a united Canada and in bettering social 
programs, not destroying them.
<P>
	What have the Liberals done for women? Our proposals will 
provide greater assistance to low income families. Two-thirds of 
the claimants who will receive the family income support are 
women. Our record includes a new pension system that will mean 
that nine out of ten low income senior women will be better 
protected. Changes to student loans will allow expanded relief for 
women in doctoral studies.
<P>
	What do the opposition parties have to offer for women? The 
Bloc offers uncertainty and discourages investment which can help 
women find employment and the Reform's discussion on women's 
issues in 1990 concluded that there are no women's issues. That is 
what the Reform's report found. The women in 
Guelph-Wellington will disagree.
<P>
	In my work with representatives of the building and trades 
unions I brought forward their support for an employment 
insurance program based on hours worked. They wanted this 
proposal and the Liberals have responded. This is a positive step 
forward for workers who generally did not benefit from the 
previous UI system. With the changes announced by the 
government 45,000 more seasonal workers will be eligible for 
assistance.
<P>
	The minister listened to the building trades. They have concerns 
which need to be addressed further and I acknowledge that. We will 
continue to work positively with them. This is a positive first step 
and it is concrete. You can see it and you know what is being 
proposed.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	What do the opposition parties have to offer seasonal workers? Is 
the Bloc offering a first step, or a step into the uncertainty created 
by the breakup of Canada? Reform offers $15 billion of further cuts 
to social services, services which would benefit seasonal workers 
and their families.
<P>
	Finally, the Bloc has expressed concern regarding the results of 
our proposals on immigrants. I welcome its concern for new 
Canadians and those who come to Canada to seek a better life.
<P>
	Our proposals, along with the measures announced in the budget, 
and the emphasis on jobs and growth will give Canadians, whether 
they have been here for hours or generations, hope for their future.
<P>
	The Bloc tells new immigrants that it wants to break up the 
country. Reformers believe that immigration should be based on 
economics alone. Reformers do not like policies based on 
compassion or need.
<P>
	I recognize that our efforts to improve the unemployment 
insurance system will not eliminate unemployment in Canada. I 
recognize that but it is a good first step.
<P>
	Guelph-Wellington, as part of the country's technology 
triangle, offers the best workforce in this country. We are known 
for quality, dedication and hard work. A national unemployment 
rate of 9 per cent is unacceptable to Liberals. While we have 
created over 600,000 jobs, we recognize that there is more that can 
be done and more that needs to be done.
<P>
	The employment insurance reforms are made in the interest of 
protecting the very groups that this motion claims we are hurting. 
The simple fact is that young people, women, seasonal workers and 
immigrants, for that matter all Canadians, are better protected by 
the Liberal Party.
<P>
	The Bloc offers only uncertainty and discourages investment 
that is needed to keep Canada strong. It discourages foreign 
markets. It makes everybody uncertain. It somehow believes that 
economies are built on policies that destroy rather than on 
commitments which build.
<P>
	Reformers believe that if social programs are cut now in order to 
reduce the deficit, more could be spent on social programs in the 
future. That is like suggesting we burn down the house in order to 
make room for the furniture. If Reformers get their way there will 
be no social programs and no medicare.
<P>
	This motion deserves to be defeated. It shall be defeated by the 
encouragement of the people of Guelph-Wellington who support 
our efforts to build programs that offer hope, protection and 
opportunity.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> With all the interest shown 
in the speech by the hon. member for Guelph-Wellington, I will 
recognize one Bloc member, the hon. member for Longueuil, and 
one member of the Reform Party.
<P>
	I will ask you to take two minutes each, and then the hon. 
member for Guelph-Wellington will be asked to respond.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would just 
like to point out to the hon. member that a consensus was reached 
some years ago now in Quebec. The unions and the bosses, the 
Liberals and the present Parti Quebecois government, all have 
reached the consensus that manpower training is primarily a 
provincial matter and one that ought to be handled by Quebec, by 
the Quebec Department of Education.
<P>
	What is being noticed now about the unemployment insurance 
program is that several billion dollars are being taken from 
unemployment insurance contributions, and no one yet knows 
where that money is going to end up.  We see this as a new method 
of taxation, a tax in disguise. Employees are taxed, employers are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="599"> 599 </A></B>
<P>
taxed, for unemployment insurance, but we are not yet clear what 
you are planning to do with that surplus money.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	What we in Quebec are hoping-and Quebecers are unanimous 
in this, whether unionists, employers, the previous Liberal 
government or the present government-what we have been 
demanding for years is that this surplus in the unemployment 
insurance fund, made up of employee and employer contributions, 
be ploughed back into manpower training, and that such training be 
delivered and administered by the Quebec Department of 
Education, which is best placed to provide training tailored to the 
needs of our businesses and our unemployed workers.
<P>
	Now, one more question. How can it be that both employers and 
employees are asking, since they are the contributors, why they are 
not the ones to administer unemployment insurance and manpower 
training funds? I would like to know what the minister's thoughts 
are on this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have talked to several labour 
union people and government people in Quebec and I would not 
concur at all that everyone agrees that Quebec should have 
exclusive jurisdiction over these surpluses.
<P>
	I would also like to point out to the hon. member that many 
provinces across Canada are being governed by many different 
people. I find more and more people across Canada, and especially 
in Quebec, who are saying: ``We need the federal government. We 
are worried by some of our current leaders today in all provinces. 
We know that each time a government changes there are different 
philosophies, there are tides and waves to the right and left''. 
However, there are many people in the trenches who are really 
anxious for the federal government to have a very strong presence 
in Canada and which will assure Canadians that certain programs 
and safeguards such as medicare will stay in place.
<P>
	That is why the Liberals and the federal government pledge to do 
their very best for all Canadians, including those in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
quite interested to hear the hon. member for Guelph-Wellington 
contend that the Liberal Party is the only defender of social 
programs in Canada. I suppose it is not too surprising that I 
disagree.
<P>
	I find it most amusing, contradictory in fact that the member 
would hold Reform Party members up as those who would not 
defend social programs.
<P>
	I would like to take the member back to 1993. In our literature, 
we suggested that with regard to old age  security, family income 
should be taken into consideration. At that time we used the figure 
of $54,000 for a household income.
<P>
	How would the hon. member explain how the Liberals can 
possibly be the great defenders of social programs for the elderly 
and those who have trouble fending for themselves when they 
criticized our policies at that time. Now they have reduced social 
programs on a household basis down to a ceiling of $45,000, some 
$9,000 less than the Reform Party advocated in 1993.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very easy to explain a lot 
of these things. We have seen right wing governments and their 
legacies in several provinces in Canada. The Reform Party wishes 
to use a figure of $54,000, but it does not talk about the fact that it 
would look at user fees for everything. It does not talk about the 
fact that it would use a two-tiered health care system. That $9,000 
would soon be eaten up and there would be nothing left for those 
people
<P>
	In the last budget we protected seniors. We promised new 
programs so that social services will be available.
<P>
	With due respect to the hon. member, I have to tell him that right 
wing governments will absolutely choke Canadians if we allow 
them to progress.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my turn to 
rise in the debate on Bill C-12 on unemployment insurance, which 
the government is trying to rename employment insurance. I think, 
if the name is going to be changed, it should be ``deficit insurance'' 
in order to reflect the real change.
<P>
	Earlier, I heard the parliamentary secretary admit, in response to 
a question by a Reform member, that indeed it could eventually be 
used for the deficit. I think some information has to be provided on 
this point. Up to now, there has been an accumulated deficit. The 
unemployment insurance fund had an accumulated deficit of $11 
billion.
<P>
	Perhaps we need to understand the background of this 
accumulated deficit of $11 billion. Where did it come from? It 
dates from the time of the Conservatives. We cannot attribute it to 
the Liberals opposite, because it predates 1993. It dates from fiscal 
1991-92. That is the very year that followed the government's 
withdrawal, when Mr. Valcourt was Minister of Employment. It 
withdrew and decided not to put a penny more into the UI fund.
<P>
	Subsequently, surprise, surprise, there was a deficit in the fund, 
which grew to $11 billion. The Conservatives proposed a bill in the 
House, a reform, an initial reduction. I do not have enough time 
this afternoon to go back over all the speeches of the former 
members of the opposition, who are now across from me in the 
House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="600"> 600 </A></B>
<P>
	The present Minister of Human Resources Development called 
it a scandal when Mr. Valcourt announced the cuts. However, what 
did this government do when it came to power? It passed Bill 
C-17, which led to a cut in eligibility. We must remember that 
it reduced unemployment insurance from 60 per cent to 55 per 
cent of insurable salary. It shortened the periods. This made it 
possible, in two and a half years, to recover the $11 billion deficit 
in the fund. In December, a few months ago, officials of the 
Department of Human Resources Development confirmed there 
was no longer a deficit in the fund.
<P>
	It would have been possible to go on with Bill C-17, and it was to 
be expected that we would have a surplus similar to what the 
Minister of Finance had estimated last year, some $4 billion. The 
following year, the surplus would have been more than enough. But 
what is the Liberal government doing instead?
<P>
	It is proposing a new reform, further cuts to UI benefits, limited 
eligibility, reduced benefits for a lot of groups-and I will show 
that it is so. But the government is going a step further.
<P>
	Once the deficit has been made up, why does the government 
keep on cutting? It wants to pay down the country's deficit, the 
federal government's deficit. That is unacceptable, because the 
unemployed are not the ones who caused the federal government's 
deficit. There are various other factors. The unemployed should not 
be the only ones to pay.
<P>
	We, in the opposition, are often accused of manipulating the 
figures. All these figures are in the last budget brought down by the 
Minister of Finance, who announced a surplus of at least $4.3 
billion for 1995-96. In 1996-97, the surplus will be over $5 billion. 
Adding that amount to the $4.3 billion, we get $9.3 billion in two 
years.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	The following year, he deposits only the contributions, not the 
surplus. Since more people contribute to the fund, the contributions 
are going to generate record revenues of $19.5 billion. And if the 
trend continues, you are going to have in 1997-98, a surplus of 
about $6.3 billion. This is quite a lot of money.
<P>
	These three amounts added together make an enormous surplus. 
We know this is correct: $4.3 billion plus $5 billion plus $6 billion 
come to a total of $15 billion. Is the government going to keep that 
surplus in the fund somewhere? No. It is going to use it, and it is 
clear that it intends to use it to repay Canada's debt.
<P>
	People may sometimes feel unemployment insurance is for 
others. Some say: ``The unemployment rate is about 10 or 12 per 
cent in Quebec''. A lot of people are not affected. At present, the 
unemployment rate may be 10 per cent but last year, 14 per cent of 
workers in  Canada received unemployment insurance 
benefits-14 per cent. That is 2,124,000 individuals.
<P>
	We are not talking of some small isolated village in Charlevoix. 
We are not talking about a village in the minister's riding. Two 
million recipients is the equivalent of the whole population of 
Montreal. Efforts are being made to minimize the figure, but the 
number of unemployed individuals will be 2,124,000.
<P>
	On average, this represents $540 per capita, even if we count 
those who were not able to collect benefits. But more important, 
3.2 per cent of the total income of all Canadians comes from 
unemployment insurance. The government wants to cut benefits 
for families, claiming that it will stimulate the economy; and yet 
we know, for instance, that, according to my calculation, at the end 
of the day this would represent for MIL Davie workers, in my area, 
$1.4 million a year over 5 years for 435 claimants on average. This 
is money they will not have for groceries and the rent, and money 
that will not be available to those who want to do business in this 
area.
<P>
	Sometimes, people who talk about unemployment insurance are 
called socialists. The money I am talking about is money business 
people in a given area will not have access to. People do not see 
that, but afterwards, they realize that it makes sense.
<P>
	This is a problem created by cuts, because what we have here are 
cuts. The unemployment insurance fund surplus is the result of 
cuts. If 30 per cent of the cuts are going to affect Quebec we, in the 
Bloc Quebecois, find this outrageous. Thirty per cent. We only 
represent 24 and some per cent of the total population. And yet, 30 
per cent of the cuts will affect Quebec. As early as this year, 
1996-1997, Quebec will lose $400 million. This is an 8 per cent 
drop since last year.
<P>
	We are told this is insignificant. These are not cuts. But an 8 per 
cent drop is a cut. I will give you some figures for last year; in 
Quebec, some 754,000 individuals-right now there are 435,000 
claimants-but last year they were 754,000 who, at one time or 
another, were on UI. This is a lot of people.
<P>
	I am only talking about Bill C-17, I said nothing of the impact of 
the next reform. Within two years, Bill C-17 has resulted in a 
25,749 increase of the welfare roll in Quebec. This means 
shovelling the deficit into the province's backyard at a time when 
Quebec is already in a predicament because of previous cuts. It 
should be pointed out that exactly 25,749 individuals are on 
welfare in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> This is due to the referendum.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> The parliamentary secretary claims that the 
referendum had an impact on the unemployment rate in Quebec. So 
let us 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="601"> 601 </A></B>
<P>
see what happened in the other provinces. Did the referendum 
adversely affect Ontario  also? Ontario will lose $400 million next 
year. This means 6 per cent less for Ontario.
<P>
	Was British Columbia, which is far from Quebec, also affected 
by the referendum? There was no referendum in that province, but 
it will still lose $165 million next year, a decrease of 9 per cent.
<P>
	The four maritime provinces together will lose $220 million. 
Newfoundland will lose $85 million. Was there a referendum in 
Newfoundland? Oh yes, there was one on the question of catholic 
or secular schools. Could that be the cause of unemployment in 
Newfoundland? There was a referendum so maybe the 
parliamentary secretary will want to repeat that the situation is due 
to the referendum. However, Quebec sovereignists have nothing to 
do with the Newfoundland referendum.
<P>
	New Brunswick will receive $65 million less, an 11 per cent 
decrease. For Nova Scotia, it will be $55 million, 8 per cent less. 
Prince Edward Island, which is sparsely populated, will still lose 
$15 million because of the reform proposed by this liberal 
government.
<P>
	I can hear the member saying: ``The opposition members is 
using figures that he manipulates''. These figures come directly 
from the deputy minister. He presented some impact studies to the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources Development, but only 
because we had requested them. So I am quoting figures from that 
document. I am not inventing these data. I do not even read figures 
in the newspaper. These figures come directly from the Department 
of Human Resources Development. These must be good figures. I 
hope so, otherwise we are wasting our time.
<P>
	I just reviewed the figures from a geographic point of view. 
However, I also searched these same papers by sectors. Let us start 
with the projections in the forestry sector, which is of particular 
interest to my colleague for Charlevoix and other areas. This sector 
will receive 21 per cent less, not only in Quebec but everywhere in 
Canada, 21 per cent less. The mining sector will get 17 per cent 
less.
<P>
	In the construction sector-there is actually a strike in 
Quebec-cuts in unemployment benefits for construction workers 
will amount to 16 per cent. In agriculture, 15 per cent less, and in 
transportation, 12 per cent less.
<P>
	Because there are cuts almost everywhere, government services 
will not be exempt. In Ontario alone-and the figures I have 
predate the announcements of the Harris government, which means 
that it will be much worse-at the present time it is already 11 per 
cent less. For hotel workers, 9 per cent less. In finance, 8 per cent 
less. In commerce, 8 per cent less and in all the other sectors, that I 
regrouped, also 8 per cent less.
<P>
	I looked for one sector which would benefit from the changes. I 
took the document and I studied all the sectors, one by one, and I 
did not find a single one which would benefit from the changes. 
Everybody loses. All  sectors of economic activity are losers, 
whichever they are. And the government would like us to believe 
that it is a good reform, when everybody is losing. If one group was 
a loser and another one the winner, while others would remain 
unchanged it would be fine. But no, all the sectors, according to the 
government's own figures, are losing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> This is unacceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> As my colleague for Lotbinière just said, this is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	That is why our leader this morning brought forward a motion 
asking that the Liberal government withdraw this bill. I could go 
on; I could go into this more thoroughly. As the official opposition 
critic for youth, my special concern is the fate of our young people.
<P>
	Since the Liberal government took office, it launced a youth 
employment sttrategy. The speech from the throne waxed eloquent 
on youth employment. I notice that when the Liberal Party came to 
power, the unemployment rate for young people under 24 years of 
age was 17.5 per cent. What it the present rate? It is 17.2 per cent. 
There has been a 0.3 per cent improvement, and the government 
wants us to find that acceptable. The government tells us it will 
double the number of federal summer jobs.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	I looked at the statistics; $60 million were spent and the 
government raised it to $120 million. It is doubling it. The 
Conservatives had provided about the same amount, that is $104 
million the first year. But when the Liberals came to power, they 
cut it in half. So, they are raising it a little higher than the level it 
was at two years ago. I do not call that a visionary strategy, but 
something that goes up and down. The only expression I can think 
of is a yo-yo strategy. The government is reinstating things it had 
abandoned last year and is coming back to the same point. But to 
whom is it offering that money? To students. Students are not 
unemployed people, they go to school and find summer jobs. That 
is quite all right. I have nothing against that. But does the 
government think this will change the unemployment situation for 
our young people? No, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	What does the government do for young people? It says to them: 
for new unemployed people, the reform has now done this. In some 
areas, the qualifying period for UI benefits was 300 hours, that is 
15 weeks at 20 hours per week. What is the situation now, or rather, 
what will it be after the UI reform is passed? It will be 910 hours. 
And that will be not only for young people, but also for women, 
immigrants, all newcomers on the labour market. They will need 
52 weeks of work at 15 hours per week to qualify for 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Yet, a change was brought in by the Reform Party. Before, those 
who worked less than 15 hours per week  did not contribute to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="602"> 602 </A></B>
<P>
UI system. Now, they will contribute as of their first hour of work, 
but it is not sure that they will qualify.
<P>
	There is another shameful measure that the government has 
introduced. It has reduced the benefit ceiling, that is the insurable 
income, from $42,000 to $39,000. By doing this, the Liberals will 
save $900 million as soon as the measure is implemented. Now, as 
I just mentioned, the fact that people who work 15 hours per week 
or less must contribute to UI also allows the government to save 
$900 million. So, the government saves in one area in order not to 
reduce contributions to UI for those who made $39,000 and more, 
but at the same time, it makes people who work 15 hours per week 
and less pay more. There is a social choice here.
<P>
	When I was listening to the throne speech, I heard: ``We will 
give more help to those who are in need''. What is the first bill that 
is being introduced in this session? We are doing just the opposite. 
We reduce the contribution of those who earn more than $39,000 
and make those who work less than 15 hours a week contribute just 
as much. This is unacceptable. It is another reason why we, as the 
official opposition, want the government to withdraw this type of 
reform.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary said a little bit earlier today that the 
opposition was not suggesting anything. I am saying this: Why 
change things and make low income earners, women working part 
time, young Canadians who are hard hit by the unemployment, 
contribute? The government recognized that in the speech from the 
throne, but at the first opportunity, in its first initiative, it does 
exactly the opposite. The government members say one thing and 
do the opposite. Members will recall that when the Liberals were in 
the opposition, they condemned Mr. Valcourt, the previous 
Minister responsible for the Unemployment Insurance Act and now 
that they form the government, they do the opposite, they continue 
on the same path.
<P>
	It is sometimes difficult to ask people to stop and explain to us 
their frustrations in terms of what is happening. This government is 
a master of contradiction. It announces the opposite of what it 
intends to do. Other examples were given during the last few 
weeks, the GST, for instance. But as far as unemployment 
insurance is concerned, the present government condemned Mr. 
Valcourt' cuts, then continued on the same path. Even after 
succeeding in eliminating the deficit in the unemployment 
insurance fund, it still continues on the same path.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Meanwhile, employer contributions are being reduced. I would 
have supported this. We did not object to a cut in employer 
contributions. But why reduce employee premiums from $42,000 
to $39,000? To sweeten the pill, because the benefit ceiling is also 
falling. That is why I see this as a lose-lose situation.
<P>
	People previously entitled to the $448 maximum benefit will 
now receive only $413 a week. For someone with a family to 
support, this is not much. Workers at MIL Davie and those working 
in construction, industry and big business are all affected by this. 
They will all be affected by the new minimum.
<P>
	If they are unfortunate enough to be working for a seasonal or 
cyclical business like construction, they will also be affected by the 
so-called repeat claimant rule, that is to say, instead of receiving 55 
per cent, their benefits will be reduced by 1 per cent for every 
claim. For example, someone collecting $448 will see his benefits 
go down, first, to $413 a week and, after the fifth claim he has to 
file because he works for a cyclical business and must go back on 
unemployment, to $375 a week. They are trying to sweeten the pill 
by telling us that this is a good reform.
<P>
	At a time when people earning $100,000 stop contributing and 
banks, with record profits of nearly $5 billion per year, cut back 
their staff and make massive layoffs while at the same time making 
record profits, we are expected to grant the government its wish to 
have job creation now rest with large business, is that it? That is 
outrageous.
<P>
	We in the opposition will not stand for it and we will do all that 
we possibly can to have the government withdraw its bill. I sit on 
the Standing Committee on Human Resources, and the 
parliamentary secretary can rest assured that I will spare no pains 
to propose corrections and amendments to make sure that the 
people of Quebec and Canada, the unemployed, the young, women, 
immigrants and everyone involved are not penalized. The 2.2 
million people who received UI benefits last year can count on the 
Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, to make sure it does not 
happen.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
speech made by the hon. member's leader, the comment he made 
was that the Bloc is opposed to the new system of every hour 
counting, what we call the hours based system.
<P>
	The present system is based on weeks where one has to work so 
many weeks in order to qualify. With a system in which every hour 
that one works counts, some 270,000 workers will now qualify for 
an additional three weeks of benefits because they will now be 
given full credit for all the hours they work. About 45,000 workers 
in seasonal industries not eligible for UI will now qualify for EI. I 
would like the member to explain to the House why the Bloc is 
opposed to moving to an hourly system where every single hour 
counts.
<P>
	In a region like mine and a region like yours, Mr. Speaker, this 
affects every single member. Members are trying to suggest that 
seasonal workers are fishermen and  foresters. This country's 
biggest seasonal industry is construction and construction workers 
work long hours when they can. It is just the way it is in the 
construction industry. They work 16 to 18 hours a day when it is 
nice out, when the sun is shining and it is not raining. Every single 
hour an individual works will qualify. He may only work eight 
<P>

<B><A NAME="603"> 603 </A></B>
<P>
weeks but is working 60 hours a week during those eight weeks. He 
will qualify under the new system but will not qualify if we stay 
with the old system.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	I would like an explanation as to why the Bloc is opposed to the 
hourly system. Everyone I have spoken to thinks it is a tremendous 
improvement for the average worker in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of things to say. It is 
truly extraordinary that, each week-and the minister again 
complained about that today, as do people in his 
region-demonstrations are held every Sunday afternoon in his 
area, with some 2,000 or 3,000 people taking part.
<P>
	The hon. member from Fredericton sat with us on the human 
resources development committee and we accompanied him. The 
three of us went to Bathurst last year and people, not just unions, 
made that point. I remember in particular four single mothers 
telling us that if what was being contemplated became reality, it 
would be terrible for the economy of the Caraquet region, Acadia 
in particular, but also the maritimes as a whole.
<P>
	I know I will never convince the member opposite with this 
answer, but-and this is what people in these regions 
understand-that in itself should be enough to reconsider the issue. 
In fact, before he became parliamentary secretary, the hon. member 
said that he would ask the former human resources minister, who is 
now Minister of Foreign Affairs, to make these corrections. In 
other words, he recognized the situation.
<P>
	In a recent statement, a colleague of yours, the member for 
Madawaska-Victoria, who is now acting speaker, said that if the 
bill was not changed, she would not be able to support it. I know 
that many government members have the same problem. Of course, 
the hon. member for Madawaska-Victoria is now Acting Speaker. 
Because of this, she may not have to vote. But I do not wish to get 
into a debate on this matter.
<P>
	I also object to the idea that taking into account the number of 
hours will improve the situation. The parliamentary secretary is 
saying that this will encourage those who have jobs to hustle to 
accumulate the highest number of hours. In other words, in the 
forest or tourism industry, for example, one would work two jobs at 
the same time in order to add up hours as quickly as possible.
<P>
	As critic for training and youth, I say that this stiffens the 
competition for young people, women, part-time  workers, and 
those who have a hard time finding what I might call ``McJobs''. 
Young people already have a hard time finding such jobs and, with 
this system taking hours into account, they will face even stronger 
competition against those who already have jobs, who are more 
experienced, and who have a better knowledge of their work 
environment, to add up hours of work.
<P>
	In the so-called leisure-oriented society we have been promised 
for the past 20 years, we see exactly the opposite. People must 
work 60 or 70 hours for fear that their company will shut down in 
two weeks. Is that what the parliamentary secretary calls progress? 
I doubt it and I say that it is an unacceptable incentive for people to 
take on those jobs. This is another reason why the Bloc Quebecois 
is asking for this bill to be withdrawn.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member did a great job of dancing 
around the question. I can understand his reluctance to try and deal 
with it. I am aware that his party is trying to dance between two 
interest groups, one which is in favour of the hourly system and 
another which is not. Let me put it to him based on questions from 
some women in his caucus over the last couple of days relating to 
women's issues.
<P>
	The vast majority of part time workers are women who do not 
fall under the present system and do not get any benefits. I happen 
to know some of them. Some are related to me, very close family 
members who work part time and do not have benefits because of 
the present system.
<P>
	Is the member of the Bloc telling me that his party's position is 
that the vast majority of women who do not come under the present 
system should not be able to pay into the system and get benefits 
when they need them because his party has a couple of union 
friends who do not agree with the hourly system?
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is one of the problem with the 
government's arguments. It refers to circumstances like these, to 
ask if we are against that on an individual level. Finally, we have to 
admit that, for instance, some women who could not benefit from 
UI before might benefit from it now. It is possible.
<P>
	But what is more likely is that we will see again the inequity 
condemned by the parliamentary secretary. I would like to quote, 
for instance, a document from the department which says: ``In 
2001-2002, the decrease in women's benefits will reach 9 per cent 
and will represent a $560 million loss''. In my answer, I refer to 
government's figures.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="604"> 604 </A></B>
<P>
	Here, the government admits that women will lose $560 million 
in benefits. It is in black and white, and the parliamentary 
secretary would want me to say that this is an improvement.
<P>
	I invite him to read the reports of his own department; he will 
find the answer there. It is detrimental to women, to everybody, but 
mainly to women. I hope that this answer will satisfy you. I invite 
you to have a look at the document, on page 8, and in particular at 
Part A which deals with the effects on governments.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, as you know, you must always 
address the Chair rather than addressing another member directly.
<P>
	I would ask the member for Charlevoix, who has the floor, if he 
wants to speak on debate, or ask a question or make a comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, on questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> You have two and a half to three minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I 
would like to congratulate my colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois 
on their excellent work, particularly the party's critic, the member 
for Mercier, the member for Lévis and the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup. I congratulate them on the 
excellent work they are doing on the human resources development 
committee.
<P>
	I assure you, members of the Bloc Quebecois who represent us 
on the human resources development committee, that there are 
many unemployed workers and low income families. These people 
expect you to defend them very well in this House, and at all times, 
because you have the chance to remind the government that it was 
elected by them and that it made promises in the red book. In it, the 
Prime Minister committed himself and his team to job creation.
<P>
	We remember what the Prime Minister said about creating 
``jobs, jobs, jobs'' as well as reducing the deficit. It is important to 
remind the Prime Minister as well as the Minister of Human 
Resources Development of those words.
<P>
	I will also ask the committee to remind the Minister of Human 
Resources Development not to eliminate the deficit at the expense 
of the most disadvantaged, but rather to consult the auditor 
general's report, which indicates clearly to the government exactly 
where all the wastage of public funds is occurring.
<P>
	I would like to say to the member for Lévis, who made a very 
fine speech on seasonal workers, in particular, that there are many 
seasonal workers in my riding of Charlevoix. Many of them work 
up to 15 hours per week, for a maximum of 10 to 12 weeks.
<P>
	Tourism is developing in Charlevoix. We know that summer is 
very short so, unfortunately, those workers can not qualify for UI.
<P>
	In my riding, there are also more and more people with 
innovative ideas and goodwill who want to create their own job. 
These people invest everything they have earned during their 
lifetime to create their own business. Unfortunately, there again, 
the government found the arm's length relationship rule to prevent 
such investors who are ready to create a business from being 
eligible for UI after the summer season.
<P>
	I would like to ask my colleague from Lévis if they tried to bring 
that arm's length relationship rule to the minister's attention. It is 
important for Charlevoix because there are many seasonal 
businesses there. I am thinking, for example, of a landscaping 
company in which a woman from Charlevoix, her spouse and her 
brother-in-law invested but, because summer is so short, they are 
not eligible for UI benefits. Right now, they are getting 
dangerously close to welfare.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	I ask my colleague from Lévis if he intends to defend-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but I must interrupt the hon. member. 
The hon. member for Lévis has only 10 seconds left. You can 
answer by yes or no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer is yes, and with all of our 
energy.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> That is a good answer.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion and the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to share my time with the hon. member 
for St. Boniface. My first comments respond to the last couple of 
interventions from the other side.
<P>
	There was reference to the social security review and a trip 
members of the HRD committee made to Bathurst one Saturday 
afternoon following the social security review. I remind the hon. 
member for Lévis that at the time many of the representations from 
Bathurst asked us to convert the measure for eligibility for 
unemployment insurance from weeks to hours.
<P>
	It is a very well received change in most corners, business, 
labour and seasonal workers. I am surprised that recollection fails 
the hon. member, that he was not aware of how important that 
change is to the seasonal industries and to our region.
<P>
	Similarly, another comment was made with regard to the need to 
defend the interests of the less fortunate in society. I bring to the 
attention of the members of the Bloc that for those people who 
would earn less than $26,000, the outcome of the changes even 
before the amendments that have been promised is an increase of 
11 per cent in benefits.
<P>
	I think it is very important to recognize that while there are 
things that need to be amended in the bill, which I will speak to, let 
us not forget that by throwing out the bill, withdrawing the bill, an 
awful lot of good things will go with it. For that reason I cannot 
support their motion.
<P>
	I remind the House what those changes need to be so that the 
record is clear in terms of some of the commitments that have been 
made, some of the statements by colleagues particularly from 
Atlantic Canada and Quebec. We need to fix what has become 
known as the gap, basically the way benefits are calculated.
<P>
	As the bill presently reads, that calculation would be done on the 
basis of the last 14, 16 or 18 consecutive weeks. If you work in a 
pattern that sees spaces between periods of work all of those spaces 
would have the effect of decreasing benefits unduly, and that 
change needs to be made. I look forward to participating in the 
committee's hearings to make some suggestions as to how that 
might be done.
<P>
	The divisor is an instrument that would allow the government to 
separate the measure of eligibility from the measure of calculation 
of benefits. That can be a  good thing if it is used to allow people 
easier access to unemployment insurance in some instances while 
at the same time protecting the system from the possibility that 
some people would assume that access is their ultimate objective.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="606"> 606 </A></B>
<P>
	We have to be careful to make sure the divisor is not so great as 
to have a negative impact on the rate of benefits as a result of those 
calculations. It is very important that be attended to. Originally the 
discussion was around a divisor of 20. That would mean that if 
someone were eligible for unemployment insurance with what 
would be the hourly equivalent of 12 weeks of work, that would be 
divided by 20 and the result would be a very low rate of benefits. 
However, if the divisor were small enough-I will be participating 
in the discussion with the committee on that as well-it could be a 
helpful tool to allow people easier access to the system.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	The final point is the intensity rule. It is very important to 
recognize the difference of the intensity rule as it is applied to 
people with low incomes as against the intensity rule as it is applied 
to people with high incomes.
<P>
	In order to explain this it is necessary to understand the two 
principal objectives of the new employment insurance program. 
The first objective is to insure people against the loss of work or 
income replacement in the case of loss of work. The second 
objective is to offer income support or an income supplement in 
various areas where people simply cannot put together enough 
work, time or wages to sustain a family over the course of an entire 
year. Those two objectives are fundamental to unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
	The income supplement objective has been hijacked by many 
people who apply the rules which allow the income supplement at 
very high income levels. People who are making $60,000 and 
$70,000 are the exception. I would want to be accused of using 
those exceptions to beat up on people who are blameless. However, 
there are people who have taken the annual supplement component 
of the UI program and who are using it to give themselves 
supplements. Very often they are not individuals. Very often they 
are businesses. Very often they are governments and large 
organizations which use that possibility to supplement incomes 
which do not require a supplement.
<P>
	It is very important to understand the two functions of the 
unemployment insurance program. We can challenge the annual 
use of the system by people with high incomes. I doubt there are 
many Canadians who would disagree with that sentiment.
<P>
	Despite the fact there are changes which need to be made, and I 
have every confidence they will be made, I want the House to know 
why it would be wrong to withdraw the bill at this time. There are 
many things in  the bill which will help the people who need help, 
whether in the Atlantic region, in Quebec or any place with 
seasonal industries such as tourism, the resource area or in 
construction.
<P>
	Before I get into that subject I thank the former minister, the 
present minister, the HRD committee and its members from all 
sides of the House. It has been a very vigorous debate, one which 
has flushed out beyond most people's expectations. In my 
constituency we have had forums going back almost two years on 
the issue. It is very important to Atlantic Canada. It is very 
important to my riding. I am thankful that so many people in my 
constituency have been engaged in the debate.
<P>
	What are the good things in the bill we cannot afford to 
withdraw? The shift from weeks to hours; anyone familiar with 
seasonal industries will realize that when those industries work 
they work long hours. Consequently if a person works 70 hours a 
week, in this system that is worth two weeks. That is very 
important.
<P>
	It is important that everyone recognize that to withdraw the bill 
would be to withdraw a provision which would allow 270,000 
people three more weeks. On average in Atlantic Canada it would 
mean two more weeks. It would also make the system available to 
half a million Canadians who cannot now get into the system.
<P>
	On the low income protection, if a person makes less than 
$26,000, with the new legislation they could claim up to 80 per 
cent. It is very important to recognize that provision would be gone 
with the withdrawal of the bill.
<P>
	The high income clawback is a good thing. It takes out of the 
system all of those people who are making large amounts of 
money. They are the exception, but they are there. There are people 
working year round at minimum wage, paying premiums so the 
money can be given over to people making much more money on 
an annual basis. I believe that is wrong.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	The employment provisions contained in the bill will take 39 
programs to 5 and make them much more flexible. They will be 
administered by local communities which is another improvement.
<P>
	Finally, the macro impact of this change in our region is 
significant, even though I support many of the provisions. Having 
said that, we have a transition fund which will allow us to make the 
adjustment. Generally speaking, it would be a genuine shame, 
subject to the amendments that I talked about, for our region to 
have this bill withdrawn.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the speech made by my colleague 
from Fredericton-York-Sudbury, with whom I have worked on 
the human resources development committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="607"> 607 </A></B>
<P>
	The question that comes to my mind following his speech is 
how will we get out of this situation? We know and people in the 
Maritimes know as well that this bill contains many important 
elements that are unacceptable. As of today, neither the minister 
nor the government have given us a clue as to which amendments 
will be proposed.
<P>
	After reading the bill, we would be tempted to say that, if we 
have to accept this legislation in its present form, if we have to take 
the whole package, we would rather have nothing at all. We would 
rather have no reform than have the one contained in this bill. 
Nobody in Canada would be against a reform that would propose 
an active job creation policy. Nobody is against giving people an 
opportunity to work more or helping the regions that have seasonal 
industries to diversify. Why is there not, in this reform, an active 
job creation policy?
<P>
	Where are the economic diversification measures that would 
help seasonal workers instead of penalizing them, accusing them of 
not wanting to work or saying that it is their fault that they have 
that kind of job? The government could have proposed a policy that 
would have given the regions that have seasonal industries a period 
of 5, 8 or 10 years to adjust their economy. If the situation has not 
improved at the end of that period, then it can draw the necessary 
conclusions. But there has to be an adjustment period.
<P>
	I want to raise another point. At the end of his speech, my 
colleague talked about a new program, namely the transition job 
fund. Let us be realistic; we had a decentralized program, the job 
development program, which allowed each employment centre to 
make its own decisions, to make adjustments based on a local 
approach, and now, with the new transition job fund, each project 
has to be approved by the minister. We have gone back to the stone 
age in terms of decision making. Does the member really think that 
this is an improvement? Does he not think that the government 
should withdraw this bill rather than go through with it in spite of 
all the criticism it draws, especially in Atlantic Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup for the 
questions.
<P>
	The first questions put were: Where are the amendments? What 
are they going to look like? I am a bit astonished, at this point, that 
anybody would not know what these amendments are going to be. I 
have a hard time distinguishing between the bill that is going to be 
and the bill that is in terms of my speaking on it. We have talked 
about these amendments so much. We have to fix the gap. We have 
to fix the divisor. We have to fix the intensity rule. I do not know 
how much clearer I can be.
<P>
	As the member is a member on the committee, I think he knows 
exactly what I am speaking about. We will have an enjoyable three 
weeks attending to these things.
<P>
	As far as confidence in whether or not these changes are going to 
be made, the member will recall how much resistance there was to 
two-tiered UI in the green book during the social security review. It 
is gone. The member will recall how much resistance there was to 
experience rating which is having one's premiums based on the 
likelihood of one drawing unemployment insurance. I am sure the 
member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup realizes how bad it 
would be for his region and my region if that were to happen, 
notwithstanding the fact that the Reform critic on HRD is quoted in 
a New Brunswick paper this morning as saying that is exactly what 
we should be doing, restoring this back to original insurance 
principles, which I can only say would be absolutely devastating to 
Atlantic Canada, period.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	We are going to be delivering the programs that create jobs in the 
communities to the communities. In my case, there is a human 
resource development office in Fredericton that will be making the 
decisions. I am sure that taking these decisions out of Ottawa and 
larger centres and giving them to the communities is exactly the 
kind of progress we want. It was suggested during the social 
security review that we need to bring more flexibility into the 
system.
<P>
	A significant number of times during the social security review 
people came before us and said: ``The biggest problem with the 
program is that you have to be getting income benefits in order to 
get employment benefits''. We have changed that. Now people will 
be eligible for employment benefits even if they are not drawing 
income benefits. That is another reason why we cannot support this 
motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like, first of all, to set the record straight and, second, to 
bring a matter up for discussion.
<P>
	You are probably aware of the fact that the Employment 
Insurance Act provides for the modernisation of the Canadian 
unemployment insurance system, which is 50 years old, and for the 
revision of federal employment programs. In fact, the Employment 
Insurance Act will establish a two part re-employment assistance 
system.
<P>
	First, the revised insurance benefits. Income support will 
continue to be provided on a temporary basis to recipients while 
they are looking for work. The benefits were revised to give more 
value to the work effort.
<P>
	On the subject of hours, the insurance system is based, not on 
weeks of work but on total hours worked.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="608"> 608 </A></B>
<P>
	As for earnings, each dollar earned is taken into account in the 
benefit calculation. The higher the total earnings during a 
reference period of 16 to 20 weeks, the higher the benefits paid 
upon becoming unemployed.
<P>
	Regarding the intensity rule, as you know, the benefit rate will be 
gradually reduced based on the number of previous weeks of 
benefits.
<P>
	Finally, as regards the family supplement, this new supplement 
will raise the benefit rate of low income families with children. 
This means that claimants whose family income is lower than 
$25,921 could see their benefit rate increase by 7 per cent on 
average.
<P>
	Second, the active employment benefits. The 39 programs which 
are currently centralized will be replaced with an employment 
benefits program focusing on set goals.
<P>
	It is estimated that 400,000 individuals will receive direct 
assistance in their job search through the five measures put forth: 
wage subsidy, income supplement, self-employment assistance, 
job creation partnerships and development grants and loans.
<P>
	These five measures will be tailored to individual needs and will 
support the jobless in their efforts to return to work. These are 
flexible tools, which will be tailored to meet the needs of local 
communities as well.
<P>
	Our goal is to ensure that everyone is treated with fairness. We 
want the population as a whole to be treated fairly. Low income 
families with children will get increased protection, thanks to a 
family supplement. This is one example.
<P>
	Here is another one: some of the new rules will be applied 
gradually to give individuals and communities time to adjust to the 
new situation.
<P>
	Third, jobless people in regions with a high rate of 
unemployment will need fewer hours to be eligible.
<P>
	People earning $2,000 or less per year will get a refund of their 
premiums through the income tax system. Small businesses will be 
eligible for a temporary refund if the amount of the contributions 
that they pay over the next two years increases significantly.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	All claimants will be allowed to work on a temporary basis and 
to earn at least $50 per week without their benefits being affected. 
The program will take into account all the hours spent working. 
Regions where unemployment is high will get proportionally 
greater support.
<P>
	These measures are designed to facilitate the program's 
implementation, to be fair to all Canadians, and to be receptive to 
the needs of regions and communities.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would now like to share, with you and with 
members of this House, some comments made  regarding this bill. I 
am not referring to comments made by members of the opposition 
parties, but by people who look at this legislation with an 
independent mind, if you will.
<P>
	Raynald Langlois, president of Quebec's chamber of commerce, 
said: ``As regards vocational training, the proposed legislation 
provides an interesting approach to reduce, if not eliminate, useless 
and costly overlap''.
<P>
	Yvon Charbonneau, a member of Quebec's national assembly 
and a former union leader, said: ``At this point, the Quebec 
government's responsibility is to go to Ottawa and start negotiating 
directly and immediately''.
<P>
	Here is another quote: ``The Conseil du patronat du Québec feels 
this is the first true federal overture in the manpower training 
sector. Consequently, the CPQ hopes that Quebec will agree to hold 
real discussions on this proposal with Ottawa''. This from Ghislain 
Dufour, chairman of the Conseil du patronat du Québec.
<P>
	There are other headlines and comments. <I>Le Soleil</I> stated: ``A 
good test for the good faith of the Government in Quebec''. And 
Jean-Jacques Samson, in <I>Le Soleil</I>, stated: ``The minister's plan is 
an invitation for provincial governments to negotiate an agreement 
on labour which will be a good test of the good faith of the 
Government of Quebec''.
<P>
	Jean-Robert Sansfaçon, in <I>Le Devoir</I>, said: ``Under the new plan, 
claimants with children whose family income is under $26,000 will 
become eligible for benefits of up to 80 per cent of their salary. 
This is an excellent measure''. Alain Dubuc, in <I>La Presse</I>, 
commented: ``The minister has broken the wall of inertia and has 
launched the process of change''.
<P>
	Jean Jacques Samson, in <I>Le Soleil</I>, stated: ``The new 
employment insurance proposed by the minister was designed to 
reduce costs, indeed, but it has many other merits, the main one 
being that 500,000 part time workers will become eligible. This 
measure is well adapted to one on the new realities of the labour 
market''.
<P>
	There is more. The <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> stated that the plan is 
``reasonable, practical and urgently important''. The <I>Financial 
Post</I> stated: ``The federal government has taken some much needed 
steps in re-orienting the UI system. There are many positive 
features with the minister's proposals''. The <I>Winnipeg Free Press</I> 
stated: ``Responsible and fair''.
<P>
	The <I>Halifax Chronicle Herald</I> stated: ``The minister has 
recognized the needs of the poor in Canada by providing additional 
benefits to those with family incomes of less than $26,000''. 
Sharon Clover, vice-chairman of the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce: ``These changes go a long way toward needed 
improvements, removing some features which previously had been 
a disincentive to work''.
<P>

<P>
	What about other regions of Canada? It was stated in the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> that the minister's plan is ``reasonable, practical and 
urgently important''.
<P>
	The <I>Financial Post</I> stated: ``The federal government has taken

<P>
	The vice-president of the Chamber of Commerce, Sharon 
Glover, stated: ``These changes go a long way toward needed 
improvements, removing some features which previously had been 
a disincentive to work''.
<P>
	I have indicated clearly what this particular piece of legislation 
is all about. I have quoted people who are not members of the 
opposition, who were there in part to embarrass the government, to 
try to destabilize whatever project it brought forward. I have 
quoted neutral third parties who have looked at it with a detached 
eye. These are the kinds of comments they have made.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	If I have more time, I have much more to say about this. May I 
have an indication?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but the member only has about 25 
seconds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, in 25 seconds I can reiterate that I 
would welcome questions from my colleagues with respect to the 
descriptions I have shared as well as the quotes I have put forward. 
These were not from members of the opposition, but from people 
who have looked at this with some objectivity. Perhaps they would 
like to share the views of their own champions on this issue.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask a very broad general question of 
my hon. colleague from St. Boniface concerning the nature of 
employment at this time throughout the world. We are aware that 
the problem affecting Canada and Quebec is not peculiar to 
ourselves. One has only to look at the rising unemployment levels 
in virtually all of the usual industrialized countries at the present 
time to realize that the nature of work is in the process of being 
totally redefined.
<P>
	We understand that there is an increasing trend toward robotics 
and computer assisted design, which means higher production, 
better products, and fewer and fewer people involved. This is a 
fundamental problem. We will  recall Henry Ford's saying in the 
early years of this century: ``When I start production, I will make 
sure that my workers earn enough to be able to purchase what I am 
producing''. Today we are doing the very opposite. At the very 
moment that companies are recording the highest profits, they are 
laying off the most people, and in the medium term, within ten 
years or so, there will be a fundamental problem everywhere in the 
world: no one will be able to afford the products available for sale 
any more.
<P>
	My question to the hon. colleague is a general one, therefore. He 
has kept abreast of this issue since entering the House, and 
therefore during several mandates now. I would ask if he does not 
think that the time has come on the international level for countries 
such as Canada to start redefining the concepts of work, wealth and 
production?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to thank my 
colleague for his question, which I consider of prime importance. 
Yes indeed we must study more and discuss open-mindedly the 
whole concept of work, the way we work and the way we used to 
work. We must look at the changes that have occurred not only in 
Canada, including Quebec, but throughout the world.
<P>
	It is true that things are done differently, dramatically so. This is 
no doubt the reason, and I want to share this with my colleagues, 
that, the government's speech from the throne promoted job 
creation primarily in the sense of ensuring our finances were in 
order. But we did the same in the budget. We want to be sure we 
create a better climate for creating jobs, which is what we want for 
all the Canadians we represent.
<P>
	But I come back to the key point my colleague made. Yes, 
indeed, we must examine, we must look and we must consider what 
the future holds, because, like him, I think things will be different 
again. If we look at the last decade, we can see a major change. And 
if we look ahead into the next decade, I think there will be as many 
changes.
<P>
	This is why I support this bill in principle. We are well aware it 
can stand improvement. But, we also know that it meets certain 
needs today. I will give you two quick examples. When we include 
the people working part time, we meet their needs. There are other 
measures, however. Some should perhaps be added; some should 
perhaps be improved. But as my colleague said earlier, certain 
adjustments will be made.
<P>
	However, I entirely agree with him on the fundamental issue. We 
have to look at what is happening, what has happened and what will 
have to be done in addition to what we did to improve things for 
workers.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup has the floor. I hope his question 
will be brief.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="610"> 610 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Indeed, it will be very brief, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	How is the member for St. Boniface going to explain to a person 
who received $400 a week, who worked 42 hours a week for 10 
weeks, that, after January 1, 1997, the amount to which he or she 
will be entitled will be divided by 16 weeks and that-because the 
work is seasonal-benefits will be cut by 50 per cent and the 
benefits collected will be $125 per week? What is fair about that 
system?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel: </B>Mr. Speaker, I would like to further consider that. 
If my colleague has clear and precise suggestions to make in this 
case as well as others, the government and the minister would be 
quite ready to consider them.
<P>
	We, on this side of the House, are very open-minded and ready to 
remedy any inequity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Prior to resuming debate it is 
my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that 
the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for Mackenzie-Grain; the hon. member 
for Delta-Canadian waterways.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, two years 
ago in the first throne speech of the 35th Parliament the 
government promised to make Canada's social security system 
responsive to the economic and social realities of the nineties.
<P>
	After two years of extensive and expensive travel by the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and 
countless expensive studies and testimonies by bureaucrats and 
experts, the cosmetic changes to the unemployment insurance were 
a real letdown. After listening to Liberal doublespeak for the last 
two years I cannot say that I am surprised.
<P>
	Canadians are realizing the government's idea of an action plan 
really only amounts to a play on words: employment insurance or 
unemployment insurance. Only the name has changed. The 
program will remain as unworkable as ever.
<P>
	Consider the goods and services tax. Scrapping the GST in 
Liberal terms means changing the name to the federal sales tax.
<P>
	The Liberal definition for maintaining universality for old age 
pensioners seems to be combining the old age assistance plan and 
the guaranteed income supplement plan to come up with a seniors' 
benefit that most seniors will not qualify to receive. This is truly 
amazing since the Liberals scoffed at the Reform Party's 1993 
election proposal to base seniors' benefits on family income. At 
least under our plan we suggested that benefits be reduced when 
family income reached the level of $54,000. Under the new Liberal 
seniors' benefit, couples  whose total income exceeds $45,000 
would see a drop in their pension benefits.
<P>
	The member for Guelph-Wellington suggested that parties to 
the right of centre have a difficult time coming up with social 
programs. She should look at the province of Alberta. Its main 
problem at the moment is what to do with a budgetary surplus. 
When we as taxpayers and as government are paying out some $48 
billion a year in interest that severely handcuffs the government to 
come up with any social programs.
<P>
	Canadians are catching on that Liberals make great election 
promises which unfortunately are very conveniently forgotten 
immediately after the votes are counted. When it comes to 
legislation they also fail miserably. Bill C-12 is a prime example of 
this.
<P>
	It is hard to imagine how the government could come up with a 
plan that could anger so many people. The consensus from all sides 
is that this is a flawed bill. Despite the musings of the new Minister 
of Human Resources Development that he will sweeten the bill, it 
will be another step backward for those Canadians who want to 
reduce their dependence on government social programs. The 
government somehow thinks it can win votes and maintain its 
popularity by perpetuating the social welfare system. Insurance 
means insurance, whether it is called employment insurance or 
unemployment insurance. The reason this bill should be withdrawn 
is that it does not resemble insurance in any way, other than the fact 
that it needs to have premiums paid into it.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	Let us talk about insurance the way Canadians understand the 
concept. For instance, if you own and operate a motor vehicle you 
are required by law to purchase and maintain insurance on that 
automobile. If you have an accident or if the car is stolen you 
receive some monetary compensation. Also if your house burns 
down and your insurance premiums are paid up, you would be 
entitled to some monetary remuneration as long as you did not set 
the fire.
<P>
	The unemployment insurance program is not a true insurance 
plan. It includes wage supplement programs, training programs and 
other add-ons that drain the resources of the employers and 
employees who fund the program.
<P>
	The day the Minister of Human Resources Development 
unveiled his long awaited proposal for reforming the 
unemployment insurance program, Statistics Canada reported that 
full time employment fell by 64,000. In reply to my colleague 
opposite who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="611"> 611 </A></B>
<P>
says that government creates jobs, this shows exactly the converse. 
The number of people with jobs dropped by 44,000 to 13.5 million 
in November. This is the worst monthly performance in more than 
three years. The  proportion of young people in the labour force is 
at a 20-year low of 61 per cent.
<P>
	In answer to these problems and in an attempt to look like its 
two-year review is worthwhile, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development announced $800 million for training benefit 
programs and another $300 million for disadvantaged areas. One 
has to wonder if these new programs are nothing more than slush 
funds set up to provide temporary jobs just in time for a new 
election.
<P>
	The former Minister of Human Resources Development said that 
the jobs fund could be used to support local infrastructure projects. 
Does this mean that there may be more make-work programs and 
expensive projects for seasonal exploits like perhaps bike paths or 
exclusive boxes in sports stadiums or perhaps a canoe museum?
<P>
	The government brags about replacing 39 centrally controlled 
programs with five benefits. What it really did was camouflage old 
ideas into a new package. Shades of the GST, more renaming and 
more repackaging.
<P>
	When I asked the Minister of Human Resources Development in 
December about changes to the delivery of training programs, he 
said that we really should be transferring resources to the people, to 
the private sector, to communities. I would like to know why the 
government does not transfer labour market training exclusively to 
the private sector where the marketplace can create real jobs and 
that way Canadians can look forward to training that is specific to 
the economy and the jobs that they may be entering.
<P>
	How does the minister reconcile his department's continued 
involvement in training programs when the Prime Minister 
announced that labour market training would be the sole 
responsibility of the provinces? The provinces will have to enter 
into agreements with the federal government on programs and their 
delivery and if they do not sign a deal with Ottawa no federal 
training money will be spent there. Instead the money will be 
earmarked for other programs for the province in question.
<P>
	This is an arcane idea that somehow the government believes 
that it can keep provinces in line by manipulating the purse strings.
<P>
	When the Liberals last revamped unemployment insurance in 
1971 it was a tool to redistribute income on both class and regional 
lines. This time is has brought in a $3 million job fund designed to 
create new permanent jobs in disadvantaged areas.
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	What it really amounts to is a pay off to Atlantic Canada 
premiers so they will not complain about being short changed by 
not receiving complete control over training programs.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mississauga West complained that Ontario 
was tired of supporting less prosperous provinces. In that case she 
should support the Reform plan to turn UI into a true insurance 
plan.
<P>
	Bill C-12 will generate huge tax revenues of over $1 billion but it 
will increase business costs and it will kill off the creation of part 
time jobs. The government is still trying to make it look as though 
it is fulfilling its red book promises of jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	When will the government realize governments do not create 
jobs, governments are good at creating debt and that taxation is the 
killer of jobs? It will be about the time that hell freezes over and 
Satan learns how to play hockey.
<P>
	The 7 per cent payroll tax on part time workers will be used to 
fund the $800 million of employment benefits. It did not take the 
private sector long to figure out that it was to bear the brunt of yet 
another tax grab. As it stands, the provisions of the legislation will 
have a detrimental effect on both part time employers and their 
employees.
<P>
	Take for example the fast food industry. An owner-operator of a 
quick service restaurant in my constituency told me his costs would 
increase by 30 per cent if Bill C-12 is passed into law. He employs 
90 people, many of whom are students working to defray university 
tuition costs. He says his customers are very price sensitive. In 
other words, he is unable to raise his prices. He will have no choice 
but to cut back on employee hours and reduce the number of new 
people he hires in his business. Taxation kills jobs. He went on to 
say that implementing the payroll tax would run counter to the 
government's job creation objective.
<P>
	As I said earlier, the real killer of jobs is high taxation. Small 
business people realize it, students are coming to grips with it and 
soon Canadian voters will tell the Liberals they have had enough 
taxation.
<P>
	Incredibly generous benefits introduced by a former Liberal 
minister were left basically unchanged until the mid-eighties when 
attempts to tighten the system were met with cries from the left and 
social activists. The Tories backed away from the far reaching 
reforms which were required, reforms which should have taken 
place at that time.
<P>
	Now as a result of procrastination by governments for 20 years 
we have a Liberal government saddled with a $579 billion debt, a 
debt which will have grown by $100 billion after three years of this 
Liberal government. It still has a social conscience that it finds 
extremely difficult to finance.
<P>
	There is the old saying that if something is not broken do not fix 
it. However, the employment program is broken beyond repair. 
When that happens we have to park it and start over. The 
government only has one option: scrap it. I mean really do away 
with it. It should  not harmonize it and it should not change its 
name. It should replace it with a new system that provides 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="612"> 612 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians with a true insurance plan to protect them in times of 
temporary job loss.
<P>
	The amendment put forward by my colleague from Calgary 
Southeast should be supported by all members of the House if they 
have the best interests of Canadians in mind.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
attentively to the hon. member's dissertation.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	I heard him say scrap the UI bill. I heard him say scrap the GST. I 
wonder what else he wants to scrap around here. I do not here much 
about responsibility of the Reform Party. I do not hear it saying for 
$15 billion with GST revenue where that money is to come from; 
`poof' out of the air I suppose.
<P>
	The bottom line says harmonize and make it fairer for small and 
medium size businesses. I travelled on the committee across the 
country and that is what people in Alberta, Saskatchewan and in the 
maritimes told us. That is what we will do as a government.
<P>
	The hon. member remarkably starts talking about UI and how 
people are looking for jobs more and more everyday neglecting 
that this economy is creating jobs as we are talking here today. The 
reason why there are more people looking for jobs today is what is 
called labour force participation rate. It means as one person gets a 
job there is a second person who has given up looking up for a job 
two years ago and suddenly decides they want a job too and then 
joins the labour force and starts looking for a job. That is good. 
That is positive.
<P>
	People are saying there are jobs being created and I will go out 
an look for one. That is positive. That is not negative.
<P>
	We talk about the cost of small and medium size business. The 
government reduced the unemployment insurance rate from $3 per 
$100 to $2.95 per $100. That is good. That is positive. That reduced 
small and medium size business costs and is employing people. Let 
them increase their employment.
<P>
	The hon. member talks somebody in his constituency who will 
end up paying more UI, and that may well be if he is hiring 
students. What he neglects to mention are the people working in 
part time employment, possibly less than 15 hours a week, who 
never could access the system before. He is saying it is quite all 
right that those people cannot access the unemployment insurance 
system. He thinks it is fine that because they chose part time work 
they have to pay benefits but have no way of receiving them. He 
thinks that is a fine situation.
<P>
	The bottom line is this legislation attempts to make a connection 
between getting people back to work. It gives them an incentive to 
find work. It even gives them  incentives to get a lower paying job 
if they have to do that. It provides a top-up credit to them to access 
new employment to get people back to work. That is not something 
you scrap, that is something you applaud. I wonder if the speaker 
could address some of these issues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be delighted to reply to my 
hon. colleague.
<P>
	He asks me how I will come up with the $16 billion the GST 
generates. It was the Liberal Party that went door to door in 
October 1993 and said it will scrap it, abolish it, throw it away.
<P>
	The question should be asked of the Prime Minister and 
particularly the Deputy Prime Minister how they will come up with 
the $16 billion. It is not my question to answer.
<P>
	The hon. member makes the point of the five-cent reduction in 
premiums. That is five cents, one-twentieth of 1 per cent; five cents 
on every $100 of earned income. We were told this huge reduction, 
five cents on $100, will produce 25,000 jobs. That must be the new 
math, the Liberal math perhaps.
<P>
	Following that reasoning, why do we not bring down the 
premium a full percentage point and create half a million jobs? We 
could reduce it 2 per cent, 3 per cent. We would have to import 
people to fill all the jobs in this country if we followed the 
reasoning of the members opposite.
<P>
	The member opposite says we can create jobs, and maybe we 
can. Private industry can create jobs, private enterprise can. I do 
not believe for one minute that governments can create jobs. Every 
government over the last 25 years has said it would create jobs and 
that it is capable of creating jobs. If this is true we should all be 
working at two or three jobs.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	I think the problem is being attacked from the wrong end. If we 
did not have to pay $48 billion in interest to the international 
bankers every 12 months, $4 billion a month in interest, we would 
be able to fund social programs, unemployment insurance and 
medicare to the fullest extent. If the government had followed the 
Reform plan it would be sitting over there debating what it would 
do with the surplus next year and not about how it is saddled with 
all this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, under the EI 
changes and the family supplement some 350,000 claimants and 
low income families will be guaranteed a supplement. That works 
out that all claimants and low income families with children will 
average 7 per cent more in benefits.
<P>
	I ask the member if he thinks that is a bad thing for low income 
Canadians and whether his party agrees that is a necessary step 
under these legislative changes. Does  he think we should scrap that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="613"> 613 </A></B>
<P>
as well and leave low income Canadians to drift in the wind, as 
some of the issues he put forward today suggest?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Mr. Speaker, let me clarify one thing. I did not 
suggest for one minute that we should let anything, to use the hon. 
member's words, drift in the wind.
<P>
	I am suggesting that whether a low or a medium income earner 
or wherever one may be in the earning ability we would all benefit 
if we could lift this millstone of debt off our necks. This is 
something the Liberal Party has not address. If it really wanted to 
do something, not simply for low income earners but for every 
resident, it would get control of the debt and start living within its 
means and cut those interest payments down. The money that 
would be saved could be put to all kinds of wonderful uses.

Mont-Laurier-Sainte-Marie has the floor on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie, Mr. Speaker, not Mont-Laurier. I would be 
pleased if it were the case, it would be very nice, but I am not that 
much of an expansionist.
<P>
	Today, we held up the proceeedings of the House because of a 
motion brought forward by the Reform Party. I ask for the 
unanimous consent of the House to continue with the debate on the 
official opposition's motion until 8 p.m. at the latest, on the 
understanding that the question be deemed to have been put at 6.15 
p.m., as stated on the Order Paper, and the recorded division 
deferred until tomorrow, at the end of the sitting.
<P>
	I consulted with the Liberal Party, which agrees with this 
proposal. I did not have time to consult our colleagues from the 
Reform Party. There would be no delaying motion. This would 
simply give members who wish to speak to the official opposition's 
motion the possibility to do so.
<P>
	I ask for unanimous consent of the House on this proposal.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have no objection. We are prepared to give unanimous 
consent, as the opposition House leader said, that the debate not go 
any later than at 8 p.m., with no calling of quorum or presenting of 
delaying motions, and that the question be deemed to have been put 
and the recorded division deferred until tomorrow, at 6.30 p.m.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I could have the assurance there 
would be no votes or quorum calls I would have no objection to the 
debate being extended until 8 p.m.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie gave his assurance there would be no 
quorum calls, no dilatory motions and that the vote would be 
deferred until tomorrow at 6.30 p.m.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	Just to wrap this business up, the debate on the official 
opposition motion today is being extended no later than 8 p.m. with 
no quorum calls or dilatory motions. The question will be put and 
the vote deferred until tomorrow at the time of adjournment at 6.30 
p.m. Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore today.
<P>
	It gives me great pleasure to speak to the employment insurance 
reforms in the legislation that has been put forward by the Minister 
of Human Resource Development. This legislation is appropriate 
and is an improvement over the system currently in place. This 
legislation deserves the support of the House.
<P>
	I will deal with some general principles upon which I believe the 
legislation has been formulated. These principles are worth 
enunciating in the House to make it clear exactly what it is the 
government is trying to accomplish.
<P>
	The first principle is a recognition that the best social program 
one can have is a job. Beyond all else that is the best way of 
securing one's financial future and is the best social program that 
can possibly exist.
<P>
	The second principle is that as a government and as individuals 
here in Parliament, we need to create an environment in the private 
sector that allows business in general and small business in 
particular to create jobs.
<P>
	The third principle is we need to design programs which 
encourage rather than discourage people to work.
<P>
	The fourth principle, and one the government has demonstrated 
over and over again on the various pieces of legislation it has 
brought forward, is that the benefits should be directed to those 
who are most in need. That is an appropriate principle to build 
reform on.
<P>
	The fifth principle is we must recognize that the deficit we have 
as a government and a nation is too high. It simply is not 
sustainable in the long run.
<P>
	Those are principles our government has looked at in 
formulating not only this legislation but many other pieces of 
legislation. They are good principles and ones that definitely need 
to be followed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="614"> 614 </A></B>
<P>
	All members in this House should recognize as I certainly do 
that an employment insurance system has to be more than an 
income support program. One of the members from the third party 
who spoke in the House said it should be a stop gap measure or 
a temporary income support for times of difficulty.
<P>
	That might have been an appropriate approach 30 or 40 years 
ago. Back then most unemployment was of a very temporary nature 
and individuals who lost their jobs would be re-employed in a 
number of weeks or months down the road when the supply and 
demand equalized out. That is not the case today. Today many 
people who are unemployed find themselves in that position not 
because there has been a temporary lack of demand for a product or 
service but because their jobs have permanently disappeared.
<P>
	It is important when designing a program that it have more than 
the income support component. It must have a job creation 
component. It must help individuals become re-employed. They 
must be able to develop new skills and find new jobs so they can 
re-enter the workforce. It is not appropriate to simply concentrate 
on income support alone in today's environment.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	The EI program is certainly one that helps in the area of job 
creation. It does it in three ways. First, it does it through a series of 
employment tools. The minister announced the employment tools 
which go along with the program. They will assist in the area of job 
creation. Second, contrary to what the hon. member from the third 
party mentioned in debate, this EI program is going to help small 
business create jobs. Third, the EI program will provide incentives 
that will lead to increased employment.
<P>
	This reform is calling for an additional $800 million in revenue 
for employment tools. That is on top of the $1.9 billion which is 
already being spent in that area. A significant amount of new 
money will be spent on employment tools. These tools are more 
than just handing out a dollar to someone hoping they have a 
temporary job for a while and then when it is gone it is not to be 
seen again. These tools are designed to help people obtain long 
term employment and to create sustainable economies in the areas 
in which they work.
<P>
	Many of my colleagues have gone into some detail on these but I 
will enunciate them here. There are wage subsidies and earning 
supplements. The self-employment initiative is one that is already 
in place but which is going to be expanded. It is one I personally 
believe in. It assists unemployed individuals and provides them 
with the tools to start their own businesses which not only will 
employ themselves but possibly will employ others.
<P>
	There are job creation partnerships which provide valuable job 
experience for the individual. At the same time they work on 
creating infrastructure that leads to  permanent jobs. There is going 
to be some specific assistance to areas of high unemployment as 
well. The employment tools are an important step toward 
increasing job creation.
<P>
	There is assistance to small business. I want to correct an 
impression that might have been left by my colleague from the 
third party when he suggested that small businesses do not like this 
reform. I had an opportunity to read the latest bulletin put out by 
the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, a very well 
respected business organization. It terms the employment 
insurance program as a hard won victory for small business.
<P>
	To suggest that small business is opposed to this reform is 
inappropriate. Small business is in support of this reform because it 
does reduce payroll taxes not only in terms of the rate but in terms 
of the maximum insurable earnings. More important, it provides a 
simplified system for small businesses to keep track of their 
employees' records of employment.
<P>
	Too often small business people spend so much of their time 
dealing with paperwork and basically trying to adhere to 
government regulations that they are taken away from doing what 
they do best which is running their small businesses, creating 
wealth and creating jobs. I am not going to deny that there are some 
businesses that might face increased costs through this program. 
They will receive rebates from the government in order to ease the 
transition if they are faced with higher costs.
<P>
	We have talked about some incentives to help individuals. 
Obviously the way the program is designed now, the more they 
work the more their benefits are. They can earn up to 25 per cent 
while staying in the system. Lower income Canadians will be 
eligible for enhanced benefits. It is also important to point out that 
500,000 part time workers who were not eligible for UI under the 
existing program are going to be eligible. That is an important 
reform.
<P>
	In wrapping up I want to refer to something which occurred in 
question period yesterday. It had to do with the exchange which 
took place between the hon. member for Mercier and the human 
resources minister. It dealt with the issue of how we were coming 
along with EI reform. The hon. Bloc member suggested that the 
minister could not seriously be looking at changing things because 
we did not see any more money in the budget.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	I know the hon. member cares deeply and is committed to this 
process. However what that showed was a mindset from back in the 
1970s and 1960s where something was fixed simply by throwing 
money at it. That is not necessarily the way to deal with things. 
Things are fixed by creating something better by being innovative 
in the approach. Simply throwing money at a problem is no 
guarantee that it is going to be fixed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="615"> 615 </A></B>
<P>
	It spoke volumes for the perspective being presented that an 
absolute relationship was trying to be made that if we do not spend 
more money then we cannot be doing something positive. That 
is not a legitimate way of looking at it. This reform shows that 
through innovation and a new approach we can accomplish 
something positive and something that works well.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
for Parry Sound-Muskoka says that the principle, the main goal of 
this reform is to encourage people to work. But where are the jobs? 
Could he tell us where to find them? I do not know where the 
Liberal government is heading with this reform. It is doing things 
event the Tories did not dare doing. As far as I am concerned, this is 
tantamount to aggression. It is a frontal attack against workers, the 
unemployed and labour.
<P>
	Earlier this afternoon, during question period, I was deeply 
distressed when the Minister of Human Resources Development 
viciously attacked labour leaders, especially Bob White, the CLC 
president.
<P>
	I come from organized labour and I am proud of it. I know Mr. 
White, he is a dedicated labour advocate. He has served Canadian 
workers well. Internationally, he was the head of the Canadian 
Auto Workers Union for years. He has lead historical battles on 
behalf of auto workers.
<P>
	I ask the member where is the government headed with this 
reform? Why make cuts? What is the logic of cutting 
unemployment insurance benefits when the fund has a surplus? 
What is the logic of cutting benefits the government is not funding? 
Where is the logic in all that? Answer me, please.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, if we want to talk about logic to 
suggest that you have a program that simply provides income 
support and does not provide tools to help create employment, that 
is an illogical argument.
<P>
	To answer a specific question about jobs that the hon. member 
asked, let me tell him about jobs. Let me tell this House about jobs. 
There have been 650,000 jobs created in this country since this 
government came to power. That is an answer about jobs. We can 
talk about the 150,000 new jobs that Statistics Canada just reported 
which have been created in this economy in the last three years.
<P>
	We could talk about what our government has done to ensure that 
the fundamentals of our economy are right so that job creation can 
occur. Perhaps we want to talk about the fact that inflation is at its 
lowest sustained level in 30 years and we want to talk about that.
<P>
	We could talk about the fact that interest rates in this country 
have come down by 3 percentage points in the last year and that 
this is stimulating job growth. I think we want to talk about that 
fundamental.
<P>
	We can talk about the fundamental that the borrowings the 
federal government is having to make is going to drop to $13 
billion this year, $6 billion next year. The best of the G-7 nations. 
We are not crowding out the private sector any longer so they are 
able to have the necessary moneys to invest in new jobs.
<P>
	What we have is inflation down, interest down, government 
borrowings down and job creation up. That is what we are talking 
about with jobs.
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to join with my colleagues in this debate and 
to address one aspect of the discussion that came from the 
opposition which spoke to the fact that women would be 
disadvantaged by this reform.
<P>
	The changes to UI will benefit women. The changes to UI and 
the arguments that are made on the other side are far from the truth. 
The new system is designed to smooth out inequities. It is much 
more inclusive than the old one. The whole idea is to make the 
system more relevant to today's workplace, to extend the coverage 
to more people and to shift the emphasis toward employment.
<P>
	The EI system will mean that all part time work will be 
insurable. Women represent 70 per cent of part time workers. In 
fact, 270,000 women in part time jobs will have their work insured 
for the first time.
<P>
	Under current UI rules there is a so-called ceiling of 15-hour 
weeks that affects many part time workers and therefore many 
Canadian women. To avoid paying premiums employers restrict 
them to less than 15 hours of work a week. I think most of us know 
that story. However, with employment insurance premiums will be 
paid on the first dollar earned, enabling individuals to ensure much 
more of their work and encouraging employers to provide 
additional hours of work for part time workers.
<P>
	In addition, the eligibility and the duration of benefits will be 
based on all the hours a person has worked in the past 12 months. 
This simple change may encourage employers to offer part time 
employees more work and encourage individuals to accept more 
part time work because it is now insurable. It also means that many 
women will be eligible for benefits for the first time.
<P>
	Women currently make up about 70 per cent of Canada's part 
time workforce. By insuring all part time work, 270,000 more 
women will now have their work insured. In addition 700,000 
women with very low earnings will receive a full premium refund.
<P>
	Many women hold down more than one part time job trying to 
make ends meet. Most of these multiple job holders currently do 
not qualify for UI and often only some or even none of their work is 
insurable. Under this new system every hour worked counts. Again 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="616"> 616 </A></B>
<P>
many of  these multiple job holders will be eligible for insurance 
benefits for the first time. Maternity and parental benefits will 
continue to be a fundamental support for women and families.
<P>
	One of the overriding features of these reforms is that they are 
fair and balanced. Employment insurance is designed to strengthen 
the social safety net, to provide added security for those who need 
it most, among them women in low income families and single 
mothers.
<P>
	Benefits for single parents and low income families with 
children will actually increase thanks to an innovative family 
supplement to top up their benefits. Single parents, most of whom 
are women, will receive an average 10 per cent more than they 
currently do in benefits. Overall, claimants in low income families 
with children will receive about 7 per cent more in benefits.
<P>
	The new rules mean that low income women will be able to 
increase their weekly income while claiming benefits. Changes 
brought about by this bill mean that Canadians, both men and 
women, will be able to earn up to $50 a week without having their 
benefits reduced.
<P>
	A general analysis shows that employment insurance measures 
will have a positive effect on many women, particularly those in 
low income families. With employment insurance what counts are 
results, getting unemployed Canadians back to work as quickly as 
possible. Perhaps the best new measure for women are five basic 
employment benefits. My friend who spoke earlier mentioned 
those employment benefits, measures that have been tested for 
results.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	One cornerstone of the reform is to move from a passive to an 
active approach to re-employment by investing $800 million of the 
savings in employment benefits. These innovative employment 
benefits will provide women with opportunities to establish 
themselves in today's workplace, that will help them increase their 
earnings and most important, that will help them build a bridge 
back to employment.
<P>
	Access to these measures will be extended to anyone who has 
had a claim for insurable benefits in the past three years and to 
those who received maternity or parental benefits in the past five 
years. Women re-entering the workforce after caring for their 
children can use employment benefits to make the transition to 
work. For example, wage subsidies to employers can help level the 
playing field for people facing disadvantages in the workplace, like 
women.
<P>
	Studies show this approach works. It can mean an increase of 
$5,000 a year on average in earnings. Income supplements will 
increase the incomes of people who might be reluctant to take 
lower paying jobs. These projects help unemployed single parents 
get back on their feet and gain new experience.
<P>
	I can quote stories of individuals who over the many years have 
worked at low paying, temporary and part time jobs. For them it 
has been a struggle. They can take advantage of some of the new 
initiatives to do well for themselves.
<P>
	I can boast of a Toronto woman who took advantage of a federal 
program to help budding entrepreneurs create their own future. 
After losing her job as a psychotherapist, Sheena Singh used her 
own funds and talent to create a multicultural calendar promoting 
greater understanding between different cultures and ethnic groups.
<P>
	With self-employment assistance she turned her calendar into a 
full fledged business. Sheena's calendar is now sold across Canada 
and her orders have doubled for the coming year. She tells us: ``My 
ultimate goal is to have one of these calendars in every home in 
Canada and the United States''.
<P>
	The self-employment assistance program has already helped 
more than 34,000 Canadians start their own businesses, injecting 
about $188 million into the economy. Not only will EI enhance 
opportunities for women but it will also create work. EI reforms are 
expected to generate between 100,000 and 150,000 new jobs.
<P>
	Fairness and opportunities for women have been improved by 
strengthening employment equity legislation. Women are being 
helped to break through the barriers into non-traditional jobs. One 
and a half million dollars will be contributed over three years to a 
project to help female youth find work in trades, technology and 
the so-called blue collar jobs. At the same time a new national 
employment service will tell women where the jobs are. Across 
Canada job centres, self-serve computer kiosks will help match 
unemployed women with suitable job openings.
<P>
	Canadians want to work and they have told us that they want a 
system that makes work pay. A government cheque every two 
weeks is not enough for many Canadians. They are working hard to 
find new job opportunities and adjust to a changing economy. They 
want programs that get results.
<P>
	Employment insurance will get more unemployed women back 
into the workforce as quickly as possible and boost their earning 
power. That is why $300 million is being invested in a three-year 
transitional jobs fund, targeted at regions that suffer from high 
levels of unemployment. This fund will encourage partnerships 
between provinces, communities and business to create new 
sustainable jobs. Canadians have long held the idea of sharing the 
load, of helping each other through difficult times. It is 
fundamental to the vision that created this country. Employment 
insurance taps into the spirit of shared strength to help get more 
Canadians back to work.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The honourable Alfonso 
Gagliano, Minister of Labour and Deputy Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe that you will have 
unanimous consent for the House to proceed with the debate on the 
adjournment proceedings immediately after the speech of the 
member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, and afterwards to 
resume debate on the motion now before us, pursuant to an order of 
the House adopted earlier today.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
terms of the motion moved by the honourable Minister of Labour. 
Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Debate is resumed with 
question period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the speech from my colleague. 
She talked about the situation of women which, according to her, 
would be improved by the new system.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to answer the following question. 
For instance, in my riding, some women are finishing their degree 
in nursing or in recreation techniques. According to the 
information they received, with the unemployment insurance 
reform, when they enter the system they will have to work 910 
hours a year, which is the equivalent of 26 35-hour weeks, while 
previously, with the system currently in place, they were eligible 
for benefits after 20 weeks at a minimum of 15 hours a week, that is 
to say after 300 hours.
<P>
	Could the hon. member explain to me what is the advantage for 
women, and for men, when anyone entering the labour force goes 
from a system requiring 300 hours of work to be eligible for 
benefits to a system requiring 910 hours? If we had applied the 
same rules as before we would have said: ``Now we require the 
equivalent of 20 weeks of 35 hours'' and we would have talked 
about 700 hours. Young people looking at these figures get the 
feeling that they are being taken for a ride. They are required to 
work even longer than the 20 weeks required before. They will 
have to work 910 hours.
<P>
	Are we not encouraging the underground economy? The young 
worker who has tried to work 910 hours during a given year and 
realizes at the end of the year that he or she cannot reach that 
number, especially if he or she works in an area of seasonal 
employment, will be  simply encouraged to work underground and 
offer employers to work outside the rules, because the rules are 
neither acceptable nor viable for that person?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are starting the whole process 
of debate on the bill, which the hon. member has been working on 
in committee.
<P>
	I want to focus on the fact that women's groups and others who 
have looked at the draft legislation have all commented on the 
positive aspects of the bill.
<P>
	To ask me in one minute or so to define the finer points of the bill 
is not giving due consideration to the fact that the House is 
spending time on the details of the bill. However, it is important to 
note that groups such as the New Brunswick Advisory Council and 
others across the country support the move from weeks to hours.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in the debate today 
because, it is worth repeating, the opposition motion asks that this 
House require the Minister of Human Resources Development to 
withdraw Bill C-12, an Act respecting employment insurance in 
Canada, from the Order Paper immediately and go back to the 
drawing board, since this reform hits young people, women, 
seasonal workers and immigrants hard.
<P>
	What is the first question we can ask ourselves? Why is the 
opposition asking the government to withdraw the bill as a whole?
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	Could we not be satisfied with some cosmetic changes? The first 
reason is that there is an error in the title of the act. They speak 
about employment insurance, although nowhere in the program is 
there an active employment policy which would guarantee to 
people who are losing their job that they will be able to find another 
one. The objective of this program is absolutely not to guarantee a 
job to people. It is to define the rules under which they will be 
entitled to unemployment insurance benefits.
<P>
	So, right at that moment, the government made the choice of 
saying: ``We will use a popular term that responds to the concerns 
of the people, to the fact that they want jobs, but basically, the 
contents of the bill will not reflect the reality.'' Right there I think 
the bill is unacceptable.
<P>
	Another reason why it seems important to us that the minister 
withdraws his bill is that it was said everywhere that people who 
were complaining about the bill were professional agitators, people 
who were doing that professionally. I can tell you that the people 
that I met in public meetings in Trois-Rivières, Saint-Pascal, 
Rivière-du-Loup, Pohénégamook, almost 1,000 people who came 
throughout the day during the protest, were not professional 
agitators.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="618"> 618 </A></B>
<P>
	They are people who were asking questions because, for the last 
5, 10 or 20 years, they have been working in a region with a 
seasonal industry where they must sacrifice their lives to manage 
to get by. In Trois-Pistoles, it was not the president of a national 
labour body who was asking questions. It was young people who 
asked me: ``How is the 900- hour thing going to work? Does it 
mean that, in order to qualify for UI, someone who lives in 
Trois-Pistoles and has managed to work 300 or 400 hours in his 
region in the summer will have to move to Montreal to work the 
rest and chase hours of work everywhere, so that he will no longer 
want to live in his home town?''
<P>
	By its action, the government wants somewhat to ensure that the 
market will empty the regions. People are aware of that. It is not a 
sociologist or someone with a very theoretical approach who came 
to talk to us about that. It is people who feel it in their daily lives; 
they want to stay in their own environments and they find this 
unacceptable.
<P>
	The people in Saint-Pascal mostly talked to me about benefit 
calculation, which is arousing a great deal of anger. People must 
understand what this means. In the future, someone filing UI 
claims year after year will need 420 hours of work to qualify for 
benefits. He may have worked 42 hours a week for 10 weeks for a 
total of 420 hours. However, starting in January 1997, benefits will 
be calculated by dividing the total not by 10, the actual number of 
weeks of work, but by 16.
<P>
	You can imagine what that does to benefits. This cut is totally 
unacceptable. For example, a salary of $400 a week divided by 16 
weeks will result in an average benefit of $250. And, after a few 
years, the benefits of seasonal workers will be slashed by 50 per 
cent. This means that some people will go from a $400 weekly 
salary to a UI benefit of $125 a week. I do not know if you can 
imagine the consequences. This is less than welfare.
<P>
	The proposed reform would systematically impoverish people. 
These people are wondering: ``If they are doing this and if we are 
really in a difficult financial situation, we might be willing to do 
our share. But are others doing their share?'' Yet, they hear about 
the tremendous increase in the banks' after-tax profits. They also 
hear that the UI fund is probably not in such bad shape, since it runs 
an annual surplus of $5 billion, which now comes from the pockets 
of employers and employees.
<P>
	As for the surplus at the end of the year, insurance plan managers 
normally look at annual costs and see if rebates could be given to 
policy holders. They look for ways to humanize the system. In the 
case of a dental plan, for example, managers see if additional 
services can be provided. Not so in this case. Instead of looking at 
the UI system to find ways of helping people in difficult situations, 
the government has decided to use the surplus as evidence that it 
has succeeded in reducing the deficit.
<P>
	It is in fact a hidden tax, and this is the negative side of this 
reform. The members across the way often claim that people want a 
reform.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	When asked in a survey if they are for employment insurance 
reform, people are likely to say yes. But ask them, for instance, 
what they think about the current situation, and they will tell you 
that, right across eastern Quebec and the Maritimes, everyone 
agrees that, if the government keeps it up, it will have hell to pay.
<P>
	This should have happened only after the next elections, and 
everyone will have been penalized by then, but now there is a 
chance that the government might withdraw the bill. Luckily, we 
have a new minister. He could take the time, as suggested in our 
motion, to go back to the drawing board and see if it would not be 
possible to go about it differently, so that the public can see that a 
real effort is being made to create jobs.
<P>
	To ask regions that depend on seasonal industries to tighten their 
belts, so to speak, with measures such as these, while at the same 
time not providing any government support to help these regions 
diversify their economies is to penalize the workers, who are the 
producers in these regions and whose products often benefit larger 
centres, among others. This is therefore an unacceptable reform, 
and it appears essential to us that it be amended.
<P>
	The reform, as it stands, is also disrespectful. In Pohenegamook, 
what was on the minds of the people there, was the fate of forestry 
workers. They asked me: ``What is going to happen to us? We are 
jobbers, contract workers. Our job is to cut trees in a certain area. 
Also, the number of weeks is calculated differently.'' In the context 
of this reform, no one has been able so far to respond to these 
people. No one has been able to tell them what their coverage will 
be starting next summer. This is unacceptable to me.
<P>
	I think that the government make a major mistake when, last 
December, it decided to skip the second reading debate through 
some procedural device. The bill was then referred to committee, at 
which stage we will hear the testimony of experts and look at what 
amendments could be made, but the merits of the issue were never 
debated. This is why the official opposition must spend the whole 
day on this issue today, because there has been no debate in the 
House, and we could not deliver the message we have received 
since December, when the terms were made public, indicating that 
Canadians were terribly disappointed with the reform being 
proposed to them.
<P>
	The hon. members from the Maritimes are certainly asking the 
same questions as we are. Let us hope that they will carry enough 
weight in the government to have it drastically change its reform. 
More than two or three minor changes are needed here. Canadians 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="619"> 619 </A></B>
<P>
want the  reform to be replaced with an approach which is really 
focused on productivity, on the realization that, even in times of 
economic growth like today, even when government members are 
right in saying that 100 000 jobs have been created in Canada, the 
fact is that these jobs still exclude many people, either because they 
are young and just entering the labour market or because they are 
45 or 50 years old and losing their jobs due to the implementation 
of new technologies.
<P>
	The government must not only ensure that these people are still 
able to feed themselves, but it must also see that they are retrained, 
that an active employment policy is in place, and that productivity 
gains are being redistributed among workers, so that they can be 
proud to produce interesting things. So, what would a constructive 
employment policy include? After all, opposition members are 
often told: ``You criticize a lot, but what would you suggest to 
improve the situation?''
<P>
	The first thing that we should do is to remove the obligation for 
employees to work overtime. That should immediately become a 
social value. The government should say: ``Our priority is to bring 
the unemployment rate down to 6 or 8 per cent today''. We are told 
that the deficit should not exceed 3 per cent of the GDP. I challenge 
the government to set similar goals regarding employment and to 
act on them.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	The government must realize that, in two or three years, its 
performance will be evaluated not only in terms of productivity, 
but also in terms of how it made sure that every working-age 
person living in Quebec and in Canada has a chance to work and to 
support his or her family on the territory where that person lives.
<P>
	There are ways to achieve that. For example, we could make 
good use of the productivity gains made through the use of new 
computer technologies. Someone, somewhere is making additional 
profits. Some of these profits are made by banks.
<P>
	Why are there no measures to ensure a constructive employment 
policy? Thus, if banks want to keep the savings they made through 
technological change, they would have to use it for job creation, 
but not necessarily in their area of activity. Why not require them to 
make a social contribution allowing for bank profits to be used to 
create jobs for people taking care of seniors at home?
<P>
	The issue requires innovative solutions, but there are none in the 
present government proposals. The budget speech only provided 
for a technical committee on taxation, something that will have 
effects after a year or two whereas the problem is today.
<P>
	I will give another example. Officials in the public and 
quasi-public sectors could be encouraged to facilitate work time 
reduction. Has there been any action in that regard as part of a full 
action plan or a concerted action plan by the government? We 
could remove the right for  retired government employees to work 
for the government while receiving retirement benefits. There are 
many such situations in the public service at present. I am sure the 
national capital area, the Ottawa area, would benefit a lot from that.
<P>
	Young people graduating from the CEGEP de l'Outaouais and 
young people already on the labour market could be very 
productive, and that would be very beneficial to society.
<P>
	I want to raise another issue. It may look a little farfetched, but it 
is important to me. Why not start taxing robots? Why not tax what 
is bringing about job reduction for workers who lack specialized 
training? Why should we praise a business that is introducing new 
technologies while laying off workers without seeing to it that 
those people can find another occupation? Some measures should 
be put forward in that area, but they are nowhere to be found in the 
government proposals.
<P>
	For the government, reform means cutting. We think the goal of 
reform should be to improve the lives of those who cannot find a 
job, and try to give them more opportunities to get back in the 
system and find a new job as quickly as possible, and not put them 
in a position where they periodically have to go back on welfare.
<P>
	When a young student who has just finished school gets the 
message that he has to work 910 hours in the coming year, he might 
as well tell his employers that he will join the underground 
economy and that he will manage better that way. When our society 
sends out a message like that, you cannot claim to have done what 
you were elected for. Remember your slogan was ``jobs, jobs, 
jobs''.
<P>
	If the Conservatives had been elected to form a new government, 
given the platform they ran on, they would do just like the Liberals, 
and we could always say that they are simply carrying out the 
program they were elected on, and that we have to live with that 
and try to manage as best we can. But we are now faced with a clear 
case of false representation. We have been told that the government 
would create jobs, but it is just riding the wave of economic 
growth, a growth that does not necessarily create jobs. The 
government will even do worse than that: with the reform fully in 
force, it will rake in $2 billion more, at the expense of those who 
fund the system.
<P>
	That is quite something. Our system is funded by the employers 
and the employees, but they have no control over its operation. 
They are not the ones who decide how it should develop. Instead of 
having a $5 billion surplus in the unemployment insurance fund, 
would it not be possible to reduce that surplus to $3 billion and to 
inject the remaining $2 billion in the economy by lowering the 
contribution paid by the employees and the employers?
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="620"> 620 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	Since we are continually reminded that job creation is best left to 
the private sector, would it not have been a good way to ensure that 
jobs are created? Why insist on creating this situation? Well, part of 
the answer resides in the constitutional dossier. In the last few 
years, the federal government has had little money to spend on 
areas of provincial jurisdiction. So, with the surplus in the 
unemployment insurance fund, the government has found a way to 
continue to interfere in the area of manpower training. With the 
surplus it has set aside for itself, it will be able to spend and to say 
to the community organizations and to everyone who wants to get 
some training: ``We have the money, so we get to set the standards. 
In fact, we think we should become the Canadian Department of 
Education.''
<P>
	This is basically why the government has planned a surplus in 
the unemployment insurance fund, but it also wanted to use the 
money to hide the fact that it has not reduced its expenditures in 
order to fight the deficit. No, instead it is maintaining its 
expenditures at their current level and ensuring that the top civil 
servants, with their vision which dates back to the seventies, can 
keep carrying out their activities, thanks to a hidden tax known as 
the unemployment insurance fund.
<P>
	This is why the workers, the young people, the women, the 
seasonal workers and the immigrants have told us and keep telling 
us day in and day out that this reform is unacceptable and has to be 
withdrawn by the government. If not, we have to ensure that 
several major changes are put forward.
<P>
	In conclusion, let me summarize their arguments. They say that 
the 910 hours expected from the young people and the required 
hours of work in the future are totally unacceptable, as is the 
penalty for seasonal workers. A lot of things like that are brought to 
our attention, but, in fact, the real problem is that this reform is 
based on principles which are, in themselves, unacceptable. Under 
these circumstances, the government now has a very courageous 
decision to make. It must acknowledge that this reform proposal, 
which was developed by top federal civil servants, is not what 
Quebecers and Canadians want. Today, the Official Opposition has 
made that message even clearer and I think the government will 
have to take responsibility if it does not come to the same 
conclusion as the opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want to congratulate my colleague for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup for his presentation. He 
demonstrated the weaknesses of the UI ``reform'' plan in such an 
eloquent manner that government members had to blush, if Liberal 
members can blush at all.
<P>
	In the few moments at my disposal, I would like to make some 
comments about the government's attitude regarding this reform 
and especially that of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	Twice today the minister showed quite well how he feels about 
this reform. First, when he took part in the debate, this morning, he 
offered his philosophy on the reform, which can be summarized 
this way: ``Finally, yes, this bill must be improved upon; so, if 
someone has suggestions to this end, they should make them.'' As 
if, as Minister of Human Resources Development, he was not 
responsible for this issue and did not himself have to propose 
amendments to the bill.
<P>
	He also said during his presentation that, due to his long 
experience both at the provincial and federal levels of government, 
he was aware of the needs of the people. So, acting as a know-it-all, 
if I may say so, the minister tells us on the one hand that he is aware 
of the needs of the people and, on the other hand, that he wants us 
to come up with some good ideas, that he might take them into 
consideration.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	What is worse, though, is the attitude that the minister showed 
and reiterated during the question period, when the hon. member 
for Mercier reminded him of what he said only a few hours ago 
when he criticized the demonstrations being held and a union 
representative in particular. He named individuals, which is rather 
uncommon on the part of a minister, saying: ``These individuals 
who come from New Brunswick, from my own area, are 
troublemakers. They like to use their Sunday afternoon to create 
problems for the government. These people do not know what to do 
on Sunday afternoon, so they look for demonstrations to go to''. He 
added in the House: ``The President of the Canadian Labour 
Congress, Bob White, who earns more money than I, was also there 
as a political agitator. He is only interested in rousing the public 
against the government. He is not interested at all in helping 
ordinary folk.''
<P>
	If I had had the chance to ask him when he made that comment in 
the House, I would have asked the minister, who is an elected 
representative-just like Bob White is-whom he was speaking 
for. Was he speaking for the banks, which made exorbitantly high 
profits last year and will be making even higher profits in the 
coming year? Whom is the Minister of Human Resources 
Development talking for?
<P>
	We must ask that question because he is the one who will give its 
soul to that reform. If he is convinced that the UI beneficiaries, the 
people who protest against his so-called UI reform, are people who 
have nothing better to do on Sunday afternoon or who are loafers, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="621"> 621 </A></B>
<P>
do you really believe that his reform will benefit the workers? To 
ask the question is to answer it.
<P>
	People who listen to us, those who heard the minister will 
understand that this is a big joke, that the government's only 
objective is to claw back the money to reduce its deficit. There are 
very simple calculations to be made and I challenge the minister to 
prove that they are false. With the measures already taken in past 
years the government can cash every year a UI surplus of $5 billion 
to reduce its deficit, and we agree with that. But it takes that money 
directly in the pockets of the unemployed while, it is worth 
repeating, banks alone register profits exceeding $5 billion. What 
should be done to improve the UI reform? To ask the question is to 
answer it.
<P>
	Instead of criticizing the union leaders and the thousands of 
people in the Gaspé Peninsula, the Maritimes and all over Quebec 
and Ontario who demonstrated against his reform, I would prefer to 
see the minister restrain himself and propose amendments which 
would make the bill more acceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague made me think of 
something when he asked where the minister's position comes 
from. It is often said that the opposition criticizes for the sake of 
criticizing.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	When we look at the positions taken by some people, for 
example by the municipal council of Pohénégamook, a small town 
located in my riding, which says that it is fiercely opposed to this 
reform because it does not respect regional economies which are 
based on seasonal activities and because the 910 hour minimum 
requirement to be eligible for benefits is unrealistic, these 
judgments come from people with a lot of common sense.
<P>
	Several elements of this reform will result in a drastic reduction 
in regional economic activity. That is why such a solidarity has 
developed. Opposition to this reform does not come only from UI 
beneficiaries, but also from regional boards of trade, community 
groups and business people.
<P>
	Once the government cuts the money available in a particular 
region, this will result in significant job losses because when 
people have less money to buy cars or to pay the rent, when they 
have to move away, this has an impact on the economy of a region. 
If we want Canada and Quebec to be a fully developed country, 
these kinds of reforms have to be put aside because they are not in 
line with the vision we must have of what the development of a 
country like Quebec or Canada should be.
<P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GRAIN">GRAIN</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on February 
29, I raised a question directed to the new Minister of Transport. I 
pointed out that the grain shipment this year was the first when we 
had almost complete deregulation, and the use of two fully 
privatized railways has been abysmal.
<P>
	Grain movement in the previous crop year to mid-February was 
21.4 million tonnes. This year with the new system in place the 
railways have moved a mere 15.1 million tonnes.
<P>
	I asked the minister what he was prepared to do to make the 
circumstances improve. He pointed out there had been some cold 
weather. There were three weeks of cold weather but that would not 
account for even half of the discrepancy between the amount 
moved the year before and the amount moved this year.
<P>
	In my own research I discovered that vast parts of prairie Canada 
have a shortage of rolling stocks in locomotives. I have checked 
with the railways, which admit this. They point out that they 
perhaps will have to bring some locomotives and cars back from 
the United States.
<P>
	I am sure the Minister of Transport even though he is new will 
quickly be apprised that the rates they can charge for the same cars 
and locomotives in the United States are considerably more than 
they can charge in Canada with the current ceiling on rail shipment 
of grains in Canada.
<P>
	The U.S. rail system has dramatically increased their fees for 
service because they understand that grain prices are higher and 
they are simply charging everything the market will bear. There has 
been a rapid and radical increase in fees charged to farmers and 
shippers in the United States. Our railways are down there trying to 
take advantage of this, meanwhile shorting our ability to export 
grain and the ability of our farmers who produced a very good crop 
of excellent quality in prairie Canada.
<P>
	There should be very little to stand in the way of rapid movement 
because virtually every district in western Canada has produced top 
grades of wheat and barley. It is not a problem to put together a full 
104 or 108 car trains of one grade to be moved to the terminals at 
port.
<P>
	Wheat and barley are under the wheat board and a system of 
pooling is used so that all of the train can be dumped at one 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="622"> 622 </A></B>
<P>
terminal even though some of the grain may have belonged to a 
different company. A book exchange of grains is used to speed up 
the turnaround.  Turnaround time on wheat board grains is double 
or more than double the turnaround time for a similar car of 
non-board grains. Some of the specialty crops have turnaround 
times that would make one weep. They take three to four times as 
long as wheat board grains.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	As well, the country elevator system has not been awfully 
co-operative. It took advantage of the new deregulation and filled 
its elevators late last summer and in the early fall, at least in 
northeastern Saskatchewan where I come from. Most elevators 
report that they are about half full of non-board barley, open market 
barley, for which the elevator companies have not yet found a 
buyer.
<P>
	This is clogging the system. There is less than half of the space 
to handle this year's crop. The farmers are beginning to despair of 
being able to deliver what was a very good crop in this crop year 
when prices are high. I wish the Ministry of Transport and the new 
minister would take this into account and take action as quickly as 
possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member 
for his intervention. It gives me an opportunity to expand on the 
position espoused by the Minister of Transport in his response to 
the hon. member in question period on February 29.
<P>
	I have a few words to say about the movement of grain for the 
current crop year, which is down from the same period last year. 
However, to be fair to the hon. member for Mackenzie, there are a 
number of reasons for this.
<P>
	Movements were extremely low in August and September of this 
year because of low carry-over stocks. Grain traffic did not really 
pick up until the end of the harvest. By contrast, in 1994 there was 
plenty of grain to move and the system was at full capacity in 
August and September.
<P>
	Weather, as previously stated by the Minister of Transport, has 
also been a factor this year. There were heavy rains on the west 
coast in December and January. Beyond the temperatures the hon. 
member spoke about, there were also mud slides and of course 
track outages. These things take time to repair.
<P>
	The prairies also experienced three weeks of record cold, as the 
hon. member enunciated, which slowed deliveries to the country 
elevator system and rail deliveries to port. Fortunately the system 
is catching up. Vessel line-ups at Vancouver are expected to be at 
normal levels very shortly.
<P>
	In spite of the slow start and unfavourable weather conditions, it 
is anticipated that the entire crop will be moved this year.
<P>
	One of the objectives of the grain transportation reform 
announced last year was to create a less rigid and  more efficient 
grain transportation and handling system. A number of positive 
initiatives have been announced by industry since western grain 
transportation reform was implemented. We believe even more 
benefits will be achieved as structural changes take place.
<P>
	Grain farmers are enjoying the benefits of high world prices for 
their product. I am sure the hon. member for Mackenzie will agree 
with me when I say that we all want to be sure that their grain gets 
to market promptly and at the lowest possible cost.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANWATERWAYS">CANADIAN WATERWAYS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 1985 when a 
U.S. coast guard icebreaker transited Canadian sovereign waters in 
the Arctic without permission, the Prime Minister said that the 
government of the day and Canada had been humiliated by the 
action.
<P>
	In B.C. there is a strong sentiment that Canada has been 
humiliated by U.S. legislation which declares the inside passage of 
British Columbia an international waterway. Yet the federal 
government, as in the Quebec referendum, has failed to speak up 
for Canada.
<P>
	The issue was before the U.S. congress in 1995 and at no time 
did the government speak up for Canada and publicly make the 
case for Canadian sovereignty. In fact, the U.S. congress passed the 
bill on October 24 and an amended version of the same bill passed 
the senate way back on June 30, yet there was silence from the 
Liberal government.
<P>
	``The bill'', according to the <I>Congressional Quarterly</I>, ``is the 
result of a fishing dispute in which the Canadian government 
imposed an $1,100 fee on U.S. vessels that pass through Canadian 
waters between Washington and Alaska. This was an act U.S. 
officials regarded as inconsistent with international law''.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	That being said, there is no foundation for the claim that the 
inside passage is an international waterway. The Americans 
acknowledged as much in 1846 when they signed the Oregon 
treaty.
<P>
	Now is not the time to diminish Canadian presence on the inside 
passage by shutting down lighthouses and contracting out weather 
information from American satellites controlled by the U.S. 
government. We must maintain our presence in the passage at this 
time.
<P>
	It is also not the time for ministers to turn these critical decisions 
over to senior coast guard officials who, in discussing the 
lighthouse issue, said: ``We don't have to accept what the minister 
said''. We need the minister to be tough, to give no quarter on the 
sovereignty issue but to recognize that the challenge to our 
sovereignty is at heart a fish dispute.
<P>
	We should not be suckered into a school yard brawl over this 
issue. We must give reason a chance to work. We know what does 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="623"> 623 </A></B>
<P>
not work. We tried fish wars in 1982  and again in 1994 to no avail. 
We have tried the transit fees. We have tried normal diplomatic 
channels. In fact, we tried mediation with a well respected 
international mediator, all to no avail.
<P>
	We need a fresh approach to solve this fisheries dispute and 
ultimately the sovereignty issue. In that fresh approach what we 
should do and what we must do is recognize that when we are 
dealing with our American cousins on this we are not dealing 
directly with the American government. There are four groups that 
have a veto, including the states of Oregon, Washington, Alaska 
and the native tribes of the Pacific northwest.
<P>
	The solution to this problem will not be found in Washington. It 
will only be found on the west coast. To achieve a solution, it is my 
view that we must appoint someone who has the confidence of 
British Columbians, who understands the issue and who will bring 
this dispute to a resolution.
<P>
	To that point, I suggest that the government appoint John Fraser, 
Ambassador for Environment, to deal with this issue to protect 
Canadian sovereignty and to get to the root cause of this, which is 
in fact a fisheries dispute between Canada and the United States.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for Delta for his question. He has shown a keen interest in 
issues of fisheries for a considerable number of years.
<P>
	I would be happy to put to rest some of the concerns that he 
expressed. In no way is the Canadian government humiliated or 
does it feel humiliated by what has happened.
<P>
	Some legislation has been passed by the United States congress 
which makes certain assertions, which are no more than assertions: 
first, that American vessels have the right of innocent passage 
through the inside passage of Canada; second, that Canada violated 
international law by imposing transit licence fees in 1994; and 
third, that Canada should compensate the United States, in essence 
reimburse the transit licence fees applied in 1994.
<P>
	The statement in the American legislation does contain some 
errors of law which can be easily corrected and fears put to rest. It 
is also interesting as an example of what might be called the King 
Canute approach to international law. It is beyond the competence 
of a national legislature by national legislation to establish a right 
in international law. It just cannot be done and frankly there is no 
need to be too concerned over that.
<P>
	As to the errors of law, they are very simple issues here. The 
right of innocent passage, to which the U.S. legislation refers, 
applies under international law to what is called the territorial sea. 
The territorial sea in the region concerned is measured from the 
base line, the low water mark, on the west side of Vancouver 
Island. The inland passage is in fact part of Canada's inland waters 
or  internal waters. It is not subject to the United Nations 
convention on the law of the sea. International law does not apply 
to it. It is within our province to control and regulate it, to apply 
transit fees. We have every right under our law to do so. There is 
nothing in international law restricting our right to do so.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	The inside passage is not part of Canada's territorial sea which is 
measured, as I have said, from the west side of Vancouver Island. It 
is part of Canada's internal waters. There is no right of innocent 
passage, as it is called under international law, through our internal 
waters. There is no prohibition under national law against our 
imposing a transit fee in the case concerned.
<P>
	We have made the following points to the United States 
government. Canada is not in violation of international law. The 
waters of the inside passage are Canadian internal waters and no 
compensation will be paid.
<P>
	The statements in the United States congressional legislation are 
interesting but they are simply findings or expressions of opinion 
of congress. They do not constitute anything more for purposes of 
international law. In particular they do not authorize an 
intervention by U.S. coast guard vessels into Canadian waters.
<P>
	I should remind this House and perhaps the U.S. congress that 
under the United States constitution and under the separation of 
powers it embodies, it is for the President of the United States and 
not for congress to assume responsibility in the execution of 
foreign policy. The findings in the U.S. legislation are mildly 
offensive to Canadians but they only express an opinion.
<P>
	There have been calls on this government to reintroduce the 
transit licence fee in response to the refusal of the United States to 
respect the larger Pacific salmon treaty obligations to Canada and 
the failure to respect the United States role in the maintenance of 
the Pacific salmon stocks. We also have to refer to the recent 
failure of the Pacific salmon mediation process.
<P>
	However, I am happy to tell this House that negotiations are 
proceeding. There will be a Pacific salmon commission meeting on 
1996 fishing arrangements and also a bilateral meeting between our 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and the United States Secretary of 
State, Mr. Christopher. Both are scheduled for later this month.
<P>
	This government will not reintroduce the transit licence fees 
while these initiatives are under way. That would be an error. 
However, all options remain on the table. They are under study and 
if appropriate they will be used.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> If I might take the liberty of 
a brief intervention on the matter of the adjournment proceedings. I 
did not interrupt the  parliamentary secretary given the importance 
of the subject matter being raised by the hon. member for Delta.
<P>
	However, as we continue our work in this new session I want to 
remind the House that presenters have up to four minutes and 
parliamentary secretaries on behalf of their ministers and the 
government have two minutes to reply. I would not want us to stray 
too far from that. As a matter of fact we should not stray at all from 
those limits. Understand that today I made an exception, but I 
would not want the House to interpret that we would take that same 
latitude at each and every occasion. I would ask you to be mindful 
of that in the days to come.
<P>

	Pursuant to order made earlier today, the House resumes 
consideration of the motion of Mr. Gauthier, the member for 
Roberval, and of the amendment of Mrs. Brown, the member for 
Calgary Southeast.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is certainly my personal 
privilege to stand in the House today to speak on this opposition 
motion which should definitely be rejected.
<P>
	Once again we have a very curious spectacle. The Bloc 
Quebecois, the party that says it wants to change this country 
irrevocably, the party which says that separation is the only 
solution to solving all of the social and economic problems facing 
Quebecers, is making an impassioned plea for the status quo in 
Canada. This is the party that is suddenly the champion of the 
downtrodden worker in New Brunswick, Ontario, Alberta and 
British Columbia? I do not think so and neither do many 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	What the Bloc's argument comes down to is that we should 
simply shelve any thoughts of changing or improving the old 
unemployment insurance system, the program with all its 
inefficiencies and all the unfairness. We should just ignore 
proposals which came about after a lengthy process of consultation 
and consensus building with thousands of Canadians right across 
the country.
<P>
	The game plan of the Bloc Quebecois members is not only 
transparent, it is extremely cynical. It is transparent because we all 
know the real reason they are opposing  this legislation. They 
simply do not want to see any improvements in any legislation that 
would make the country work better. They have a vested interest in 
failure and it shows. Failure. It shows in all their arguments.
<P>
	Modernizing the employment system for all Canadian workers, 
lowering premiums, making it work better, expanding it to include 
more people, encouraging more people to work, making the system 
sustainable into the next century for all Quebecers and for all 
Canadians are not objectives the Bloc members could support. Not 
today, not tomorrow, nor ever and for a very simple reason. A 
better employment insurance system for all Canadians including 
Quebecers weakens their cause for separation. And this is the party 
which sees everything through that particular lens.
<P>
	How could the Bloc possibly support the idea that 350,000 low 
income families across Canada will now get an extra income 
supplement under this new legislation? That is what this bill will 
do.
<P>
	How could the Bloc possibly support the proposals in the bill for 
the first time to ensure the work of upwards of more than 500,000 
part time individuals in Quebec and across Canada who are not now 
part of the system?
<P>
	How could the Bloc agree with a bill that will give some 270,000 
seasonally employed Canadian claimants an additional three weeks 
of benefits?
<P>
	How could the Bloc be in favour of a bill that is conservatively 
predicted to create upwards of 100,000 to 150,000 new jobs in the 
country? Many thousands of them would be in Quebec.
<P>
	How could the Bloc support a bill that will lower premiums for 
workers and employers to the tune of $1.3 million and which lets 
employers put their share, more than $760 million into creating 
new jobs for Quebecers and for all Canadians?
<P>
	How could the Bloc agree with a bill that makes special 
provision for women who have been out of the workforce raising 
families to help them get back into the workforce and have access 
to employment benefits?
<P>
	Why would the Bloc be in favour of a bill that will expand 
coverage of the program to include 97 per cent of workers but at the 
same time return contributions to more than 1.3 million very low 
income workers, including 920,000 who pay premiums today?
<P>
	Why would a separatist party support a bill that is going to give 
300,000 small businesses in Quebec and across Canada a premium 
refund of up to $5,000 over two years?
<P>
	How could a separatist party give its support to a bill which has a 
series of active employment measures, including wage subsidies, 
earning supplements, self-employment, community job 
partnerships, to pave the way for more Quebecers and Canadians to 
get 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="625"> 625 </A></B>
<P>
back  into the workforce? These are programs which will be 
developed directly with the provinces.
<P>
	I guess if I were a separatist, heaven forbid, I would probably not 
want to see this bill go through either or anything else that might 
improve the employment situation in this country for that matter. 
The plain fact is the bill is good for workers and for the economy 
and we will prove that.
<P>
	I think the real cynicism of the party opposite shows itself in this 
motion. What the Bloc is saying is that it does not want Canadians 
or Quebecers to talk about trying to improve the bill in our 
committee.
<P>
	We have to come to terms with how we modernize our outdated 
unemployment system so that it reflects the realities of today's 
working world because that world has changed just as profoundly 
in Quebec as it has in the rest of Canada and across the western 
world. Fewer and fewer people work in the traditional nine to five 
pattern for which the old UI system was created. More and more 
people work part time or in multiple part time jobs. They are not 
fully covered under the current plan with its rigid rule of weeks 
worked. Since every hour worked will now count toward eligibility 
for benefits, workers will have incentives to accept available work.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	The opposition says the new program is unfair to young people, 
women, seasonal workers and immigrants. What does this new 
measure really mean for youth? Four out of ten part time workers 
are young people. With an unemployment rate of 16 per cent, 
nearly double the average of all other workers, this bill is going to 
help thousands of young people who are caught in the 15 hour trap. 
Many employers use this 15 hour system to avoid paying 
premiums. That denies our young people benefits when the work 
runs out. This bill will be especially helpful for youth.
<P>
	Young people also need support to make that all important 
school to work transition. For this reason we have invested in the 
intern programs working with business, local communities and 
educators. We have also invested in youth services to help young 
people get the experience and skills they need to find jobs. The 
government has announced that funding for summer jobs is going 
to be doubled from $60 million to $120 million. It will be 
committed over the next three years to help young people get into 
the job market.
<P>
	The opposition says that women are being penalized. Again, this 
is not true. On average, women currently earn 70 per cent of what 
men earn. They make up 60 per cent of minimum wage earners. 
The new arrangements recognize these facts and make a real 
attempt to turn that situation around in several ways.
<P>
	Two-thirds of those who qualify for the new family supplement 
will be women. This supplement results in low income single 
parent families receiving 10 per cent  more than they do today. 
Women returning to work after having received maternity or 
parental leave benefits will have access to the new re-employment 
benefits for a full five years. Very low income women will be 
eligible for a premium refund.
<P>
	What about new Canadians? The opposition claims they are 
being punished. Again, it just is not true. Asking for a slightly 
longer initial attachment to the workforce in the first year before 
being eligible for benefits just like everybody else is not wrong. 
Again, it is only the first year. In the second and following years if 
they have some attachment to the workforce they will have lower 
qualifying periods. They will also have access to re-employment 
benefit tools.
<P>
	More good news for the home front. There is going to be a very 
positive impact on the social assistance caseloads within the 
provinces. At the moment 45 per cent of social assistance 
recipients have also been UI claimants within the last three years. 
Many are UI exhaustees. These individuals will now have access to 
the new re-employment measures which will help get them back 
into the workforce and will help reduce provincial social assistance 
roles. Many people are going to be very happy with this legislation.
<P>
	Canadians expect us to come up with better answers and so do 
Quebecers. My suggestion to the opposition members is that they 
should join in that process, work with their colleagues who are 
members of our standing committee and help us come up with the 
right solutions. I sincerely hope they can put aside their ideological 
goals and help us deal with the task of creating a new and better 
system of unemployment insurance protection for all Canadians. 
This motion should be defeated.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I shall try to be 
brief; I see others wanting to speak. I am itching to respond to the 
hon. colleague across the way. I think he is still a bit blinded by the 
aftermath of the October 30 referendum debate.
<P>
	The referendum is settled. That is not the issue today. I have two 
little questions for the hon. colleague across the way. In his speech 
he mentioned that the new bill would entitle seasonal workers to up 
to three weeks additional benefits. I would like to see him do a 
demonstration of A plus B equals C for this, because that is not 
what people have understood the reform to mean.
<P>
<B>(1910)</B>
<P>
	A second little question of arithmetic. He says that young people 
would be better off with this new reform, because now they will 
have deductions taken off from the very first hour they work. They 
had to work fifteen hours in the past before deductions started, but 
910 hours divided by 15 makes about 60 weeks. First of all, when 
will they be eligible to apply for unemployment insurance? 
Second, students are deemed not to be  available for work. If young 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="626"> 626 </A></B>
<P>
people study full time in the winter and work only on weekends, 
will they have enough time for entitlement?
<P>
	Did they state in this unemployment insurance reform that it will 
allow students to collect unemployment insurance while still at 
school? I think that the hon. member was talking through his hat. 
He was perhaps just a bit too blinded by the political option I am 
defending, but I would remind him that what we wanted to discuss 
today was unemployment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McCormick:</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly I want to reply to my 
hon. colleague from the Bloc.
<P>
	I am not influenced by the results of the referendum but I am 
influenced by many Quebec friends and many Quebec colleagues. 
Great Canadians. Great Quebecers.
<P>
	When the SSR review toured the country, in 35 days we had 
hearings in 27 cities, ten provinces, two territories, the eastern 
Arctic, and many locales in Quebec. People asked for the same 
thing and Quebecers were no different. They are Canadians who 
want an opportunity to work and make a contribution to this 
country.
<P>
	I would gladly ask the member to read out the list of people in 
his province who do not want the same opportunity as what they 
have here.
<P>
	The second question concerned students and the 15 hour system. 
Many students I know personally work at two part time jobs. I 
believe that after this legislation is passed the ``Mc'' companies 
will offer more than 15 hours to these students. I am sure many of 
these students will have the opportunity to work 30 hours a week. 
We will find that this legislation will be of great benefit to all 
Canadians including Quebecers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the opposition for giving us an opportunity to give more 
explanations regarding important issues, by presenting motions 
which always surprise us, as they surprise others, by their incisive 
and unexpected nature.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I thank the opposition for giving me the opportunity to speak 
about youth, the generation which is next in line and which literally 
represents the future of our country. The future is of concern to all 
of us but there is no question that it is of even greater concern to 
young people.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It was the case for us when we were young, but it probably is 
much more so for young people today. They feel more bound by the 
choices made by their elders and  they have a greater interest in the 
decisions taken in the present legislative process. This is why there 
is great interest among young people for the debates we are holding 
and the positions we take.
<P>
	I find it unfortunate that the opposition, with all due respect to 
my hon. colleagues, is taking advantage of young people's 
uncertainty about the future, which is quite understandable, to 
heighten that uncertainty, increase their nervousness and to arouse 
passions. They want to give to the most vulnerable groups in our 
society the impression that the major reforms proposed by the 
government are aimed at them.
<P>
	If there is one group which will benefit from the major reforms 
launched by the Government, it is the young people. If one group 
should one day be grateful to us for having taken the necessary 
steps to control the deficit, it is the young generation. And if there 
is one group in our society for which employment insurance will be 
beneficial, it is, once again, the young people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Young people will benefit like our own generation has from the 
major social security programs the generation before us established 
30, 40 and 50 years ago. Many of those programs in their original 
form no longer meet today's needs and that is certainly the case 
when it comes to unemployment insurance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	More than 80 per cent of Canadians agree that the present system 
is flawed and must be redesigned.
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	One thing is sure, if we do nothing, we are guaranteed of leaving 
our children a house mortgaged to the hilt, as Jean Paré wrote last 
year in <I>L'Actualité</I> on the very subject of social program reform.
<P>
	Employment insurance offers an affordable system that continue 
on into the future. We have already explained why, under the bill, 
the eligibility requirements are increased for those newly arrived 
on the labour market. It would appear that young people tend to 
leave school earlier if they have relatively easy access to UI 
benefits.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If young people do not have an adequate education they often 
embark on a cycle of dependence on unemployment insurance or 
even welfare. We want to encourage young people to work rather 
than to depend on UI. We want to encourage personal 
responsibility, training and development. With these goals in mind 
it is not in our interest to have a system that does not encourage 
young people to get a good education.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In many respects, the young will benefit from the new system. 
With eligibility calculated according to  accumulated hours of 
work, the insurance plan will be extended to 500,000 workers who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="627"> 627 </A></B>
<P>
are not currently covered: those working part time, those in two or 
more small jobs and those whose job profile changes frequently.
<P>
	In the job market at the moment, many of our young people find 
themselves in one of these categories. Of the 1.3 million low 
income workers who will have their contributions returned, nearly 
half are young people under 25. For the young, the new rules mean, 
in the end, a program cut of 8 per cent compared with 11 per cent 
for workers as a whole.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Young people constitute a priority for the government, made 
clear in the speech from the throne and in the budget tabled by the 
Minister of Finance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As the minister said, our young people are, along with 
technology and trade, one of the three areas in which the 
government is going to invest more, because these areas are of 
crucial importance for improving employment and increasing the 
number of jobs now and in the future.
<P>
	These initiatives are designed to create a leverage effect in the 
private sector and in our communities. The government is thus 
going to increase from $60 million to $120 million its contribution 
towards summer job creation for students. Furthermore, in the 
speech from the throne, the government called upon business and 
upon political and community leaders to join the efforts of the 
federal government to find new ways of helping our young people 
to find jobs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is in the interests of all Canadians to see to it that young people 
have every possible opportunity to participate in and contribute to 
the national economy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our young people must regain their confidence in the future. To 
that end, we must create new opportunities, and create jobs for all 
the workers in Canada. It is not up to the government to create jobs, 
but it is among its immediate responsibilities to generate a 
favourable climate for job creation. The best way to do it is to, first, 
stop the government from getting deeper in debt and control the 
deficit, as I said before. The budget that the government just 
presented shows that there is reason to hope, on this front.
<P>
	At present, interest rates are low, the inflation rate is barely at 2 
per cent and the overall unemployment rate is under 10 per cent. 
These are certainly favourable conditions for economic recovery 
and job creation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As the Prime Minister said, it is now up to the private sector to 
do its part. It is in this way that the country's economy will move 
ahead.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is how we will regain control. This is how we will manage 
to put our house in order so that our young people can regain 
confidence in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we must be living in two totally different countries. Go 
walk in the streets and talk to young people who have just 
graduated. Today's unemployment rate among young people is the 
direct result of our current system. It ranges from 15, 16, 18, 20 to 
25 per cent, depending on the region.
<P>
<B>(1920)</B>
<P>
	Does this proposed reform carry a message of hope to our young 
people? Will asking them to work 920 hours the first year in order 
to qualify for unemployment insurance be a message of hope for 
them? Do they see that as an incentive to start a family? For 
someone graduating with a degree in land use planning or working 
in wildlife conservation, for all those working in recreation and 
tourism, who are seasonal workers by definition, is there in this 
reform a message to the effect that they have a future, that we trust 
them and that they will go places?
<P>
	As for the refund, does the member realize that only young 
people earning less than $2,000 a year will receive a refund? Two 
thousand dollars, that means 10 weeks at $200 a week. Therefore, 
most of those who work during the summer will not receive a 
refund because they will have earned more than $2,000 during the 
year. They will contribute to a plan but will never receive any 
benefits in return.
<P>
	I agree with the member on one point, when he says that one 
solution is the reduction of the deficit. It is true, it is very true, 
provided we cut where we should really cut. If we say we reduce 
the deficit by having a surplus of $5 billion in the unemployment 
insurance fund, we end up with the opposite of what we wanted.
<P>
	In conclusion, I ask why does the government not set a goal for 
the reduction of unemployment as it did for the deficit? Why did it 
not say: ``We are going to try to be, in two years time, at 6 per cent, 
or 8 per cent or 4 per cent, depending on what we consider to be full 
employment; this will be our primary objective as a government, 
and we will make sure that unemployment is decreased to that 
level''. Then, the employment insurance system would have 
deserved its name. Given this, would the hon. member have 
arguments that could convince me to change my point of view, to 
see the situation differently, when the message which seems to be 
given to our young people is: ``If you get good  training, you will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="628"> 628 </A></B>
<P>
have a good chance to find a job but, unfortunately, if you cannot 
enter the system correctly you will be condemned to rely, year after 
year, on social assistance?''
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his questions. 
The first answer is yes, there are very concrete measures in the 
government bill. The first, most concrete measure is that premiums 
for businesses will be reduced, which will help to create jobs. It is 
estimated that 150,000 new jobs will be created under this new 
system.
<P>
	On the member's second proposal concerning unemployment 
insurance surplus, I want to tell him that in 1990 the unemployment 
insurance fund had a surplus of $2 billion and with the recession 
that followed it became a deficit of $6 billion. We do not want to 
have to deal with the same problems that we faced in 1993 and 
1994. So, what the government is doing now is taking preventive 
measures. We are trying to prevent problems in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today and I will not telling you anything new by 
saying that I sincerely believe the government has no choice but to 
withdraw Bill C-12, the so-called employment insurance bill that I 
would rather call destitution insurance bill.
<P>
	It has no choice, if for no other reason than the one that people do 
not want this bill. So the government, simply to respect democracy 
and the people who elected it, must go back to the drawing board, 
as is suggested in the motion of the Leader of the Opposition, my 
colleague from Roberval.
<P>
	People do not want this bill and this reform. I am not talking only 
about people who are directly affected, that is, the current 
beneficiaries. I am talking about people in general. I am talking 
about editorial writers, unionists and workers. Lise Bissonnette and 
Jean-Robert Sansfaçon of <I>Le Devoir</I>, the FTQ, the CSN, the CEQ, 
the CSD, the Bishop of Bathurst, the Canadian Labour Congress, 
mayors of Acadian villages, labour councils in Edmundston and the 
regions all agree that the government's proposals are simply 
unacceptable.
<P>
<B>(1925)</B>
<P>
	Provincial politicians have also condemned this reform. Why? 
Because it will increase the number of welfare recipients for whom 
the provinces are directly responsible. They are simply 
impoverishing the provinces by transferring these cases to them. 
This is called shovelling into the provinces' backyards.
<P>
	There will be less money for the unemployed. For example, after 
Phase I of the reform, the Quebec government reported last May an 
additional 10,000 welfare claims for April alone. Again, it is 
precisely in April that the provision reducing the eligibility period 
came into effect. In Quebec, this means an additional 10,000 
welfare claims.
<P>
	This is no coincidence. Those people deprived of their UI 
benefits went straight to welfare. Why? Because they could not 
find jobs. In fact, a document from the Department of Human 
Resources Development foresaw exactly the direct impact of the 
new program, stating that total benefits would be cut by $735 
million in Quebec and that it could cost provincial welfare 
programs between $65 million and $135 million. This is clearly 
stated in the document itself.
<P>
	To fend off the sharp criticism that would surely be directed at 
the federal government, the document went right on to say that, to 
counterbalance these measures, other job creation initiatives were 
being implemented: the infrastructure program, the youth service 
corps, the young trainees program and strategic initiatives related 
to social security.
<P>
	What does this mean? It means duplication and overlap. I must 
point out that the document also stated that these measures, along 
with the $800 million invested in strategic initiatives, would act as 
a countermeasure to the budget proposals. In short, they expected 
all hell to break loose, so to speak. They knew full well that it 
would not go down easy this time around, that the public was not 
going to swallow this new bitter remedy. Once again, the 
government ignored provincial jurisdictions, and particularly what 
the Quebec government and many other social stakeholders in 
Quebec are asking for, that is to say, that full financial control be 
restored to Quebec so that we can have a real job creation policy.
<P>
	As window dressing, new programs were established in areas of 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction. How wasteful. What a waste of 
time and energy, energy wasted in particular on giving once again 
false hopes.
<P>
	We know that half of the 808,000 welfare recipients in Quebec 
are in fact chronically unemployed. Instead of creating 
employment, the government is turning out welfare recipients. 
How encouraging for the future. That is why the public does not 
want anything to do with Bill C-12, and that is not an 
understatement. As evidence of that, you need only recall the many 
protests that have been covered by television and the newspapers 
since December.
<P>
	When my colleague from Mercier said the reform was pure 
nonsense, I remember that government members told her that she 
did not understand the so-called reform. So, considering all the 
protests that have been held since December, or since the 
government revealed another aspect of its so-called reform, 
hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets. They 
demonstrated not only in Quebec, but also in New Brunswick, in 
Nova Scotia, and elsewhere. Are there any members in the House 
who have not been informed by their constituents of their 
objections to this awful system that I would call the employment 
insurance light?

<P>
	In fact, the newspapers gave extensive coverage of the trials and 
tribulations of a Liberal parliamentary secretary from Acadia, who 
was bluntly reminded that he should look after his voters' interests. 
As the 400 protesters chanted in Montreal, on February 26: ``That 
reform will not go through''. This is what they were saying.
<P>
	The Wednesdays of shame will continue until the government 
finally understands the message that people, in their wisdom, have 
been trying to convey for two years. The poor, the young, as well as 
women and the unemployed have given enough. They should not 
have to pay for the deficit. The Bloc Quebecois agrees with them. 
The time has come to set up a true job creation program, instead of 
trying to catch those who cheat, instead of, as Angéla Vautour put 
it, ``making bad people out of good people'', instead of saying that 
protestors are separatists disguised as unemployed workers. The 
time has come for people to understand what really motivates this 
government, other than the reduction of the deficit, of course.
<P>
	Not too long ago, the President of the Treasury Board made a 
slip of the tongue that was reported by journalist Michel Vastel. 
The formula is very simple. Here is what the President of the 
Treasury Board had to say: ``First, we will reduce federal transfers 
to the provinces by $7 billion. This will force the provinces to make 
cuts in their social programs. We will wait for Mr. Bouchard's 
government to make its cuts. Those cuts are going to hurt, and the 
provincial governments are the ones that will pay. Then we table a 
seemingly nice budget, the recent budget, which does not appear to 
impose new constraints on taxpayers. We come out looking like a 
good father sparing his poor children.'' That is what the President 
of the Treasury Board said.
<P>
	``Finally, after the provinces have juggled with the new 
constraints we have imposed on them, after they have given the bad 
news to their citizens, our government will launch a massive 
publicity campaign to explain to taxpayers that we are the only 
government capable of protecting them, of defending them and of 
guaranteeing them a minimum of adequate services and benefits. 
QED.''
<P>
	They will wait for the Quebec government to table its budget in 
order to demonstrate that the federal government, like a good 
father, will provide small grants, bypassing the provinces, to 
community networks and to individuals, while Quebec is dealt a $7 
billion cut through the Canadian social transfer and while the 
unemployment insurance program is also cut by $640 million. It 
was cut last year, and it will be cut a further $650 million.
<P>
	This is impossible. They forgot one thing: the people will not be 
fooled. They forgot the people's wisdom. They forgot the wave of 
revolt that is sweeping the country.
<P>
	I hope that the government will listen and will not be content 
with implementing minor reforms in this bill, but will withdraw it 
and recognize the validity of the motion put forward by our 
colleague, the hon. member for Roberval, who asked that this bill 
be withdrawn.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened with a great deal of interest to the speech of 
my colleague, and I was deeply touched. I think that she got to the 
bottom of the problem.
<P>
	The opposition motion says in part that the minister should go 
back to the drawing board, since this reform hits young people, 
women, seasonal workers and immigrants hard.
<P>
	Could the hon. member elaborate a bit more on the situation 
women have to face when they enter the workforce for the first 
time or when they return to the labour market after raising their 
family? What is the situation going to be if this reform is carried 
out? Will they be able to get benefits or, like the motions says, are 
they going to be hit the hardest by this reform?
<P>
<B>(1935)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question asked by 
my colleague, because it deals with an issue I did not have time to 
address during my speech. Yes, women will be penalized. Why? 
Because 70 per cent of all part-time jobs are held by women.
<P>
	We know full well that, under this unemployment insurance 
reform, part-time workers are penalized. Anyone who works fewer 
than 15 hours a week-and this is often the case for many women 
who have to spend many hours at home, because they have two 
roles to play and have to take care of their children-does not 
qualify for UI benefits, even though that person has paid his or her 
premiums. To qualify, that person would have to work 60 weeks a 
year. As you know, Mr. Speaker, there are only 52 weeks in a year, 
unless the government has done something about that in this bill.
<P>
	So, I think that women will be penalized and that young women 
will have a hard time finding a first job. With the job insecurity we 
hear so much about, it will be tough for them to qualify if they have 
to work 910 hours a year to do so.
<P>
	Again, what they would need are more stable and longer-term 
jobs. Given its lack of vision, what is the government offering in 
terms of job creation? In its first budget, there was the 
infrastructure program, but in its second budget, there was nothing. 
At least, it had included a so-called job creation strategy in its first 
budget.
<P>
	I deplore the fact that there is no job creation proposal especially 
for women, who make up 52 per cent of the population. So, we 
think that this reform will penalize women, because it is targeting 
workers who claim UI benefits too often. Since women are affected 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="630"> 630 </A></B>
<P>
by job insecurity and hold part-time jobs, I think this reformis unfair and will be carried out again at the expense of the 
underprivileged.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as several of my 
colleagues have said again and again today, the purpose of this 
debate is to ask for the withdrawal of the new Bill C-12, the old Bill 
C-111.
<P>
	Why do we ask for this bill to be withdrawn? First, because we 
feel it penalizes the very victims of the job shortage, that is the 
unemployed. As described here and as we saw when Bill C-111 was 
introduced, these measures are a direct attack on the very victims 
of the lack of jobs.
<P>
	Since every Canadian did not follow our debates all day long, I 
will try to summarize these measures in three points. First, there is 
the eligibility rule invented by the former Minister of Human 
Resources Development, that is, a total of 910 hours or 26 weeks of 
work.
<P>
	As I said, I come from an area where seasonal work is 
everybody's fate. It is difficult to work for more than 10 or 12 
weeks. By the way, I remind the House that it is biology which 
decides that lobster cannot be fished for more than 10 weeks. Any 
more than that would deplete the resource. Thus, Mr. Speaker, you 
will allow me to be surprised that the minister has not addressed 
this rule yet and said that it must be objected to.
<P>
	The second rule, which I called the penalty rule in my 
constituency, concerns the intensity. Anybody who receives 
unemployment insurance benefits for at least 20 weeks will see his 
or her benefits reduced by 1 per cent. Every time you receive 
benefits for 20 weeks, these benefits will be reduced by 1 per cent. 
This means that in about three years' time, seasonal workers will 
be denied 5 per cent.
<P>
	The third point, which always needs to be explained, is the 
calculation method. The minister proposes to use a fixed basis. 
When the required number of hours is reached, it will immediately 
be divided-and this is the calculation method-by 14 weeks.
<P>
<B>(1940)</B>
<P>
	But it is by 14 weeks within a given period, once you have done 
your 420 hours. However, it is possible that people have been 
unable to work within this given period.
<P>
	What about seasonal workers? If they work in early spring, in 
April and May in the case of fishing and again in the fall in another 
type of fishing, the entire summer period would not be included. 
That means that, once the 420 hours have been reached, the 
division to determine  the value of benefits will have to be by the 
number of weeks the individual has not worked. This is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	For this reason, we feel that this is unacceptable and we ask that 
this bill be withdrawn.
<P>
	Why do we have difficulty meeting the objectives set out by the 
Minister in this area? I said earlier in this House that the premises 
are all wrong. For us, in our language, reforming the situation of 
the victims of job shortages means improving it. In this case, as I 
just said, coming from the new Minister for Human Resources 
Development, reform means cuts. And this is an indication, an 
order given to him by the Minister of Finance who, last year, said in 
his budget that the government wanted a cut of about 10 to 12 per 
cent-which means a cut of about $1.5 billion dollars which will be 
passed on to the recipients.
<P>
	In the meantime, we realize there is a discrepancy as regards to 
the revenue generated by the UI fund, that is, premiums from 
workers and employers will generate a surplus of some $5 billion, 
for this year alone.
<P>
	You will understand our surprise. Considering the equation I just 
did, it is clear that the problem is not about a lack of funds. They 
want to streamline. So to reduce or eliminate the problem, they 
want to hit those who happen to be the victims over the head.
<P>
	I would have thought that alternative measures would have been 
proposed, precisely because UI benefits are dependent upon 
regional unemployment rates. I would have thought that measures 
to stimulate employment would have been devised.
<P>
	The government cannot do here what it blames large companies 
for doing. In the throne speech, the Prime Minister, who thought he 
had delivered the goods, admonished big business, telling them: 
``Now that we are starting to meet our deficit reduction target of 3 
per cent of GDP, it is up to businesses to create jobs.''
<P>
	But what are big corporations doing? My colleague from 
Roberval also mentioned in his address in response to the throne 
speech that major banks cut around 3,000 jobs, even though they 
posted record profits of $5 billion. I do not have a detailed list, but 
it is in that order of magnitude. Bell Canada too made profits and 
cut workers.
<P>
	I have nothing against profits, but I want to draw the attention of 
the House to the fact that the government, the Minister of Finance 
cannot put its fiscal house in order as does a corporation, whose 
sole purpose in life is to generate profits. Here we are dealing with 
real people who depend on our decisions. The minister must 
absolutely take this into consideration. We are asking him what 
will the people deprived of unemployment insurance get in 
exchange? Nothing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="631"> 631 </A></B>
<P>
	It is the same in the fisheries sector, and I cannot wait to meet 
the new Minister of Fisheries. What can the people excluded from 
this program expect? We are going to ask some people to define 
what is the core of the fishing sector, that is to say to define who 
is going to be excluded, who is going to be declared surplus. But 
what can the excluded people expect? Nothing. The government 
seems to be reneging on all its social responsibilities, but there 
is one that it must assume.
<P>
	On the same point, the minister often tells us that he intends to 
act in a certain way or is forced to act that way, because of ``public 
opinion in the rest of Canada''. The minister comes from Acadia 
and I come from the Gaspé and he tells me: ``Public opinion in the 
rest of Canada wants me to streamline and cut in these areas''. I am 
sorry, but I think that what most Canadians, like most Quebecers, 
want is action.
<P>
<B>(1945)</B>
<P>
	People will not be fooled. They know full well that, with the UI 
reform which is going on, the minister might, at some point, reduce 
their UI premiums in a fit of generosity, but that, meanwhile, social 
assistance budgets will have to be increased and the provinces are 
the ones that have to pay.
<P>
	If the provinces are forced to increase their share of taxation, to 
tax the same people who said they are tired of paying for the 
unemployed, we are going in circles. Nobody addresses the real 
issue. We could say that following this policy is like burying one's 
head in the sand. At some point, we must face the problem et roll 
up our sleeves.
<P>
	I took a lot of notes today and I noticed another small point. It 
seems that the government wants to ram Bill C-12 through. I must 
remind the House that the former Minister of Human Resources 
Development has been talking about a reform for more than two 
years, but it was only before Christmas, just after the referendum, 
that we began to get an idea on the kind of reform he was 
considering. The victims, the people directly concerned by this, did 
not wait long before expressing their opposition.
<P>
	What is the rush when the minister has taken two years to think 
about how and where to cut? How is it that everything has to be 
done between now, in early March, and July 1? Does the minister 
realize that the unemployed do not have secretaries to defend their 
position? I believe he is going at this a little too fast.
<P>
	The minister also talked about sensitivity. I just said that it will 
be the same people who will be affected if we reduce 
unemployment insurance premiums, if we reduce deductions 
which will levied on this, it will the same people who will have to 
contribute more to their province for social assistance.
<P>
	I would like, through the House and with your help, to address 
the people who are fortunate enough to be working today, the 
directors and owners of businesses. They are fortunate to be 
working, and I am happy for them. I am asking them to put pressure 
on the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Human Resources 
Development so that the government uses part of the savings 
obtained at the expense of the unemployed to stimulate the 
economy and, above all, to put into practice what it preached after 
October 30, that is decentralization.
<P>
	The problems in the Gaspe Peninsula are not quite the same as in 
Toronto or Montreal. I believe the time has come, in this matter, for 
the government to start thinking about decentralizing standards or 
things that will help workers by stimulating their local economy, in 
the Gaspe or in Acadia. I believe they have to use the right words to 
say it and the right means to do it.
<P>
	At present, we do not see that kind of sensitivity. For all these 
reasons, I support my colleague from Roberval, and I hope that the 
government will withdraw this bill if it really wants to improve the 
situation of the unemployed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to ask the member for Gaspé a question as it relates to the gap. That 
is a very important issue. He has many fishermen in his riding who 
work different portions of a season and therefore have a gap.
<P>
	The minister has made it very clear there is some concern in 
various regions based on that issue. He has signalled to all 
members of Parliament, especially to one member who spent a lot 
of time on this issue, the member for 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury. We call it the Scott proposal 
because it was made by one of our members.
<P>
	The proposal is basically structured like this. Instead of allowing 
those gaps to exist, people on UI would be allowed to go back 26 
weeks. In any one of those 26 weeks they would find 12, 14 or 16 
weeks in order to qualify for UI.
<P>
<B>(1950)</B>
<P>
	This proposal has been bounced around by some members as a 
solution to the gap. So far we have not found anyone except for that 
member who has done that amount of work on the gap.
<P>
	I ask the member for Gaspé if he has any proposals or if he 
thinks the Scott proposal would deal with that problem in regions 
like his, particularly in industries like the fishing industry where 
there are significant gaps.
<P>
	What we are saying is if you needed 12 or 14 weeks to qualify 
you could go back 26 weeks to find those weeks and it would not 
matter if there was a gap of 2 weeks in between, and then you found 
another 4 or 5 weeks.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="632"> 632 </A></B>
<P>
	The interest I have in this is that the minister has signalled that 
we are looking for solutions to this. I want to make it quite clear 
to the opposition and the public that there is no intention of 
throwing the bill out and starting from scratch.
<P>
	A significant amount of work has been done on this bill. There 
are a lot of good parts to this bill. There are a few problems we are 
trying to deal with. One is the gap.
<P>
	I want to know from the member for Gaspé whether he agrees 
with the Scott proposal or whether he has one of his own that could 
help with that problem, which he suggests is one of the reasons we 
should scrap this legislation presently in front of the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad to see that my 
words have made the new Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Human Resource Development aware of the existence of the 
riding of Gaspé.
<P>
	To give more information to the hon. member, I will say that, in 
the riding of Gaspé, which covers the Gaspe Peninsula and the 
Magdalen Islands, the unemployment rate is about 18.9 per cent, 
and 43 per cent of the labour force is ready and willing to work. 
That means that even if we are told-and I do not know exactly 
what ``gap'' means, but I will read the translation later on. For the 
moment, areas like mine must be considered disaster areas because 
of the lack of jobs.
<P>
	Then if we compare the definition of ``disaster area'' with that of 
``developing area'' I think that the necessary emergency measures 
must be taken.
<P>
	Where will the fishermen and even the construction workers find 
the missing work weeks? It would be very difficult to force people 
from the Gaspe Peninsula to expatriate themselves to Toronto or 
Montreal. Unemployment rates are already high and employment 
opportunities are few in those cities. I do not think that this is the 
solution.
<P>
	People want things to be done locally, they want to energize their 
communities. That is what we are doing right now in the fishery. 
There has to be streamlining, and that will be done. Different things 
must be done, but there is no forum to allow people to make their 
views on this known, at the present time.
<P>
	I remind the parliamentary secretary that the federal fisheries 
minister is still responsible for license management, a 
responsibility that Quebec had claimed. It worked very well before 
1984. It could be a way of helping the economy of my region.
<P>
	I ask the parliamentary secretary to inform the fisheries minister 
that it could be a good solution. What would we do with that? We 
have to think about changing the marketing system and, for that, 
we need to have control over licenses.
<P>
	There are other types of industries that need some adjustment. 
People in the Gaspé Peninsula want decentralization. There are still 
areas in Canada, like forest and mine management, that need to be 
decentralized. There are areas from which the federal government 
must withdraw.
<P>
	First, in the absence of a reduction in the unemployment rate, we 
ask that the present system be maintained and we ask, and here you 
will get the support of all people concerned, for constructive 
measures. We see no constructive measure in this Bill. What we see 
is that you are using insurance to reduce your deficit. But what 
about measures which will really revitalise this area? There are 
none and it is regrettable. I would be ready to work with you, 
whatever my allegiance. For the time being, we are still a part of 
Canada and my riding is among the most severely affected by that 
plan.
<P>
<B>(1955)</B>
<P>
	I don't know if this answers the questions of the parliamentary 
secretary, but welcome to the Gaspé. It could be a good area in 
which to launch something.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Mr. Speaker, what the hon. member asks is very 
similar to what I always ask when I stand up in the House. I come 
from a region very similar to his in a lot of respects. It is not part of 
the Torontos of the world or the Montreals; it is in the outlying 
regions.
<P>
	The hon. member might not have had an opportunity to read the 
bill in its entirety. There are two areas I want to ask him about.
<P>
	There is the $100 million investment program to create jobs at 
the local level. There is also the $300 million job fund for high 
unemployment areas such as his and mine. I think that will be very 
valuable in helping us create jobs or put together programs and 
policies of a local nature.
<P>
	If he looks at the bill very closely he will also note there are five 
tools over which the local areas will have control, including the one 
he represents.
<P>
	Another aspect of the bill is very important to the hon. member 
because he signalled that UI is a problem but social assistance is 
probably a bigger problem. In the new bill 45 per cent of the social 
assistance population will be eligible for re-employment 
initiatives. It never existed before that people on social assistance 
could qualify for measures which would help them to return to the 
workforce.
<P>
	Does the member not think these are major improvements for his 
region, which has high unemployment and a large population on 
social assistance, similar to my region?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="633"> 633 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, the few measures contained 
in the program, referring to a $100 million project, are for all of 
Canada.
<P>
	I would like to draw the parliamentary secretary's attention to 
the real impact of the cuts and of the implementation of the new 
employment insurance program, as they are calling it, in our 
region. According to the figures given to the people in the Gaspé 
employment centres, according to indications in the Minister of 
Finance's budget, the cuts will reach $17 million in my region 
alone, the Gaspé Peninsula and the Islands. This is for HRD, 
Human Resources Development, alone.
<P>
	As for the fisheries, the new Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is 
maintaining the increases in fishery charges. This represents a tax 
bite of some $50 million for the minister across Canada.
<P>
	The rule of thumb is that Quebec's share of fish landings is about 
10 per cent. This will be another $5 million taken out of the Gaspé 
and Magdalen Islands region, given our share of fish landings in 
Canada. So we are losing $17 million from human resources 
development, and $5 million from the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans, for a total of $22 million in the first year, starting onJuly 1st.
<P>
	In return, what share will I get of the $100 million that he says 
will be spent throughout Canada? This is just one riding out of 295. 
It may well be the worst off of them all, but it still has to make a 
contribution. Could the parliamentary secretary ask the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans to slow the pace? Could he ask this minister 
to withdraw the bill, because it is another hard blow for us?
<P>
	I have no choice but to demand the withdrawal of the bill. The 
hon. member's arguments did not convince me. I understand there 
is pressure from financial circles, but they do have a social 
responsibility. They cannot behave like private enterprise that just 
has to keep making profits. We have human lives to protect, we 
must get them up and running again. It is unfortunate, indeed, but I 
still want it withdrawn. However, I shall again be interested in 
debating with you, once you have withdrawn it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to order made 
earlier today, the amendment by Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southwest) 
shall be deemed to have been put to the vote, and the division 
thereon demanded and deferred until tomorrow at 6.30 p.m. The 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2.00 p.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 8.00 p.m.)
