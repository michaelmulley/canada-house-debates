<A NAME="LINK4">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion 
of this House, the Government should authorize a proclamation to 
be issued by the Governor General under the Great Seal of Canada 
amending Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
to: (a) recognize the fundamental right of individuals to pursue 
family life free from undue interference by the state and (b) 
recognize the fundamental right, responsibility and liberty of 
parents to direct the upbringing of their children, and urge the 
legislative assemblies of the other provinces to do likewise. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am both pleased and disappointed this 
morning to be leading the debate on a topic that is so important 
to families all across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if it would make any difference to the members of this 
House and to the people of Canada if they knew that the state had 
more power than parents to determine what is in the best 
interests of children.  I wonder if it would make any difference 
to all of us here and to parents if they realized the unlimited 
power of the state to take children away from parents without any 
real evidence whatsoever.  Today I will present evidence that 
parents have only time consuming, expensive legal recourse if 
their rights are abused because of the legislation and the 
bureaucracy working against parents and that the government is 
clearly abusing their powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some concrete examples, or should I say horror stories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until February 1995 Charles and Sandra Butler home schooled 
their children, ages 11, 8 and 5, which is permissible in 
Newfoundland as long as the curriculum is accredited by the 
district school board.  The Butlers followed a home school 
curriculum developed by the Seventh Day Adventist Church that the 
local school board had refused to accredit.  The family had no 
history of neglect or abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department of social services decided that the Butler 
children were in need of protection under the province's child 
welfare act on the grounds that the Butlers had neglected to 
provide adequately for the education of their children.  The 
Butlers' three children were apprehended even though the five 
year old was not required by law to go to school.  Social workers 
expanded their list of grounds for taking the children away from 
their parents to include concerns about the children's health and 
education, possible physical and/or emotional abuse and the 
religious zealotry of their parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A judge granted social services temporary custody of the 
children for a four month period.  The Butlers were forced to 
hire a lawyer and appeal the judge's orders on the grounds that, 
first, the judge applied an improper standard of proof; second, 
he relied on inadmissible evidence and hearsay; third, the 
hearing violated the principles of fundamental justice; fourth, 
the parents were not properly informed of the nature of the 
hearing; and fifth, the parents were not given an opportunity to 
call evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1995, more than 10 months after their kids were 
taken from them, the court granted the Butlers' appeal and 
ordered the children be returned immediately to their parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her conclusions the judge found that the Butlers' parental 
rights under section 7 of the charter of rights and freedoms had 
been violated.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She also concluded that the children's academic abilities seemed 
normal for their age.  They appeared well adjusted.  They were 
physically healthy.  They were rarely sick.  There was absolutely 
no evidence that the parents physically or mentally abused their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She also agreed that the bureaucrats had not handled the case in 
a manner in keeping with the principles of fundamental justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Butler children had to spend more than six months in foster 
care.  This government-enforced separation of children from their 
parents was devastating for the kids, the family and the family's 
relationship with the community in which it lived.  All of it was 
totally unnecessary.  A proper investigation by government 
bureaucrats at the outset would have arrived at exactly the same 
conclusions that the judge did in court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The abuse here was by government bureaucrats, not the parents, 
even though the judge concluded that the Butlers had parental 
rights under the charter.  Had parental rights been in the 
charter it may have actually resulted in the bureaucrats 
conducting a proper investigation before scooping the Butlers' 
kids and keeping them separated for six months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many horror stories.  Here is another one.  In June 
1995 a Nanaimo couple's three children were taken from them by 
social services.  Terry and Lisa Neave's two-year old daughter 
was taken to hospital for testing and treatment of a choking 
disorder.  One day before the transfer a paediatrician taught 
Mrs. Neave a jaw-thrust manoeuvre that would clear her daughter's 
air wave when she was choking.  The manoeuvre involved raising 
the child's jaw with a hand at her neck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the children's hospital in Vancouver, Lisa Neave and her 
daughter were assigned a double room with another mother and sick 
child.  Mrs. Neave performed the manoeuvre on her daughter during 
a choking episode.  The other mother reported what she thought 
was abuse to the hospital authorities.  Mrs. Neave was required 
to explain her paediatrician's instructions to a social worker 
and to the head of the hospital's child protection unit.  The 
head of the child protection unit concluded that Mrs. Neave had 
an unusual form of child abuse in which a parent fabricates an 
illness for their child.  Without checking with the Neave's 
paediatrician or family doctor, the next day social services 
apprehended all three of the Neave's children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though no one had ever seen Mrs. Neave abuse her children, 
a judge ruled that Mrs. Neave was a high risk to her children. 
The Neave's family doctor and paediatrician tried to contact the 
social worker.  They reported that their calls were not even 
returned.  The children were not allowed to come home until 
December and Mr. Neave still had to act as supervisor over his 
wife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January the results of the court ordered psychiatric 
assessment of Mrs. Neave concluded that Mrs. Neave's only 
psychiatric problem was caused by her children being taken away 
from her and by the RCMP investigation.  In February the court 
orders imposed by the department of social services were set 
aside.  The Neave's children had lived away from home for five 
months.  Their legal bills exceeded $10,000.  All this could have 
been avoided if the social worker had simply called the 
paediatrician and confirmed the instructions Mrs. Neave had 
received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having parental rights included in the charter of rights and 
freedoms may have prevented this travesty of justice and this 
emotional nightmare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other examples like this that I could relate to 
members.  These ought to be of grave concern to all Canadians. 
Unfortunately, the charter of rights and freedoms only protects 
an individual's rights and freedoms, it does not provide the 
legal framework for this balancing of parental rights, children's 
rights and the rights of the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I maintain this is why parental rights and responsibilities need 
to be included in our charter.  Child abuse by the state is just 
as abhorrent as child abuse by parents.  There needs to be a 
proper balance between the rights of parents to raise their 
children and the right of the state to interfere.  That is why 
M-33 is here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My main point is this.  Parents have a responsibility to provide 
their children with the necessities of life.  As long as parents 
meet this fundamental responsibility to their children 
governments should respect the fundamental right of parents to 
raise their children free from undue interference by the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cindy Silver, a Vancouver lawyer, points out that the dignity 
and worth of both individuals and families in a free society were 
prominent in the Canadian Bill of Rights, but any reference to 
the family was omitted from the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms.  She says that omitting the reference to family in the 
charter of rights and freedoms contributed significantly to the 
demise of family autonomy and the devaluing of the family in law 
and legislature.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Motion No. 33 would correct this oversight and return a 
proper balance between parental rights and responsibilities and 
help reaffirm the state's proper role in family life in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 15 of the charter states every individual is equal 
before and under the law and has the right to equal benefit of 
the law without discrimination.  Ms. Silver correctly points out 
that because the charter includes age as a prohibited ground for 
discrimination this effectively changed the constitutional status 
of children, making them equal to adults under the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Making children equal under the law and omitting family and 
parents from our Constitution has put child rights groups in 
charge of the political agenda and left parents with little or no 
defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what is happening as result.  In 1991 Canada ratified 
the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, a 
document which tried to address all the concerns raised by child 
rights groups around the world.  Ms. Silver states: “As a 
result, the UN convention confers both protective rights and 
choice rights, thereby establishing a presumption that children 
should be able to act autonomously whenever possible”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Silver then outlines the choice rights that governments now 
endorse for all children in Canada regardless of what parents 
think is good or bad for their children.  Article 13 states the 
right to freedom of expression, including the right to seek, 
receive and impart information and the ideas of all kinds, 
whether orally or in writing, in the form of art or through any 
media of the child's choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 14 states the right of freedom to thought, conscience 
and religion.  Article 15 states the right to freedom of 
association.  Article 16 states the right to privacy. Article 19 
states the right to be free from all forms of physical and mental 
violence. Article 19 has been interpreted by the UN convention 
review committee to include freedom from simple spankings by a 
loving parent to help correct a child's behaviour from time to 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1995 the review committee criticized Canada for failing 
to repeal section 43 of the Criminal Code, the section that 
provides a defence for parents who use corporal punishment, 
reasonable under the circumstances, to correct their children's 
behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the UN convention and the review committee's 
recommendation have no legal force in Canadian law, this does not 
prevent the no spanking lobbyists from pushing the government to 
change the law.  Nor has the federal government been an innocent 
bystander.  The government has been providing funds for these 
anti-spanking, anti-parental rights lobby groups to do research 
and to launch court challenges to advance their cause.  That is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents and families are left to defend themselves from this 
intrusion by the state while government provides moral and 
financial support to lobby groups that would diminish parental 
rights and family autonomy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Silver's paper states: “Since 1992 the federal government 
has allocated $459 million toward conforming Canada's law and 
policy to the provisions of the UN convention.  Part of this 
amount was used in 1992 to create the children's bureau of Health 
Canada whose mandate is to ensure consistency with the UN 
convention and co-ordination for all federal program and policies 
for children”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is expenditure of human and financial resources by the 
government to implement a UN convention that has not even been 
debated or approved by members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dallas Miller, legal counsel for the Home School Legal Defence 
Association of Canada, describes the negative aspect of the 
United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in an action 
paper he prepared for home schoolers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It states: “Although several of the provisions offered 
generally positive, non-offensive platitudes, a substantial 
portion of the convention undermines parental rights.  These 
threats to the family generally fall into three categories: 
first, transfer of God given parental rights and responsibilities 
to the state; second, the institutionalization of rebellion by 
vesting children with various fundamental rights which advance 
notions of the children's autonomy and freedom from parental 
guidance; third, the establishment of bureaucracies and 
institutions of a national and international nature designed to 
promote the ideas proclaimed in the charter of the United Nations 
and to investigate and prosecute parents who violate these 
children's rights”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Miller has analysed each article in the UN convention and he 
highlights how the charter could be used to undermine parental 
rights and responsibilities.  Here are just a few examples he 
cites.  Article 3: In an article concerning children the courts, 
social service workers and bureaucrats are empowered to regulate 
families based on the bureaucrats' subjective determination of 
what is in the best interests of the child. That is happening in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 4: Signatory nations are bound to undertake all 
appropriate legislative, administrative and other measures for 
the implementation of rights articulated in the convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 13:  Little children are vested with the virtual 
absolute freedom of expression and under this provision parents 
could lose the right to prevent their children from interaction 
with pornography, rock music with profane lyrics or violent 
television shows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is terrible that this is allowed. Children are guaranteed 
freedom of thought, conscience and religion.  Children have the 
legal right to object to all religious training from their 
parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 15: This article declares the right of the child to 
freedom of association.  Children could claim a fundamental right 
to join street gangs, cults or racist organizations over parental 
objections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have many other things I would like to present and that is why 
I have introduced Motion No. 33.  I feel strongly about the 
issue, as more than 6,000 petitions support my efforts to 
strengthen protection for parental rights from undue interference 
by the nanny state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents must have the freedom to do what I think is in the best 
interests of their children.  If the government thinks they are 
wrong, section 1 of the charter guarantees the government can 
only interfere in accordance with reasonable limits prescribed by 
law that can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, my motion proposes to institute a proper balance 
between children's right, parental rights and the rights of the 
state.  I would like to respectfully request at this time, with 
the consent of the House, to make Motion No. 33 a votable item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent that this 
motion be deemed votable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
stand today to speak to the motion to amend section 7 of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I would like to say the hon. member from the Reform 
side uses exceptional cases to make his point and not what is the 
general rule in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 7 of the charter says: “Everyone has the right to life, 
liberty and security of the person and the right not to be 
deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of the 
fundamental justice”.  It sets out a balance between the rights 
of the individual and the rights of the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In looking for protection under section 7, one first asks if 
there has been an infringement of one of the three protected 
interests, deprivation of life, liberty or security of the 
person, and then asks if such deprivation was in accordance with 
the principles of fundamental justice.  These principles are 
found in the basic tenets of our legal system and are vital to 
our societal notion of justice. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the member's motion is to add to section 7 the 
fundamental right of individuals to pursue family life free from 
undue interference by the state, as well as the fundamental 
right and responsibility of parents to direct the upbringing of 
their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On first examination, there is nothing reprehensible about this 
motion.  One might indeed be tempted to support it, for who 
among us does not think that Canadians are entitled to a rich 
and rewarding family life free from undue interference by the 
state, and who would not encourage the right and, of course, the 
responsibility of parents to direct the upbringing of their 
children? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada takes seriously its responsibilities toward its children. 
For example, in December 1991 Canada ratified the United Nations 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, a broad ranging treaty 
which delineates the civil, political, economic, social and 
cultural rights of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a leader in drafting the convention, Canada has been noted 
for its action on behalf of children.  As a mother of two 
daughters, I am reassured that the government has done everything 
to acknowledge that children also have rights in our society and 
takes action to protect those rights here in Canada and 
throughout the world.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The family has been recognized and entrenched in the Canadian 
legal system in a myriad of ways.  It has been supported and 
treated as a fundamental building block of our nation.  One can 
look to laws concerning the validity of marriage, dissolution of 
marriage with its attendant need to provide for the financial 
interest of the parties and the continued well-being of children, 
and recent developments such as the government's child support 
guidelines initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We provide support to families through a vast array of programs 
and policies.  The Criminal Code of Canada protects children from 
abuse and neglect, as do child welfare agencies throughout the 
provinces and territories.  Our tax system treats family 
relationships in a way that differs from individuals. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada in no way fails to respect families.  It supports parents 
who look after their children's upbringing.  No one is worried 
that Canada will introduce measures of oppression, interference 
or repression with respect to the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore do not understand what the risks are to which 
families and children are exposed and which the motion before us 
seeks to eliminate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the state interfere in family life in Canada today?  There 
is no doubt that it can and, in some cases, it even has an 
obligation to do so. 
Ideally, every parent should be a loving parent, every child 
happy, healthy and safe from danger, and every family a refuge 
from the hustle and bustle of daily life, a place of warmth, 
security and affection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have only to read the newspapers, listen to the news and turn 
on the television, however, to realize that this is not the 
case, and the member has given examples to prove it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Families in Canada today do not need more protection from state 
interference.  Every day in this country there is enacted a 
delicate balancing act wherein the state uses its powers 
carefully, some may say too carefully, to protect vulnerable 
family members, women, children and the elderly, from harm. The 
rights of individuals are weighed and where the balance tips the 
state steps in to take care of its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think Canadians wish to see those capabilities eroded. 
Our society is outraged when we read of children returned to or 
left in abusive families.  Every day we read of that in the local 
newspapers.  Do we really wish to further hamper the efforts of 
our child welfare authorities?  Do we really want long charter 
based challenges clogging up our court systems while the 
vulnerable continue to be harmed? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts have examined section 7 of the charter and its impact 
on family rights.  It is not my intention today to give a list 
of all the relevant case law.  There simply would not be the 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our courts have concluded that the right to raise a child 
is part of a parent's right to liberty. 
They have ruled that the state should interfere only when 
necessary, thus confirming that the rights of parents are vital 
in our society.  It is not a question of recognizing parents' 
right of ownership over children, but of recognizing parents' 
rights to make decisions in the interest of the child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our common law rules have long recognized, however, the right 
and the power of the state to step in to protect children at 
risk. 
That is a fundamental principle of our law. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion and in the opinion of the government we do not 
need this amendment to section 7 of the charter.  Canadian 
families are protected from undue interference by the state and 
parents have the right to raise their children within the limits 
of the law.  The law is there to protect those who are the most 
vulnerable in our society and those who are our most precious 
resource, our children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps members find this a difficult issue to talk about.  I 
will state something personal for the record.  I have received a 
lot of mail on an issue which the hon. member who introduced this 
motion referred to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not personally in favour of repealing section 43 of the 
Criminal Code. 
I certainly made that clear to a lot of constituents who have 
written to me about this.  I know I have colleagues who take an 
opposite view.  However for the record, being private members' 
business and all, I do not take that view.  I do not think the 
government does either.  At least that is what it says.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are being whipped up into a frenzy in some quarters about 
the prospect of this article of the Criminal Code being repealed 
when I do not see any evidence that the government has this 
intention.  Certainly it would not have my support if the 
government did have that intention, if it were to come before the 
House that the government was trying to repeal it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member has done is point out in a different way 
something I commented on years ago in this House during the final 
debate on the charter, which is that is the charter of rights and 
freedoms institutionalizes in this country a small <I>l</I> 
liberal individualist view of society and it has its limitations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance it does not adequately recognize the rights of 
communities or of collectivities.  It tends to regard all human 
life as the interaction of individuals.  It goes beyond that to 
some degree when it recognizes the existence of aboriginal rights 
but I think it certainly is still limited in so far as it only 
succeeded in enshrining the small <I>l</I> liberal individualistic 
view of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to say that there is anything particularly wrong 
with that point of view.  It is just that it does not encompass 
the complexities of the relationships we have with each other 
both as individuals and as groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was something I pointed out then and I think it continues 
to be true.  The member argues that it does not adequately take 
into account the reality of the family.  I am listening to that 
argument.  In fact I read the articles he sent around. There are 
some concerns expressed in those articles which I agree with.  At 
this point anyway I remain unconvinced that anything could be 
accomplished by actually putting into the charter something 
having to do with parents and families.  I personally am not 
opposed in principle to that idea, I am just not sure how it 
would work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I find curious in the debate that unfolded 
this morning, and it takes on this shape in other forums and on 
other issues, is this tension between the state and the family. 
To some degree I do not know whether to call it exaggerated or 
misplaced or a bit of a phoney war in this sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think both the state and the family are losing out to the 
marketplace.  There are two more fundamentally weaker and weaker 
institutions in our society, the state and the family. The 
reaction of those who are concerned about family values is to 
attack the state. It may be appropriate in some cases to do so 
but it is totally inappropriate in any case not to recognize that 
what is eating away at family values every bit as much as some of 
the things that are attributed to the state are the values of the 
marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all it is not the state that creates and maintains the 
culture of violence we see on our TV screens.  It happens because 
of the very successful marketing on the part of the TV companies. 
The advertisers participate in this.  They will pay higher rates 
for programs they know have the attraction that comes with 
violence. We see this more and more in sports as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the state that is the purveyor of pornography. 
We see this wrong attitude toward human relationships and toward 
women and men not just in what we strictly call pornography; we 
see it in advertising all the time.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time we turn on the TV people with young children have to 
worry about what boundary will be pushed by private advertisers, 
by people many of us in this place hold as examples:  “Boy, that 
guy is a good marketer.  Boy, that company is a good marketing 
company.  Boy, they really know how to sell their product, look 
how their stocks have risen in the marketplace”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be obvious but what I find difficult to take is this 
concentration alone on ways in which the state may be undermining 
the moral fabric of the country.  I find this difficult to take 
when it is not accompanied by an equally vigorous attack on the 
values used in selling a product, that the end justifies the 
means, that sex or whatever the case may be can be used to sell 
the product and that is just the way the market works and we have 
to accept that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we have to accept that.  If we want to create a 
moral society, we have to be prepared to be comprehensive in our 
view of this and not just single out the things that fit our 
ideological predisposition.  We have to be willing to take on the 
marketplace. This is not something we are willing to do, 
particularly in this day and age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who talk about the marketplace in this way, like myself, 
are regarded as some kind of archaic old socialist who has not 
embraced the freedom that comes from the marketplace where people 
do what they want.  People sell what they want.  People do 
whatever is permissible in order to sell their product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members who are concerned about these things to think 
about this as well because to the extent that we cultivate a 
particular ethic when it comes to the marketplace, we reinforce 
values that perhaps we do not really want to reinforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often say when we speak of youth crime that young people do 
not seem to have any values.  Well maybe they do.  Maybe young 
people have picked up the values of the marketplace instead of 
the values of the family or the values of the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps young people have picked up on the value that what 
matters is the bottom line, that what is important is the 
quarterly profit margin. It does not matter how many people have 
to be laid off or how many hospital beds have to close whatever 
the case may be whether it is the state or a private company 
depending on what kind of activity is involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps young people have picked up that for 15 years we have 
been glorifying the ethic of every man for himself, every person 
for him or herself and that we regard as romantic, unrealistic 
and idealistic in a pejorative and patronizing way anyone who 
says that maybe this is wrong and maybe we should not exalt these 
types of values at the expense of everything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly invite people who are concerned about the 
points the member was concerned about to rethink this as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today on behalf of the Progressive 
Conservative Party to speak to the Reform motion respecting 
Canadian families and the role and responsibility of parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Progressive Conservative Party believe that ultimately 
the raising of children is the responsibility of parents.  We 
believe in supporting families to raise children in the best 
possible manner so they can become productive citizens in our 
society. We encourage families to enable the potential of each 
and every child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today speaks of amending the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms in order to allow individuals to 
pursue family life free from undue interference by the state and 
to recognize the fundamental right and responsibility of parents 
to direct the upbringing of their children. 
If we are proposing to amend the charter to allow this, what 
exactly is it that we would amend? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 7 of the charter of rights states “Everyone has the 
right to life, liberty and security of person and the right not 
to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles 
of fundamental justice”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that this section of the charter does not need to be 
amended to provide families with the ability to raise their 
children in the manner they see fit.  Section 7 provides parents 
with the right to liberty, freedom to raise their children as 
they see fit within the common fundamental values of society. We 
would argue that existing laws already provide parents with the 
ability to raise their children without undue interference of the 
state within the framework of the common public good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is undue interference? The member proposing this motion 
speaks of the concern that parents have that if they spank their 
children in public their children would be taken away from them 
by the authorities.  This he says is undue interference in family 
life.  Spanking a child as a disciplinary measure is an issue 
which is hotly debated but to my knowledge most child welfare 
agencies in the provinces regard spanking a child's bottom as a 
grey area between discipline and abuse. Ways of disciplining 
children is an issue that should continue to be debated by our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What of the necessity to protect children unfortunately 
sometimes from their own parents?  Would the Reform Party 
amendment to the charter of rights and freedoms prevent the 
government from exercising its ability to protect children who 
are suffering from abuse, sexual and otherwise? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children should be raised within their families.  Families are 
the basis of Canadian society.  Parents should be responsible for 
their children. But the state must have the ability to protect 
children in situations where the parents are unable or unwilling 
to assume that responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Removing a child from the family under current provincial laws 
is not as simple as members of the Reform Party would make us 
believe.  Child protection workers must use the least intrusive 
measures possible and social workers are charged with showing 
that removing the child is in the child's best interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Child welfare legislation is quite specific stating that 
children can only be removed if evidence of emotional, physical 
or sexual abuse, or neglect can be proven before the courts. 
Instead, much work is placed in trying to assist families to 
better deal with the stresses of everyday life so that children 
are not neglected, not abused and families can work and live 
together without abuse or neglect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this an undue interference in people's lives?  To me this is 
trying to strengthen the family unit rather than break it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that the Reform Party proposes an amendment to the 
charter of rights and freedoms to allow parents to raise their 
children without interference by the state.  The Reform Party's 
principles and policies state: “The Reform Party recognizes that 
child abuse and family violence attack the very foundation of 
organized society.  The party supports enacting, communicating 
and enforcing laws that protect family members against such 
acts”. Would the Reform Party's own principle not conflict with 
the motion before us today?  The Reform Party's policies and 
principles appear to contradict the hon. member's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform calls for a lowering of the age at which offenders should 
be tried as adults.  Even though these children would still be 
considered minors, Reform's policy would call for an intervention 
by the state into the ability of parents to raise and discipline 
their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we do not need to amend the charter of rights and 
freedoms to allow parents to raise their families in the manner 
they best see fit.  What we need is a better informed discussion 
on the issues that prompted the member to bring forth this 
motion.  We also need to ensure that family poverty is not the 
cause of abuse or neglect of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a society we need to focus on the needs of today's children 
because they will be the ones representing Canada in this House 
in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the hon. member for bringing forward an 
issue which should be debated and should be questioned in this 
House.  The issue is not to change the charter of rights and 
freedoms to be able to accomplish what the hon. member has 
suggested.  One cannot legislate that and good family values. 
Those family values must and will come from families and the 
parents of the children themselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand before you, Mr. Speaker, very proud of the job that my 
wife, my family and I have done to make sure that my children are 
constructive members of society.  That was done without 
legislation.  That was done with pride and with obvious 
dedication from both parents, and certainly dedication from my 
children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak briefly to the motion.  I 
want to make sure that I leave the appropriate amount of time for 
the hon. member who moved the motion.  I would appreciate if you 
would give me a signal to ensure I do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is very important.  I think many members of the House 
have not fully recognized how important it is.  It is important 
because Canadians have had a long history of respecting the role 
of the family in Canadian society.  They are concerned 
historically about the separation of state and family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the Canadian bill of rights which in its preamble 
clearly states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliament of Canada, affirming that the Canadian Nation is 
founded upon principles that acknowledge the supremacy of God, 
the dignity and worth of human person and the position of the 
family in a society of free men and free institutions; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Entrenched in our bill of rights was a recognition by the 
founders of our nation that the family had a unique and special 
place in our country.  In the same way Reformers who are 
Canadians and have shaped our policy are also concerned.  That is 
why in our party documents we have a statement that says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party affirms the duty of parents to raise their 
children responsibly according to their own conscience and 
beliefs, and further affirms that no person, government, or 
agency has a right to interfere in the exercise of that duty, as 
long as the actions of the parents do not constitute abuse or 
neglect. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concern is that there seems to have been an erosion of the 
respect for the role of family in the Canadian mosaic and in our 
laws.  I refer to the preamble that is now in the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms which superseded the bill of 
rights as we all know.  That preamble states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas Canada is founded upon principles that recognize the 
supremacy of God and the rule of law: 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no reference to the family.  It has been taken out, an 
omission which although may seem insignificant to some is having 
impacts in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parent-child bond is so critical to the long term health of 
our nation and starts first in the physical sense.  Actually it 
is even before children are born.  They are saying now in some 
studies that the child in the womb can recognize the mother's 
voice and certain movements.  I know in my own case I have twin 
daughters, one is very active and one is a little more sedate. We 
knew the one that was very active even in the womb.  She was so 
active and she is still the same today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A nursing mother has a closeness with her children and passes on 
certain antibiotics.   My point here is that the physical needs 
of the children are met by the parents.  There are new studies 
showing the importance of physical contact with parents. Children 
develop trust as their needs are met and they are put in a stable 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also there are studies showing—I saw one over 10 years ago—the 
negative impacts of changing caregivers, what that does to 
children and the long term effects of psychosis which can come 
from it.  It is so common, as we see in many day care centres 
today.  It is from our parents and our families that we actually 
get our identity; he looks like Uncle Joe or she looks like Aunt 
Mary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are sacrifices for sure in raising children, but in 
anything worthwhile there are big rewards.  Seeing one's child go 
from the womb to adulthood is a special investment that reaps 
great rewards for parents.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one is in a better position to do this than parents.  No well 
intentioned state or social agency will ever be able to usurp the 
role of the parent.  That is why our forefathers were sure to 
entrench that in our bill of rights and in our legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to see that parents have a hand in shaping 
the mental capabilities of children.  There is a new study out 
that I read recently which indicates that the cognitive and 
mental development of a child from age zero to three is critical. 
If they are not properly stimulated in the right environment with 
their parents and are left alone, for example, as was referred to 
in some tragic cases, certain parts of the brain do not develop. 
Even as they get older, after the age of three, they cannot 
recoup that loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is such a critical time and only a parent who loves the 
children can provide what is needed for the long term best 
interest of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within families we teach children how to get along.  We teach 
within families how to share, how to be considerate of others, 
how to give up our own personal desires and learn how to control 
our emotions and gain self-control.  Sometimes we do not always 
get our own way.  For the good of the family we may have to back 
away from something.  In this day and age when everyone is 
clamouring for rights, the family is one institution where we 
need to learn that we do not always get our own way for the best 
of the family.  Respect for authority is birthed in the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote how important the parent-child bond is by referring to a 
comprehensive study done in 1996 by the Foundation of Family 
Research and Education.  It stated that in the area of children's 
emotional bonding with parents regular non-parental care 
increased the risk of children developing insecure bonds by 66%. 
It also stated that the results from this work and others 
conducted since demonstrated that insecure bonding to parents in 
childhood was a direct cause of clinical levels of emotional and 
behavioural problems in adolescents, including youth crime. It 
indicated that it was clear the family was the primary arena of 
influence in the development of children and adolescents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at some of the challenges we have with our youth 
today, it just underlines the need to ensure that the autonomy of 
the family is protected.  We go beyond just protecting it to 
supporting, strengthening and encouraging the family for the long 
term health of the country.  I applaud the member for bringing 
forward a motion like this one that is designed with that intent 
in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to move to one additional area briefly, the loving 
concern that parents have for their children.  They want things 
to go all right for them.  They want them to have a happy and 
good life.  We all know this.  Parents are in the first and best 
position to pass on the core foundational values that will carry 
children through their lives.  These values the parents have 
themselves.  They have tried them in the crucible of life, things 
that they were taught and have tested as they have gone through 
life.  When parents look back, as I do, there are some things 
they wish they had not done.  I have learned some lessons.  My 
concern is that I impart to my children the very best lessons I 
have learned for their best interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No state or social institution can do that with the same love 
and concern that a parent has for a child.  I applaud 
grandparents in this respect as well.  Much can be gained from 
grandparents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents establish a foundation in their children.  The children 
test the foundation and may change it and develop their own when 
they are adults.  However, the best person to impart that 
foundation is the parent.  No system, no government or no agency 
should interfere in this work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are families that have troubles and problems, and some of 
them are tragic.  The pressures families face today are enormous 
in this technological age.  In our enthusiasm sometimes we look 
for a quick fix and we think we know better.  However, we should 
always be cautious of a bureaucracy eager to expand, where 
government will fix everything. 
That is a medicine that is worse than what is being treated.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really want to help Canadian children we must respect the 
special relationship between parents and their children just as 
our forefathers did in shaping of the bill of rights. Governments 
and bureaucratic social agencies do not serve families by coming 
between the parent and their children.  If anything, their focus 
should also be to support, encourage and strengthen healthy 
family relationships rather than interfere with them.  Let us 
help parents, not replace them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We will go to the member for 
Wentworth—Burlington who will take us to 11.59 a.m.  Then the 
hon. member whose bill it is will have five minutes to wrap up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad to have the opportunity to speak to the 
motion.  While I believe the intentions behind the motion are 
excellent, the motion is seriously flawed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may say to the member, what I find most wrong with the 
motion is that it sets the individual against the group. What he 
would propose to do with the motion is amend the charter to the 
effect that parents would have certain rights over their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very essence of rights legislation is to define the 
limitations of the state or the group on actions of the 
individual.  If we give rights to parents or the state it does 
not matter; we erode the rights of the individual.  We would get 
into terrible difficulties if we accorded special rights to 
parents.  We would get parents who might abuse their children in 
a very profound way and we would limit the ability of the state 
to intervene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand the member detects, as we all detect from our 
constituents, an erosion of the ability of custodial parents to 
manage their children in a sincere and effective way because of a 
certain fear that the state may intervene improperly when it 
attempts to apply discipline or other actions on children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a problem that is limited to parents.  It is also a 
problem that extends to other custodial figures in society like 
teachers and police officers in the course of their duties in a 
community with teenagers and other young people.  In the old days 
before the charter of rights, the teacher, parent or the local 
policeman could caution a child, could say to that child “you 
must not do this”.  They could even enforce limited discipline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real flaw in the charter of rights, which is causing the 
problem and discomfort with respect to the ability of parents, 
teachers or local police officers to discipline children, is that 
the charter accorded full civil rights to children before the age 
of majority, before the age of having the responsibility to 
exercise those rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation now where if a teacher attempts to impose 
discipline on a child in school, or even if a parent attempts to 
impose discipline on a child, the child can resort to the courts 
and actually report to the police.  We have a situation in our 
schools now where there is a great problem with respect to 
teacher-student discipline simply because children are often a 
little too alert to their rights, which has caused a major 
problem in the exercise of discipline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel the problem in the charter of rights is fundamental to 
our difficulties with the Young Offenders Act.  Whatever 
amendments come down in the Young Offenders Act, ultimately we 
will have to amend the charter of rights so that we can give not 
full civil rights to young people but return some of the 
custodial opportunities to parents, teachers and the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I support in principle the idea behind the motion, I 
regret I cannot support the motion itself.

discourage undesirable behaviour in Canada.  Armed robbery is an 
exceptional act.  The vast majority of people do not need a law 
against it, but we pass laws against it nonetheless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is abuse by bureaucrats and the state of their power.  The 
argument that the government makes holds no validity because we 
need to be protected from them.  There needs to be this balance 
and that is what I have been arguing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also complained that this would result in a 
logjam in the courts, but look what is happening now.  Parents 
have to go to great lengths to get back their children after 
having done absolutely nothing wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is designed to protect children.  People are missing 
the point.  Children need our protection and this motion would 
give them precisely that. Those who are objecting to this just 
need to look at what is happening in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could give many other examples.  I wish that the government 
members, New Democrats and Conservatives who have tried to twist 
what I have been saying would look at these more closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I quote from Mrs. Silver's paper: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These cases illustrate the margin for error in Canada's child 
protection laws place families in a vulnerable position.  This is 
not to say that the state has no role in protecting children. 
Society has a vested interest in ensuring that a child's best 
interests are served.  There are times when the state's power to 
intervene in cases of genuine physical or sexual abuse or neglect 
is crucial.  A parent's rights do not trump the rights of the 
child.  Neither are the two necessarily opposed.  The rights of 
the child must be paramount; however, where the parent and the 
state disagree is on the child's best interests.  The law must 
begin with the presumption that the parent and not the state is 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beginning at this point places the onus on the state to 
rebut the presumption according to the principles of fundamental 
justice. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kari Simpson, executive director of the Citizen's Research 
Institute in Surrey, B.C., sent me documentation on dozens of 
horror stories of kids being scooped by government officials 
under the authority of the child family and community services 
act.  People would have to contact my offices.  Obviously, I do 
not have time to go through them.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, I have received notice this 
morning of a question of privilege from the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is with some regret that I bring this matter 
forward, but I feel I am under a duty to do so.  It arises out of 
Bill C-3 which will be before the House today for amendment. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT13"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT13"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1205

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also bears on government action which I feel impedes members 
of this House in their consideration of this bill which is 
scheduled for report stage today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An essential part of the debate on Bill C-3 has to do with a 
disagreement over an important constitutional question.  Eminent 
counsel outside the government were requested to give an opinion 
with respect to the options the government was considering.  The 
chief law officer for the crown, the Minister of Justice, decided 
to go outside her department to secure the opinion of these three 
distinguished lawyers who had in the past been members of the 
judiciary.  This information was made known to members of the 
justice committee on April 20 when the minister appeared before 
the committee for main estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice felt it was necessary to get this 
judicial opinion outside her department as it bore directly on 
the issue of the timing of the taking of DNA which is central to 
the debate before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the weekend I learned that on Friday evening the opinions 
of these three eminent jurists were made available to the 
executive director of the Canadian Police Association.  At the 
same time, those opinions were not made available to members of 
the justice committee, or at least not to the members of the 
opposition I spoke with.  The information was made available to 
the director of the police association, but not to the justice 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons will be asked to vote on questions relating 
to this very important opinion which the Minister of Justice felt 
it necessary to seek.  I suggest that, as members of the House, 
we have been placed in a disadvantaged position.  I and my staff 
worked on this issue over the weekend, as did other opposition 
members in preparation for today's debate.  We did so without the 
knowledge of the opinions sought by the Minister of Justice. I 
only received these opinions this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the opinions were made available, but it would appear 
they were not delivered to the office in the same manner that 
they were delivered to the director of the Canadian Police 
Association.  I understand he received them via courier to his 
house in Brockville, while we as members of this House did not 
receive them until this morning.  I took the liberty of providing 
those opinions to my colleagues in other parties because they had 
yet to receive them at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the government's actions demonstrate that 
it cares more for the opinions of an interest group than it does 
for those of members of the justice committee who are being 
requested to speak on this issue in the House today.  The 
government has failed in its obligation to treat this House with 
the same respect as it does those who are not members of this 
Chamber.  It is the “cheque is in the mail” response.  The 
government went to the trouble of having this decision rendered 
and then did not go to the trouble of having that information 
provided to us as members of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to show any disrespect for interest groups, in 
particular the Canadian Police Association.  It is certainly 
entitled to this information as well, but the same courtesy 
should have been extended and the same effort should have been 
made to ensure members of this House had that crucial 
information.  Instead the government chose the slowest and least 
cost effective means to transmit the material.  We in this House 
have been asked to approve departmental estimates and to provide 
the department with our feedback on this important piece of 
legislation, and yet the government has communicated this 
information to us by the slowest of all possible means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit there was a breach of parliamentary privilege.  The 
government's purpose in securing a legal opinion was to influence 
the deliberations of the vote that will take place on Bill C-3, 
yet it has failed to give sufficient time for us to fully 
consider these important legal opinions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point the Chair to citation 31(10) of the sixth edition of 
Beauchesne's where a Speaker on the issue of ministerial 
communications to the House stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question has been asked whether Hon. Members are entitled, 
as part of their parliamentary privilege, to receive such 
information ahead of the general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can find no precedent to justify this suggestion. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not arguing that we have a priority to receive it before 
members of the public, but at the very least we should receive it 
at the same time.  This information relates directly to the point 
that will be debated in the House today.  It relates directly to 
the point with respect to the timing of the taking of DNA.  I 
assure the House that will be the position taken by members of 
the opposition. 
There is an obligation to make that information available in 
advance.  This action by the government, I would suggest, was not 
only contentious, but ill-thought out and ill-advised, given the 
fact that this information is before the House.  Haste makes for 
bad law and that is the danger that arises when situations like 
this occur.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I believe it is incumbent upon the Chair, at the very 
least, to consider this issue prior to the commencement of the 
debate.  We need time to review these decisions.  We need time to 
digest the opinions of these jurists who have been called upon by 
the government to render a decision and to consider them in the 
debate here prior to speaking to these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest it is urgent that we deal with this in a timely 
fashion, to use the minister's words, and that we do so prior to 
the commencement of the debate today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I support 
the points which my hon. colleague has made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important bill.  The three legal opinions that 
have been rendered were rendered after our committee exhausted 
its time to call witnesses to explore all avenues on both sides 
of this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now left in the position where the three legal opinions 
are resting upon all members of parliament with considerable 
weight and without adequate examination of the positions 
reflected in those decisions.  It certainly puts us at a 
disadvantage in terms of being able to adequately deal with the 
opinions at this particular time when we are no longer able to 
call witnesses before the committee to deal with the issues that 
have been raised in them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important in this particular case that we have time 
to do that.  If we do not, then we are simply going to take the 
weight of those three decisions without examining the rationale 
that is given within those decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have only had time to rush through the three decisions this 
morning.  We are going into debate today on this and it is not 
fair for members of parliament to have to deal with these very 
weighty decisions without time to adequately consider them or 
even to call witnesses to get their opinions on the reverse side 
of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support my hon. colleague's point of privilege. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too want 
to support my colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, I received from my colleague, the Progressive 
Conservative House leader, three legal opinions totalling 75 
pages in English only.  Unfortunately, I was preparing the eight 
motions I will present before this House and I did not have time 
to read the 75 pages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must add, however, that a legal opinion does not read like a 
Stephen King or John Chisholm novel, and I think all members 
taking part in the debate, and all the members in this House, 
should have the opportunity to read, digest and understand these 
three legal opinions, which I believe will have a significant 
role to play in the debate this afternoon or later, we hope. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
too would like to comment on this point of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Crowfoot is in fact a step ahead of me.  I 
have not yet seen the decisions that were rendered which form an 
integral part of the amendments to the legislation that certain 
parties wish to introduce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can anticipate what the justices might have said.  They might 
have agreed with my reasoning, but I do not know that and I would 
like to see their opinions.  I think they are fairly important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not know they were available until I received a phone call 
from my colleague, the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  I thank him for making that 
call to me today.  I did place a call to the chair of the 
committee to see if we might get copies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those decisions are important.  As indicated, one does not take 
lightly and read quickly the decisions of justices on a 
particular point of law.  We must make an effective and proper 
decision on this piece of legislation.  Indeed my colleagues in 
the House have questioned me about these particular issues.  I am 
sure members of the Bloc Quebecois, members of the Reform Party, 
members of the Conservative Party and perhaps even members of the 
government want to know this important piece of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too would support the question of privilege raised by my 
colleague.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the member 
for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough has defeated his own argument 
in claiming a question of privilege when he quotes Beauchesne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that citation, he indicates very clearly that there is no 
obligation on the part of the minister to have to advise members 
of parliament prior to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to assure the Speaker and hon. members that the 
Minister of Justice did render the opinions on May 1.  It was a 
Friday.  The House adjourns relatively early, at 2 o'clock on 
Fridays.  Some members may not have been present in their 
offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opinions were given to the public and to members of 
parliament.  Every single member of the justice committee 
received these opinions.  The member has claimed also that the 
government may have used the slowest possible means of 
communicating these opinions to members of parliament whereas we 
used courier services to get them to some of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We used the traditional means, the internal courier service.  In 
talking to some of my colleagues, they have not yet seen the 
opinions either because some of them have just come back today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is an obligation on the part of government 
to make sure members are in their offices to receive their 
correspondence.  That is up to members and their staff.  I beg to 
differ, that there is no question of privilege here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are still at report stage and we still have ample time to put 
forth any modifications members of the opposition would want to 
put forth.  As I said, the copies were sent through the normal 
distribution channels we have always used traditionally in this 
House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor—St. Clair, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to point out a couple of things. I received these 
opinions on Friday afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some problems. The chair of my committee was 
circulating documents. There is a procedural motion in our 
committee that we not distribute unless documents are in both 
official languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second problem is that these opinions were not ordered as a 
result of activity on our committee.  In other words, our 
committee did not ask for these opinions.  It was the minister 
acting on behalf of the government who asked for these opinions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three opinions came from lawyers, retired judges, who were 
in fact retained by the government, by the administration, by the 
cabinet, by the Minister of Justice, to render those opinions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the argument of the House leader for the Conservative 
Party does not hold because there is no obligation on the 
government to share legal opinions that it pays for and obtains 
in the normal course of its business with members of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Minister of Justice elected to do that and she did 
so commencing on Friday when she undertook to distribute those 
opinions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us keep in mind that our committee reported on this bill a 
week or two ago.  There was a very strong vote in the committee 
with respect to this bill.  I do not think there was any 
wavering.  There was no backtracking after by the committee, no 
other concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can still take this up under Standing Order 108(2) which 
allows us to look at anything within the jurisdiction of those 
departments for which we have responsibility in our portfolio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument of the justice critic for the Reform Party falls 
because if the committee decides to undertake that further study, 
it can do so under Standing Order 108(2). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at report stage now but the Senate, whether some of us 
may like it or not, will also study this.  Presumably we will 
have access to these opinions which have been made public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary process will continue and it will unfold as it 
should.  I submit the government is under absolutely no 
obligation to provide these opinions to other members of 
parliament or even to government members of parliament.  However, 
it has done so.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest therefore that this is not a point of privilege and 
even if it raises a prima facie point of privilege, I suggest it 
has been answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think it bears 
mentioning that it was received at our office by regular standard 
mail.  It was not sent by courier to our office, just to 
differentiate from what the parliamentary secretary said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member for Windsor—St. Clair also raises an 
important point that this information has distributed in one 
language, and that point was raised by the hon. member from the 
Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that if a prima facie case does not exist, at the very 
least we should be given an opportunity to review this material 
in its entirety.  If it was important enough to seek this 
decision and important enough to get to an important group like 
the Canadian Police Association, surely that in and of itself 
bears out the argument that we as members of parliament debating 
this issue on the floor of the House should be given an 
opportunity to digest this information. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, I have heard argument on both 
sides of the House.  It would seem to me that at least at this 
point the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, after 
arguing his point, quotes that other Speakers have ruled that it 
is not incumbent on the government to share whatever information 
it has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, we have the parliamentary secretary saying 
that this information was indeed sent out in the usual fashion in 
order for members of parliament to get it at the same time as 
anyone else, the public, would be getting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the bill before us now to be debated.  I want to look 
into this.  There are a couple of small matters that I want to 
satisfy myself on. I will try to get back to the House before the 
end of the day today.  We will begin the debate on this and if 
there is reason to abrogate a little later I will reserve that 
right for myself to do it.

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak today in this 
House to this important bill, which has required a lot of 
attention and a lot of work.  It concerns fundamental issues in 
a free and democratic society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 is very simple.  It aims to include criteria, a set 
of principles in the preamble to the bill.  We must not lose 
sight of the function of DNA.  It can be used to identify not 
only an individual, but his family as well.  We can identify 
parents, find out about them, children and brothers and sisters. 
It is something very private. 
There is nothing more personal than a person's DNA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Motion No. 1 is very simple.  It provides 
principles or yardsticks according to which the bill must be 
applied.  Among other things, it states that DNA profiles may be 
used only for purposes of identification, and not for any other 
purpose.  There are a number of things that can be done with DNA 
already, and more will be possible as the technology progresses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wish to avoid the improper use and disclosure of DNA 
profiles, for the same reason, to avoid the wrongful use of a 
very powerful technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before passing this bill, let us set up principles for now and 
for the future, because it will have repercussions not just for 
now but also later on.  As the technology evolves, the 
principles will be more and more defined, but the more that can 
be defined today the better.  This is very important.  So that 
was Motion No. 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3 is equally important.  The bill was discussed in 
committee for hours.  The motion is intended to strike a balance 
between protecting society, fighting crime, and protecting 
privacy.  Let us keep in mind that these are two fundamental 
principles in our society, and that a balance must be struck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3 concerns clause 5. It states as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“(2) The Commissioner shall ensure that the National DNA Data 
Bank Authority maintains a record of every person who accesses 
the national DNA data bank established under subsection (1) and 
any DNA profile contained in that bank”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is to prevent people from consulting the bank for a just 
any reason, and consultations will be recorded. Abuse can be 
avoided by having knowledge of who consults the bank, for which 
individual, and how.  People will hesitate to consult the bank 
needlessly, knowing that records are being kept.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now read Motion No. 5, because it is just as important: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“9.1(1) The Privacy Commissioner shall every three years after 
the coming into force of section 5, carry out a complete 
investigation in respect of the National DNA Data Bank 
established under that section—” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, there is a government agency called the office of the 
privacy commissioner, whose role is to ensure that people's 
privacy is respected. 
Therefore, why not give that government agency the power to see 
if the national DNA data bank is fulfilling its mandate, 
respecting people's privacy, and not being misused? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Keeping track of any consultation would allow the Privacy 
Commissioner to look at the file, to see if there were too many 
consultations or if these consultations were unjustified, for 
what reasons, and so on. In such cases, the Privacy Commissioner 
would have the authority to impose sanctions on those who do not 
respect privacy which, as we know, is an essential value in any 
democratic and free society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what I had to say on Motions Nos. 1, 3 and 5 in Group 
No.1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, we feel that, generally 
speaking, the motions in Group No. 1 that were moved by the hon. 
member for Charlesbourg are unnecessary, because they do not add 
to the detailed context of the bill before us. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general the motions presented by my hon. colleagues are 
actually considered unnecessary because the bill itself addresses 
a lot of the concerns raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example the bill's purpose and principles already emphasize 
that the national databank is intended to help law enforcement 
agencies identify persons and that safeguards must be placed on 
the use and communication of and access to information in the 
databank.  This is already in the bill.  It is there to protect 
the privacy of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out to the hon. member that the 
commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police will have the 
jurisdiction for the administration and establishment of the 
databank.  This will ensure that the DNA information does not 
fall into the wrong hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, once the bank itself is implemented it will be subject to 
audit by the privacy commissioner, as we discussed, who may audit 
it at any time rather than the three year time interval that is 
proposed by the hon. member. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to comment on Motion No. 1. I believe it has 
already been pointed out that the purpose of the national DNA 
databank is to help agencies, in enforcing the law, to identify, 
as the member indicated, only persons, and that protective 
measures must be taken with regard to the use and distribution 
of DNA data, and access to the databank, in order to protect 
privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Current provisions in the act already deal with the problems 
raised by this motion. I therefore invite my colleagues to 
reject this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also opposed to Motion No. 3.  Although the government is 
in agreement with the principle that a record of every person 
who accesses the bank must be maintained, as the member is 
suggesting, I think that the point of the legislation is the 
identification the bank contains.  The only access allowed is to 
an individual's identification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that there are already certain safeguards in place, I can 
ensure the member that, in our view, the request contained in 
Motion No. 3 deals primarily with an administrative matter, and 
that the government will duly address this in the related 
regulations.  We feel it is unnecessary to amend the bill, and 
this is why we are also rejecting this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final motion in this group is Motion No. 5. 
This motion suggests establishing a fixed time frame for 
examination by the privacy commissioner, but does not broaden 
the commissioner's authority to conduct investigations.  Section 
37 of the Privacy Act already authorizes the privacy 
commissioner to carry out investigations in respect of personal 
information under the control of government institutions in 
order to ensure compliance with the provisions of the 
legislation in question.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the national DNA data bank is in place, it will be subject 
to investigation by the privacy commissioner, who may, as I have 
pointed out, conduct an investigation at any time, rather than 
every three years, as called for by the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons, in my opinion, Group No. 1, that is Motions 
Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5, does not really add anything to the bill. 
The problems raised in these motions are already addressed in 
the bill as written.  I therefore urge members to vote against 
these motions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  For clarification, Motion No. 2 in Group No. 1 is my 
amendment.  It was not clear to me whether in fact that had been 
removed from this grouping or whether it was part of this 
grouping.  If it remains a portion of this group, it would seem 
to me that, like my colleague from Charlesbourg, I ought to have 
an opportunity to speak to this prior to the debate resuming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking for some clarification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must advise the 
hon. member that Motion No. 2 is in this group.  Members at this 
stage are free to address all motions as a whole or any one of 
them as they wish. Is that clear? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Madam Speaker, my question to you is 
that if this is a portion of that grouping, it seems to me, and I 
am looking for some direction here, that I ought to speak to that 
motion before the other members of this House can respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Am I being invited to address the House on this motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Under the 
circumstances since the hon. member technically has a point, I 
would ask the hon. member for Crowfoot if he would be kind enough 
to let him speak first. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
this grouping of amendments are intended to strengthen the 
safeguards against misuse and abuse of DNA profiles stored in the 
databank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My amendment is Motion No. 2, the (a) portion of which appears 
to already be accepted as it is provided in the act.  I will move 
on to the other section.  I would propose that we amend the 
principles of the act by placing in the following, which would be 
an addition to section 4: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c)  because of the personal information that can be gathered 
through the use of DNA profiles, it is the role of the government 
through public agencies, to perform the tasks set out in this 
act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I proposed the amendment because we have seen in the last eight 
or nine years tremendous privatization by both this government 
and the government prior to it.  Crown corporations or government 
agencies which were normally perceived to be within the realm of 
government because they performed important public functions were 
given to the private sector in a fiscally conservative move.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that we are setting up an agency under the RCMP 
that can take these DNA samples and record them.  None of us has 
a crystal ball.  None of us can be sure whether in the future 
either this government or another government might think the cost 
of maintaining a DNA databank—not the taking of the sample but 
the keeping of the information—is too expensive.  We do not know 
when another fiscal conservative wave will sweep over the House— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  We will do all we can to build 
appropriate walls to keep a Conservative government from taking 
power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put forward the amendment because it would be a clear 
indication that only the Government of Canada through a public 
agency ought to store the very personal information referred to 
by my colleague from Charlesbourg.  The reason I proposed the 
motion was to ensure that only the government and not private 
agencies, which at some point in the future may profit from the 
sale of such information, keep that information, keep it secure 
and keep it confidential for the people of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will 
comment on the four amendments in Group No. 1.  We realize the 
very important nature of the bill.  It has enormous tools that 
could potentially provide the police with the ability to solve 
unsolved crimes and to provide greater protection for society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of Motion No. 1, with the greatest respect, I 
understand the concern for the respect of privacy as a result of 
the taking of DNA samples.  When the bill was before committee we 
found from witnesses that the databank contains only the profile 
of the DNA samples.  It will only carry the profile.  The profile 
can only compare one sample with another profile, so the privacy 
matter has been largely looked after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the penalty for the misuse of DNA information is 
very significant.  It carries two years maximum.  In some of the 
amendments we will be discussing today it is recommended that we 
increase the period of two years to five years.  I am convinced 
the privacy concerns are adequately addressed by the nature of 
the databank and by the penalty prescribed in the bill. Depending 
upon the vote of the members the penalty may be increased from 
two to five years.  My colleagues and I have very little concern 
about that.  As well, the privacy commissioner has the authority 
to review at any time the databank and its use.  There are very 
strict and secure safeguards as far as privacy is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can support Motion No. 2 proposed by the NDP.  The amendment 
precludes private agencies and labs from taking samples.  It 
creates public standards and better accuracy of testing quality. 
It would appease to a certain degree the concerns about privacy. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one area where we feel that a government agency, where 
standards are set by the elected representatives of the people, 
is in order so that the testing of a sample meets standards which 
have been approved by the two houses of parliament.  We think 
this is a logical and common sense amendment and can support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move to the third motion in this grouping.  We have some 
concern about the motion because it would eliminate subsection 2 
of clause 5 of the bill.  We could support it if it is not to 
eliminate the particular subsection which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Commissioner's duties under this Act may be performed on 
behalf of the Commissioner by any person authorized by the 
Commissioner to perform those duties. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel this subsection must not be struck from the bill.  It 
should remain. Therefore we will have difficulty supporting this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to Motion No. 5, we see no reason that there should be 
included within the statute the demand for a three year review. I 
appreciate the member's concern with regard to privacy, but I 
believe my earlier comments and rationale cover the area of 
privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that goes into the databank is the profile.  Anyone 
obtaining a profile improperly from the databank gets nothing 
unless it can be compared with something.  I understand that not 
even a name will be attached to a profile.  I am satisfied the 
privacy requirements and concerns will be adequately addressed in 
that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also feel the privacy commissioner has the right to audit the 
databank at any time.  He does not have to wait a three year 
period.  Someone with a substantial basis requesting the privacy 
commissioner to act can mobilize the commissioner to do so.  With 
respect to Motion No. 5 we think the privacy safeguards are in 
place and within the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, as previous members have expressed, I am very 
pleased to take part in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members previous have also indicated this is a very crucial 
and important piece of legislation that will certainly aid police 
officers and Canadians generally in their never ending fight 
against crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address the motions in the order in which they appear. 
With respect to the first motion, which is moved by the member 
for Charlesbourg, although I certainly agree with the purpose for 
which he has brought the motion forward, I would suggest it is a 
motion or an amendment that is already addressed in the current 
form of the bill.  Clause 4 of the bill is clear.  Any further 
tinkering with this clause would only lead to potential 
misunderstanding, which of course could then lead to unnecessary 
litigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find myself in the untenable position of having to agree with 
the government that the legitimate concerns are in fact met. 
Although there is always concern for misuse of this important 
technology, I believe the principles set out in the preamble will 
address that point.  I certainly would not call it a pointless or 
irrelevant motion but simply duplicitous. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very complicated bill.  There can be no debate on that 
issue.  We as members of the House, and particularly those 
participating in this debate, have an obligation to try to 
simplify where possible the legislation, not to complicate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 was proposed by the member for Sydney—Victoria. 
For the reasons I previously stated I feel it may be a motion 
that is addressed in a more direct form in the current drafting 
of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the principle that we disagree with but rather that 
the bill might become unduly complicated by making this 
amendment.  Certainly there is evidence that this type of DNA 
data can and perhaps will in the future be used for other 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to how it will be used as it stems from this piece 
of legislation, safeguards are in place and sections of the bill 
will be addressed in other amendments which we will be debating 
on the floor today.  It is perhaps duplicitous.  Safeguards 
currently exist in the act.  Any improper or illegal use of the 
DNA evidence would be addressed by existing sections of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third motion is proposed by the member for Charlesbourg with 
respect to the use of DNA, or how the commissioner would ensure 
that DNA was not being abused, is a motion that I embrace, a 
motion that I think is a good one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is aimed particularly at protecting the privacy interests of 
individuals.  It ensures accountability and is aimed at 
correcting or addressing any misuse of information.  It is a good 
motion.  It is one that I hope all members of the House will 
consider and take seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would allow for a more complete and perhaps a more thorough 
investigation of the DNA databank.  It is an important safeguard. 
As I have indicated earlier, it is a motion we should support. It 
would also ensure that improper use does not occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth motion in this grouping proposed by my hon. friend in 
the Bloc is a motion that I believe in principle we should 
support.  However, as has been indicated by the parliamentary 
secretary and the member from the Reform Party, there are 
provisions in existing legislation that would allow for an audit 
outside a defined three year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence this concern has been met.  I am pleased to hear that 
the parliamentary secretary is supportive of that position. 
Therefore the legitimate concern raised by the hon. member is 
addressed.  It is certainly there for a very crucial intent, that 
is to balance the protection of the public and the crucial need 
of law enforcement officers to use this trace evidence and DNA 
sample evidence for their legitimate fight against organized 
crime and crime generally, coupled with the need for the privacy 
concern interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an obligation to ensure that is what happens by the 
enactment of the legislation.  There is a great deal of 
responsibility weighing upon us in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying that of the motions before the House in 
this juncture of debate, we support the last two but have some 
difficulty with respect to the prior two motions which appear in 
this grouping. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-3 at 
report stage as we discuss the amendments.  Bill C-3 is an act 
respecting DNA identification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As some of my colleagues have already mentioned, the Reform 
Party is fully supportive of the creation of a DNA databank and 
the use of that information in detecting and prosecuting those 
who committed crimes.  However the bill has a scope that is so 
limited we would be unable to support it as it is. 
Therefore the amendments here are of some importance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As almost anyone who is aware of this issue and the debate 
taking place on it will know, the official opposition is firmly 
committed to restoring confidence in our justice system and 
providing Canadians with a true sense of security.  This is 
something Canadians lack.  Canadians do not feel secure. They do 
not feel secure from those who would attack them, rob them and 
harm them.  Nor do they feel secure in the apprehension of those 
who do this. They do not feel secure with regard to the 
prosecution and punishment of criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents in Cariboo—Chilcotin are greatly alarmed when 
they see instances of heinous and bloody crimes being committed 
and the evidence being thrown out on a technicality, a 
technicality that rests mostly on the latest thought a judge may 
have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we talk about DNA, my constituents see this as a very 
important tool in the detection of crime and in its prosecution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3, as it now stands, will provide Canadians with some 
sense of security but in my opinion a false sense of security. 
Neither my colleagues nor I can support this legislation as it 
now stands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our constituents need to be assured that those who protect us 
are given real tools, not imaginary tools, tools that are 
available to them to fight against violent offenders in society. 
Bill C-3 does not grant our police forces, the officials who 
maintain the law, the full use of DNA technology which has now 
become fairly readily available even though it is an expensive 
tool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One wonders, when we consider the expense of using faulty or 
less effective means of apprehending and prosecuting criminals, 
whether this is a false sense of economy when we talk about the 
costs of using this DNA technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another point that also needs to be considered and that 
is the use of this technology not only for prosecution but for 
the defence and the freeing of those who are innocent.  We have 
recent examples of this in Canada.  There are very sad stories of 
people who have been in the wrong place or the right place at the 
wrong time and have been apprehended, charged, tried and 
convicted.  Yet when all the evidence is on the table, these 
people turn out to be totally innocent.  They and their families 
end up going through not weeks and months but years and years of 
a sense of betrayal by a justice system that is more interested 
in convicting someone in these instances than in convicting the 
correct person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not only interested in correctly solving violent crimes 
but also in seeing that justice is appropriately applied to the 
right person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are hundreds of unsolved assaults, rapes and homicides 
where DNA evidence has been left at the scene by the perpetrator 
of the crime.  DNA identification now offers an unparalleled 
opportunity to solve many of these cases and bring these 
perpetrators to justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, because of the government's irrational fear of 
violating the privacy rights of those responsible for these 
heinous crimes, it is intending to restrict the use of a very 
important technology by law enforcement officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 does not allow for the taking of a DNA sample at the 
time of charge.  It does not permit samples to be taken from 
incarcerated criminals other than those designated dangerous 
offenders, multiple sex offenders and multiple murderers. 
Bill C-3 does, however, provide a dangerous and unnecessary 
exemption authorizing judges not to issue warrants for the taking

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order, I 
do not want to interrupt the hon. member but we did group these 
amendments by groupings.  I understand the hon. member does have 
concerns over some of the amendments.  I would ask him to address 
the grouping we are now studying, Motions Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5.  I 
believe right now he is speaking on Motion No. 10.  Perhaps if he 
could group his thoughts around our groupings we might be able to 
get the debate under way a lot faster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I believe the 
parliamentary secretary does have a point.  We are discussing 
Motions Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5 at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank you for that 
point.  However, I intend to use the latitude I need to discuss 
these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 does provide a dangerous and unnecessary exemption 
authorizing judges not to issue warrants for the taking of a 
sample if they believe that in doing so the impact on the 
individual's privacy and security would be grossly 
disproportionate to the public interest in the protection of 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it stands, Bill C-3 now is a hindrance to more effective law 
enforcement and a safer society.  Those responsible for shaping 
our justice system continue to express a willingness to place the 
lives and the safety of innocent people in jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether by paroling violent offenders who go on to rape and 
murder again or by freeing convicted violent offenders through 
conditional sentencing or by tying our police officers hands 
through Bill C-3, the safety of society it would seem is a 
secondary issue for the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the government is a little apprehensive about the 
invasion of privacy and to a certain degree I am as well. Privacy 
is an issue I have studied.  It is an issue that concerns me 
greatly.  However, it seems there is a point when we must also 
take into consideration first of all the protection of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel this tool if it is to be used effectively can do this. We 
want to do more good than harm in getting violent offenders off 
the street.  There has to be a balance between respecting the 
rights of innocent individuals and the protection of society from 
violent and repeat offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be certain that the rights of innocent individuals 
are not trampled on.  Innocents have a right too.  This must be 
clearly taken into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And so we see there is a fine line between infringing on the 
rights of the individual and one who has committed a crime, 
especially serious violent crimes.  When someone commits a crime 
they have violated the societal laws and therefore should not be 
subject to the same rights and privileges as others in society. 
By their actions they have in a sense lost the right to those 
privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel the government has forgotten this and that those 
criminals should not still enjoy the same rights and privileges 
as those of us who have not committed crimes, in some cases 
jeopardizing the safety of the rest of society as a result.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, what is privacy all about?  This brings me back to a 
case we heard so much about in the last number of years of David 
Milgaard who was imprisoned for 20 some years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>David's family lived in the Snowflake area where I farmed for a 
number of years.  People in the community always felt very 
strongly that David Milgaard was innocent.  They knew the family 
and they knew what type of upbringing he had.  There was always 
the suspicion that he had been at the wrong place at the wrong 
time and was blamed for an act he was not responsible for.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had we a DNA databank and some of the information available to 
the police forces to double check on the evidence they had, 
probably David Milgaard would have been exonerated from that 
crime and would have been free those 22 or 23 years he was in 
prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think society has the right to have protection and that is 
what government is there for, to give the type of protection from 
unjust prosecution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When somebody is caught up in a crime and has violated civil or 
criminal law there should be a sample of DNA so that in future 
cases the person can either be charged or exonerated. Having the 
databank is not just a matter of proving people are criminal or 
that they were involved in the act.  The databank is there to 
prevent people from being charged wrongly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In comments in the previous debate the government feels this 
would cost too much money.  It would create a bank that was too 
costly to manage.  The gun legislation, Bill C-68, was passed in 
order to register guns of law-abiding citizens just to keep track 
of them in case some of the criminal element might pick up some 
of these guns and they can be traced. We have seen a number of 
speculative suggestions or estimates that it would cost about 
half a billion dollars to register all the guns of law-abiding 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the databank which would serve a much bigger 
bank of information on catching people who have committed crime 
or preventing people from being prosecuted who were not involved, 
money seems to be an issue.  It was not an issue when it came to 
gun registration.  That does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When looking at the hepatitis C issue it is money that seems to 
be what the government is hesitating to talk about.  It does not 
want to admit that maybe it was  wrong.  It does not want to 
admit that there could have been something done to prevent the 
problem of poison blood.  That is the same with the databank. The 
government is very hesitant to make the bank resourceful and to 
give the bank the authority to take the samples of DNA from 
people who are suspect of committing crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were accused falsely of a crime I would demand that a DNA 
sample be taken so I could not be charged for something I was not 
involved in.  I cannot understand why that is a matter of private 
information that I would not want to have in a databank 
controlled by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the amendments made by other parties concern putting 
safeguards into the bill in order that the DNA data information 
collected is not misused.  An ounce of prevention is worth a 
pound of cure.  Had we a databank giving the RCMP and the 
investigators the information they needed in the David Milgaard 
or Guy Paul Morin case it would have meant a lot less stress and 
hardship for those families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will it create any stress for people who are forced to give a 
sample of DNA where it is protected by government and cannot 
become public information?  There is no problem.  It is the same 
as the tax man.  When he wants to come and open up my books they 
are there for him to look at. 
If I do not give him that information he can force me to give it 
to him.  Is it not easier to provide the information rather than 
forcing somebody to give that information?

</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems only logical that we should support the amendments. The 
bill is going in the right direction.  We should support some of 
these amendments to guarantee safety.  We should also put in 
amendments which will guarantee that the legislation contains all 
the bullets the RCMP and investigators need to prove beyond a 
reasonable doubt that a person is or is not guilty of a crime. It 
makes sense that we should give this type of protection to our 
ordinary citizens, whether they are law abiding or living on the 
edge of the law.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  Jack has his own ideas and he will 
talk to those ideas.  I am talking about the amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  But he objects to the amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  Not all of them.  He does not 
object to all of them.  He only objects to the ones that do not 
make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the problem with these Liberal governments.  They do not 
know what common sense is.  And when they see it, they distort 
it. They distort it enough until they think they have got 
something that is publicly acceptable.  People are brainwashed 
and led to believe that it is good for them. It does not work 
that way in real life.  Real life common sense tells us we have 
to do what protects the ordinary law-abiding citizen who wants to 
give his best to the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people in my constituency who would gladly volunteer 
DNA because they have somebody in their family background who 
someday might get mixed up with something that would not be so 
nice to deal with.  There are a number of cases.  They would be 
glad to give a DNA sample to the bank so that they would be 
protected from things that happened with members of their 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The bill allows that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  It does not allow that.  One has to 
be convicted before it is allowed.  That is what I read in the 
bill.  You have to be a one time criminal before you can be asked 
to submit a sample. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating whether or not it is common sense. To me it only 
makes common sense if we can prevent an offence.  I cannot see 
any harm.  When the RCMP suspects somebody or when law 
enforcement believes it should have the right, they should be 
able to take that DNA sample and put it in the bank.  The way I 
read it, this bill does not allow that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will see during the debate today that the Liberals will try 
to brainwash us.  They will try to put us into a nice comfortable 
mood and say that this is a bill everybody should support.  We 
support some of it.  When the justice critic objects to certain 
clauses, I support him because he is dead right.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to express our 
opposition to Bill C-3, an act representing DNA identification 
which would make amendments to the Criminal Code and other acts. 
This bill was previously introduced as Bill C-94 in April 1997. 
There still appears to be minor differences between this bill and 
Bill C-94. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the official opposition believe that people are 
concerned about victims of crime.  My constituents and a host of 
others inside and outside the law enforcement community are very 
disappointed with what the Liberals have done with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is firmly committed to restoring confidence in 
our justice system and providing Canadians with a true sense of 
security. 
This includes strengthening our law enforcement agencies by 
providing them with the latest effective technological tools to 
quickly detect and apprehend the perpetrators of the most violent 
crimes in society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA identification is that kind of tool.  If used to its full 
potential the DNA databank could be the single most important 
development in fighting crime since the introduction of 
fingerprints.  The technology available through DNA 
identification would make our society safer.  It would protect 
our homes, our families and our lives from criminal activity and 
in particular violent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that DNA capabilities will greatly 
enhance the work of our law enforcement community.  This 
technology over the next few years and decades will virtually 
change our world in terms of crime solving, crime detection and 
the positive identification of criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 if passed unamended will provide Canadians with a false 
sense of security. Therefore the Reform Party cannot support this 
inadequate and incomplete piece of legislation. The Reform Party 
fully supports the creation of the DNA databank.  We do not 
however support the limited scope of Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I oppose this bill?  I oppose it because Bill C-3 does 
not grant our police forces full use of DNA technology and 
because Bill C-3 does not allow for the taking of DNA samples at 
the time of the charge, whereas fingerprints are taken at the 
time of arrest. Another reason I oppose Bill C-3 is that it does 
not allow samples to be taken from incarcerated criminals other 
than designated dangerous offenders, multiple sex offenders and 
multiple murderers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it stands now, Bill C-3 is a hindrance to more effective law 
enforcement and a safer society.  This is a needlessly 
restrictive measure in Bill C-3.  The official opposition does 
not want to join the Liberals in their attempt to fool Canadians 
about what this bill does, and most importantly what it does not 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not go far enough and we must not fool ourselves.  That 
is wrong and that is why on behalf of the people of Surrey 
Central I will be voting against this bill.  It is an inadequate 
piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are choosing to slow down the process of the advent 
of DNA identification into our crime fighting efforts.  The 
Liberals are crippling the ability of our law enforcement 
agencies to use this technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has so far refused to allow the amendments to 
this bill that have been put forward by the official opposition. 
These amendments would put teeth into Bill C-3 but it is as if 
the Liberals do not want that.  They are afraid to unleash this 
powerful crime fighting tool because the Liberals are more 
concerned about the criminals and the rights of the accused than 
they are concerned about the victims of crime and the rights of 
the victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our law enforcement agencies should have been given the go ahead 
to use DNA identification tools when the technology was first 
invented.  For example, it is like forcing people to use candles 
or kerosene lanterns instead of electric lightbulbs, or for that 
matter a minister's office asking her staff to use 286 computers 
rather than pentiums.  This is how technology evolves. We should 
use the advanced technology for the purpose intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those responsible for shaping our justice system continue to 
express a willingness to place the lives and safety of innocent 
people in jeopardy.  Whether by parolling violent offenders who 
go on to rape and murder again, or by freeing convicted violent 
offenders through conditional sentencing, or by tying our police 
officers' hands through Bill C-3, the safety of our society is a 
secondary issue for this Liberal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are watching the Liberals withhold granting tools to our law 
enforcement agencies. The Liberals are not getting tough on 
crime, violent crime in particular.  The Liberals are not willing 
to do the work necessary to give our police agencies better tools 
to solve crimes and to prevent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do the Liberals deny Canadians amendments to the Young 
Offenders Act?  The justice minister continually answers the 
question by saying she will do it in a timely fashion.  What is 
meant by a timely fashion when it is not timely? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals say they are concerned about the constitutional and 
privacy rights of the criminals and that is why they are trying 
to pass such a watered down DNA identification bill.  Yet the 
Liberals refuse to wait for the report of a constitutional review 
that would dispense with the issue of DNA identification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 in its present form denies our police the full use of 
DNA identification. This maintains an unnecessary level of risk 
to the lives and safety of our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 provides a dangerous and unnecessary exemption 
authorizing judges not to issue warrants for the taking of a 
sample if they believe that in doing so the impact on the 
individual's privacy and security would be grossly 
disproportionate to the public interest in the protection of 
society. It seems to me that if DNA identification were positive 
unequivocal proof, then the rights of an individual would best be 
served by that person providing a DNA sample. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA samples are conclusive if processed carefully and correctly. 
A DNA sample can disprove as well as prove the accused's 
involvement in a crime. The Liberals' argument in support of 
allowing the judges not to issue a warrant for the taking of a 
DNA sample fails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the government's irrational fear of violating the 
privacy rights of persons accused of heinous crimes, the Liberals 
are restricting the use of this very important technology by our 
law enforcement agencies.  The Liberals should be ashamed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we are watching the Liberals use cold-hearted legal 
talk to deny giving us what we need.  The Liberal government used 
cold legal arguments and numbers to deny help to all the victims 
of tainted blood. Now the Liberals are allowing certain crimes to 
go unsolved because they are afraid to violate the rights of the 
accused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clifford Olson would have been charged earlier had the DNA 
technology been available to the police.  More of the murders he 
committed would have been solved earlier and perhaps some lives 
could have been saved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are devastated when innocent victims fall prey to 
violence, whether the motivation is drugs, theft, greed or hate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is failing our youth, our seniors, our 
communities and our society because it lacks the moral strength 
to deal with all types of violent crime and repeat offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on but my constituents and I are warning this 
government to get tough on crime, to do the work necessary to 
protect our society.  That is why we are not supporting Bill C-3 
as it is presented unless the amendments are accepted. The bill 
does not do the work necessary to give our police what they want 
in terms of using the DNA identification tool.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in listening to the debate and examining this bill on 
the DNA legislation, three questions come to mind.  I would like 
to discuss those three questions this morning in relation to this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question is:  Why does the government persist in 
registering law-abiding citizens but not criminals? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT30"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT30"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1330

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question that I will deal with is:  Why is the 
government refusing to allow the police to use a tool that could 
help them solve a lot of crimes, reduce court costs and the cost of 
law enforcement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My third question is:  Why are Liberals keeping innocent people 
in jail who could be freed if we put in place Bill C-3, this DNA 
databank legislation that is totally inadequate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me deal with the first question.  Why does the government 
persist in registering law-abiding citizens and not criminals? 
How is the government registering law-abiding citizens?  Several 
years ago this government put in place a bill that received 
nationwide attention, Bill C-68; a bill that will force 
law-abiding gun owners to register with the government when they 
have never committed a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is spending hundreds of millions of dollars going 
after law-abiding citizens in a huge bureaucratic scheme that its 
own department now says will accomplish the very opposite of what 
the legislation intended.  Not only that, it will make criminals 
out of law-abiding citizens because it put the property 
regulation scheme into the Criminal Code of Canada and people who 
do not comply with it could end up in jail for one, two, five, 
possibly ten years for failing to comply with the government's 
desire to have them register. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, we have a government that will not register 
criminals.  People who have been charged with a crime will not, 
under this legislation, be required to give a little saliva, a 
hair or a slight skin sample to the police.  They will be able to 
declare their rights not to let the police DNA fingerprint them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time the police can take a fingerprint from 
someone who has been charged with certain crimes.  The Reform 
Party is not advocating that everybody comply with this DNA 
legislation, we are saying that in serious criminal offences this 
should be allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government require law-abiding citizens who have 
not committed a crime or are not a threat to society—in fact the 
opposite could be argued—to be kept track of but not the 
criminal element?  I do not know.  I cannot understand why the 
government is not doing as the police request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police have come before the government.  They have pleaded 
with the government that this is a very effective tool.  It could 
reduce the costs of law enforcement greatly.  It could increase 
the effectiveness of our criminal justice system.  It could help 
to declare people who have not committed a crime innocent at a 
much earlier stage.  No, the government is not interested in that 
kind of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not deplorable, Mr. Speaker?  I can see that you are 
listening.  You are as concerned as I am with the things the 
government requires law-abiding citizens to do but does not 
require criminals to do.  Why does the government give the 
criminal more rights than the law-abiding citizen?  I cannot 
understand that. It just blows me away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the gun registration scheme the legislation that is before 
the House will have the effect of increasing smuggling and of 
increasing black market trade in firearms.  It is not just me who 
is saying that; justice department bureaucrats who have been put 
in place to put in that huge regulatory scheme are saying that. 
Why are we doing it?  It is absolutely ridiculous.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the police are saying that if we were able to 
get a DNA fingerprint, which is very easily done because we have 
the technology, we could solve crimes a lot sooner.  We could 
find people guilty or innocent a lot sooner which would help the 
police greatly in their efforts to control crime.  I do not 
understand why this government is on the side of the criminal 
element. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question that I want to deal with is:  Why is the 
government refusing to allow the police to use a tool that could 
help them solve a lot of crimes, reduce court costs and the cost 
of law enforcement?  The argument the government has used is that 
there could be a lot of misuse of this information.  If in fact a 
criminal gave a DNA fingerprint to the police, in some way or 
another, down the road, that information might be used in a way 
that would infringe on the criminal's rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution to that concern is very simple:  punish the misuse 
of that information if it is used in a way that the government or 
the police do not find appropriate in solving a crime.  Restrict 
the unethical and unlawful use of that information.  That could 
be easily done and this government has refused to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to the concern that the information may be misused is 
very simple.  We have that protection in many other areas 
already, so why not extend it to this?  It does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also argues that the courts may not approve of 
this legislation if we extend it to everyone who has been charged 
with certain crimes and if we require all of them to take a DNA 
fingerprint and give that fingerprint to the police.  The 
government said it may infringe on the constitutionally 
guaranteed rights of criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again the answer to that is so simple that I do not know why 
this government does not do it.  Why not refer the matter to the 
courts?  Ask the Supreme Court of Canada what measures would be 
necessary and what could be done in order to protect them.  We 
could put that into this legislation to make sure that it 
complies with our charter of rights and freedoms.  These answers 
are so simple, why do we not do it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third question I want to deal with is that many people have 
been wrongly convicted in the past 20 or 30 years.  Some people 
have spent five, ten, fifteen, up to twenty years in prison 
because they were wrongfully convicted.  This government allows 
that to continue by not adequately putting in place a DNA 
databank that would prevent this kind of thing from happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present legislation, as it is structured, would still allow 
some of these people to be in prison for many years when they 
could be freed if we put this in place.  Why does the government 
not put in place something that would help these innocent people 
be free? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would appeal to the government to listen to the 
concerns of members of the opposition and of Canadians who want 
this to be put in place and, above all, to listen to the police 
who require this as a tool.  I appeal to the government to listen 
and to not simply use the undemocratic means that it continues to 
use to ram legislation through.  I ask that it consider some of 
the amendments that Reformers have put in place because they 
would strengthen the legislation and law enforcement in this 
country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of my 
community to add my comments concerning Bill C-3, an act 
respecting DNA identification and to make consequential 
amendments to the Criminal Code and other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be clear, what are we talking about?  In specificity, it 
concerns an enactment to provide for the establishment of a 
national DNA databank to be maintained by the Commissioner of the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police and to be used to assist law 
enforcement agencies in solving crimes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The databank will consist of a crime scene index containing DNA 
profiles derived from bodily substances found in places 
associated with the commission of certain types of serious 
offences and a convicted offenders index containing DNA profiles 
obtained from persons convicted of or discharged from those types 
of offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment amends the Criminal Code to provide for orders 
authorizing the collection of bodily substances from which DNA 
profiles can be derived for inclusion in the DNA databank.  It 
also amends the Criminal Code to authorize the collection of 
bodily substances from offenders who meet clearly defined 
criteria and who are currently serving sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment contains specific provisions regulating the use of 
the bodily substances collected and the DNA profiles derived from 
them, and the use and communication of and access to information 
contained in the databank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, we are at the report stage debate of this bill and 
the Reform Party is firmly committed to restoring the confidence 
in our justice system and providing Canadians with a true sense 
of security.  Today's debate is broken down into various sections 
concerning amendments about which I will speak later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians really do not have a lot of confidence in our justice 
system, and no wonder, for essentially it is a liberal justice 
system.  Reformers want to strengthen our law enforcement 
agencies by providing them with the latest technological tools so 
they can quickly detect and apprehend the perpetrators of the most 
violent crimes in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA identification is that kind of tool.  But it can also 
vindicate possible suspects, protect the innocent and save money 
for more appropriately focused resources for investigation 
efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If used to its potential the DNA databank could be the single 
most important development in fighting crime since the 
introduction of fingerprints.  To deny the prosecution the full 
use of this technology in the fight against crime, as Bill C-3 
does in its present form, is unacceptable because it maintains an 
unnecessary level of risk to the lives and safety of our 
citizens.  Again, from my point of view, it is the usual Liberal 
half-step in the right direction and further evidence of a weak 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3, an act respecting DNA identification, if passed 
unamended will provide Canadians with a false sense of security. 
It is just not good enough to meet our higher standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Reform Party fully support the creation of DNA 
databanks.  However, we do not support the timid and weak style of 
Bill C-3.  It does not grant our police forces full use of the DNA 
technology which is readily at their disposal, a tool that would 
help close hundreds of unsolved violent crimes and a tool that 
would have the enormous potential of saving lives by removing 
predators from our streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me refer directly to the motions in this section of the 
report stage debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice at page V of the Order Paper and Notice Paper for 
Monday, May 4, 1998 that there are 14 report stage amendments.  I 
will speak briefly to the ones in the section concerning our 
present debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 is brought forward by the Bloc.  I believe that the 
bill already contains adequate provisions covering these areas 
and that the amendment is not necessary to support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 is brought forward by the NDP.  I think it has 
merit.  This amendment precludes private agencies and labs from 
taking samples and it creates public standards and better 
accuracy for testing quality.  I support the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3 is brought forward by the Bloc.  It also has merit. 
It safeguards against the wrong persons accessing the DNA 
databank.  I support this improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 5 is brought forward by the Bloc.  I really do not 
think it is particularly helpful.  It is really a make-work 
amendment and there is no reason for us to have a three year 
review.  It really does not help the general goals of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, Bill C-3 does not allow for the taking of a DNA sample 
at the time of formal charge.  It does not permit samples to be 
taken from incarcerated individuals, other than designated 
dangerous offenders, multiple sex offenders and multiple 
murderers.

DNA identification now offers an unparalleled opportunity to 
solve many of these cases and bring the perpetrators to justice. 
However, because of the government's fear of violating the 
privacy rights of those responsible for heinous crimes, it is 
restricting the use of this very important technology by law 
enforcement.  It is a typical approach of a weak government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those responsible for shaping our justice system continue to 
express a willingness to place the lives and the safety of 
Canadians in jeopardy.  Whether by paroling violent offenders who 
go on to murder again, or by freeing convicted violent offenders 
through conditional sentencing, or by tying our police officers' 
hands through Bill C-3, it appears the safety of society is a 
secondary issue for the Liberal government.

Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party is firmly committed to restoring 
confidence in our justice system and to providing Canadians with 
a true sense of security.  This includes strengthening our law

technological tools to quickly detect and apprehend the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3, an act respecting DNA identification, if passed

Therefore the Reform Party cannot support this inadequate piece 
of legislation.  The Reform Party fully supports the creation of 
the DNA databank.  We do not however support the limited scope of 
Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 does not grant our police forces full use of the DNA

time of charge.  It does not permit samples to be taken from 
incarcerated criminals other than designated dangerous offenders, 
multiple sex offenders and multiple murderers.  Bill C-3 does 
however provide a dangerous and unnecessary exemption authorizing 
judges not to issue warrants for the taking of a sample if they 
believe in doing so the impact on the individual's privacy and 
security would be grossly disproportionate to the public interest 
and the protection of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are hundreds of unsolved assaults, rapes and homicides

government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the newspaper this morning the solicitor general was quoted 
as saying that we have a terrible problem in Canada with 
terrorists and people who are here causing real problems.  He is 
to get a lot of police work going to try to solve this problem. 
He should talk to his colleague in immigration who is letting 
them come through the border because of poor laws that have been 
set up.  We listened to a supreme court which allows in people 
who come to our border saying they are refugees.  Then we find 
out later they are terrorists.  The bill is the same type of 
thing as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a bill that will not do the job.  Our party will oppose 
Motion No. 1.  We think it is an unnecessary amendment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support Motion No. 2, which is an NDP motion.  The amendment 
precludes private agencies and labs from taking samples.  It 
creates public standards and better accuracy in testing quality. 
The government should look at this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We oppose Motion No. 3 which is supposed to safeguard against 
wrong people assessing the DNA databank.  We oppose Motion No. 4 
which indicates that the entire convicted offenders index will be 
destroyed.  There may have been a problem with the English 
translation of this amendment.  We oppose Motion No. 5 because we 
believe there is no need for a three year review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative House leader raised the issue of legal opinions 
sought by the government on the bill.  I wonder if we could find 
out where the government picked the justices from to get 
opinions.  I know there are other opinions within the legal 
profession that certainly disagree with the three opinions 
obtained by the government with regard to the issue of blood 
alcohol sampling comparison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read from page 6, section (b) of the report by the hon. 
Martin R. Taylor, QC, who says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scheme established by s. 254 of the Code governing the taking 
of samples from drivers for alcohol and drug analysis is directed 
to the acquisition and preservation of evidence of a particularly 
perishable kind from those who are actually engaged in the 
dangerous business of controlling vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no authority under this part of the Criminal Code for 
the compulsory taking of samples except in the case of persons 
physically or mentally unable to consent, for which judicial 
warrant is required under s. 256.  But it must be recognized that 
a police officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that the 
ability of a person to control a vehicle has been impaired by 
consumption of alcohol or a drug can coerce the person's consent 
to provide a breath or blood sample, because failure to comply 
with a proper request for such a sample in itself constitutes a 
criminal offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The s. 254 scheme contemplates the taking of 
samples of bodily substances without warrant under such coercion 
of law as may, for practical purposes, be equated with 
compulsion, and has, in my opinion, more in common with the 
proposed extension of authority under Bill C-3 to warrantless 
compulsory taking of bodily substances for DNA testing from 
accused persons than does the fingerprinting scheme authorized by 
the Identification of Criminals Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is, however, an important distinction to be drawn from the 
context of the Charter.  The constitutionality of the Criminal 
Code s. 254 scheme for drug and alcohol testing of breath and 
blood samples rests on the unique nature of problems associated 
with drinking and driving.  There is obvious need to obtain blood 
samples promptly both for the purpose of preventing continuing 
breach of the law and to secure evidence which would otherwise be 
lost with effluxion of time. The courts, would not, in my 
opinion, equate compulsory taking of DNA samples without warrant, 
in the context of the Charter, with the taking of breath or blood 
samples under coercion of law from drivers suspected of 
impairment.  I say this because personal DNA characteristics do 
not change with time, and the taking of DNA samples cannot be 
expected to result in the termination of offences in progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that either of the comparisons mentioned would 
be regarded by the courts as persuasive in answering the present 
question. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were the comments of a former judge whose legal opinion 
was sought.  He said that DNA could not be taken from a person 
who was charged.  Yet we could take blood samples if the person 
were suspected of drinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we being told that if we take a blood sample from a person 
caught driving while drunk and can match the DNA with six rapes 
or six murders that have taken place we will not be able to 
charge the person because we obtained the evidence illegally? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a lawyer, but it seems that is where we are with this. 
We have to make sure to protect ourselves.  We have to make sure 
that people caught for crimes will serve for those crimes and 
that we do not have all the loopholes.  The public is frustrated 
with today's laws, with the number of cases overthrown in the 
courts because of so-called abuse of people's rights. 
It seems the criminals are getting all the rights and the victims 
have no rights at all.  Bill C-3, although it is a good start, 
does not include enough.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A gentleman spoke to our caucus a few weeks ago.  He was the 
chief of police in a major city in Ontario.  He pointed out very 
strongly that there had to be more in the DNA bill.  We had to 
make sure that people who were in prison and were already 
convicted of crimes had their DNA put on the record.  He assured 
us that if that were the case they would solve literally hundreds 
of murders, rapes and major crimes in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once crimes have been committed and the criminals are serving 
time in jail, they should have no right that says their DNA 
cannot be taken and put on the record, because their right not to 
have it there has been violated by them.  Many people think we 
all should have DNA taken at birth so there are good records of 
everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the government can make sure the criminals in the land 
have their DNA on record so if they commit other crimes they will 
be caught.  Certainly it has some feeling for solving all those 
crimes across the nation that have been committed by making the 
right amendments to the bill.

Party and the official opposition will not be able to support it 
in its entirety.  The gist of the bill is proper, but it will 
take a lot of convincing on that side to get me to vote for it. 
The gist of the bill, the idea of taking DNA samples, is good. 
The idea of trying to identify and to solve crimes by using DNA, 
a modern scientific tool, is sound.  I just wish the bill had

event.  Every year on the first Sunday of May, Canadians gather 
to remember the bitter battle of the Atlantic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the second world war the supply lines from home to the 
front lines were crucial to a successful campaign.  They carried 
valuable arms, material and personnel across the ocean.  It was 
not just a simple voyage across the Atlantic.  If it was not the 
dreaded German U-boats travelling in what was commonly known as 
wolf packs, it was the weather that caused havoc during the run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the merchant seamen to cross with the supplies, the air force 
and navy provided escorts to protect against the enemy.  The navy 
took the bulk of that responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The battle was costly to Canada; 50 merchant ships and 24 
warships lost.  Fatalities were almost 4,000 in the two navies 
and over 200 in the air force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To our veterans of the battle and to the families of those no 
longer with us, we thank them for their important contribution to 
their country.

economy is on track to post one of the strongest growth rates in 
this country this year and next.  As well, the province posted 
the lowest unemployment rate in 15 years at 5.7%.  Much of the

an additional $100 million in spending on health care.

unanimous provincial consent for its position.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, just before Question Period we learned through the news 
of the Government of Ontario's announcement.  We of course 
received the Government of Ontario's press release but have not 
had direct contact from it. Therefore I think our first step

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should get the particulars on Ontario's position. 
This is obviously a new and important development.  It is a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

Canadians do not want to hear from this health minister again. He 
is a discredited health minister.  The only reason he should be 
on his feet is to announce a renegotiation of the compensation

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the history of this better shows that had it not been for the

at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we did come together, we developed a position that all 
governments agreed to in relation to those infected before 1986. 
Today's development is a new one.  The ground has moved and an 
important partner has changed its position.

Canadians are begging for some leadership from this government

with it, is just muddying the waters and saying it will look into 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back when Mr. Trudeau was Prime Minister, a Red Cross researcher 
named Dr. Moore called for testing of the blood supply.  Other 
countries were doing it and for nine years the Liberal government 
of the day chose to ignore them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not true that the real reason the Prime Minister will not 
compensate victims in the pre-1986 period is that he does not

offered, but there remains the $1.6 billion in care needed by 
victims that will be paid by the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Deputy Prime Minister or the Minister of Health admit 
that, by limiting its contribution to $800 million out of a 
total of $2.7 billion to cover the cost of hepatitis C, and thus

or not, transfers have been cut and then frozen.

my question is for the Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is clear what all Canadians want.  They want all 
victims of hepatitis C from tainted blood to be compensated. 
Frankly they want the finger pointing in this place and elsewhere 
to stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health himself has said that this is a new 
development.  It is certainly grounds on which he could call the 
federal and provincial health ministers together.  Will he do 
that?  Will he let Ontario put its new position to the entire set 
of health ministers and himself and see if they can all get their 
heads together and solve the problem? 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I welcome the refreshingly constructive approach reflected in the

think he is quite right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a new development here.  It is a significant 
development.  One of the major partners in confederation has 
changed its position on an agreement that all governments had 
reached.  Let us look at this new development. Let us find out 
from more than the wire story what Ontario is saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already spoken with the chair of the provincial 
ministers.  He has indicated that perhaps a meeting of ministers 
at this point would be appropriate because in the last analysis, 
our responsibility is together—

<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would hate to think that all of this is happening just 
because Ontario changed its mind.  It is not a major player, it 
is a province and if any other province changes its mind, I hope 
it might have the same effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the meeting take place?  Are the ministers of health 
going to meet this week?  Let us get this thing over with.  Let 
us do the right thing.  There is a new development.  Get the 
ministers of health together. Let us get a solution which meets 
the values of all Canadians, which is that these people should be 
looked after. 
<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as I have indicated to the member and to the House, we are going 
to find out from Ontario, from more than a wire story, what it is 
that Ontario is saying. I will be speaking with Clay Serby who is 
the minister from Saskatchewan, this year's chair for the

meet.

now. I will do so at the end of my question so that he can deal 
with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary responsibility for the control of blood safety rests 
with the federal government. It is clear that there are provinces 
that believe it is wrong to cut off 40,000 people who are 
suffering from hepatitis C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will this government and the Minister of Health show the 
same leadership as Ontario and compensate all hepatitis C 
victims?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
let me repeat for the member because she should know that if it 
was not for the leadership of the Prime Minister's government, 
then victims of hepatitis C would not be compensated at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we did meet, ministers in good faith did their best to come 
to an agreement on a difficult decision.  We all agreed on a 
position.  Ontario has now apparently changed its position.  That 
is an important development. As I have said to the House and I 
say to the member, we will now take a look at what it is 
Ontario— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. leader of the Conservative Party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have 
one province that has put its money where its mouth is, as asked 
by the Prime Minister of Canada.  That province is willing to 
help those who are sick through no fault of their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we also have a former senior official from the Department of 
Health, Dr. Brill-Edwards, who has stated “If the federal 
government had been doing its job safeguarding the blood supply, 
then the huge numbers of people suffering and dying simply would 
not be there”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the government not take the stand today, do its job and 
compensate all hep C victims? 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I think the member should remember that the Krever report, which 
went into all of this history in great deal and examined what 
problems resulted in the tragedy, made it clear that while the 
federal government regularly played a part, the provinces as 
proprietors and the Red Cross as operator of the system were also 
at fault. 
I reassure the member we will look at what Ontario is proposing. 
If it is a significant development then we shall respond 
appropriately.

the provinces in renegotiating this agreement?” 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to assure my hon. friend and all Canadians it 
has always been and it will continue to be our intention to do 
the right thing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  So 
far we have not seen any doing the right thing on this file, Mr. 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this renegotiation occurs the current health minister's 
credibility will be shot.  He will be incapable of renegotiating 
a new agreement.  The current health minister has misrepresented 
the position of the provinces from the very beginning in the 
House. He has bad mouthed them and he tries to take credit for 
giving leadership when the leadership is coming in this case from 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will we have a new health minister who would be capable of 
renegotiating in good faith with the provinces?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Leader of the Opposition should know that we discovered at 
one o'clock this afternoon what Ontario was proposing.  Ontario 
is the province that has changed its position three times in the 
last seven days.  We apparently have a new position from Ontario, 
but I for one would rather find out directly from Ontario and 
when we do find out we will react appropriately.

<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  Seven months 
after the Calgary declaration, a Léger & Léger-COMQUEST survey 
reveals that no one, or virtually no one, knows what is in the 
declaration, and that those who do have an idea of its content 
say it will not lead anywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister was concerned about the lack of consultations in 
Quebec compared to elsewhere, so what is his answer today, now 
that we know that 90% of the people of Canada are unable to say 
what the Calgary declaration contains? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I cannot comment on a survey when we have only seen 
part of it.  Only a few excerpts were published in the press and 
we can see from the wording of the questions that people were 
not really asked what the exact content of the Calgary 
declaration was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, according to a poll whose results were 
recently released in B.C. this past January, 54% of the people 
surveyed in British Columbia were familiar with the Calgary 
agreement, 62% supported the unique character of Quebec society, 
69% supported the role of the National Assembly, 80% supported 
the Calgary agreement, and 66% would have no objection to 
inclusion of this agreement in the Constitution. 
<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
is confusing wishful thinking with reality.  At the time of 
Meech and of Charlottetown, the minister was an attentive 
observer of the Canadian political scene.  He noted that each of 
these initiatives led to total failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that he has become a front line player in the creation and 
follow-up of Calgary, is he not just reshooting the same old 
film, with the same old actors, and the same old predictable 
ending, in other words the Calgary declaration, which is not 
enough for Quebec and far too much for Canada? 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, the Calgary agreement is not a 
constitutional text.  Moreover, there is something interesting 
here in connection with what went on at Charlottetown.  At 
Charlottetown, a post-referendum survey indicated that the 
majority of Canadians were unable to name a single clause from 
the Charlottetown agreement.  On the other hand, when they were 
shown it clause by clause, Canadians, Quebeckers included, were 
somewhat against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difference with the Calgary agreement is that when people 
are surveyed about whether they are in agreement with each of 
its clauses, there is very strong support in Canada, Quebec 
included.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs says that the unique

that it does not confer any special status on Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for

by all Canadians to have a federation that respects the 
principles of equality, it being understood that equality is not 
synonymous with uniformity, but must go hand in hand with deep 
respect for the country's diversity, including the unique 
character of Quebec society. 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the minister said he went into politics to sell English Canada 
on the idea of distinct society.  When he sees how strongly 
opposed Canadians are to entrenching special status for Quebec 
in the Constitution, does he realize that, even though he has 
tried to sell Quebec short, his plan is destined to fail 
abysmally?

did their jobs?

the people who were originally brought to the other place by 
election.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the government promised to renegotiate the NAFTA to

that the justice department had agreed to provide certain 
documents to members of the Standing Committee on Justice and

apparently been supplied with the documents last Friday, he 
himself had not received the documents until this morning.  This, 
he argued, constituted a breach of his privileges as a member of

been informed that the documents were offered by the minister to 
the committee as a matter of courtesy and not as a result of a 
formal request made by the committee. There seems to have been a 
bona fide effort made by the department to forward the 
information to committee members in a timely fashion but 
obviously some difficulty arose.

find that any privilege has been breached.  While this may amount

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>DNA IDENTIFICATION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK217">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-3, an act respecting 
DNA identification and to make consequential amendments to the 
Criminal Code and other acts, as reported (with amendment) from 
the committee; and the motions in Group No. 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Before question period the member for Fraser 
Valley had the floor. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to talk briefly about Bill C-3, an act respecting DNA 
identification.  I started my comments just before question 
period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who are watching this debate it would be useful for 
them to consider this bill as the new fingerprinting act of the 
1990s.  It is what used to be done with fingerprints back when 
that was the leading edge technology for identifying people who 
had been at the scene of a crime. Once someone was convicted of a 
crime, their fingerprints were entered into the record never to 
be taken away.  People who were repeat offenders and so on could 
therefore be found. Bill C-3 in essence should mirror the efforts 
that were made during what I imagine were similar debates on what 
to do with fingerprint evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can generally be understood why we support the bill. It 
allows the police to take a DNA sample. That DNA sample could be 
very useful in the prosecution of a crime and the conviction of a 
criminal.  The sample would be in the criminal's permanent 
records in case that person ever committed another crime. For all 
those reasons it is easy to support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate as I said before question period that the bill 
does not treat evidence the same way as it treats the taking of 
fingerprints. I will explain that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the police charge someone with a serious crime, under the 
current rules they are taken to the police station and upon 
charges being laid their fingerprints are taken.  Those 
fingerprints may or may not be kept on the permanent file, 
depending on whether or not the person is convicted.  In other 
words, the fingerprints are taken.  If the person is convicted, 
the fingerprints become part of the person's permanent record. 
The fingerprints go along with the person's photo and other 
information about that individual into the person's permanent 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 is a half-step toward that.  Instead of allowing the 
police to collect the evidence at the time of the charge being 
laid, it does not permit samples to be taken other than from 
designated dangerous offenders, upon the charge being laid. 
Unfortunately that means that evidence which should form part of 
the evidence on that person's file is not necessarily available 
to the police at all stages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within this first grouping it is important to note that there 
are some amendments to support and some not to support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Motion No. 1 with respect to privacy we understand the need 
to keep that DNA evidence, just like fingerprints, if we can 
think of it that way, and it is important that that evidence not 
get out into the general public.  It would not be proper to take 
a DNA sample and, because of either sloppy record keeping or a 
poor effort on behalf of the police or the court, to allow those 
records to get out into the general population.  DNA evidence is 
evidence used by the police in their work and it should stay that 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first motion is unnecessary because the bill already fully 
recognizes the potential of that DNA evidence to get out into the 
general public.  If it is improperly used, it is a violation of 
the person's rights or their privacy. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already in the bill there is a provision that carries a term of 
up to two years for someone charged who wilfully or knowingly 
gives DNA evidence improperly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, if somebody sells DNA, gives it away, does 
something with it that is improper, this is a criminal offence 
just like it is to give away evidence that is on police files 
right now.  Those files are secure for obvious reasons, and so 
they should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 about respect of privacy is unnecessary in our 
opinion.  There are already provisions in the bill that are 
sound.  The provisions are adequate and they respect the privacy 
necessary with the taking of DNA samples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 is easy to support.  This amendment says that we do 
not want all private agencies and labs taking samples and so on. 
We want to have some quality control on DNA. A single strand of 
hair, anything, could contaminate or change the DNA sampling 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the most rigid standards be upheld so there 
is no contamination, no possibility of a file being mishandled or 
misinterpreted.  In other words, it should be done with the 
highest of standards because they may literally be taking 
someone's life in their hands.  That person may be committed to a 
lifetime of imprisonment if the matter is not handled properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to see a government agency handle that.  It is not 
that government agencies have a perfect record, as we have seen 
from the hepatitis C issue we have been debating in the House of 
Commons lately. What can be done with a government agency is put 
restrictions, guidelines and quality control on it that will 
ensure, to the best extent possible, that someone will not have 
their DNA sample somehow mishandled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One agency does it.  There is one set of rules.  It is a not for 
profit agency and that is the best way to ensure that standards 
are upheld.  It is easy to support Motion No. 2 and we will be 
doing that when the vote comes later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3 talks about safeguards against wrong persons 
accessing.  Again it is the same argument I used on Motion No. 1. 
There are safeguards against persons accessing that DNA 
databank. We want to ensure that only properly qualified people 
who have the authority to work with those samples have access to 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again we believe there are adequate safeguards in place and do 
not believe this third motion to create a new level of safeguards 
is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final amendment within this grouping, Motion No. 5, talks 
about a three year review of this process.  At first blush it 
might seem like a good idea.  It may even be necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government I believe will be revisiting this bill if it 
passes it as is.  If it does not pass the amendments we have put 
forward, I believe it will be back for review.  It will not be 
because there is a mandatory three year review.  It will be back 
for review because it just will not work properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Police Association has already said that it is not 
happy with the way this bill is drafted.  It wants to see some 
changes in it.  It wants to give the police the tools necessary 
to do their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully, if some of these amendments pass, I do not believe 
this amendment will be necessary.  The three year review will not 
be necessary.  It will be a make work project for a very busy 
justice committee but I do not believe it is necessary if the 
amendments go through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be interested to see what the government says during the 
course of this debate to see if any of these amendments are going 
to see the light of day.  If they are not, we may need a review. 
I think it will happen whether we ask for it or demand it in 
legislation or whether it just happens naturally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The review unfortunately will happen, mark my words, if the 
government does not pass the amendments the Reform Party and 
others have put forward today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to clarify for the people at home that I am generally 
in favour of setting up a DNA databank.  I think it makes a lot 
of sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When fingerprints were first brought in, they helped solve a lot 
of crimes that previously were unsolvable.  Having our DNA 
databank will give us the technological tools to solve crimes 
that right now we do not have the capability for. 
As a result it is generally a good idea.  But the problem with 
Bill C-3 as it stands is that it does not give the government as 
many opportunities as it would otherwise have with some of the 
Reform amendments and others across the way to go ahead and break 
these crimes, get these criminals convicted and incarcerate them.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first grouping of amendments, Motions Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5, 
the first amendment by an hon. member from the Bloc is with 
regard to the respect of privacy.  Unfortunately I am not going 
to be able to support my Bloc colleague on this because it 
basically precludes us from having access to information that we 
would otherwise possibly need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So even though it is something done with respect to privacy I 
would have a tough time in some of these circumstances to look a 
victim of rape in the eye and because of a lack of due process or 
some problem that would be laid out in this amendment be able to 
say that because of a technicality the offender walked free. 
Therefore I am not going to be able to support the Bloc member on 
Motion No. 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2, proposed by an NDP colleague, precludes private 
agencies and labs from taking samples and creates public 
standards and better accuracy of testing quality.  I believe 
these types of DNA materials or DNA information should be kept by 
the government.  I would have some problems with it being doled 
out to somebody or any group willy-nilly.  As a result I support 
this NDP motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only concern I have with this motion is that I hope, if 
indeed private laboratories become more advanced than the public 
ones we have for DNA identification and information gathering, 
that this will not preclude the use of some of the advanced 
techniques that private labs may have access to above and beyond 
the public ones, if that happens.  I think it would be a real 
travesty if we were to prevent justice from having access to 
advanced techniques that may be available in the private sector 
that would not possibly be available at that time in the public 
sector. On that level that is the only caution I give to NDP 
Motion No. 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3 is to safeguard against wrong persons accessing the 
DNA databank. This again speaks to the first motion.  Once again 
it is from my hon. colleague from the Bloc.  We have to make sure 
there is privacy and this information is not doled out to 
anybody.   It is something used almost exclusively for this 
criminal work and nobody else has access to it unless they are 
actually doing work with regard to the investigation of a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 5 is basically viewed as a make work amendment in 
that it asks for a three year review.  If we are able to get some 
of these amendments on the national databank passed then we are 
not going to have to worry about as many reviews of the 
legislation in the process if we set it up right in the first 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking to the generalities of these four motions in the first 
group motions and how they impact the bill as a whole, we are 
looking to set up a registration system so that we can track 
those offenders, those violent criminals, and prosecute and 
convict them where possible.  The government has no problem going 
ahead and registering people, law-abiding citizens, with Bill 
C-68.  On firearms certainly there should not be a problem with 
being able to give the necessary tools even above and beyond what 
we have here in Bill C-3, to enhance the ability of police 
officers to go ahead and convict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these suggestions were provided to us by the Canadian 
Police Association.  It is not just the Reform Party standing 
here in the House today asking for increased powers and expanding 
jurisdiction of some of these things so that the national DNA 
databank can be more effective.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police and their representative, the Canadian Police 
Association, are asking for some of these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are reasons why some of these amendments need to be 
included and why the DNA databank needs to be as effective as 
possible. We would see a reduced cost of enforcement of the law 
and a greater ability to convict.  There would be an increased 
effectiveness of the enforcement of the law.  We believe in 
public safety.  We believe people deserve a sense of security. 
We should not be instilling a false sense of security. We should 
make this as effective as we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not believe in depriving the police, the RCMP or the 
respective municipal police forces, the tools necessary to to 
conduct their work in criminal investigations and violations of 
the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be bar none the most effective thing that has been 
changed with regard to the justice system in the collection of 
evidence since the introduction of finger prints.  Finger prints 
with their oils would probably leave some skin samples to enact 
some DNA information gathering.  It has expanded beyond the oils 
that are left on one's fingers and skin samples to hair and in 
the case of sexual crimes semen samples and blood samples.  All 
these things are now available to us to test and determine.  No 
one else in the world will have the same DNA of a criminal left 
at the scene of the crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gist of this is good but half measures are not good enough. 
That is why we have to make changes to this bill to make sure 
that it is better than what it is.  Because of DNA people who are 
innocent and who have been charged with a crime will not be 
convicted wrongly.  It is the innocent who will triumph in this. 
They will be vindicated by DNA information gathering.  If they 
were not at the scene of the crime, it will be that much more 
easily ascertained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I leave this caution with the government.  We ask some of the 
fundamental questions of cost, who wants it and other questions 
I have asked before in this Chamber.  The cost of our not 
making these amendments to make this as effective as possible and 
to expand the range of the collection of DNA evidence will 
mean some people will walk free when they are criminals and 
should not be walking free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who wants it?  Obviously not only the police officers who 
enforce the law and the people who want to see justice but also 
the victims who would see some of their perpetrators walk free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the victims, for the Canadian Police Association, the police 
officers, for the law-abiding citizens who want to see justice 
served and a more effective justice system, we need to enact some 
of these changes.  We need to make sure that Bill C-3 does not go 
through without serious questioning and without making it the 
best that it could be.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am happy to talk about Bill C-3 and the Group No. 1 
amendments related to DNA identification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like to think Canadians are concerned about health and safety 
matters above all else.  There are some intensely personal 
questions that come to mind when we start thinking about health 
and safety issues.  It is useful to get off the topic of our 
criminal justice system for a minute and talk about our medical 
system to show a commonality in how people approach these 
intensely personal decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have, for example, technology breakthroughs in the medical 
area occurring all the time.  People buy into those technologies 
very readily.  It is very simple to equate the medical 
breakthrough, the medical technology with personal health 
consequences.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had lots of examples today.  This morning I was reading 
an article concerning mice and cancer and the two antidotes that 
they can put together to basically cut off the blood supply and 
shrink tumours to nothing.  This research could possibly lead to 
a real breakthrough for humans.  We will have no difficulty 
convincing the public at large, the funding groups, the health 
care deliverers or anyone else that this is all well and good, 
the way it should be and that it would have major consequences in 
a positive way for society at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We embrace new technology and people support it.  We understand 
the benefits and want the benefits of technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a lot of advances in technology on the crime prevention 
front as well so why would we think a lot differently in this 
regard?  I have some major concerns with this legislation because 
we and the government know the public wants DNA identification 
and a DNA databank.  It wants all those things.  We now know we 
have the technology as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has created Bill C-3, which we are debating now, 
and is selling it as if this will give the public what it wants. 
I am sorry, but when one reads the bill it is not giving the 
public what it wants.  It is actually completely tying the hands 
of our law enforcement people to utilize this new tool in a way 
that is going to benefit society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only rationale I can come up with as to why the 
government would do that is that it shows a consistent pattern. 
We have seen that consistent pattern displayed in other aspects 
of criminal justice legislation brought before this 
House.  It was demonstrated in question period today.  The 
justice bureaucracy knows that the fallout from implementing the 
firearms registry, the way it is currently legislated, will 
actually lead to increased smuggling and to an increased premium 
for black market firearms.  We have known this on an ad hoc basis 
for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We knew that because we had reports in the media at the time 
that bill was introduced thanking the justice minister from 
people involved in those various illicit activities because they 
were going to improve profit margins.  This is not rocket 
science, but unfortunately it is a case where the government is 
legislating on a politically correct basis rather than on what 
will achieve positive results for society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the same thing from this government in terms of 
conditional sentencing.  That legislation went through in the 
last parliament.  This is the legislation that allows judges to 
not impose prison sentences for various reasons.  That can be an 
enlightened thing to do but it is not an enlightened thing to do 
when we are talking about violent or sexual offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform amendments in the last parliament tried to ensure the 
legislation would apply only to violent and sexual offenders.  We 
were told by the government that it need not be in the 
legislation because that is the way it would be applied.  We are 
sorry, but that is not the way it has been applied. 
We have walking, talking, living examples of violent sexual 
offenders who have been given essentially no sentences, 
conditional sentences.  These people are hazardous and risks to 
society.  Many of them have reoffended because they have not been 
in prison.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have DNA legislation that only scratches the surface of 
what is possible.  We know national standards are needed with 
this legislation.  Quality control guidelines and restrictions 
are needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other technologies will be coming to the crime prevention front. 
If we are to tie the hands of our enforcement people on this 
technology, what are we doing?  Are we denying ourselves the 
benefits of other new technologies?  Another new technology has 
already proven itself once.  It has many of the same benefits of 
DNA technology but it is all based on odour.  Up to a month after 
it can be determined whether an individual has been in a room in 
that timeframe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another example of the enlightened use of technology, 
which I believe happened in England.  A perpetrator said in court 
that he had never been somewhere.  It turned out that there was 
some plant material in his clothing.  They compared a sample from 
his clothing with trees from all over that nation. They 
determined that the DNA from the plant material could only come 
from the place where the crime was committed.  That is a nice 
non-intrusive use of DNA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we not enact the very best legislation we can when we 
have an obvious public taste for it instead of having the 
appearance of legislation?  I do not know how to respond to that. 
We used to be able to go to someone with a basic toolbox when we 
needed to have our cars fixed.  Now we have to go to someone with 
computer technology, with diagnostic equipment and so on.  As 
society moves, our legislation has to move.  As this bill is 
constituted, it does not cut it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am rising today to speak to Bill C-3, an act respecting DNA 
identification.  We are dealing with the Group No. 1 amendments 
to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. The member knows it is not permitted to refer to the 
presence or absence of members in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But having done so I think it is only fair to point out that his 
party is far outnumbered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I gather that is not 
taken as a point of order.  I did not make any remark about 
members opposite but since the point has been raised I will say 
that normally one finds more members in the opposition benches 
than on the government benches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was remarking on the heckle of a member opposite who said what 
a waste of time to have a quorum call.  They believe it is a 
waste of time participating here in the highest chamber of 
democratic deliberation in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That reflects the sterling commitment to democracy and 
conscientious representation we saw from members opposite on the 
hepatitis C vote.  It is shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that members opposite are not willing to sit 
here and discuss this important bill to provide amendments to 
Bill C-3 on DNA identification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports the principle of the bill which is to 
provide access to our police forces and agencies to use the new 
biological technology available to them to develop evidence for 
the prosecution of criminals accused of serious crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of DNA identification is something the Reform Party 
has been pressing for over several years.  It is well known one 
of the raisons d'être of our party is to promote a justice system 
where the rights of victims are placed in greater balance contra 
the rights of criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all these bills dealing with the Criminal Code and 
evidentiary matters, sentencing matters, we must as members of 
this place strike a balance, an equilibrium between the civil 
liberties of citizens to not be convicted except in accordance 
with due process of law and in accordance with principles of 
fundamental justice on the one hand and on the other hand to 
ensure that we have a justice system that functions and 
throws away the bad guys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think all too often we end up with the wrong balance. All too 
often we become too concerned about the civil liberties of the 
Karla Homolkas of the world and not sufficiently concerned with 
empowering our peace officers and our police to enforce the 
criminal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good thing from our perspective that the government 
finally has come forward with some step in the right direction of 
DNA identification in Bill C-3 but we do find the bill falls 
short on a number of points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 from a member of the Bloc Quebecois is with regard 
to respect for privacy rights.  This proposed amendment goes on 
through six clauses giving detail of safeguards that should be in 
the legislation with respect to privacy. Quite frankly, this 
motion is redundant in so far as the bill already contains 
adequate safeguards to protect privacy of people vis-à-vis DNA 
identification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 487.07(1) on the respect of privacy and sections 
487.08(1) and (2) on the use of bodily substances already 
recognize the potential damage if DNA information is improperly 
used.  Also there are penalties included in section 487.08(4) 
which provide penalties for the contravention of these areas 
protecting privacy.  As a result we find Motion No. 1 redundant 
and therefore we will be opposing it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 comes from an hon. member of the New Democratic 
caucus.  It precludes private agencies and labs from taking 
samples.  It essentially limits the collection of DNA samples to 
the government through public agencies.  This seems like a 
sensible enough safeguard and we will therefore support Motion 
No. 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3 in this group of amendments deals with safeguards 
against the wrong kinds of people accessing information stored in 
the DNA databank and proposes a registry of those who would be 
accessing the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again we find this redundant in so far as provisions are already 
included in the act to protect against unauthorized personnel 
from accessing the personal DNA information included in the 
databank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Motion No. 5 deals with a review for the privacy 
commissioner to ensure that the act is not contravening the 
privacy rights of Canadians.  This seems like a completely 
unnecessary amendment in so far as Bill C-3 already empowers the 
privacy commissioner to review violations of people's privacy 
rights as enumerated in the privacy laws.  We will be opposing 
Motion No. 5 for that reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We really need to ensure with respect to all the amendments in 
Bill C-3 that our police agents, our peace officers, are able to 
enforce the law without undue red tape, burdens and hurdles.  We 
want to ensure that the civil liberties of Canadians and their 
rights to privacy are protected, but not at the expense of 
hamstringing the people who have the difficult job of 
investigating serious crimes and who need the evidence to convict 
and effectively prosecute the worst criminals in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to speaking to future amendments on Bill C-3 as 
we proceed through the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
gives me a great deal of pleasure to enter the debate on Motions 
Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5 in group one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to focus my remarks on three areas:  first, DNA as 
a technology; second, the privacy issue which is addressed by 
these amendments; and, third, getting to the point which the 
Deputy Prime Minister made such a point of in question period 
today of doing what is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referring to DNA as a new technology, we now have at the 
disposal of our law enforcement agencies a technology that allows 
them to pinpoint more accurately the identity of a perpetrator of 
a particular crime.  Not only is it a very useful tool.  It is a 
reliable tool and it is a valid tool.  Those are the two 
absolutely essential criteria that need to be applied to any 
scientific test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If two different scientists looking at the same sample come up 
with the same conclusion then we have some reason to believe the 
tests are reliable and are in fact are honestly depicting on a 
continuing basis, no matter who does the test, what the result 
will be.  It is also valid in the sense that it is an accurate 
depiction of who gave a particular sample and to whom it belongs. 
This is a very useful and necessary tool to make sure that 
mistakes are not made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this tool so important when it comes to crime detection 
and to identification of perpetrators of crime?  The number one 
point is obviously to protect society.  We want nothing more in 
our society than to be secure, to have happy families and to be 
safe on our streets.  We want to predict with reliability that we 
will be able to go down to the corner store to pick up our 
groceries and our lives will be safe, and that our children will 
be able to go to their school buses or walk to school without the 
need bodyguards and things of that sort.  That is what it is for. 
It is also there to protect the suspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All kinds of cases in this regard come to mind.  Most 
directly is the Milgaard case.  He was incarcerated 
after being accused of having committed a crime 
until the DNA samples revealed unequivocally that he was 
not the person who had committed the crime but that someone else had 
committed it. 
For many years he suffered incarceration because he was 
improperly identified.  We have here a very useful tool which 
should be available to law enforcement agencies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of the motions deal with privacy.  Of course we are 
concerned about privacy.  There is nothing more significant than 
privacy of the individual.  In fact we have appointed in the 
country a privacy commissioner whose job it is to make sure that 
there is not an unusual, unnecessary or unconstitutional 
intrusion into the privacy of individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last weekend we had in this city a discussion on electronic 
commerce.  The Information Technology Association of Canada came 
together with major business interests.  What did they talk 
about?  They talked about privacy.  They talked about the 
security of information.  They talked about the security of 
transferring funds from one institution to another or from one 
account to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the news report on Saturday in the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>?  It reported that the CIBC had some chip problems. What 
was the problem?  Several individuals had deposited money and it 
was not credited to their account via the automatic bank machine. 
The bank assures us and assures those individuals that they have 
a record and will be credited with those moneys. However it 
points out that the need for privacy is absolutely imperative and 
must be reliable and valid.  It is essential that this be 
provided for in the act and it is provided for in the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes beyond that.  We need to be sure that communication is 
maintained in a secure manner so that it goes only to those 
people who need to know, who have to know and for whose 
protection that information exists.  We need to recognize that 
not only is it protected from eyes that should not see it but 
also protected from use by people who have no right or need to 
use that information.  Privacy needs to be provided for and it is 
being provided for.  The amendments that are being proposed are 
redundant in that sense and I commend the government for having 
done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to move to the third area of doing what is right.  We 
need to do what is right.  In this connection I refer to the kind 
of statement that has been made with regard to hepatitis C 
victims.  The issue here is doing what is right.  In the hep C 
case it is making sure the people who are suffering are properly 
looked after.  That is one issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the area of crime with which the bill deals we 
have three issues to consider.  One is the careful identification 
and punishment of those who committed the crime.  The second is 
to identify in order to protect future victims from further 
perpetration of the same individual against them.  The third is 
the protection of society at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a sense when somebody commits a murder, a robbery or a 
violent act of any kind indirectly we are all victims because we 
do not know where the criminal will hit next.  It is important to 
protect the rest of us against that kind of perpetration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the right thing to do?  The right thing to do is to use 
the absolute best technology and tools available for the 
identification of those who have committed crimes so that future 
victims can be protected and that the victim who is currently the 
object of a crime may say the person who did it has been properly 
identified and punished accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes beyond that as well.  It means to do what is morally 
right.  The moral thing to do is to provide the assurance for all 
of society that the number one concern of the government is to 
have a justice system that is fair and that has laws that are 
right.  The laws must come out on the side of what is right and 
must punish that which is wrong.  That generates confidence on 
the part of the individuals that they can rely on the law.  More 
important and beyond that is the enforcement of the law.

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We spent a lot of money hiring good, qualified and trained 
police officers and other law enforcement officers.  We want to 
be sure that these people not only understand the law but 
recognize the significance of the law and are provided with all 
tools necessary to carry out the requirements of enforcing the 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we deny them the proper tools we cannot expect them to ensure 
our justice system meets the objectives for which it has been set 
out.   We as the official opposition submit that the DNA test is 
one of those.  The government will argue that is exactly what the 
bill is about.  It provides exactly that but it is just the 
beginning.  The government could have done so much better.  It 
could have done a complete recognition of the DNA act and have 
given it to the law enforcement officers in such a manner that 
they could use it unequivocally, unassumably and without 
restriction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the bill restricts.  It does not help.  It starts and goes 
so far and suddenly the persons trying to enforce the law say 
they cannot go any further and the very thing needed to bring 
about a conviction is denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the way a good legal system, a good justice system 
should work.  It is not the way a solid, good enforcement agency 
should operate.  It goes beyond this as well.  It goes to the 
point of recognizing that in order to do this job right we need 
to ensure that evidence is intact, remains intact and is 
accessible only to those who need to know, and those individuals 
are the enforcement officers, the judges and the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that these three motions in Group No. 1 should be dealt 
with as being proposed.  We would oppose the first motion.  The 
second one we would support.  The third and fifth ones we would 
oppose. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
intrigued with the subject of identification of people. 
Fortunately I do not have an identical twin; the world could not 
take two of us.  There is little doubt that I am a unique 
individual.  The DNA that would identify me is like an individual 
serial number that is cranked out at the time of manufacture. 
This identifies me as a unique person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my wife and I were first married we moved to a little town 
in Alberta.  Some of my acquaintances, having come from a large 
city, said “How can you stand living in that town?  Everyone 
knows what you are doing”.  I said “But I am not ashamed of 
anything I am doing so let them know who I am”.  The reason I 
say that is that I think it underlies the principle we are 
debating in this DNA bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people who have not done anything wrong want the 
identification process to work correctly so they are not 
incorrectly accused of and convicted of a crime.  On the other 
hand, those who have done something wrong are the ones who in our 
little town would hide behind the shades at night and leave town 
so no one would know what they were doing because they were not 
doing things they were proud of or they could defend in the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently when we come to identification there really is a 
dual question.  It is that ancient question of a justice system. 
There are two objectives in the justice system with respect to 
identification of criminals.  As my colleague has just stated, 
the overriding principle of our system ought to be the protection 
of law abiding citizens.  Consequently what we want to do is to 
correctly identify those in society who are not playing by the 
rules.  They are the ones engaging in criminal activity which 
endangers the life, property and safety of ourselves and our 
families. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want to do in this dual objective of identification is 
to correctly identify the person who has actually done the crime. 
The second part of that which is really the mirror image of it, 
is to make sure that we do not falsely identify a person.  In 
other words, we want to identify the person who is guilty and 
name the person as guilty rather than innocent. On the other 
hand, we want to be able to demonstrate that the person who is 
innocent is falsely accused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I taught mathematics and statistics for a number of years and we 
had in sampling for example the type <I>A</I> and type <I>B</I> 
errors.  One error was where if one had a sample in a 
manufacturing process and wanted to know whether or not a batch 
should be approved, one error was that you let the thing slide 
through when in fact it should be rejected.  The other error was 
that you rejected it when in fact it was a sample that was within 
the specifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA is new technology which enables us to do this.  It enables 
us to identify individuals in a unique way.  With respect to 
criminal activity, it is unique because individuals who commit 
certain crimes leave behind telltale traces of identification. It 
is as if I had my social insurance number on little pieces of 
paper and whenever I walked, every three feet one of those little 
pieces of paper would drop and they could be traced to see 
exactly where I went.  Criminals leave particles of skin, hair 
and other parts of their bodies in various ways.  Sometimes they 
are injured and they leave some blood.  There are many different 
ways in which to get a unique sample that carries the serial 
number of the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about here is using that technology in the 
most efficient way so that our law enforcement people can 
identify correctly the people who are actually guilty and 
exonerate those who are not guilty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the motions that are before us today, I would 
like to speak just in generalities.  We need to make sure that 
the police have the mechanisms to ensure that the DNA samples 
which are collected and kept are done so in such a way that the 
identification process can be implemented in the most efficient 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently there is a great need to make sure that the police 
are able to collect samples and maintain them in a secure 
fashion.  Certainly we also have to guard against the incorrect 
use of DNA as an identifier because obviously those who become 
aware that this is the identification that is used will soon 
invent ways of transplanting DNA evidence in order to implicate 
people who are innocent.  All of those processes have to be very 
carefully safeguarded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that what we are talking about here is protecting the 
innocent and making sure that the guilty ones are the ones who 
are hauled on the carpet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying in my analogy with respect to being ashamed of 
what one is doing, I really think that we err when we make rules 
favouring even the accused. I have often said that if I am 
accused of a crime I want the truth out if I am innocent, I 
really do.  If there is a databank somewhere which contains the 
DNA identification codes of a whole bunch of different 
individuals and I am innocent of that for which I have been 
accused, I would appreciate there being a databank available so 
that the true culprit could be found, arrested and found to be 
guilty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I think that only those who are afraid of being caught 
would like to see the samples destroyed in a timely fashion. They 
would want to make sure that the track of identification is wiped 
out as quickly as possible in order to reduce the probability 
that they would be identified, accused and convicted of the 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes right down to it, on behalf of law-abiding 
citizens of the country we want to strengthen this bill.  We want 
to make it so strong that it actually works and works efficiently 
and favourably to its purpose. Those who say that we cannot do 
this and that they do not want to do it, to a degree I do not 
really care what they say.  They may have their objections but 
what takes precedence here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk so much about the rights of privacy, the rights of this 
and the rights of that.  I sincerely ask at what stage do we say 
that the rights of law-abiding citizens and the rights and the 
protection of those citizens takes precedence over somebody 
having a DNA sample that maybe they should not have? That becomes 
secondary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course I would be very concerned if somebody had my 
fingerprint, my DNA signature and was able to use it incorrectly 
against me.  I want safeguards on that, there is no doubt about 
it.  At the same time, let us not hamper our police forces and 
our law enforcement agencies in their ability to do their work.

</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to again have the 
opportunity to speak and to try to refocus the debate on the 
bill before us today, which is Bill C-3 and the related 
amendments.  It is a change from talking in vague generalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first amendment proposed is Motion No. 4, which talks about 
the destruction of information in the convicted offenders index. 
As it now stands, subsection 9.(1) of the bill reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>9. (1) Subject to subsection (2) and the Criminal Records Act, 
information in the convicted offenders index shall be kept 
indefinitely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) Access to the following information in the convicted 
offenders index shall be permanently removed without delay— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It talks about permanent removal, even in cases where a 
conviction has been quashed, or absolute discharge given, or in 
the case of young offenders, but this is getting a bit more 
technical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we raised this in committee and asked why the file was not 
simply destroyed, instead of being permanently removed, we were 
told that this is complicated with computers, that they did not 
really know, that these were files, that it was technical, and 
so on. 
I was astonished, as were other witnesses.  If we have the 
technological know-how and scientific knowledge to analyse DNA, 
which is such a tiny thing, and are able to penetrate to the 
very centre of human cells to identify people, I cannot believe 
that we are unable to destroy computer files. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with precisely this in mind that the Bloc Quebecois has 
introduced Motion No. 4.  Instead of permanently removing the 
file and allowing it to float around somewhere in a computer 
bank, and not really knowing where it might end up later, let us 
destroy it and put an end to the problem.  Let us remove the 
temptation to put this computerized information to an improper 
use later on.  That was the purpose of Motion No. 4.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not come up with this on our own.  A number of witnesses 
who appeared before the committee said “Hold on, now, DNA 
technology is so powerful and potentially so powerful that 
something must be done to limit temptation as much as possible”. 
That is Motion No. 4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 6 is along the same lines: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“7.(1) The Commission shall destroy the stored bodily substances 
of a person without delay after a forensic DNA analysis of these 
substances is first performed under this section”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If genetic testing is done, whether on saliva, blood or hair, 
the desired information has to have been obtained. 
Why then keep the hair, saliva or blood?  We already have the 
picture and the information required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the purpose of this is to take away possible 
temptation—because that is always present—so that our bodily 
substances cannot be misused.  Let us not forget that, when a 
sample is taken for analytical purposes, it is possible to have 
a number of pieces of information not only about the person from 
whom the sample came, but also about that person's family, his 
or her parents, children, brothers and sisters.  The closer the 
other individual is biologically to the source of the sample, 
the more information can be gathered about him or her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 6 is, therefore, in the same vein as Motion No. 4. 
Let us take away the temptation, so as to avoid its use for 
other dubious purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now move on to the motions in Group No. 2. Motion No. 13 
concerns clause 22 on page 24.  This clause talks about section 
487.09 of the Criminal Code and reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subject to subsection (2), bodily substances that are taken from 
a person in execution of a warrant under section 487.05 and the 
results of forensic DNA analysis shall be destroyed, or in the 
case of results in electronic form, access to those results 
shall be permanently removed— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to what I said with respect to Motion No. 4.  If we 
have the technology to analyse DNA and see right inside a 
person, why make a point of not destroying the computer file? 
It can be done, instead of just eliminating the link between a 
given individual and his data, which would float around 
somewhere in the bank.  Let us destroy the information in the 
databank. 
Let us remove the temptation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us ensure that the right to privacy is sacred and that it 
will be respected not just today, but in future as well.  It 
must not be forgotten that the bill before us today will be good 
for five, 10, 15 or 20 years, and is only a precedent that will 
undoubtedly change as technology advances, and goodness knows it 
is advancing quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us therefore remove the temptation and ensure that the 
privacy of all Canadians will be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the 
hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre, Hepatitis C. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I rise for a number of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I rise in support of the Group No. 2 motions to amend Bill 
C-3, an act to establish a DNA databank. In speaking to those 
motions some things have to be clarified for those who will be 
listening to and reading this debate.  I refer to some of the 
comments made earlier in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a question everyone is interested in when we deal with 
this subject.  It was raised at the committee on numerous 
occasions.  My hon. colleague from Crowfoot and I had discussions 
about this matter.  The question is what is the difference 
between the DNA samples and fingerprinting?  We have heard 
various scenarios around that.  It was the subject of reasoned 
debate and questions to many of the witnesses who came before the 
justice committee during the many weeks we took to examine this 
piece of legislation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT63"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT63"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1615

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard comments in the House today that there is no real 
difference, that this is the new fingerprinting technology as we 
move into the next millennium.  But there is a clear difference 
and it has to be enunciated and understood.  Although I have 
still not received the written decisions of the supreme court 
justices that were referred to earlier on a point of order, it is 
my understanding that they concur with my interpretation of the 
difference between fingerprinting and DNA analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put this into the simplest terms, I questioned different 
members of the justice department.  Let me explain it this way. 
The taking of a DNA sample is a taking of the self.  It is a 
taking of a piece of the person, whereas a fingerprint is an 
image of the person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps even a simpler way to put it would be to say that if one 
thinks a crime was committed at 1313 Mockingbird Lane, one might 
take a photograph of that home.  That is like a fingerprint.  But 
to give the authorities the right to walk into the home and take 
the furniture is a completely different thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a misnomer to say, as we move with this new technology 
into the next millennium, that it is the same as fingerprinting. 
It is not.  It is an intrusion into the very sense of the person, 
into the very being of an individual.  When my colleague, the 
hon. member for Charlesbourg, talks about the necessity of making 
sure that we have safeguards, it is to protect the individual 
self from any intrusion by the state, by the government into a 
person's most fundamental being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that point needed to be clarified.  It is an interesting 
debate.  It is an interesting question.  As we enact this 
legislation and as it takes shape over the next three or four 
years before it comes back to this House for review, it will be 
interesting to see exactly how both the authorities and the 
courts deal with that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I can move to the issue before the House, that is, the 
questions put by my hon. friend from the Bloc, I support them in 
part.  I submitted myself a very similar amendment which I 
believe the government looked at carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was my contention that the DNA ought to be destroyed 
absolutely.  My colleague has indicated in his amendment that the 
index should be destroyed without delay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting thing is that there was considerable concern 
among the committee members when we were told that the DNA index 
of an innocent person could not be destroyed absolutely.  That 
was the question put to them.  “Why do we not say that the index 
will be destroyed if the person is innocent?”  There was a pause 
and then we were told “On the computer screen we cannot destroy, 
absolutely, that index.  Fragments of it will remain, but they 
can't be used for anything.  It is impossible for anybody to 
detect what it means”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard over and over again in this debate that technology 
is moving at a rapid pace, that we can barely keep up with the 
advances in science.  Who is to say that if an innocent person's 
DNA is taken and analysed and put into the databank and traces of 
it remain that the technology in 10 years will not be there to 
take those traces and piece them together to determine what the 
genetic code of an individual is, whether they have a 
predisposition to certain illnesses, whether they ought to be 
insured and whether they ought to be hired for particular jobs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the motion put forward by the member for Charlesbourg 
has some real merit.  For that reason I would support Motions 
Nos. 4, 6 and 13, all of which provide safeguards for the 
destruction of the DNA profiles and bodily samples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we keep those samples?  My colleague asks a good 
question.  We live in an age of media celebrity.  One can only 
imagine how much some hair samples from the scene of the accident 
where the Princess of Wales was killed might fetch on the open 
market if they were stored in some databank in some DNA 
laboratory for the next 20 years. 
Why not destroy them?  Why not ensure that privacy is protected 
and that people are safeguarded?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been some comments that the bill does not go far 
enough in terms of giving the police what they want.  That goes 
to the merit and the substance of the bill and I will speak to 
that later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I should point out that we are only at this point debating 
the amendments to the bill, so I do not want to use up any more 
time than I have to.  With regard to the amendments in Group No. 
2, I can indicate my support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise 
to speak on the motions in Group No. 2.  There are three of them 
and they were all put forward by the Bloc member.  I appreciate 
his participation on the committee, as well as our hon. colleague 
from the NDP.  They were very concerned about this particular 
area of the bill, that is, the privacy and the potential improper 
use of DNA samplings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is whether these amendments are needed in order to 
maintain the safeguard over not only the DNA samples, but the 
analysis, the profile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 6 has to do with clause 10, paragraph (7).  The 
beginning of it reads: “The Commissioner shall nevertheless 
destroy the stored bodily substances of a person without delay”, 
and then the bill gives the conditions:  (a), (b), (c), (d) and 
(e).  The hon. member's motion would come in after (e) and read 
this way:  “The Commission shall destroy the stored bodily 
substances of a person without delay after a forensic DNA 
analysis of these substances is first performed under this 
section”.  It says exactly that at the beginning:  “The 
Commissioner shall nevertheless destroy the stored bodily 
substances of a person without delay”.  Why do we need the 
second notation to say the very same thing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless I have read this wrong, or unless there is a problem in 
interpretation, I do not see the purpose of this particular 
amendment.  Maybe my hon. colleagues who support the motion and 
who moved it can explain the rationale for this, but that 
provision is already there under 10(7).  I do not understand the 
amendment and I am puzzled over it.  It is the same thing with 
the other two amendments.  I think the provisions are already 
there to deal with the privacy aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from the NDP who just spoke is concerned about 
privacy.  It is a legitimate concern, but when we examined it in 
committee the expert witnesses provided very conclusive evidence 
that the profile of a DNA sample is useless for any other 
purpose.  The sample itself can be used for other purposes, but 
the profile cannot be.  It is the profile that goes into the 
index.  If it is difficult or impossible to remove the profile 
from the index, what is the concern?  What harm can it do?  They 
cannot go further with the profile or do anything more than 
simply compare it with another profile.  If there is an 
identification of that profile then, of course, they can identify 
where that sample came from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I struggle to understand why we are so concerned about a matter 
when the evidence before the committee indicated a lack of 
concern.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the idea that the taking of a DNA sample is intrusive. 
However, we now hear that DNA can be picked up off a glass that 
someone drank from.  It can be picked up from a Kleenex used for 
blowing one's nose.  It can be picked up from a swab or a 
band-aid that might have been put on a finger.  I have a band-aid 
on my finger because I cut myself.  If I discarded this, there is 
my DNA sample. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are literally hundreds of thousands of samples taken every 
year.  For every child who is born a blood sample is taken. 
There are blood banks.  Every time we go to the doctor to have a 
medical and a blood sample is taken it is stored.  We have not 
seen any evidence of the abuse of the blood in blood banks now in 
existence and growing at a fantastic rate, probably faster than 
the DNA bank will ever grow because for every child who is born a 
sample is taken and every time we go to the doctor and give a 
blood sample it goes into a bank somewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this were a legitimate concern, that someone might have a 
vested interest in getting hold of these samples to do some kind 
of insurance check or whatever, I am sure there would be evidence 
of that now, and there is none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the threat to our privacy with regard to this 
bill and the powers it will give I think we should balance it 
with reality.  The reality is that there is a huge databank now 
in the blood banks.  We do not see abuse emerging from them that 
my hon. colleagues have suggested could emerge from a databank 
controlled by the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no provision for the misuse of the samples which are 
now in society's databanks.  In this bill we have a two-year 
penalty for any misuse of those samples, or the profiles.  I 
think that the privacy of the individual who is compelled to 
submit a DNA sample is well guarded, certainly more so than when 
I went for my last physical and gave a blood sample. I do not 
know where that went and I have no reason to be concerned about 
it at this particular time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, if I am not concerned about my sample sitting in some 
databank in some clinic, why should I be concerned if my sample 
is sitting in the RCMP databank protected by law, protected by 
the privacy commissioner who has the right to audit the operation 
of that bank at any time?  Why should I be concerned when these 
other banks do not have those measures to protect my privacy?  I 
have no concern that those samples I have given over my lifetime 
are being used improperly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we are raising an issue, the justification for which 
does not exist.  Although I respect the concerns that have been 
raised by my hon. colleagues and witnesses who appeared before 
the committee, I say show me where there is justification for 
this alarm or concern and certainly I will take it under 
consideration.  But I have not seen anything to indicate that. 
The fact of the matter is that nothing can be drawn from a 
profile other than the identification factor.  From the sample, 
yes, it can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that I believe the samples should not 
be destroyed inasmuch as the new technology may be able to 
develop a better form of identification and a higher level of 
identification. 
If we can protect the samples or if we can protect the profiles 
surely we can provide the same protection for the samples under 
the act given the provisions within the act.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House to partake in this 
very important debate on this very timely and important piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been indicated by previous speakers, the motion put 
forward by the hon. member for Charlevoix is aimed specifically 
at the protection of the privacy of individuals and particularly 
the integrity of the test samples that may be taken by the police 
in the course of their investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with the previous speaker, I find myself in a position where 
I cannot in all conscience support this motion.  It had been 
clearly demonstrated at the justice committee, by a professional 
chemist who spoke of the ability scientists would have to destroy 
the actual DNA profile, that this is not a possibility.  The DNA 
profile itself is set up in such a way that it appears on a sheet 
with 24 other profiles.  If one profile were physically removed 
all the other profiles would fall and it would cause a mix.  I am 
not articulating this as well as the professor, but as I 
understand it is a physical impossibility to destroy the profile. 
I am puzzled as to the insistence of the hon. member from the 
Bloc that this motion be adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 4 of Group No. 2 is the first motion.  For the 
reasons I have indicated I feel it is not appropriate that we 
would be quick to embrace this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 6 was moved by the hon. member from the Bloc.  It 
speaks of the necessity of the commissioner to order without 
delay the destruction of stored bodily substances of a person 
after the forensic DNA analysis of those substances has been 
performed.  As indicated by previous speakers, I suggest this is 
not a necessity and this proposed amendment in its present form 
would contradict the previous amendment. That is to say that 
section 7.1 as amended would contradict section 7 of the same 
clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Charlevoix should have indicated in the amendment 
that there should be a deletion of section 7 if the amendment 
were adopted.  In its present form section 7 is clear and 
sufficient.  It would defeat the purpose if we were to do away 
with all the other safeguards.  The safeguards are crucial to the 
protection of individual rights.  The safeguards put specific 
onus on the commissioner to take into consideration certain 
factors as to when and where the substances and the DNA profile 
should be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a section that we should tamper with at this time.  I 
would not be supportive of this amendment for the reasons stated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 13 which appears in this grouping talks of the need 
to amend section 487.09 of the Criminal Code which speaks of the 
use of DNA sampling in trials or court cases where there has been 
an individual who has been found not criminally responsible. 
When a person is finally acquitted of a designated offence or any 
other offence with respect to the same transaction that 
individual would not be subject to any further review or that the 
DNA would never be sampled or used again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion calls for the destruction of bodily substances and 
the removal of the DNA profile of a person found not guilty by 
reason of a mental disorder.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe it is important to continue to store and to keep this 
information and profile of an individual as the current law does 
presently provide.  To destroy that information on the basis of 
the finding of the court would destroy the ability of the police, 
with the use of this sample, to establish that the individual had 
committed the actus reus. Whether they had formed the requisite 
mens rea, whether they had intended to do this act, would be a 
finding for the court.  At least they would be able to put some 
finality on the investigation.  They would be able to say we have 
the DNA profile, we have the individual who committed the act. 
That is an important feature that this amendment would prevent 
the law from doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 672 of the Criminal Code, which deals with mental 
orders, allows the courts to make specific findings with respect 
to a person's culpability and whether they have formed the intent 
to do so.  There are provisions aimed at individuals who have 
been deemed to be not criminally responsible.  This is not the 
time or the place for us to interfere with that, which is what 
this motion calls for.  It is tampering with the safeguards that 
presently exist.  It is not something that we should be getting 
into at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important amendments put forward are done so with the best 
of intentions.  They are done so with a very clear purpose by the 
hon. member for Charlevoix, to address privacy concerns.  Once 
again I am afraid that what we are in danger of doing should we 
accept these amendments is making this legislation unnecessarily 
cumbersome and more complicated than it is in its present form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are hoping to do by the enactment of this important and 
historic piece of legislation is give police officers the 
necessary tools to conduct criminal investigations, particularly 
into very violent offences.  This will help police officers to 
solve a great number of outstanding murders. This legislation 
will give those police officers a tool to get on with the very 
important task of solving these crimes not only for the purposes 
of holding people accountable for their atrocious acts but to 
give victims some closure.  It will give the families of those 
who have been affected an opportunity to come to grips with what 
has happened.  There are 600 cases in the province of British 
Columbia alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the process we are embarking on today by going through 
this piece of legislation and looking at ways to improve it and 
to beef up what the intent of this legislation will help police 
officers to perform the important tasks they are charged with.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, Motions Nos. 4, 6 
and 13 deal either with the destruction of DNA samples or 
information relative to the DNA databank. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 4 introduced by the member for Charlesbourg is more 
or less the same motion introduced, albeit in another form 
perhaps, and the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights 
rejected it on technical grounds, as several members have 
already pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion poses problems, particularly from a technical point 
of view because of the limits of the technology that was and 
will be used, because data concerning a particular offender 
cannot be destroyed.  We have already explained the technical 
reason for this. 
The link between identifying information and the actual profile 
is severed. 
It would be like removing all the telephone numbers from a 
telephone book, leaving a random list of telephone numbers and 
people's names, with nothing to connect them.  The link would be 
severed like that.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of the same motion deals with the communication 
of DNA information.  Once again, it is felt to be unnecessary, 
because clause 6 of the bill stipulates that the RCMP 
commissioner may communicate information in the databank only to 
a Canadian law enforcement agency or laboratory that the 
commissioner considers appropriate.  This is already covered in 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 6 deals primarily with the distribution of DNA 
samples. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again we have a problem.  The whole basis of DNA legislation is 
to establish a databank.  A databank cannot be established if we 
do not have the samples, if we destroy the samples immediately 
upon taking the profile and the analysis at this stage. Our 
committee heard numerous testimonies that the technology and the 
analysis advance on almost a daily if not weekly basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, if we were to destroy the samples right after the 
establishment of this one databank we would be defeating the 
purpose of the legislation which is to establish a DNA databank 
that will be useful not just now but in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a consequence we would like to keep the samples.  It is 
important to keep the samples because as technology evolves, we 
would have requirements at times to retest the samples.  The 
administrative costs associated with resampling everybody would 
be enormous.  DNA samples should be kept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding Motion No. 13, the government supports this amendment. 
I am of the opinion, having spoken to some of the other members, 
that the Reform Party and the Conservative Party do not support 
this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do because Motion No. 13 would amend paragraph 47.09(1)(b) of 
the Criminal Code to ensure consistency with equivalent 
provisions as outlined in the bill currently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 proposes the destruction of bodily substances of 
acquitted persons.  Unfortunately it does not make any 
distinction regarding the Criminal Code between substances 
obtained for acquitted mentally disordered and non-mentally 
disordered offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion will therefore ensure that bodily substances taken 
from any acquitted person are destroyed.  That is why we are 
calling on members to support this motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise on the second group of motions 
to make a few remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member from the Bloc had the best intentions in 
mind when he proposed these amendments.  They do not make the 
picture clearer as far as what we are trying to do with this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the overriding principle of this bill should be that we 
protect the law-abiding citizen, that we do everything possible 
to give that protection to people who are affected by criminal 
acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back to about March 1995 when my son was brutally 
attacked in Winnipeg.  He was beaten beyond recognition but hung 
on to life by a thin thread for a number of days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I phoned the police in Winnipeg to see what was being done 
to apprehend this person or persons who had attacked my son and a 
friend so brutally, they were rather at a loss.  They had had a 
similar incident at the same place in October and a person was 
killed. 
They felt this was another incident where a gang had demanded 
some kind of violent act from people who wanted to be initiated 
and that killing a person was part of the initiation to get into 
that gang. I would have done anything to catch that person. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had there been a databank available for the police to use in 
October, they could have at least marked the person even if they 
could not have apprehended the person.  They could have then 
cross referenced that sample with the sample of the persons who 
attacked my son.  I would have been very supportive of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the parliamentary secretary that we cannot try to 
take a piece out of a map. A map is very important to me when I 
travel across the country.  If a destination on the map has been 
erased or there is a detour I did not know about, I would get 
lost and the map would not be of much value to me. That is the 
way I look at this databank.  If we are going to form the bank, 
put some of the funding principles of the bank into the system 
and then erase the data samples of those who have been wrongly 
accused, we will run into a lot of problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often the intent of the bills we pass in this House is very good 
but the bills do not go far enough.  That is similar to when 
people plan trips.  They have a time limit within which to get to 
a destination. That is the way I look at this databank.  It is 
another tool we are being given to make sure we arrive at the 
destination we have been planning on over the last number of 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fingerprinting was a good tool.  It has worked for many years. 
It has been used in some good investigative work.  Now we have 
the extra tool of a DNA databank. We should make full use of it. 
We should use it to its best within the circumstances so that 
citizens and not the criminals get the protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are so often worried and concerned that criminals will not 
have their rights.  In my opinion when a criminal violates the 
law and he is involved in a violent act or in some act that 
affects society, there is a price to pay.  If the databank can be 
used to mark this individual in a way that is not public but is 
there for the protection of the ordinary citizen, then it should 
be used to its fullest extent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that the crime rate in Canada be brought 
down.  Statistics show that violent crimes are continually going 
up.  This is not just happening among the general population but 
with young offenders, adults and even some seniors.  When I read 
of violent crimes by seniors I do not know whether it is old age 
or their attitude toward each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were in the United States for a short holiday.  A couple of 
seniors were playing cards and before the game was over they were 
both dead.  One wonders how a couple of friends could be playing 
cards and get into such a furious fight that they would kill each 
other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes things are overdone but in many cases when these 
criminal acts occur, it is a matter of the police finding out 
what has happened and getting to the bottom and the truth of it. 
If criminals are aware of the fact that there is very little 
chance of them escaping the law, that in itself will deter crime. 
It is important that we have more impact on criminals to make 
them realize they will be caught and will serve a penalty.  That 
can override the few freedoms they demand because of the charter 
of rights. 
I would rather sacrifice somewhat and err on the principle of 
freedoms and rights than on the principle of criminality that the 
non-violent law-abiding ordinary citizen was not paying a price 
for.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become almost an accepted fact that someone in every 
family will suffer from a violent act.  That is sad.  Years and 
years ago when I was a teenager it only happened in large cities 
and it only happened to someone else.  I hear of drive by 
shootings in my own little town of Altona.  I hear of a murder in 
Miami because of the drug trade.  And I found out in the last 
couple of weeks that one of my neighbours was gunned down because 
he was involved as an undercover agent for the RCMP, and there 
are no clues as to who did it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore very determined that we in this House pass 
legislation that will make sure the criminals are apprehended. 
This bill is another tool for doing that.  It is important that 
we make this bill as effective a tool as it can be to apprehend 
criminals.  I think everyone is concerned about privacy and 
rights, but once people are affected by crimes and suffer through 
violent crimes, it becomes more important that we as lawmakers 
pass legislation that will protect citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are experiences in other countries where we can see how 
laws have affected the land.  I was in the Soviet Union in 1991. 
I was told there were only 40 people in the city of Moscow to 
enforce the laws. That was scary.  The government at the time had 
dictated law through the military regime.  There had been no 
civil law and the government's policy of perestroika was taking 
place.  The government did not have the laws of the land to 
protect law-abiding citizens. Following Soviet history in the 
last couple of years the criminal element has become stronger 
rather than weaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so very important that we give our RCMP and law 
enforcement officers a DNA databank that can identify people and 
which will not just catch criminals and ensure they were the ones 
involved in the criminal act but will also protect individuals 
who were not involved but happened to be in the wrong place.  I 
mentioned David Milgaard earlier as an example. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this 
group of motions but particularly Motion No. 4 strikes at the 
heart of the provisions of Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the people watching,  Bill C-3 is an act which provides for 
the establishment of a national DNA databank to be maintained by 
the commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and used to 
assist law enforcement agencies in solving crimes.  That is the 
overriding concern of Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that this group of amendments and particularly 
Motion No. 4 would suggest the elimination of the DNA index which 
is the exact purpose behind the whole bill.  I respectfully 
suggest that the purpose behind the motion may have been not to 
abuse or provide inadvertent access to the index. 
I can certainly respect, admire and support that intent. However, 
the way it is written suggests that the index itself should be 
eliminated.  It seems to me that contradicts the very purpose and 
essence of Bill C-3. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT71"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT71"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1655

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill goes on to do some other things.  It states exactly 
what the databank will consist of.  It consists of a crime scene 
index containing the DNA profiles derived from bodily substances 
found in places associated with the commission of certain types 
of serious offences and a convicted offenders index containing 
DNA profiles obtained from persons convicted or discharged of 
these types of offences.  This gives us a very clear indication 
of what exactly needs to be done here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose and intent of establishing an index is to protect 
both society in general and in particular a person who might have 
been found near the scene of the crime, who may not have 
perpetrated the crime but may have looked like he did the job and 
really did not.  The evidence that comes out of comparing 
profiles provides a much more accurate tool for the law 
enforcement officers to do the job they are charged to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill goes on to state that the enactment amends the Criminal 
Code to provide for orders authorizing the collection of bodily 
substances from which DNA profiles can be derived for inclusion 
in the DNA databank.  It also amends the Criminal Code to 
authorize the collection of bodily substances from offenders who 
meet clearly defined criteria and also are currently serving 
sentences.  A compulsory collection is included here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill, while admirable and while moving in the 
right direction, does not go far enough.  It suggests the right 
things and moves in the appropriate direction but it is clear 
that it does not give to the enforcement officer the freedom to 
use the best judgment available at the time in order to collect 
the necessary information and data so that a conviction might 
later result when comparing the various profiles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally the enactment contains specific provisions for 
regulating the use of these bodily substances collected and the 
DNA profiles derived from them and the use and communication of 
and access to information contained in the databank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is precisely in this connection that we have Motion No. 4 
which pertains to clause 9(2).  Subclause (2) is very clear.  It 
amends the Criminal Code in that “access to the following 
information in the convicted offenders index shall be permanently 
removed without delay after” and the conditions are spelled out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent here is clearly to limit the access so that if a 
person has been charged with an offence and the charge does not 
result in a conviction, while the evidence and the profile may be 
in the index, which should be and will be in the index, the 
access to that information is cut off if there is no conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this not exactly the kind of thing the charter of rights and 
freedoms is about?  It wants the privacy of the individual to be 
safeguarded so that it is not abused by other people and so that 
it does not become the object of abuse and misuse by other 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really significant that this provision be in the act. 
However the motion does not suggest access to the information. 
It would destroy the index itself. That is the error as I see it 
in this particular motion. 
I wonder if the member who proposed this motion actually thought 
about the fact that this would remove the index rather than 
provide the adequate safeguards for abuse or the access to 
information by persons who might use it for their own purposes or 
for misguided purposes of one kind or another.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect to the member who submitted this motion, I 
suggest that probably it is not the kind of motion that would 
serve the interests of the intent of the bill, nor would it 
provide for the purposes intended of a sound and adequately 
balanced justice system in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to revert now to the purpose of the DNA profile in 
the first place.  We have had cases in Canada where individuals 
have been accused of committing a crime and where all the 
evidence points in the direction that the individual did commit 
the crime, but there was no conclusive evidence.  It was largely 
circumstantial.  In fact, the circumstantial evidence was so 
powerful that the best lawyers' and the best judges' minds were 
put to work on this case and the individual was convicted and 
incarcerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then with the persistence of people moving on and on and saying 
we need absolute evidence that is incontrovertible so that we can 
say clearly this person did commit this crime, they discovered 
that the circumstantial evidence was not supported by more 
concrete evidence.  What was the evidence that was used to take 
away the doubt in this case?  It was the DNA profile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is absolutely essential if we are to have a fair and 
just justice system that we have a tool, the best possible tool 
that has been made available to us through technology and 
science, to identify clearly and unequivocally who the individual 
was. That is exactly what the DNA index is designed to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it is so essential that the enforcement officers be 
able to collect those kinds of samples that will result in an 
accurate and indisputable profile of a person and that the 
profile is absolutely unique and completely distinguishable from 
any other person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that kind of operation is possible, it should not be 
restricted to be used in an arbitrary or capricious way. The 
amendments proposed in this bill in general are the good ones. 
They should be supported.  But the bill should go further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 4 in my opinion does not do that.  In fact, it 
restricts the bill even more.  I recommend that we oppose this 
amendment and consider very carefully how we can improve the 
enforcement of our legal system and also make sure justice 
prevails, that our streets are safe and that law-abiding citizens 
are protected and carefully rewarded. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
speaking now to the second group of motions. I want to clearly 
identify for the folks at home what we are speaking to. It is 
Bill C-3, the national DNA databank.  There are 13 motions.  We 
are now referring to Motions Nos. 4, 6 and 13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give a brief thumbnail sketch, one motion would basically 
destroy the convicted offender index. The whole purpose of the 
national DNA databank is to establish an index of those people 
who are convicted offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it speaks directly against the whole purpose of the 
bill.  If the purpose of the bill is to establish a national 
index of convicted offenders and if Motion No. 4 proposed by a 
member from Bloc is to actually destroy the index, then it speaks 
directly against the main purpose of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is more destruction yet.  Motion No. 6 speaks to the 
destruction of stored bodily substances. 
To develop the index we need stored bodily substances.  There is 
a debate in terms of whether once we have a profile established 
we need to keep the bodily substances, because once we have the 
profile, supposedly we have the profile.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask hon. members to think back with me in a bit of a tale. 
Imagine if previous to the discovery and the understanding of the 
double helix structure we had the ability to collect substances 
from the scene of a crime but without DNA evidencing or without 
being able to break things down on a DNA level and without being 
able to analyse bodily substances we would not be able to know 
whether they were the substances of that offender or criminal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like we are standing on the edge of a technological cliff, 
on the edge of a brave new world.  If we destroy these substances 
when the government has admitted here today that it was brought 
forward by chemists in committee that each day or each week 
advancements are being made in DNA technology, in the ability to 
analyse these things forensically or otherwise, we are tossing 
away data that will be vital in terms of the prosecution of these 
crimes.  That is a crime in itself.  That speaks to Motion No. 6. 
If we destroy these bodily substances when it would be easy 
enough to keep them on file and to bank them, all we are doing is 
keeping the profile as it stands right now at the simplistic 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far be it from me as somebody who is not a chemist but a mere 
politician to determine whether 10, 15 or 20 years down the road 
chemistry will advance or DNA analysis will have advanced to the 
point where the profiles can be much more expansive than what 
they are right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 13 is with regard to once again destroying bodily 
substances.  Here the idea is to keep it in sync with other parts 
of the Criminal Code in terms of destroying substances or pieces 
of evidence in the case of acquittal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again let us think about this is terms of the victim and in 
terms of those who are innocent and want to be proven innocent 
and want to get their acquittals as opposed to those people who 
are actually the offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many times we have taken into account the rights of the 
criminal rather than the rights of the victims in this 
circumstance.  I am will now go over some of the arguments that 
have been brought forward today with regard to the second set of 
motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my colleagues in the Reform Party brought this up and it 
was very effective.  The idea comes up that if one lives in a 
small town everybody knows what one is up to and is that not 
awful.  Actually it is only awful if one is not very proud of 
what one is up to.  This once again speaks to the whole idea of 
innocents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have this national DNA databank and if substances are kept 
past one's acquittal and if bodily substances are kept rather 
than just the minuscule or whatever type of profile we are able 
to have at this time, never mind what we are going to have 10, 15 
or 20 years down the road, the only people who have something to 
fear in this case are the criminals, not the innocent, for indeed 
they are the ones who shall be set free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Merely it raises the question of what these people are doing if 
they are so worried about having a DNA databank that stays for 
longer than a year or for just that crime or case. The whole 
purpose of having the index is so that we can cross-reference 
these things when other crimes come up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the Bloc members asked why we should keep these 
materials.  We may need more samples to go ahead and verify a 
sample.  Once again, I am not an expert in these things but if 
there are multiple clippings of hair or types of blood at a site 
and merely one sampling is taken then destroyed, what if there 
were other blood samples mixed in?  We want to be able to know 
these things, so keeping the actual bodily substances is 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point that I have already raised is to future 
testing.  I think I would be a poor person to judge at this 
moment in history whether technology will change and allow us the 
ability to make further testing, more comprehensive testing than 
what we have right now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>NDP members also had a chance to speak to this set of motions. 
They said it was an intrusion of the self and that it was too 
important in terms of the intrusion of the self to allow these 
bodily substances and these databanks to be maintained. They said 
we should seriously question this.  The destruction of these 
things in what they considered to be due process it would be the 
best thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is part of what we are getting at here.  If all we 
are worried about all the time is the intrusion on the actual 
criminal, if we are worried about in a sense how the case of the 
defence stands, then we are not having as a primary concern the 
rights of the victims rather than the rights of the criminal.  In 
that case, when there is a rape or a murder, why are we more 
worried about the intrusions made on the victim than the 
intrusions made on the criminal in these investigations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often we are concerned with the criminal legal system, not 
enough with the victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard today from a Reform colleague of mine about how 
blood banks are far exceeding the expansion and growth than 
anything we could possibly be worried about at this point with 
DNA databanks.  If that is the case we certainly have a precedent 
set already with the expansion of blood banks for every new 
infant.  To collect data in the case of crimes is merely doing 
due diligence for law-abiding citizens who want to see injustices 
righted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservatives, our Tory friends in the House, 
also spoke to this, the member in mind having actually sat in on 
the justice committee.  He said that according to people who 
presented there was great difficulty, indeed an impracticality, 
with regard to the destruction of DNA profiles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having 20 profiles on a page and trying to destroy one, and 
thereby in some way tampering or destroying an entire page, it is 
getting rid of the whole purpose of having an index.  Once again, 
if we are going to go to this trouble, if we are to increase the 
effectiveness of the enforcement of law, why tamper with the 
index in any way?  We should want to have it.  It is going to 
help in the prosecution of crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had Liberals who spoke to this group of motions and their 
words were often encouraging when they said why destroy samples 
when technology progresses day by day or week by week. I pointed 
that out as well, so good on them for recognizing something that 
has true value.  They spoke to the costs and the administration 
of resampling these things.  We would not want to burden 
taxpayers with more cost and more administration.  It just does 
not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my Liberal colleagues across the way who wanted to cut down 
on the administrative costs of resampling, good on them.  I only 
wish they kept these things in mind on more issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another Reform colleague spoke to the whole idea of indexing. 
Trying to get rid of the index is working against the very 
purposes of the bill and the underlying justice we are trying to 
achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that I leave it to other members in the House and say that 
in no way can we support some of these amendments, namely Motions 
Nos. 2, 4 and 13.  We have to stand against them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I too am pleased to speak at report stage of Bill C-3, an act 
respecting DNA identification, and Motions 4, 6 and 13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated during my earlier remarks, we do support the 
principle of this bill but think it is too filled with 
exceptions, loopholes and red tape to provide our peace officers 
with the kind of latitude they need to make this important public 
safety legislation actually work for victims and potential 
victims.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our first and final consideration should be to give our police 
officers, our prosecutors, our courts and our entire justice 
system the kind of evidence they need to convict people guilty of 
serious crimes and to ensure that they do not get around 
conviction because of legislative loopholes which allow the 
destruction of important DNA evidence or prevent its collection 
in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make specific reference to Motion No. 4 proposed 
by one of my hon. colleagues from the third party.  It would 
amend clause 9: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) by replacing lines 21 and 23 with the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“the convicted offenders index shall be destroyed without delay 
after” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) by adding after line 34 on page 6 the following: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“(3) Subsections (1) and (2) also apply to information 
communicated under this Act that is in the possession of any 
Canadian laboratory or federal or provincial law enforcement 
agency”. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears to us that this amendment would eliminate the entire 
index.  It would be destroyed.  Perhaps this is a problem in the 
English translation.  We cannot understand why our colleagues in 
the third party, or any other party, would be in favour of such a 
sweeping amendment that would undermine one of the central 
purposes of the act, which is to develop an index that can be 
used for future reference after convictions have been established 
against criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current legislation makes provision for the destruction of 
certain parts of the evidence.  It narrowly defines which 
elements of the index can be destroyed.  Motion No. 4 makes no 
such distinction.  Instead it opens the door to the wholesale 
destruction of the convicted offenders index.  This is something 
we cannot support.  It occurs to us that this motion, as the bill 
on a whole, tends to place too great an emphasis on the rights of 
the criminals as opposed to the rights of the victims, a tendency 
we see all too often in criminal justice legislation of this 
nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I move to Motion No. 6 in Group No. 2.  The motion was made by 
one of our colleagues in the third party.  It would amend clause 
10 after line 34 to read: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“(7.1) The commission shall destroy the stored bodily substances 
of a person without delay after a forensic DNA analysis of these 
substances is first performed under this section”. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For forensic science purposes it is important that substances be 
kept as new testing techniques are developed.  We cannot project 
what kind of advancements forensic science will make in the years 
to come.  Fifteen, twenty or thirty years ago legislatures in 
this place could not reasonably expect to have ever had the kind 
of sophisticated DNA testing science that is now available to us, 
our police officers and our prosecutors.  Let us not hamstring 
future courts, future prosecutors, future police officers and 
investigators from using new technology as it becomes available. 
Let us keep this evidence on file.  Let us keep it in the index. 
Let us not destroy it unnecessarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand what leads to these kinds of amendments. Why 
should the objective of this legislation not be to build up as 
comprehensive an index of DNA evidence as we possibly can while 
at the same time respecting the privacy rights of individuals who 
are not convicted? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not fill the legislation with all sorts of loopholes and 
measures like this one.  Evidence could be destroyed given this 
amendment which could later be necessary to use in the conviction 
of a violent offender.  We cannot take such a risk. 
One piece of evidence in this databank could be enough to save 
future potential victims from violent offenders.  We should err 
on the side of a comprehensive databank which does not destroy 
evidence for no particularly good reason.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move on to the third and final motion in the Group No. 2 
amendments to Bill C-3, Motion No. 13 as proposed by the same 
hon. member from the third party.  We find this motion difficult 
to understand.  I am not sure the hon. member understands it. 
Perhaps he could enlighten us further.  Apparently it would seek 
to amend paragraph 487.091(b) of the act and replace it with the 
following: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“(b) the person is finally acquitted of the designated offence 
and any other offence in respect of the same transaction; or” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not see the purpose of this amendment.  It seems to be a 
dilatory and frivolous amendment with no useful purpose.  It does 
not strengthen the bill in terms of its ambit or coverage or the 
size or extent of the DNA databank.  We see no reason to support 
this amendment and will be opposing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I want to summarize the importance of not turning the 
legislation into Swiss cheese for criminal defence attorneys to 
allow their clients to get through the loopholes and to tie up 
the courts, our police officers and prosecutors in legal red tape 
designed by and for people who are more concerned about the 
rights of criminals than they are about the rights of victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We oppose all three of these amendments and will continue to 
call on our colleagues in all parties to support the kinds of 
amendments which would make the legislation meaningful in terms 
of providing a comprehensive collection of a DNA databank of 
convicted criminals.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to talk to report stage of Bill 
C-3, an act respecting DNA identification, and to make 
consequential amendments to the Criminal Code and other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now looking at Group No. 2 which includes Motions Nos. 4, 
6 and 13.  As my colleague has just said we oppose all three of 
these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment indicates that the entire convicted offenders 
index will be destroyed.  We support the bill in its intent, but 
changes need to be made to make sure it is an effective bill that 
will work for the police forces and the people of Canada, which 
is the most important point.  When fingerprints are taken they 
are never destroyed.  When blood type is taken upon birth it is 
never destroyed.  Why anybody would want to do anything that 
would destroy an index of DNA is beyond me and the people in my 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 6 also put forward by the Bloc would destroy the 
bodily substances.  It is very important, especially with the new 
science of today, that we do not destroy anything in our 
possession.  There have been too many examples in the last few 
years of people who have been convicted on DNA evidence.  Crimes 
have been solved after people have spent years in jail because 
with the new technology that has come along we have managed to 
prove who really committed the crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a case before the courts now where a gentleman spent a 
lot of his life in jail.  Now somebody who was suspected at the 
time is now to be charged with the crime, will have to face the 
courts and the people, and will probably be convicted of a crime 
that he committed many years ago.  If we had had the DNA evidence 
and material, the innocent person would never have gone to jail 
and the guilty person would have been convicted a long time ago. 
Certainly we have to make sure we maintain the substances taken 
from people. 
We obviously oppose Motion No. 13 which is part of this section.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the motions put forward in this section, I see 
that the government received some legal opinions from three 
former judges.  We do not quite know how it hand-picked the 
judges.  As we all know, when we are dealing with lawyers we can 
get an opinion from anyone we want.  It depends on how much we 
want to pay for it and whom we want to go to.  I would like to 
know who they were, as all three of these judges were unanimous 
in their decision in this case as to what can and cannot be done 
according to the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quoted Mr. Taylor, QC, in a previous talk earlier today on 
some other motions and I would like to quote his conclusion.  He 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It follows that I am of the opinion that legislative extension of 
police authority authority under Bill C-3 to sanction the taking 
of DNA samples without judicial warrant in the case of persons 
charged or arrested but not tried and convicted would be held 
contrary to the guarantees contained in one or more of ss. 7, 8 
and 11(d) of the Charter, would not be saved by s. 1 of the 
Charter, and would therefore be found unconstitutional and of no 
force or effect under s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reference in the last line was to the Constitution Act, 
1982.  It gave the judges a lot more power than I believe they 
ever should have.  I believe the Parliament of Canada should make 
the laws instead of the judges in the Supreme Court of Canada and 
the other courts in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find interesting about the statements that the former 
judge makes in this report to the government and some of the 
motions that are before the House is that right now blood samples 
are taken.  Before I go into that I would like to read another 
conclusion by a former judge and then I can tie it together with 
the three motions we are talking about here.  They make some very 
interesting points.   Mr. Bisson, in his conclusion, says “I 
would conclude as follows:  an enactment authorizing upon a 
person—” 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I do not believe we have quorum right now.  I would like 
a quorum call. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  We will verify that 
right away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the bells having rung:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I believe we now have 
a quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  It is now nice that we have a few 
Liberals in the House, including the hundreds of thousands who 
are listening out their in the audience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was quoting Judge Bisson and his conclusions.  He said that 
therefore, the guaranteed rights of a person by the charter 
having been infringed, the legislation would have been 
invalidated because section 1 of the charter could not save such 
legislation, the prerequisites having not been met. There was no 
equation to be made between the confirmed validity of the taking 
of fingerprints upon arrest and the taking also upon arrest 
without judicial authorization of bodily samples.  Fingerprinting 
was not a search and seizure but the taking of bodily samples was 
and as such should not be performed without the greatest 
safeguards, the first of them being judicial intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where I totally disagree with these judges.  They are 
taking a position that there is a difference here.  When people 
are arrested the police take fingerprints.  Their fingers are 
placed on a piece of dirty stuff and then pressed on a piece of 
paper.  They are kept on record and stay there whether or not 
they are convicted.  From then on, if they are ever arrested in 
the future, the fingerprints will be on file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about this being an intrusion.  They can take a DNA 
sample by a simple Q-tip on a person's tongue.  They do not have 
to stick a needle in and draw blood.  There are lots of ways to 
do DNA samples.  What intrusion is that in anybody's system? 
When people are arrested they should be happy to have that done 
because they will be part of the system from now on and if they 
ever do it again we will easily catch them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For people to be fighting this, I just do not understand.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is great to bring in this legislation, but let us make sure 
it is going to work.  There are literally thousands of unsolved 
rape and murder cases in this country.  With the DNA samples of 
people in prisons right now we can solve some of those crimes 
immediately.  The police know that, the people of Canada know 
that, so why do we have legislation that protects these criminals 
instead of bringing peace of mind to parents who have lost their 
children?  People have lost family members and we have unsolved 
crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to the case I was talking about before.  That man is 
going to go on trial for murder while an innocent person has 
already served time in jail.  This man will be proven guilty by 
DNA.  If we had his DNA 15 years ago we would not have had this 
miscarriage of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure we will have a chance to talk about this over and over 
again before the bill is passed.  It is extremely important that 
the government look at this bill and accept some of the 
amendments being put forth by the opposition.  I know from 
talking to some members on the other side that the same feeling 
comes from them.  We are going to keep talking about this bill 
until we get some proper changes before the legislation is passed 
in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise again today to take part in the 
debate at report stage of Bill C-3.  The Group No. 2 amendments 
deal with the disposition of DNA evidence which I will talk 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I will tell a little story.  A couple of years ago my 
constituency office was broken into at night.  No one was there 
and no one was hurt.  The next morning the police came and 
discovered that the television set was all that was missing.  It 
is too bad because it was a new television set.  The police 
dusted the place for fingerprints.  They talked to us for a while 
and then went away.  That evening a police officer came to my 
home with my television set in his arms.  I asked him how he got 
it back so quickly.  He replied that there had been a fresh 
snowfall the night before.  They simply followed the footprints 
of the fellow to a vacant garage where he had put the television 
set, waited for him to return and they picked him up.  I tell this 
story a bit facetiously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act states that DNA profiles are uniquely private and 
personal information that may be used only for purposes of 
identification.  It strikes me that that is basically what 
fingerprints are about.  I am really glad that fingerprints are 
already included in the legislation.  I would hate to think what 
would happen if we tried to legislate and categorize footprints 
in the snow.  I can see the problems that would exist for some of 
our Liberal colleagues.  It might be discrimination against a 
person on the basis of his weight because the impression was deep 
in the snow.  It may have been a man, a woman or a crippled 
person and we could tell by the way they walked.  We would be 
discriminating against these people by using such evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that in looking at the DNA issue we are looking at 
a means of identifying someone who has done something really bad. 
We need to know who that person is and call that person quite 
appropriately to account for what they have done.  The only reason 
the DNA evidence is needed is for identification.  It should be 
kept on file until that purpose is accomplished.  The only reason 
is for identification.  It is not to talk about the genetic type 
of the person or to talk about latent genetic defects that may 
exist in future generations, it is only for identification.  All 
of these other issues are protected.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important issue for Reform members.  In fact in the 
last parliament an almost identical bill, Bill C-94, was 
introduced toward the end of the second session.  Even though the 
bill was seriously flawed, our party was willing to walk with the 
government, to fast track it through parliament.  We felt that 
this DNA tool was just too important for our law enforcement 
agencies to be without. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments in Group No. 2, all proposed by the Bloc member 
for Charlesbourg, relate to the destruction of DNA evidence.  Why 
would it be important to destroy DNA evidence that has been 
appropriately collected? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about Motion No. 6 which states:  “The 
Commission shall destroy the stored bodily substances of a person 
without delay after a forensic DNA analysis of these substances 
is first performed under this section”.  Why would we destroy 
this evidence without delay? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern that comes to mind when looking at this motion may 
be cost.  We are aware of the concern over the cost of 
establishing and maintaining this databank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this amendment could actually increase the costs of the 
databank, not only the costs involved in the destruction of the 
evidence, but the costs of re-establishing the evidence, 
regaining the evidence or seeking the evidence from someone who 
is no longer around.  What happens then? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we are well aware, technology is expanding at a tremendous 
rate.  As technology develops, tests and analysis change and 
improve.  Although the DNA analysis is far more accurate than 
other technologies we have seen to date, in a couple of years 
this analysis may prove dramatically better than it is today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some sense, then, it seems like a waste of time and money to 
destroy evidence now which may be required at a later date for 
re-analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I think of the premature destruction of DNA materials I am 
concerned about the possible inaccuracies, the mistakes that 
could be made by a technician in analyzing the DNA evidence at 
hand.  If the evidence is misanalyzed and then immediately 
destroyed, how do we recover the loss?  I alluded to this 
earlier.  This is still a relatively new technology.  The tests 
and the analysis are not totally foolproof yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens if a technician who runs the initial tests did 
something wrong and, as a result, the analysis is off?  What 
happens if the person whose sample is falsely analyzed is not in 
custody, is not available, cannot be found and the law 
enforcement agencies cannot obtain another sample? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is much more cost effective and safer to keep these 
DNA substances in storage for a specified period of time rather 
than to prematurely destroy this valuable evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises the question of why we destroy evidence that is 
legally, properly, appropriately gathered and is stored and 
maintained only for the purposes of identification.  Why can this 
not be kept on record simply as fingerprints are today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand why there would need to be a move to destroy 
this evidence.  It seems to me that it would be of benefit in two 
ways.  First, if someone has committed a crime the evidence is 
there on file and can be used for identification purposes at a 
later date if that person reoffends.  Second, if someone is 
apprehended this evidence could well turn out to be what is 
required to free an innocent person.  The issue cuts both ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only the apprehension of those who are guilty who we 
are concerned about, but the correct application of justice so 
that those who do not offend and who are apprehended and 
mistakenly charged may be cleared and the charges dropped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people may then go about having normal lives with their 
families without further disruption and harm.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the concerns that I have.  I hope to be able to speak 
to the other groups as they come up.  I find this issue one that 
is interesting.  It is extremely important for the maintenance of 
justice.  We have seen time and again how people who have been 
incorrectly convicted and sent away to jail for long periods of 
time have had their names cleared with the proper use of DNA 
evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot forget this.  It is too important.  It is a valuable 
tool.  We must use it as vigorously as necessary within properly 
prescribed limits and we must quit the nonsense of how we can 
avoid using it when it is needed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have a few brief comments to make.  I raised some 
questions this morning in the debate which have not yet been 
answered by the government.  I feel it is incumbent upon the 
government before we move on to answer these concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that concerns me with regard to Bill C-3 and the 
privacy issue that the government has raised is simply this.  We 
have raised a lot of concerns about Bill C-68, which is a bill 
that the Liberals passed in the last parliament.  They infringed 
on citizens' rights with regard to privacy and so on.  Now, in 
relation to this bill, they are raising the privacy issue for 
criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it was law-abiding citizens they were not concerned with 
privacy.  Now that we are dealing with people who have been 
charged with major offences they say we have a privacy concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can put in place legislation to protect the misuse of 
information that people would gather in this process, but for the 
government to be more concerned about privacy when it involves a 
criminal than when it involves a law-abiding gun owner I think is 
a real contradiction and something that should concern Canadians 
a great deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is incumbent upon the government to explain to us why 
it cannot put safeguards in the bill so that the information that 
is gathered by the police is safeguarded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will review what this DNA databank would be.  They would 
gather information, a hair sample, a saliva sample, a small 
amount of cells from the human body of the person who has been 
charged with a serious crime.  They could use that to either 
prove the innocence or the guilt of the person.  Because of 
technology these days we can look at these things and examine 
them closely.  The molecules that are involved in this and the 
science behind it I will leave for another discussion, but the 
explanation is that the science is now available to use this to 
convict people or to declare them innocent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should use these new tools.  The police are asking for them. 
We should put them in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was reading the history of this.  When fingerprinting was 
first brought in people raised all of these same concerns about 
privacy and about whether we should use this kind of thing. 
Nobody would question the use of fingerprints now.  They have 
become a tool that we accept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just because it is new, using a DNA print from a person should 
not just be dismissed by this government.  There are some very 
good things that can be done.  The police have the ability now to 
use this.  It would help a lot of people possibly in prison who 
say they are innocent to prove their innocence.  It has been used 
already.  But it will also help the police to solve a lot of 
crimes.  They are saying it would and I think we should seriously 
listen to them. 
The government has put too many restrictions on that with what it 
has done and some of the amendments in this group and others 
address those. I think we should look at them closely.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will now proceed to debate on Motion No. 7 in Group 
No. 3. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK240">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 7 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-3, in Clause 11, be amended by replacing line 6 on 
page 9 with the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“exceeding five years; or” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Madam Speaker, I am the only member with a motion in 
Group No. 3, so I suppose that makes it somewhat exclusive on my 
part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make some general comments first.  Some members 
of the Reform Party have commented on the importance of ensuring 
that police have an investigative tool. The NDP supports this 
wholeheartedly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average police officer on the street today needs every bit 
of assistance he or she can have to investigate the commission of 
a crime and do their job properly.  The NDP certainly supports 
them in the work they do and we hope this bill with its flaws 
will provide police officers with some of the investigate tools 
they require to properly bring to justice those who have 
committed crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make the distinction between the accused and the criminals 
purposely because a couple of my colleagues in this House, the 
hon. members for Calgary and Calgary West, said at different 
times when speaking about the NDP that we wanted to put the 
rights of the criminals ahead of the rights of the victims. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to ensure that the rights of the accused are balanced in 
the justice system.  Certain members forget that one is not a 
criminal when one is accused.  Certain members forget that anyone 
in this House, including the members who have used the 
terminology, can be accused of the most heinous crimes.  They are 
not criminals at that point and indeed the reason we have 
safeguards in the system is that many people over the years have 
been wrongly convicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a responsible and just parliament and as a society that takes 
its responsibilities seriously, we ensure there is a balance, 
that police have the necessary investigative tools to do their 
job and the courts have the proper rules to ensure innocent 
people go free and criminals are punished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I move to my motion which increases the penalty for someone who 
violates the law.  The current legislation provided by the 
government states in section 11: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every person who contravenes subsection 6(6) or (7), section 8 or 
subsection 10(3) or (5) 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to 
imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years; or 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction and 
liable to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a 
term not exceeding six months, or to both. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we recognize how important DNA information is and how 
private it has to be, the act provides that no person who 
receives a DNA profile for entry into the databank shall use it 
or allow it to be used other than for the purposes set out in the 
administration of this act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone working in the laboratory who receives the DNA 
analysis must keep that information confidential and can use 
it only in the way parliament deems it should be used. Subsection 
(7) goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(7) No person shall, except in accordance with this section, 
communicate or allow to be communicated a DNA profile that is 
contained in the DNA data bank or information that is referred to 
in subsection (1).

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying in a capsule form is that the act makes it a 
crime to communicate improperly any information on any person's 
DNA.  The maximum penalty for committing that crime is two years 
imprisonment.  My motion says we should increase that penalty to 
a maximum of five years.  We still have a minimum penalty that 
can be imposed.  The courts have some discretion in determining 
how much of a penalty could be imposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I suggest we do that is that, once again, the taking 
of the DNA and the index has to be kept regulated government and 
properly administered by the government.  Anyone who breaches 
that should be considered breaking the law of this House and 
should pay a serious penalty.  This would bring home to 
individuals how important it is to keep that privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a scandalous age in some ways.  We have people 
selling love letters of the Princess of Wales for millions of 
dollars.  We know that a taped interview of someone speaking to a 
political person can fetch thousands of dollars on the open 
market from the tabloids.  We have to recognize that this most 
personal information, be it mine, be it anyone's watching the 
House debate tonight, be it anyone's on the government side or 
the opposition side, is so personal and so private that any 
attempt to communicate it other than provided by law ought to be 
punishable with a severe sentence.  By increasing the sentence we 
would be sending out that message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an important issue of law and order.  Let me be very 
clear.  The New Democratic Party is concerned about the safety of 
people in the communities of this country, those who are 
concerned about crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have a concern about misinformation that gets sent out 
to people.  It was said in debate tonight that we know, we can 
take as a fact, that someone in our families will at some point 
be assaulted or be the victim of crime.  That statement was said 
willy-nilly without a single statistic to back it up.  Many 
people sitting in their living rooms watching this debate because 
we are parliamentarians accept with some respect what we say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  They do not believe a word we say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  It is our obligation to rise above 
that cynicism and give an honest debate on the issues before this 
House.  Statements made without facts to back them up, statements 
made to inflame debate, do little to convince those people that 
we are seriously considering the needs and the laws that have to 
be in place for all the people of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We take the recommendation of the Canadian Police Association 
seriously.  We take the recommendation of the privacy 
commissioner, who is at the other end of the spectrum, seriously. 
We take the recommendations of the Canadian Bar Association 
seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians it is our job to weigh each of those 
arguments, to balance them in the needs and interests of 
Canadians, after a thorough, informed, intellectual exercise.  We 
have to be very careful when we stand up and say that the rights 
of criminals take precedence over the rights of victims when we 
are talking about accused persons.  This country was founded on 
the rule of law.  The rule of law has one tenant, that you are 
innocent until proven guilty.  That is the purpose of this 
legislation, to allow the police the tools to help in determining 
whether someone is guilty.  Once that determination is made then 
the rights of the criminal ought not to exceed those of the 
victim. I make those points for the people listening tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the House and I ask for support for my motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise after my colleague in the New Democratic Party 
and tell him that he is not alone.  His motion may be the only 
one in Group No. 3, but he will not be the only one supporting 
it, far from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must first say that, after asking parliamentarians to support 
a number of motions I introduced earlier, in order to emphasize 
the importance that the House and the government must attach to 
privacy, I was disappointed that these motions did not receive 
all the support I had hoped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 7, however, introduced by my colleague, the member 
for Sydney—Victoria, addresses the same principle, but from 
another angle that will perhaps appeal more naturally to some of 
the members sitting to the right of me, and perhaps even further 
right than that politically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls for increasing from two to seven years the 
maximum sentence for individuals contravening certain provisions 
of the bill designed to try to keep information collected as 
secret as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois attach considerable importance to the 
protection of privacy.  When it comes to anything to do with 
information, the Bloc Quebecois takes an extremely hard line. 
We were, for example, in favour of stiffer penalties for the 
destruction of information that should be accessible under 
access legislation. 
We want the greatest possible transparency, but we do not want 
this transparency to enable some individuals to obtain 
information to which they have absolutely no right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to remember that DNA reveals to us an 
individual's deepest secrets, his or her hair colour, and 
certain physical characteristics.  For all we know, a few years 
from now, technology may make it possible to discover someone's 
personality.  This is a very powerful tool, and it is essential 
that people be discouraged from using DNA data for purposes 
other than those set out in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore with pleasure that I support the motion 
introduced by my colleague, the member for Sydney—Victoria. 
I hope that other members to my right and across the way will do 
the same, in order to underscore the fundamental importance of 
the protection of privacy in this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to partake in this debate and pleased 
particularly to follow my hon. friends and colleagues in the NDP 
and the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do note with some amusement that what we have here in the 
motion is a defence lawyer asking for more time in a sentence.  I 
think that is telling and I think it is indicative of the intent 
of this motion, to emphasize the importance of protection of 
privacy here and to put a greater degree of flexibility before 
the courts to allow a judge to impose a sentence of up to five 
years when an individual chooses to breach this important piece 
of legislation by potentially misusing DNA evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is something that we in the House and hopefully the 
government will take very seriously and perhaps embrace the 
suggestion brought forward by the hon. member for 
Sydney—Victoria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The flexibility, the discretion it would allow is certainly very 
important.  It is also going to be safeguarded, as the hon. 
member for Sydney—Victoria indicated, in the sense that a judge 
still has discretion.  There is still the fallback position that 
there is the summary offence by which the crown can proceed, that 
coupled with the fact that the crown and the defence will always 
have input into the sentencing process. 
The judge will then be called upon to apply the sentencing 
principles, to ensure fairness, to ensure that it is a measured 
response and not a cookie cutter response, a phrase that my hon. 
colleague from Nova Scotia will have also heard in courtrooms.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is there.  It is implicit in the particular system we have 
that there is not going to be a disproportionate response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's motion in essence broadens the ability of 
judges to look at the factual scenario before them if it involves 
a breach of this privacy, a breach or misuse of DNA evidence.  I 
therefore concur with his remarks.  I believe it is an important 
motion he is bringing to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It emphasizes and provides a more serious note and response to a 
criminal activity that would involve the criminal misuse of DNA 
evidence.  It is important that we look at this and consider it 
very seriously because in bringing forward the bill we are arming 
the government and police with a very important tool to respond 
to a very important and widespread problem in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we on this side of the House are encouraging the 
government to go all the way.  I think this is going to be the 
emerging rallying cry about this particular piece of legislation, 
all the way with DNA.  Let us use this to the full extent.  Let 
us for once be on the cutting edge of the justice system.  Let us 
move forward, not with tentative steps.  With no disrespect 
whatsoever to the supreme court, let us not clutter our minds too 
much with what the supreme court will do with this piece of 
legislation. Let us move forward in an informed way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had extensive hearings on this particular bill. Numerous 
witnesses have given input before the committee. Members of the 
policing community, members of the victims advocates groups, 
members of the science community who are going to be called upon 
to implement this bill, all of them are encouraging us to make 
the most of this opportunity we have at this time. This is the 
time for parliament to act, to do something in a positive way 
that is going to help the law enforcement community and 
significantly help satisfy those victims who feel that the 
justice system is failing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put a point on this, we have an opportunity to reflect the 
serious reprisals when this legislation is breached.  If a person 
chooses to misuse this, the hon. member's suggestion is that we 
should raise the ceiling to five years for an indictable offence 
involving the misuse of DNA technology. That sends a very clear, 
unequivocal message to those who would be so inclined to partake 
in that criminal activity.  It ups the ante on the importance of 
ensuring that there is deterrence, that there is a significant 
response from the government and from the justice system when 
this legislation is breached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ensure that the police and Canadians at large know 
they have the support of parliament and know that parliament is 
working to protect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party, we support this 
particular amendment.  We support it as an important step in 
building a piece of legislation that is workable and that is 
taken very seriously by Canadians.  It allows the police to get 
on with the very important task they are charged with, to 
implement and to use this tool in a significant way in their 
daily fight against crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those remarks, I congratulate the hon. member for 
Sydney—Victoria, my colleague from Nova Scotia.  He brings 
forward a very important amendment. I urge all members of this 
House at the time of the vote to take it very seriously, turn 
their minds to this suggestion and to support it. That is what 
should happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I too 
urge and recommend support for this motion. I put forward a 
recommendation in committee that we strike the summary conviction 
portion of this section and leave it at a two year indictable 
maximum penalty.  Of course that was struck down but we will see 
what happens when we come to the vote on this increasing of the 
penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we doing here?  We are safeguarding privacy, yet we are 
expressing a fear and an apprehension that is inconsistent in 
many ways.  When I give my doctor a blood sample, he can do 
whatever he wants with it.  I can volunteer a blood sample to a 
police officer and he can put my sample into the DNA bank 
together with the profile.  According to the bill, if he misuses 
it, he can be charged and sentenced to jail for a maximum of five 
years, but not my doctor.  He can use my blood sample in any way 
he wants.  He will not face a charge let alone a five year jail 
sentence.  There is an inconsistency in what we are doing, yet we 
are doing it.  Why are we doing it?  Because of the apprehension. 
By way of examination that apprehension is mythical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We looked at all of the privacy concerns and the misuse of the 
profile and the samples.  I saw no basis for the concern.  Yet we 
have this here.  This kind of apprehension is real.  We saw it in 
the justice officials who appeared before our committee.  They 
were so apprehensive of what the supreme court could do if we 
went all the way with DNA and allowed the taking of samples at 
the time of arrest or at least at the time of being charged for 
one of the primary designated offences.  There is an enormous 
apprehension so I suppose the House will recognize that 
apprehension whether it has a basis or not and we will proceed 
cautiously in the shadow of the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are saying if anyone dares to do what anyone else 
in charge of databanks, blood banks or whatever can do with 
immunity, we are going to sentence them to a possible maximum 
penalty of five years.  The underlying motivation for it is that 
apprehension which we recognize as members of parliament, and we 
have to.  Yet at the same time the law enforcement agencies tell 
us what they need to solve the unsolved crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will touch on something mentioned by my NDP colleague about 
the rights of the accused, and he is right.   This bill deals 
with more than just the accused.  It also deals with those who 
have been convicted of one of the designated offences and who is 
in custody as a result. It will allow for the taking of DNA 
samples from some of those individuals.  It goes beyond just the 
recognition of the rights of the accused to defend themselves and 
to not self incriminate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we examine what this bill will do, there is no 
justification for our not going all the way.  The reason is that 
if we examine even what the three former judges have said, we 
already have the means and the right to take a blood sample if a 
police officer believes a person is impaired by way of alcohol or 
drugs while operating a motor vehicle or a vessel.  I think it is 
under section 254.  We have that authority now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I rushed through the three constitutional legal opinions on 
this bill, I found only one to be a realistic examination of the 
inconsistencies that arise.  What did Mr. Taylor say about it? 
He said that it was allowed because it was an offence in progress 
and that the evidence can dissipate from the system of the 
individual over a period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, I think it is a very weak argument to suggest that 
to take a blood sample from that individual under those 
conditions is constitutional but that it is not constitutional to 
take a sample from someone who is under arrest and charged with a 
designated offence, whether it is murder, rape, manslaughter, 
aggravated assault or one of the other designated offences.  I 
see an enormous inconsistency which is based on apprehension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real testimony we should be adhering to and listening to is 
the testimony that comes from the forensic scientists themselves. 
They know whether or not there is a privacy danger.  They know 
whether or not there is a possibility of misuse and whether we 
should guard against that.  They know all of these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we listened to the witnesses who appeared before the 
committee, with the greatest respect to them, we were hearing an 
apprehension and in most cases a baseless apprehension.  We will 
guard this right of the police to take samples.  We will set up 
hoops for them to jump through. I predict at the end of the day 
we will deny them the right to take a sample from an individual 
under charge who has a previous conviction for a designated 
offence. Perhaps I am speaking ahead of my time but that motion 
is coming up and we will see how members vote on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply say that the apprehension contained within this motion 
where we are going to make it a possible five year jail term for 
someone who improperly uses a DNA sample is enacted within this 
legislation.  Other databanks do not have that kind of 
legislation governing the use or misuse of the samples that are 
taken from babies and individuals every day and which are 
certainly lodged with their names attached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the motion.  I understand the reason for it very 
clearly.  It is simply an expression of the apprehension that 
surrounds this whole area.  Apprehension of what?  It is the 
apprehension of the Supreme Court of Canada. Individuals on that 
court will examine this from their viewpoint and say either yes 
or no, that we have gone too far or that it is okay. So far they 
say it is okay.  We can take samples now under certain 
conditions.  All they are really saying is that we can take 
samples not by statutory authority but by judicial authority.  We 
need judicial authority.  A judge must issue a warrant in order 
to take a sample under bill 104. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that statutory authority is not sufficient.  Reasonable 
and probable grounds to believe someone has committed a 
designated offence is not enough.  Even charging them and having 
them appear before a judicial official and swearing out an 
information based upon reasonable and probable grounds is 
insufficient. Judicial authority is needed through the issuance 
of a warrant.  That is the way it seems to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we need to move in this slow and cautious way and open 
it up as years go on until we see that the apprehension and fear 
is simply a myth and does not really exist.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to 
point out that many witnesses were heard.  Also, as has been 
pointed out, we heard a lot of testimony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may have missed one of the meetings.  Unless I stand to be 
corrected, I do not recall any of those witnesses asking to 
increase the penalty for the misuse of any information from two 
to five years.  As I said, we heard a lot on privacy issue 
concerns that were generally raised, but not once did I hear any 
testimony from any witness asking what this motion calls for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government we have been very concerned about any potential 
misuse.  That is why from the onset we entrusted the 
administration, the establishment and the co-ordination of the 
DNA databank with one of the world's most respected police 
agencies, the RCMP through its commissioner.  They will be 
entrusted with the administration and the set up of the databank. 
We have tried to find the proper balance between making sure that 
there would be no potential misuse of any information provided 
and to show Canadians that we are serious about DNA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been pointed out, the profile can disclose much more than 
a fingerprint.  As the member for Sydney—Victoria pointed out 
during committee hearings, we have a tendency to compare DNA 
profiles with fingerprinting.  As he so aptly put it, a 
fingerprint is an impression of me whereas DNA is a part of me. 
There is a substantial fundamental difference between the two yet 
we often confuse the two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to caution hon. members.  This amendment refers to 
subsections 6(6) and (7).  These subsections refer to the misuse 
or disclosure of the contents of a profile.  We are not talking 
about the identification of the individual to whom the profile 
may belong.  It is similar for samples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that if it is misused it is a very serious 
offence.  We have tried to strike a balance.  We did not consult 
the supreme court on everything as the critic from the Reform 
Party might lead us to believe.  We simply said that there here 
is a crime.  Here is the message we want to get across to 
Canadians, that it is serious to misuse any of this information. 
We simply tried to be consistent with similar offences that are 
established already in the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that if the government were to extend the penalty 
from two years to five years it would be inconsistent with 
similar offences in the criminal code and very excessive.  To 
that end I ask that the hon. members vote against it for those 
reasons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it was interesting to hear the hon. parliamentary 
secretary make the comment that no committee witness had 
advocated this kind of penalty.  I would ask him to note that 
while it may not have happened in committee there have been at 
least four witnesses in the House of Commons who are advocating 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the member not to base his judgments on the 
legislation simply on the committee and on the witnesses.  I 
encourage him to remember that the members of the House come here 
with a point of view that represents many other people as well as 
their own.  We represent positions to the House and to the 
government so that they may be aware that in this instance people 
are very concerned about the inadequacy of the justice system in 
apprehending serious violent offenders who are doing great harm 
and great damage to individuals, to our communities and to the 
structure of our communities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the issue of the DNA testing is a very 
serious one.  The parliamentary secretary is quite correct when 
he says that these profiles provide an enormous amount of very 
personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important that everyone realizes that within the 
legislation it is necessary that this information be used only 
for what it was intended, that is for the identification of 
people who have been apprehended and to help in the determination 
of their innocence or guilt by the evidence provided there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some interesting paradoxes in the government's point 
of view.  As I consider this issue I see how important privacy 
is.  I would not want to diminish that importance in any way. I 
could also point out other instances where the importance of 
privacy is not nearly so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I received a letter from a constituent who is a 
financial counsellor. He is concerned about information he has 
received from StatsCan. Now StatsCan is promoting a purchase of 
information from individual tax returns, about the financial 
situation of communities, districts and right down to the 
individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all based upon postal code.  How could a profile be 
developed from a postal code?  In one instance a postal code 
might be a large apartment building.  It would not be too 
difficult to determine to which individuals, from the profile 
that StatsCan provides, it would apply in a very personal way. As 
members are aware, the information that comes out of a person's 
income tax return is pretty personal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell of another instance of a profile based upon a 
postal code.  When my family and I lived in Calgary we had a 
house on a corner of a block in that city where we had an 
individual postal code for that house in that city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not realize at the time that by postal code profiles 
StatsCan could open my income tax return to financial 
institutions, financial advisers and anyone who cared to pay them 
money for the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that there are some instances where personal privacy 
is very important to the government.  In other instances it is 
not nearly so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that Motion No. 7 is drawing attention to the 
importance of the private nature of this information.  If it must 
be used for a specific purpose only and beyond that there is a 
heavy penalty, it draws attention to the importance of this 
personal information.  It must be used in an appropriate way. If 
it is not used in an appropriate way then there are serious 
consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for Sydney—Victoria for presenting 
the motion.  I think it is timely.  I think it draws attention to 
a very important aspect of the bill.  I notice my colleague from 
the Conservative Party mentioned that he is a defence attorney. 
Now that we have had both the prosecution and the defence speak 
on this issue, as well as a number of lay people like myself, we 
have our bases covered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strengthening this section to make it a more serious offence by 
increasing the maximum sentence for indictable offences may serve 
as more of a deterrent for those who may entertain some thoughts 
of misusing this information.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I just want to respond for a moment to the comments that 
were made by the government representative across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that “a fingerprint identifies me but DNA is a part of 
me”.  If that is the argument then in fact he should support 
this amendment.  At the present time if this DNA data is being 
used for purposes anything beyond what a fingerprint is used for, 
we are saying there should be a punishment for that.  That 
punishment should fit the crime.  I applaud the NDP 
representative who brought forth the amendment. I am glad to see 
they did it.  If in fact what he said is a valid argument then he 
should be supporting the amendment.  He said that “DNA is a part 
of me”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give a little science lesson here.  When you leave a 
fingerprint behind the technology is going to be there in the 
next year or so to take from that fingerprint the same 
information that you could get if you took a hair or a saliva 
sample from someone.  We need to have appropriate punishments in 
place if someone uses that. The government should be supporting 
this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have the technology soon to do all kinds of things and 
we should be protecting the public from misuse of this 
information.  The DNA data should be used in the same way as a 
fingerprint is used to identify the person; no more, no less.  We 
would support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with what the NDP has done here. It is interesting and 
it is almost historic that the NDP recognizes the severity of a 
penalty does send a signal to society on the severity of a crime. 
I think we need to do that.  If people can devise some kind of 
method in the future to misuse the DNA samples and invade 
people's privacy, we should be looking forward and making sure 
there are appropriate punishments in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we do not see the big picture, but the question that is 
before us in regard to this amendment is should or does the 
length of a sentence send a signal to the public as to the 
seriousness of a crime.  That is what we are debating and that is 
why the government should support this.  There is the potential 
to commit some serious crimes with the misuse of these data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public also has a concern that the courts are not using the 
provisions of the law to send a signal to society on the severity 
of some of the crimes.  I may be off on a little tangent here but 
in my riding we had some very serious crimes committed, murder in 
fact, and the courts dealt very lightly with them.  Some of the 
penalties were less than eight years.  One penalty was four 
years.  They were out in less than two years on parole.  That 
sends the wrong signal to society.  It is abundantly clear that 
we need to send the kind of a signal that this can be very 
serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I want to talk a little bit about the 
contradictions that this government is making by not supporting 
an increase in the penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government put in place legislation that if you make a 
mistake on the gun registration certificate, the little 
piece of paper you fill out when you are supposed to register your gun in 
a few years, you could get up to 10 years in prison for making a 
mistake on that.  Here you could do something much more 
serious, misuse DNA data, and you only get two years.  I find 
that ironic.  If find it unbelievable that this government would 
do something like that.  It is a real contradiction and that is 
why the government should change its mind and support the 
amendment that the NDP MP has put forward.
