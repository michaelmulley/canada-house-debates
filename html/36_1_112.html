</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK4">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should bring 
in legislation making the tax deduction for contributions to 
charitable organizations no less than the tax deduction for 
contributions to political parties. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, on the weekend as I was sitting on the 
couch doing as little as possible trying to recover from my cold, 
for a few moments I watched a telethon on television.  It was the 
Children's Miracle Network telethon.  It was raising money across 
North America for a whole series of charitable works that it does 
to help to provide hospitals for children, hospice care, 
counselling and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was watching television I noticed at the bottom of the 
screen the names and the donations of the people who were putting 
forward their widow's mite, so to speak, to help out the cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course there are millions of dollars required to make this 
thing function properly but, as the dollars and names were going 
across the bottom of the screen, I noticed an obvious trend. 
There was a name such as John Adams, $100; Sarah Smith, $50; and 
on it went down the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consistently people were very generously giving to a charitable 
cause because they wanted to do what was right and they wanted to 
do a good thing.  Most of the donations were very small.  They 
were in the order of $20, $50, $100, and there was the odd large 
donation.  But, in essence, they were all trying to do a good 
thing.  They will get a tax credit for doing that.  That is good. 
We support that in our tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, what is not going to happen is that they are not 
going to get the same kind of tax credit as they would if they 
gave that same money to a political party.  That is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why this motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should bring 
in legislation making the tax deduction for contributions to 
charitable organizations no less than than the tax deduction for 
contributions to political parties. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not claim this as an original idea of mine.  In 1996 the 
24th report of the Standing Committee on Finance recommended that 
the government consider enhancing the charitable tax credit for 
donations to charities currently funded by governments to make it 
as generous as the current political tax credit for small 
donations to political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government chose not to implement that recommendation in 
1996.  However, the time has come.  The budget is now balanced 
and it is an option that the government should consider. This 
motion, when passed, will ask the government to do the right 
thing; that is, to put charities on a level playing field with 
political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other aspects of charities that some people may want 
to debate in the House.  For example, the member for 
Wentworth—Burlington has done some work on the accountability of 
charities themselves, but that is a debate for another day. This 
has to do strictly with the donations and how they are handled by 
the tax system.  That other debate is a good debate for another 
session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the present tax credit system benefit political parties 
more than charities?  Absolutely.  For a $100 contribution to a 
political party a donor will receive a $75 federal tax credit. 
For a $100 gift to a charity a donor will receive a $17 federal 
tax credit.  Clearly the donations to charities are not treated 
the same and are treated far less favourably than donations to 
political parties.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I will argue two points in relation to M-318.  First I 
will explain why charities deserve special treatment under 
Canada's tax law and, second, why charities deserve no less 
favourable treatment than what political parties receive 
currently under the tax code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the activities of charitable organizations provide 
sociably desirable benefits in a number of important areas of 
Canadian life.  They includes everything from health services to 
services to prisoners, heritage exhibits and shelters for 
homeless people.  In innumerable ways charities help society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charities employ over one million people in Canada.  They are a 
big employer.  Yes they take in charitable donations, but they in 
turn put that money back into services for people.  Charities 
maintain and improve the quality of life in our communities. 
Charities provide a more direct and efficient way of identifying 
the needs and preferences in our communities than do governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have used this expression before, but I think it is worth 
repeating.  Governments take our money, deduct 50% for handling, 
then give it back in the form of services that the community 
often did not ask for.  However, when an individual gives to a 
particular charitable cause they have chosen to direct their 
money to a particular need in their community.  Rather than give 
$100 to the taxman, they have indicated that they would rather 
give their money to the Salvation Army soup kitchen, to a 
homeless group or to help someone who is providing hospice 
facilities for battered women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever the cause might be, the individuals have chosen to 
direct their money to a certain area.  They have not asked the 
government to provide a program.  They have said they will do 
it.  They just want the flexibility to be able to direct the 
money.  They can do it just as well and, in fact, often better 
than government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alternatively, governments must identify the needs and allocate 
resources as best they can to meet the needs.  They do this in a 
variety of ways.  They combine their political agenda with the 
perceived needs to create a blanket, country-wide program that 
often does not meet those needs.  They often do not represent the 
needs required in a very diverse country like Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Study after study has indicated that tax incentives designed to 
encourage charitable giving will increase revenues to non-profit 
organizations by an amount greater than the loss of tax revenues 
to the federal government.  In other words, when we try to help 
the charities with this kind of tax measure we not only encourage 
more giving, we increase exponentially the benefits to all 
communities across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should the charitable tax credit be no less than the 
political tax credit?  First of all, the status quo hurts 
charities.  In the 1990s federal, provincial and municipal 
governments have reduced spending on programs significantly.  As 
a result the charitable sector has become a life support system 
for the hungry, the homeless, victims of domestic violence, 
refugees, the unemployed and medical patients who find themselves 
relying more and more on the charitable sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To help charities pick up the slack of these cuts the federal 
government has implemented a number of tax incentives to 
encourage giving to the charitable sector.  Those moves which 
the government has made have been good moves.  Although I have 
not agreed with the budgets that the government has brought 
forward in the last couple of years, the provisions it 
has made to charitable status, for example, increasing the 
amount of donations eligible for tax credit from 50% to 75% of 
net income, are good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This indicates the government's acknowledgement that charities 
do good work in Canada.  We should encourage charitable work. 
More than just dollars are involved.  It increases the 
compassion of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House and I think all members would agree 
that governments cannot do it all.  We will have to rely 
increasingly on individuals, on families and on charitable 
organizations to pick up the slack.  That is not a bad thing; 
that is a good thing.  That could be a very good thing.  But we 
need to ensure that we do not discriminate against those 
organizations by making the tax system skewed one way or another.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that now remains is what are the best public policy 
tools to use to generate greater incentives for people to give to 
charities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 318 provides one of those tools.  It is an excellent 
tool to generate greater giving to charities.  I do not have a 
Canadian study on the equivalent but it probably is much the same 
as the American studies.  They indicate that for every dollar in 
government revenue lost in the U.S. due to higher tax credits, 
donations to charities increase by over $1.20. In other words 
people pick up the slack and then some. They will say “If that 
is a cutback over there, I will give sacrificially in order to 
pick up that slack”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Levelling the playing field between charities and political 
parties also would send a signal to Canadians that the government 
values donations to political parties and charities equally. 
Right now they value the political donations more highly than 
they do charitable donations.  That is not right. This motion 
would eliminate the unfair advantage political parties have over 
charities when it comes to trying to attract donations and in 
fact when the taxpayer in essence is topping up the funds of a 
political party rather than topping up the funds of the local 
Salvation Army. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does the government stand on this issue?  I will be 
interested to hear from the government side during this debate. 
Certainly in the 1996 prebudget report, the all-party finance 
committee recommended that the government enhance the charitable 
tax credit for donations to charities to make it as generous as 
the current political tax credit for small donations to political 
parties. This is exactly the motion I brought forward today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I admitted earlier I will not claim that this is my 
original idea.  What it is trying to do is to bring to fruition 
the desires I think of all parties in the House to make charities 
more viable and give them the assets they need to fill the gap 
that has resulted from other government cutbacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do the charities stand on this issue?  What would they 
think of this?  In November 1995 the president and CEO of the 
Canadian Centre for Philanthropy said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dare I suggest as well that if you believe, as do I, that the 
value of a dollar donated to a voluntary charitable organization 
is every bit as important as the value of a dollar donated to 
political parties, you might also look at equalizing the tax 
treatment for contributions between those two groups or sectors? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again it is exactly what this motion proposes.  Why has the 
government ignored it to date?  I touched on it briefly.  My 
guess is that in the period of deficit budgets the government 
just felt it could not move any further on ways to help 
charities.  It felt the budget just did not allow it to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we enjoy a balanced budget and we are going to find 
ways of distributing surpluses in the coming year, one of the 
ways no doubt will be some tax relief.  That is much needed.  One 
way will be to pay down some debt that is much needed. But 
another and a relatively painless way is to do what the all-party 
committee recommended which is to allow charities to do their 
work and do it better by equalizing this charitable donation. As 
Canada moves into this post-deficit world, levelling that playing 
field can be not only an affordable idea for the government but 
it will become a very politically wise move to show that we value 
the charitable organizations in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I deliberately worded Motion No. 318 to talk about equalizing 
the charitable and political donation tax credits.  I did not 
specifically say a percentage rate or whatever because I believe 
that could be part of an interesting debate over the three hours. 
We can increase the tax credit for donations to charities from 
17% to 75%, the same thing as the current political parties get. 
That is an option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is worded in such a way that it allows the government 
to enter into this debate to say what it thinks that optimum rate 
should be.  Obviously I think charities should get more of a 
break. We discuss whether political parties deserve any break at 
all, something in between or what it might be but certainly not 
more preferential than charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go through a couple of options.  Option one is to 
increase to 75% the tax credit for charitable donations and 
political donations. That would cost the government $190 million 
a year.  It is no small amount of money.  It is significant 
dollars but it would at least level it for those small donations, 
the ones I mentioned earlier that flash on the screen during 
telethons. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Option two as another example is a 50% tax credit.  Obviously 
that levels the playing field for those small donations.  It 
costs considerably less.  It has the appeal of being the same for 
both politicians and charities and would cost even less money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My preferred option is to make the charitable donations the same 
as the current political donation system. That system is very 
generous to political parties.  It allows a 75% tax credit on the 
first $100.  It allows a 50% tax credit for donations between 
$100 and $550.  It would increase the charitable tax credit to 
one-third for donations over $550. That would cost $800 million. 
Again it is a significant amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consider that kind of a tax credit, if all other studies 
remain constant in Canada, it would increase donations to 
charitable organizations to well over $1 billion a year.  Think 
of the good this country could do through its charities. Think of 
the goodwill we could extend through those charitable 
organizations by showing them through our tax system just how 
much we value their contribution to Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are a very generous group of people.  In 1996 there 
were over five million charity donors.  Half of those donors gave 
$150 or less to charities.  They are small givers. Sometimes they 
are people who are starting out in their married lives and cannot 
afford to give a lot but they give $100 or $150. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charities rely on those small donations to make ends meet.  That 
is their bread and butter.  They do not get a big windfall at the 
end of the month where somebody comes by and says “I thought I 
would drop a million dollars on your organization”. They rely on 
those small donations. Logically then it seems appropriate to 
reward those people for their gifts and to encourage even more 
small donors to get into the habit of philanthropy early in their 
lives and give them the tax incentive to make sure that it 
happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Making the charitable tax credit no less than the tax credit for 
political parties is not too expensive. The government can choose 
one of these options.  We could debate what rates are the most 
beneficial or the most preferential.  Perhaps the government has 
some ideas of its own.  I would be interested to hear that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One must also keep in mind that any public revenue lost in the 
form of a charity tax credit will be more than made up for I 
believe in reduced social costs.  It is part of strengthening the 
civil society by allowing charities, families and non-government 
organizations to do their work and to do it well.  We can do 
that.  We can strengthen it.  We will help out the sick, the 
needy, the depressed, the homeless.  We can help them all by 
increasing our support both tangibly with the money and also our 
public support, our words of support, our acknowledgement of the 
importance of charitable organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also make the system more efficient.  We would have a 
tax system which treats all those donations the same, whether 
they be political or charitable.  We would have a tax system that 
would at least have one column taken out of the multipage form 
which would make it somewhat easier to fill out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would become a fairer system to the charity donor.  They 
would not have to sit there biting their nails wondering whether 
it is $100 to the Reform Party or the Liberal Party or somebody 
else and that only costs them $25 so maybe they had better do it. 
They could also make that similar choice and what a delicious 
dilemma to be able to say “Instead I can give it to my local 
charitable organization of my choice”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 318 would send an important message to Canadians.  It 
would signal the importance of charity work and the 
responsibility of all citizens to share toward helping to improve 
the lifestyle and the lives of everyone in society through 
charitable organizations.  It would also send a message that 
government is not intended nor can it ever be all things to all 
people. 
There are other ways and other organizations in which we can help 
pick up the slack that will be better directed in local 
communities rather than in broad national programs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion there was a newspaper article in the Vancouver 
<I>Sun</I> last year by well-known financial expert Michael 
Campbell.  He wrote an editorial saying “If the numbers are any 
indication of the relative importance politicians place on the 
two activities, then in their judgment the re-election of a 
political party is about four and one-half times more valuable 
than charitable work”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not belittle the work of political parties.  They serve a 
purpose in society.  I am part of one and I will continue to be. 
I agree with the all-party committee in 1996 which said “Let us 
do it right; let us make the playing field level”.  I agree with 
comments like Michael Campbell's that say it is time to level 
that importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put all donations whether they be political or charitable 
on a level playing field.  When it comes down to debate and the 
vote some weeks from now, I hope all parties and individual MPs 
in the House will be able to rise to say we did the right thing 
by levelling the playing field and finally the charitable 
organizations are to receive the equal treatment they deserve.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to 
participate in the debate on Motion No. 318. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a few moments to respond on behalf of the government 
to the motion that has been put forward by the member for Fraser 
Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recognizes the motivation for the hon. member's 
motion and fully supports the principle of offering generous tax 
assistance to charitable giving.  The purpose of the present tax 
regime with respect to charitable giving is to encourage larger 
donations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current tax regime was put in place in consultation with the 
charitable organizations.  The government has provided additional 
incentives to charitable giving in four of the last five federal 
budgets.  Measures that have been adopted include: lowering the 
threshold for eligibility for the 29% level of the tax credit to 
$200 from $250; raising the annual income limit for the use of 
charitable donations to most charities from 20%, and when the 
government took office to 75%; and reducing the income inclusion 
rate for capital gains arising from the donation of appreciated 
publicly traded securities to 37.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should recognize that the differences in 
treatment of political contributions and charitable donations 
reflect the different policy intention of the two measures. The 
design of the federal political contributions tax credit reflects 
the desire to encourage greater grassroots involvement by all 
Canadians in the political process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason a generous tax assistance is given to small 
political contributions.  This tax assistance is reduced by 
incremental amounts to the point that the federal tax assistance 
is eliminated for amounts contributed to federal political 
parties in excess of $1,150 per contributor per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast, tax assistance for charitable donations is greater 
for amounts in excess of $200 in order to encourage larger 
donations to charities.  This type of larger scale giving allows 
for a greater measure of stability and predictability for 
charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of very large donations, tax credits may be claimed 
for donations up to 75% of a taxpayer's income in any given year. 
Tax credits may be carried forward to future years should the 
75% limit be exceeded.  Recently we have witnessed the important 
role that the present tax regime has played in charitable giving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The charitable industry has reported seeing more large scale 
donations from individuals.  In particular it has witnessed this 
trend following the implementation of the 1997 budget which 
contained provisions allowing for reduced taxation of capital 
gains on publicly traded shares given to registered charities. 
The <I>Globe and Mail</I> recently called this tax change which 
effectively cut in half the capital gains tax that donors pay on 
such gifts a bonanza for the charity industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The University of Toronto has received more than 70 individual 
contributions of $1 million or greater during its current 
fundraising drive. Gordon Floyd, director of public affairs at 
the Canadian Centre for Philanthropy, recently stated that 
charities have “all seen a real surge in major gifts of stock 
since that legislation changed”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The executive director of the ROM Foundation has also noted an 
increase in tax driven gifts to charities, particularly from new 
benefactors.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He states: “Since 1997 we have received gifts from individuals 
in the form of shares that we would not have otherwise received. 
It has made a difference”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The incentives for large scale giving also bore fruit in terms 
of a new community foundations movement which is a collection of 
endowment funds committed to local projects.  A coalition of 
leaders heading up this movement recently announced in Calgary 
that their collective assets are now worth more than $1 billion. 
This announcement is clearly good news for communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These foundations tend to fill a unique need in that they are 
funding locally based projects across the country in almost every 
province.  Gifts to such foundations can be allocated in many 
ways, including a general community fund or a specific cause.  A 
little more than a week ago members of a youth advisory committee 
from Calgary announced a series of grants they were awarding, 
including a $1,000 grant to a high school program that helps with 
the integration of immigrants.  This type of community action by 
these foundations is encouraging and helps to reinforce our 
collective notion about the relevance and importance of community 
in an increasing globalized world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see from these examples that the tax regime that has been 
put in place has been working to maximize the benefits of 
charitable giving for both individuals and charities and the 
important work they carry out.  Charities have mushroomed into an 
$88 billion affair spreading through 76,000 organizations ranging 
from hospitals to houses of worship to social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By any measurement this industry has been growing more important 
and stronger every year under the present tax structure.  While 
we have seen that large scale giving has been greatly affected by 
tax incentives, we have also found that donations of small 
amounts to charities have not been strongly motivated by the 
availability of tax assistance.  Consequently the greatest effect 
of this proposal before the House would be to increase the fiscal 
cost of tax assistance accorded to donations that would have, in 
all likelihood, been made in any case. Canadians donate in the 
smaller increments because they want to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The level of tax assistance accorded most charitable donations 
results in a roughly 50:50 partnership between government and the 
private sector in support of charities.  It is consistent with 
the principle that although charities promote the public good 
they have direct control over their activities in these areas and 
their priorities will not generally be identical to those of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the government cannot support this motion for the 
following central reason, our basic difference in approach.  The 
current design of the charitable donations tax credit acts to 
encourage larger donations while recognizing the value of smaller 
donations verses the argument put forward by the hon. member 
across the way where he draws the analogy between charitable 
donations and political contributions.  The political 
contribution tax credit encourages small donations but limits tax 
assistance for large contributions.  That is the basic difference 
between the two.  The greatest impact of this motion would be to 
increase tax assistance accorded to donations that would have 
been made in any case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax assistance accorded charitable donations has contributed 
significantly to the growth of this industry.  For the reasons 
outlined we cannot support the motion.  I thank the member 
opposite for bringing this motion forward for debate so that we 
can all be reminded of the importance of charitable giving and 
the worthy causes pursued through their work.

pleasure to rise today to speak to Motion M-318 moved by my 
colleague, the Reform Party whip and member for Fraser Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His motion calls for legislation to be brought in to make the 
deduction for contributions to charitable organizations no less 
than the tax deduction for contributions to political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion flows from a recommendation made by the House of 
Commons Standing Committee on Finance in its 24th report to the 
35th Parliament, which was tabled in January 1996. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the committee recommended that the government consider 
increasing tax deductions for contributions to charitable 
organizations to match the tax deduction for contributions to 
political parties. The government never took this recommendation 
into account in preparing the various budgets tabled since 1996, 
preferring to maintain a policy of cutbacks, particularly in 
transfer payments to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These cuts have resulted in the first surplus in a very long 
time being accumulated in the coffers of the federal government, 
which merrily took advantage of this fiscal flexibility regained 
through other people's efforts to shamelessly step into 
provincial jurisdictions with blatant initiatives like the 
millennium scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As noble as the stated purpose of helping students may be, there 
was a hidden agenda to increase the federal government's 
visibility at the provinces' expense. In addition, in the riding 
of Verchères, the government's erratic fiscal behaviour led to 
the termination of the Tokamak project in Varennes, a world 
leader in microwave technology stemming from nuclear fusion 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research conducted in the Tokamak laboratories was promising in 
terms of new, safe and clean sources of energy. 
This motion is a wake up call to the government about its 
unfairness and its fiscal inconsistency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those making a $100 contribution to a political party enjoy a 
federal tax credit of $75.  However, a $100 gift to a charity 
entitles the contributor to a tax credit of $17.  Today's social 
difficulties arising from the many federal budget cuts have 
created an ever expanding socio-economic role for charitable 
organizations because of the increasing withdrawal of 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The donors enabling these organizations to carry on their work 
in the community should enjoy the same tax benefit as those, 
who, equally legitimately, contribute to political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the government must remedy the situation as 
quickly as possible.  Most charitable organizations operate 
thanks to the many volunteers who work there for nothing.  I 
take this opportunity to pay tribute to and congratulate our 
many fellow Canadians who volunteer body and soul, with often 
very limited means, to help attenuate the effects of the 
problems affecting our society such as poverty, violence and 
suicide among the young, to name but these few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charitable organizations operate in a variety of sectors. 
There are fundraising activities and help for victims of natural 
catastrophes such as the ice storm and the floods of the 
Saguenay and of the Red River in Manitoba, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fight against poverty, there is United Way and the many 
other volunteer action centres we have in our various ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are services helping young people.  I pay tribute to the 
workers at houses for youth, drop in centres to help young 
people find a job, and cadet, scout and guide troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also fundraising and volunteer work for hospitals and 
seniors' residences. 
Fundraising for such foundations as the 
Muscular Dystrophy Foundation, the Heart and Stroke Foundation 
and the Fondation Enfant-Soleil, which held its telethon 
yesterday.  I would like at this point to thank all those who, 
each according to their means, made the telethon such a success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Funds are being raised for university research and various 
school organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charitable organizations are involved with young people, 
handicapped people, municipal libraries, museums, leisure parks 
and summer camps, among other things. I want to take this 
opportunity to salute service clubs such as the Optimist Club, 
the Lions, the Knights of Columbus, the Daughters of Isabel and 
the senior citizens clubs that organize meaningful activities for 
young people, the elderly, and underprivileged families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Raising the tax deduction would encourage donors to invest more 
in charities to help them meet their humanitarian and 
philanthropic goals, especially since these donors are their 
main source of funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of donors, I would like to mention some telling 
statistics.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, in 1996, there were over 80,000 registered charities, 
14,000 of them in Quebec, that received over $4 billion, including 
$457 million in Quebec, from 5,451,860 donors, 1,255,773 of them 
in Quebec. In 1996, the total number of donors was 5,461,860, 
compared to 5,460,730 in 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we explain the levelling, if not the net drop in the 
number of donors? I submit this is the result of a charitable 
tax deduction which is not enough of an incentive. 
The government must review the tax deduction for contributions 
to registered charities and make it more appealing for donors to 
take a more active part in funding these organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues from the Bloc and I will vote in favour of 
the motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
with pleasure today that I rise to speak on this motion being put 
forward by the member for Fraser Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC party is willing to support this motion on behalf of 
charities across Canada. With the latest round of government 
downsizing, charities across the country have been placed under 
even more pressure to perform in many of the same areas 
previously the exclusive domain of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of areas of health care, for instance where many 
hospitals across Canada have had to increase their private 
fundraising efforts to make up for the slack of the downsizing of 
government funding and the reduction to CHST transfers to the 
provinces which has resulted in a tremendous amount of hardship, 
especially in the Atlantic provinces where the local tax base 
simply cannot support, under current charitable donations 
regulations, the amount of fundraising required to keep our 
health care system alive and well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the Victorian Order of Nurses.  The VON is a national 
organization with branches across the country. In recent years 
the role of the VON has been forced to expand exponentially as 
our health care services have been cut by the Liberal government. 
Many branches have been forced to increase their fundraising 
efforts to make up for the decline in funding resulting from 
these higher level cuts in federal government funding for health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one thing to offload financial responsibility to the 
provinces.  It is another thing to offload leadership, which is 
effectively what the federal government has done in the area of 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The VON branch in my riding of Kings Hants has suffered severe 
funding cuts from the municipality as the counties struggle to 
deal with the cuts from the provincial and federal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal government reduces funding to health care it 
creates a domino effect whereby the province of Nova Scotia and 
ultimately the municipalities have to pick up the slack.  We 
simply do not have the local tax base.  That is why this motion 
is very important. It recognizes the needs at the grassroots 
level for changes to charitable donations and the treatment of 
charitable donations to increase the incentive for Canadians in 
communities across Canada to contribute and to help pick up the 
slack for the cuts and the reduced responsibility of the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A charitable organization like the VON offers essential health 
services to the elderly in my riding.  Programs like the PEP 
program, promoting elderly participation, which was initiated 
with the help of Health Canada during the Conservative 
government's time in office, help keep seniors active and 
involved with other citizens in their community.  They are very 
important, particularly in the context of an aging population. 
These are programs that no longer receive government funding and 
the charities have had to find alternative funding arrangements 
just to continue these services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organizations like the VON are now forced to fundraise to 
subsidize visiting nurses programs, for instance to individuals 
who need to be checked at home.  For the elderly who cannot 
afford to pay for home visits these services are extraordinarily 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These visiting nurses programs, combined with the PEP program, 
respite care and meals on wheels, would not exist if not for the 
dedication and perseverance of volunteers and of course the 
generosity of donors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a person representing a political party in Canada can offer 
a potential donor a greater tax incentive to donate to their 
political party than an individual canvassing for a group like 
the VON that provides essential health services, it uncovers an 
injustice in our tax system and one that the member for Fraser 
Valley is quite right in recognizing and in addressing with this 
motion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It highlights a larger problem, that being the complexity of 
Canada's tax code.  If I had a complete copy of our tax code it 
would stand at about the same height as I am standing.  I studied 
taxation as part of my finance degree in university.  Not only 
was it one of the driest courses I have ever taken, which I would 
not wish on anybody, but it acquainted me with the incredible and 
egregiously complex nature of the Canadian tax code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is appalling that a person with a small business in Canada 
has to hire a tax accountant to deal with the government.  Filing 
a tax return should be a simple transaction between the person 
and the government.  They should not need to be represented by a 
third party to deal with the government.  This motion helps to 
recognize the greater problem, which is the tremendous complexity 
of Canada's tax code.  The PC Party will continue to fight for a 
fairer, flatter tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I discuss tax relief for low income Canadians, it should be 
remembered that tax reform needs to be done in a more holistic 
manner instead of addressing one part or another.  It is 
unfortunate that much of the tax reform brought forward serves to 
complicate and not simplify the tax code.  The guiding principle 
behind tax reform should be tax simplification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the finance committee recognized the need to assist our 
charities in their efforts to expand their fundraising 
activities.  During pre-budget consultations last year witnesses 
who appeared before the committee suggested that a motion similar 
to this motion be brought forward.  The finance committee 
included this idea in its recommendations to the Minister of 
Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charities like the VON and particularly charities involved in 
the provision of health care, which has been so tremendously 
affected by the irresponsible cuts of the Liberal government 
since 1993, should not be disadvantaged compared with political 
parties when canvassing for donations.  If we were to increase 
the advantages of donating to charitable organizations, or if 
they were at least brought into line with political 
contributions, charities across this country would receive 
considerable benefit.  In fact, all Canadians would benefit from 
such a change.  Charitable organizations offer essential services 
to society and they should be encouraged, not discouraged, by 
parliament to continue their activities. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate today on Motion No. 318 which 
was moved by the member for Fraser Valley.  The motion suggests 
that charitable donations should be treated no less equitably 
than donations to a political party.  There are some arguments to 
be made in terms of fairness and equity on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tend to agree with the government member who spoke on this 
motion a few minutes ago.  He said that we are really discussing 
apples and oranges.  Political donations have a very limited 
threshold.  It is 75% of the first $100, 50% of the next $450 and 
33% of the last $600, with a cap of $1,150.  If a person gives 
more than that to their favourite political party they do not 
enjoy any form of rebate.  The tax credit is given in the year in 
which the money is donated to the political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is quite a bit different than the situation we have with 
charitable donations where up to 75% of a taxpayer's income can 
be forwarded to the charity or charities of their choice.  Tax 
forwarding advantages can be used on many other things that are 
simply not available with the political tax credit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of history, the political tax credit came into being in 
this country following the 1972-74 minority government.  It was 
one of the conditions for our party's support for the then 
Trudeau government that it bring in some kind of public financing 
for the political process and it may very well be in need of 
updating and redressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Lortie commission on electoral reform and party financing 
discussed a number of these things several years ago.  I might 
remind members opposite that this government has managed to 
ignore the recommendations of the Lortie commission since it 
tabled its report in 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember being involved with the Lortie commission on a trip 
to Harvard University where we met with a number of American 
politicos.  They wondered, I think quite correctly, why we were 
in their country talking to them about political donations 
because we had a much fairer system in this country.  Thanks to 
funds that come in through public financing for political parties 
we get away from all the soft money and all the money that is 
raised.  There are limits.  There is a process.  Generally 
speaking, it has worked well in this country for the last two 
decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is all well and good to talk about the explosion of 
charities and the need for more money.  I agree with what has 
been said on that point, but let us get at the reasons there has 
been an explosion in the need for money for charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been correctly pointed out, but with no editorial 
comments attached, cutbacks have been made by all levels of 
government as they have focused on balancing their budgets, 
eliminating their deficits and concentrating on paying off their 
debts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we could have a very interesting debate about why we 
need all these charities and that if we had a proper tax system 
and financing for a number of social programs people would not be 
required to go door to door or call us at six o'clock at night 
for a donation for their favourite charity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think when the member moved his motion he was clearly 
directing his attention at the small donor, the person who gives 
$50 or $100.  It may very well be that we do need to look at 
levelling the playing field for those small donors, with a cap of 
perhaps $1,150, which is currently what the political tax credit 
is, or perhaps with inflation over the last two decades we should 
be looking at moving that number up to $2,000 so it is more 
appropriate in this day and age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone might make the argument that there should be symmetry 
between political givings and charitable donations at the low 
end.  However, we should be be careful about the absolute amount 
that is donated to a political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are lots of good arguments that could be advanced on 
another day on that topic, but with respect to charitable 
donations, nobody is arguing that we should cap them, so we are 
talking, to some extent, about oranges and apples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I believe that there is a case to be made at the 
low end for levelling the playing field, but I would leave it at 
that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to debate this 
motion.  However, before we rush to adopt this motion, which on 
the surface would appear to give added tax benefits to charitable 
donors, let us first examine the present status of tax benefits 
for charitable donations and ask ourselves what would be the 
fiscal cost to government and, most importantly, what would be 
the consequence to charities themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the immediate consequence to charitable contributors, 
were the legislation to be put in place as moved, would be a zero 
federal tax benefit for charitable donations in excess of $1,150 
per donor per year. 
That is the present situation for federal tax credits on 
political contributions.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the design for tax treatment different between political 
contributions and charitable donations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difference in design reflects the difference in the policy 
intent and goals of the two.  A tax credit for political 
contributions is aimed at encouraging greater grassroots 
involvement by all Canadians in the political process, while at 
the same time preventing the overbearing influence of those who 
can afford a large donation.  Hence, more generous tax assistance 
is given to smaller political contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tax assistance is reduced incrementally to the point of 
zero when political contributions exceed $1,150 per contributor 
per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast, the tax credit for charitable donations is aimed 
not only at recognizing the value of all levels of donations, big 
or small, but also at encouraging larger donations to charities. 
Hence, tax assistance for charitable donations is greater for 
amounts in excess of $200, 29% or more versus 17% for the first 
$200, and the threshold for this eligibility was recently lowered 
from the original $250. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, tax credits may be claimed for very large donations up 
to 75%, raised from the previous 20%, of a taxpayer's income in 
any given year.  The tax credit may be carried forward for the 
ensuing five years should the 75% limit be exceeded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The income inclusion rate for capital gains arising from the 
donation of appreciated publicly traded securities was also 
reduced to 37.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we can see that in four of the last five federal budgets tax 
measures have been taken to ensure that donations to charities 
indeed are encouraged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date, the level of tax benefits accorded most charitable 
donations result in approximately a 50-50 partnership between the 
government and the private sector in the support of charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the fiscal cost of the measure would be were we to 
implement the motion as moved would be approximately $125 million 
per year for the federal government and some $55 million for the 
provincial governments.  The effect on the level of charitable 
donations likely would not be that much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small donations to charities are not strongly motivated by the 
availability of tax benefits.  Thus, treating charitable 
donations in the same way as political contributions would not 
necessarily increase the total amount of donations from small 
donors.  At the same time, larger donations from big donors may 
in fact diminish in number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a recent news item reported in the May 27, 1998 issue of the 
Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>, the increase in the number of large 
donations—in millions of dollars—to help the Canadian Red 
Cross, land mine survivors and cultural institutions was 
attributed to tax measures adopted in the last five federal 
budgets of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest effect of the proposal would be to increase the 
fiscal costs of tax assistance accorded to donations that would 
have been made in any case.  Charities themselves would receive 
little benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share the principle of charitable giving.  We share the belief 
as Canadians that charitable giving, which is a defining 
character of the Canadian nation, expresses the best in our 
people.  We are people who take pride in helping the most 
vulnerable of our citizens and in advancing lofty causes such as 
scholarships, the performing arts, research, professional 
faculties, ethnic studies, finding cures for diseases, literacy, 
sports, international development projects and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence, we help to ensure that the Canadian citizenry is 
sound in mind and body.  This goal is a chance we give as 
well to the people in developing nations.  This spirit of helping 
fellow citizens, neighbours and strangers, is very much a part of 
the Canadian culture.  Essentially, Canadians, particularly the 
small donors, give not because of tax incentives or any monetary 
inducement, but because they want to give. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Viewed in this light, Canadians will see the soundness of the 
current differential government policy with respect to the two 
types of donations and see the absence of need to treat them in 
the same way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A political contribution is a contribution to help advance the 
cause of democracy.  Charitable donations are more than a 
contribution.  Charitable contributions are gifts to help advance 
the noble causes of the heart.  We value and hold in esteem 
charitable donors for their gifts of the heart.

address Motion No. 318 put forward by my hon. colleague from 
Fraser Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it absolutely unbelievable, not only to members on this 
side of the House, but indeed to all the people across Canada who 
are watching at home today that we would even have to have this 
debate, that we would even have to have this motion put forward 
by my hon. colleague from Fraser Valley.  I certainly applaud his 
initiative to bring this matter forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the issue of levelling the playing field at 
a minimum. The motion as my hon. colleague pointed out says “no 
less than”.  That is a key phrase in the motion itself.  It says 
that in the opinion of this House the government should bring in 
legislation making the tax deduction for contributions to 
charitable organizations no less than the tax deduction for 
contributions to political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reply or rebuttal, the hon. member from the governing Liberal 
Party who just spoke is missing the point. He said that if this 
were to go ahead and we levelled the playing field and treated 
both exactly the same, that anybody wanting to make a donation to 
a charity of more than $1,150 in any given year would get no 
additional tax credit.  He is quite correct if we did it exactly 
the same, but that is not what the motion says. The motion very 
clearly says no less than. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the excellent presentation that my hon. colleague from Fraser 
Valley made in speaking to his private members' motion, and the 
need to bring this type of legislation forward, he threw out the 
challenge not only to government members but to members from all 
the political parties to suggest some options. He said to look at 
alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the options I would like to discuss is the option of 
eliminating the tax credit for political parties and reassigning 
the benefit from that to charities. That type of tax reform would 
certainly be supported by a lot more Canadians than the present 
system.  The small donors, the average donor, the person who can 
only donate $50 to any given entity be it a charity or a 
political party, those are the people we need to target. We need 
to ensure that it is not a case where $100 to a political party 
gets a $75 tax credit but $100 to a charity only gets a $17 tax 
credit.  That is the issue.  That is the driving force behind 
this motion and the reason why I am certainly speaking in support 
of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The period provided 
for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired and the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of 
precedence on the Order Paper.

sharing my time with the member for Québec, who is also my 
assistant on the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> If the hon. member wants to 
share his time, I have to ask for the unanimous consent of the 
House to proceed in this fashion. Is it agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to speak today 
to this motion brought forward by the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Around this time last Monday, the Bloc Quebecois launched the 
first initiative of employment insurance week, making the whole 
country aware, among other things, that only one out of every 
four unemployed young people is entitled to employment insurance 
benefits. Three out of four young people who have paid 
contributions cannot receive EI benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The week dedicated to employment insurance also included a 
public forum and a panel of experts. 
We saw the impact of that week on parliamentary business. We saw 
all kinds of statements, particularly by the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, who said that tightening the requirements 
was good for young Canadians since it gave them a chance to go 
back to school. According to him, there is nothing wrong with 
being strict to the point where people who have contributed to a 
plan are not entitled to benefits. It is perfectly legal and it 
actually shows compassion for our young people. We saw the 
public condemn that statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week also gave us the opportunity to expose what has been 
called the employment insurance scandal. We now have the proof 
we needed. The minister was forced to admit that the billions of 
dollars paid in employment insurance premiums were not put into 
a distinct account. 
Still, it was again pointed out, as it was by the Auditor 
General of Canada, that there had to be a separate account to 
ensure that employment insurance was monitored appropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no such separate account.  The government used the 
money to reduce the deficit.  We understand the deficit did have 
to be dealt with, but we have understood today as well that this 
was done at the expense of workers earning less than $39,000 a 
year, and of the unemployed, whose eligibility for and duration 
of benefits the Liberals have twice managed to reduce, in both 
the 1994 and the 1996 reforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Late last week, five studies were released on the assessment of 
the 1994 reform, and these were not carried out by Bloc 
Quebecois experts or by experts wishing to express their 
opinions but by experts on the government payroll. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things, these studies addressed the consequences on 
long term employment.  Part of the conclusion states “It seems 
therefore that Bill C-17 has attained its objective, which is to 
reduce the eligibility for benefits of those who are eligible 
but have spent little time in the workforce”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These conclusions are an admission that the objective was to 
decrease eligibility for employment insurance benefits for 
seasonal workers and others with similar jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another finding of the study addressed the duration of the lost 
employment and the eligibility for employment insurance. 
According to the expert, “Workers in high unemployment 
provinces,  the Atlantic provinces in particular, and Quebec to 
some extent, or high unemployment industries, such as the 
primary and construction sectors, are far more prone to job 
loss.  A randomly selected worker in these provinces or 
industries could expect to lose far more in weekly benefits than 
a worker from any other region in Canada, as a result of Bill 
C-17”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those choices were deliberate.  They knew the consequences would 
be lower benefits to the unemployed, and even less employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another study on the duration of unemployment benefits was 
released at the same time. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It compared two groups:  that of 1993 and that of 1995.  It said 
that belonging to the 1995 group increased one's chances of 
getting off unemployment, resulting in a significant decrease in 
duration. Right after the election campaign, the Prime Minister 
said “We are going to set aside all the Progressive Conservative 
reforms and start treating people properly again”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did not say it verbally.  It appeared in a letter that 
pointed out, in so many words, that, under a Liberal government, 
they would not treat people that way any more. Yet, less than 
three months after the election, they passed a law that was even 
tougher, even more restrictive than everything the Progressive 
Conservatives had done before them. 
It was the GST all over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why people are angry today.  People throughout Canada 
are angry; those affected by the cuts resulting from the 1994 
reform are angry, but not as angry as those affected by the 
cuts resulting from the 1996 reform, because the same implacable 
logic is at work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the government said it was going to limit duration of 
benefits.  It then realized that this was not enough to wring a 
bit more out of unemployed workers.  In the 1996 reform, it 
decided to come at it from the eligibility angle.  This was when 
it brought in the 910 hours for someone entering the job market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A young person must work 26 35-hour weeks or, and this is to be 
found nowhere, 62 15-hour weeks.  Only the Liberals have a 62-week 
year. 
These young people have no other way of qualifying.  That is the 
direct reason why only one young person in four qualifies for 
EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are therefore looking at two Liberal reforms that have had a 
major negative impact.  The weekend editorial in the <I>Nouvelliste</I> 
said, and I quote: “There is no shame in changing course when it 
is clear that our policies are not producing the effects we 
thought they would.  Minister Martin announced that his old age 
pension reform would be reworked, because it became clear that 
it was going to penalize those who are setting money aside for 
their later years.  The time has now come to re-assess the EI 
policy.  Otherwise, this week's discontent, which goes well 
beyond Quebec's borders, could turn into a time bomb for the 
Liberals”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the judgment that was passed reflects the reality. Last 
year, on election night, almost one full year ago, the federal 
Liberals received a clear message both from Atlantic Canada and 
from the Quebec regions, who harshly criticized the reforms to 
employment insurance. Last week, particularly when judgment was 
passed on this issue, all Canadians clearly expressed their 
dissatisfaction with the way the funds are currently managed and 
stated that the government must react. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude by quoting an expert in this field, 
Mr. Marc Van Audenrode, who co-wrote the study that demonstrated 
that reforms to employment insurance push people onto welfare. 
This morning, this author pointed out, among other things, that 
Canada used to have one of the most generous employment 
insurance schemes among OECD countries. 
Nowadays, our system is not as generous as the average program 
provided by OECD countries or by our competitors in New England. 
It is about as generous as the program in Alabama. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a parliamentary system. We have a government of 
Canada. The duty of this government is not only to look through 
the window to see if the economy is growing. Its duty is to 
ensure that wealth is adequately distributed. It has to realize 
that an adequate employment insurance program is the best way to 
ensure that people do not end up unemployed and on welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the situation, the federal government must quickly go back 
to the drawing board. We offer the government our cooperation 
through the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development 
and the Status of Persons with Disabilities or in any other way. 
The government should consider our six bills 
and come up with a concrete proposal, because we cannot afford 
to wait any longer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
simply want to comment on my colleague's efforts and stress how 
much Bloc Quebecois members appreciate his work regarding this 
issue and last week's very conclusive results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we pursue the fight to achieve greater 
fairness and a better distribution of wealth in Canada and in 
Quebec. The Bloc Quebecois is particularly concerned about the 
plight of young people, since one in four can no longer get the 
support needed to ensure his or her future and return to the 
workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of this, my question to the hon. member has to do with 
young people. 
I would like to know to what degree young people are penalized 
by this reform and how—since this is the object of our efforts—we 
could improve their fate by overhauling this employment 
insurance reform? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people are indeed greatly affected. Three out of every 
four are no longer eligible for benefits. Part of the solution 
is found in our proposed bill, which seeks to bring back the 
number of hours worked by a young person to be eligible for 
benefits for the first time to a more reasonable figure than the 
910 or so hours that are currently required, so as to allow 
people, after their first job and particularly when they have 
just finished school, to qualify with a reasonable number of 
hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other objective is to give self-employed persons access to 
the employment insurance program. In addition to being unfair, 
the program does not reflect the new realities of the labour 
market. 
Many young people are self-employed and would appreciate having 
some income security. Sometimes, for example, this is what makes 
the difference in the decision to start a family. There is a new 
reality, but there is also a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are measures that the government should consider and that 
this parliament should approve. Therefore, I ask the consent of 
the House to make the motion votable, so that we can effectively 
see where each parliamentarian stands on a crucial issue that is 
being debated right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Does the hon. member have 
unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> There is no consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, just to finish answering the 
question, I have to say the Liberal majority has not only 
refused to discuss this issue in committee, but has just refused 
that this motion be put to a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly hope the members from Quebec and the maritime 
provinces will have to account for this decision by the 
government when they go back in their ridings. Why have they 
refused today to have this motion put to a vote? Why do they 
show such a lack of courage, and why did they make this 
decision? Are they totally out of touch with reality in their 
ridings or are they more afraid of their whip than their need 
for electors' trust? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this opposition day will be an opportunity for the 
Liberal majority to reconsider the issue and change its 
attitude. When we ask the House to castigate the government for 
the catastrophic effects of its reforms to unemployment 
insurance; for having taken over funds destined for unemployed 
persons; and for its inability to adapt the unemployment 
insurance system to the new realities of the labour market, 
particularly where young people, women, and self-employed persons 
are concerned, it is because Canada should go back to the 
drawing board, examine the situation, and take remedial action 
as soon as possible.

colleague, the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, I am pleased to 
speak today on this important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a well known fact that the Bloc Quebecois is very 
concerned with the employment situation and the new employment 
insurance reform. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has made this whole issue its priority. We 
have made many suggestions to the government to improve the 
employment insurance reform, which is extremely hard on those 
who lose their jobs. This is an unjustified reform, especially 
when  the government is piling billions of dollars, more 
precisely $6 billion a year, in the employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion of the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the House castigate the government for the catastrophic 
effects of its reforms to unemployment insurance; for having 
taken over funds destined for unemployed persons; and for its 
inability to adapt the unemployment insurance system to the new 
realities of the labour market, particularly where young people, 
women, and self-employed persons are concerned. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last past week, there were editorials in various Quebec 
newspapers describing this reform as unjustified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote a few. <I>La Presse</I> called it primarily intellectual 
fraud, a poor approach to taxation, a fundamental lack of 
transparency on the part of this government. 
The government is not honest with the people. That is what we 
have been denouncing for over a year. We have denounced this 
lack of transparency where the government helps itself to money 
paid first by the workers and second by the employers. This is a 
very harsh reform, which runs counter the very essence of what a 
real employment insurance reform should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In <I>Le Soleil</I>, Donald Charest wrote “This is a fictitious 
surplus”. It is well known that the $19 billion soon to be 
accumulated in the employment insurance fund are no longer 
available. It has been used to pay the government's grocery 
bill, its deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will be in a jam in the event of a recession. As 
one of the editorials said, if at least the government had had 
the foresight of accumulating this kind of surplus in case of a 
recession, it could have been said that the government had an 
ounce of wisdom. 
But this is not what is happening in reality, because we know 
full well that the amounts have been spent. These amounts are 
virtual. They are not in the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that contributions are being maintained at very high 
rates, that is $2.70, is very harmful for job creation. They 
were reduced by only 20 cents. We know that for a worker who 
earns $500 a week, these 20 cents represent $1 less in weekly 
contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, six bills have 
been introduced. When the human resources development minister 
responds to our questions in the House, as he did during the 
employment insurance week, he is not very credible. 
He gives us somewhat farfetched answers that reflect his lack of 
humanity and compassion toward unemployed people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister tells us there are 500,000 more part time workers 
who were not covered by the system and who are now covered. He 
says to women who are on maternity leave that once their 
children are raised they will have some extra assistance through 
employment insurance. He also says that the government has acted 
in a courageous manner and wanted to break the dependence cycle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respond to this by saying that even though there are 500,000 
more part time workers who were not covered by the employment 
insurance system previously, in fact this means that these 
workers are paying contributions but cannot get any benefits. 
These women do not qualify for employment insurance because they 
have not worked enough hours. This is especially true for part 
time workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some women who have worked for 40 weeks, if they have worked 
more hours during the first weeks, it does not count, because 
the calculation is on the last 26 weeks. Consequently, they 
receive even less benefits than before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a reform that is unwarranted and we have several 
comments as a result of the minister's answers. He says that the 
government did not want a repeat of the situation that existed 
when the Liberals came into office, when the deficit was at $6 
billion. I can fully understand that a $6 billion deficit is a 
concern for the government, but when there are $19 billion in 
the employment insurance fund, I say to the minister that he is 
not in a rush to undertake a reform, because it works to the 
government's advantage. 
At present, the government gets another $700,000 every hour. 
Each and every hour, $700,000 more comes into the government's 
coffers.  So leaving the reform as it is means that, in the 
meantime, the government is making money on the backs of the 
workers.  This is something to be severely criticized.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad much was made of this last week.  The minister 
responded to questions from the Bloc Quebecois by saying that he 
had been all over the country meeting with people to discuss the 
impact of the reform and that it is always a pleasure for him to 
listen. He is very polite, but he is not very quick to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all fine and well for him to listen. However, members of 
the Bloc Quebecois are not the only ones criticizing the reform. 
Last week, other parties were as vehement in their criticism of 
the government's attitude in dipping into the employment 
insurance fund to wipe away its deficit, which was very 
dishonest and showed its disdain for the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister does not want to rush into any hasty decisions.  I 
understand, it is worth his while not to.  When a government is 
accumulating a surplus of $6 billion every year, there is no 
need to worry about the deficit, because the employment 
insurance fund is right there to dip into.  Taxes could have 
been raised, but we are wise to the game the Minister of Human 
Resources Development and the government in general are playing. 
We are wise to them.  They did not want to be unpopular, there 
they were with a smile on their faces. 
They paid down the deficit and now they can walk with their 
heads held high as a result. But I would not be so proud of 
myself, knowing that thousands of people are no longer eligible 
for employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's response to the Bloc Quebecois bills is that they 
are no solution that will help the unemployed to get back in the 
work force. My response to that is that we are concerned for the 
workers in transition, the ones who are short of weeks for 
employment insurance, the women who are not qualified for 
maternity benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My response as well is that we are very concerned about a 
solution that encourages people to go directly onto welfare. 
That is the path the present Liberal government is pointing 
people to.  We know this costs millions of dollars, $845 million 
in Quebec and $1.6 billion in the rest of Canada. 
This means $2.5 billion downloaded onto the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the Canada social transfer was cut by $42 billion 
instead of $48 billion. This is what the minister calls giving 
provinces money back for health care. We call it cutting less 
than previously announced. The minister had announced $48 
billion in cuts and he cut only $42 billion. He was able to be 
this generous thanks to the employment insurance fund. He did 
not even have the honesty to show his true colours, and say what 
he really intended to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unemployment insurance reform was aimed at revitalizing the 
job market, and what do we see? Thousands of workers in 
vulnerable jobs on the fringe of the labour market are being 
excluded. This is a disaster. It is estimated that only one out 
of four young workers between the ages of 20 and 24 qualifies 
for employment insurance benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And then there are women. The minister gives us simplistic 
answers. He does not even have statistics to back them up. He 
tells us it is due to the birth rate. Then can he explain why 
maternity benefits dropped by 6% while the birth rate dropped by 
only 1%? The discrepancy is obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I deplore the bad faith of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, who enjoys reading his files, but has very few 
concrete measures to offer. The Bloc Quebecois has worked very 
hard to find solutions and make the reform easier on the 
unemployed. But obviously the government has no intention of 
backing off.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, recently, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development said rather suavely if 
not innocently “We no longer have a deficit in Canada, which 
means that the poor families are now richer.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yvon Deschamps, a renowned stand-up comic in Quebec, once said 
“It is better to be rich and healthy than poor and sick.” I do 
not know if the Minister of Human Resources Development is 
trying to compete with Mr. Deschamps, but with statements like 
that one, he is succeeding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, what the minister is telling us is that, thanks 
to the tightening of the employment insurance program, poor 
families are getting richer. Since this Liberal government was 
elected in 1993, there are 500,000 more people living below the 
poverty line in Canada. We cannot hope to solve the problem with 
the poverty insurance system we just talked about—because it is 
not an employment insurance system, but really a poverty 
insurance scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty insurance will particularly affect one category of 
workers, pregnant women. For these women, it will become 
increasingly difficult to qualify for maternity benefits. The 
hon. member for Québec touched on that issue and I would like 
her to answer my question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen to pregnant women whose access to maternity 
benefits and special benefits in general, like maternity leave, 
sick leave and adoption leave, will be reduced? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
her question. Indeed the minister's statement is shameful. He is 
telling us that we are richer because the deficit has been 
eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know now where the money that was used to eliminate the 
deficit came from. It came from the employment insurance fund, 
which is essential to help the unemployed find a job at a time 
when jobs are precarious and to give them a minimum income so 
they do not have to go on welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One and a half million poor children in Canada is nothing to be 
thrilled about. One and a half million poor children also means 
poor parents. I do not know if the minister can see the 
relationship between poor children and poor parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women are also very affected by this reform. 
We know now that, with the reform, a woman must accumulate twice 
as many hours to become eligible for maternity benefits and EI 
special benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's answer to that is that the fertility rate has 
dropped. Even though the fertility rate has dropped, do special 
benefits not also include parental, adoption and sickness 
benefits? There has been a substantial decrease in these 
benefits in 1997. Will the minister tell me that people are sick 
because the fertility rate is lower? I do not know what his 
answer will be. He will certainly come up with another 
farfetched answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have spoken out against these kinds of things and will 
continue to do so. This will definitely not encourage young 
couples to have children. 
We know that the minister's reform is not adapted to the job 
market because young women have unstable part time jobs and do 
not have any strong ties to the job market. Those are the things 
that we denounce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope the Minister of Human Resources Development will finally 
see the light and will be more human and more realistic in this 
reform that particularly affects the unemployed, women and young 
people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's 
motion talks about the disastrous effects of reform of the 
employment insurance system.  What disastrous effects? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I reviewed last week's <I>Hansard</I> and listened to the 
speakers opposite today, it is obvious the hon. members opposite 
have been trying to raise people's fears, trying to manufacture 
disaster where none exists.  Instead of assisting people to use 
the programs available they are agitating complaints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak in a moment of a few of the programs available 
under the system.  The first speaker opposite spoke of the EI 
scandal, so-called, alleging that the government is taking over 
funds of workers.  That is not the case at all.  When the 
government first came to power there was a major deficit in terms 
of the unemployment insurance fund.  We have set up the system so 
that we are sure there is an investment there in the future, that 
there is a fund we can go to in the future that will protect 
workers in the future.  That is good management to ensure there 
is a system available to workers in the future so that employment 
insurance premiums do not have to be raised should we get into a 
downturn in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance reform is helping Canadians get back into 
the workforce.  We are accomplishing this through a number of 
direct initiatives.  This is a reasonable reform package.  This 
is a compassionate reform package that is clearly in the best 
interests of all Canadian workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the old passive UI system, the system the Bloc would have 
us return to, employment insurance is a proactive approach to 
supporting and encouraging Canadians to stay in the labour market 
as long as possible.  That is why employment insurance combines 
income support with effective active re-employment measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance rewards people who work.  It invests in 
people who are prepared to invest in themselves.  Taken together, 
employment insurance measures are fair and balanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider some of those programs.  Let us consider the 
five active re-employment measures for a moment, the first being 
targeted wage subsidies.  The Government of Canada contributes 
part of a person's wage and that enables employers to hire 
claimants or former claimants who receive valuable on the job 
experience. In 1996-97 this measure helped some 9,000 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those with an entrepreneurial spirit we provide 
self-employment assistance.  This measure, and I believe it is 
one of the better programs under the system, provides claimants 
with financial support and planning assistance to help them get a 
viable business off the ground.  In 1996-97 this measure assisted 
over 13,000 entrepreneurs in starting their own business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes in proactive collaboration so we have 
job creation partnerships where we work with the provinces and 
the territories, the private sector, labour and community groups. 
Together we develop projects that do two things, generate new job 
opportunities for unemployed Canadians and enhance the local 
economy.  In 1996-97 job creation partnerships assisted over 
18,000 workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also piloting targeted earnings supplements that top up a 
claimant's wages for a short time.  This active re-employment 
measure encourages the person to take work that pays less than 
their previous job.  It is an effective way of helping them make 
a transition back into the workforce and find permanent work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth active re-employment measure is called skills, loans 
and grants.  It offers training to upgrade people skills by 
helping with fees for study courses and living expenses. Training 
is now a provincial responsibility.  So this measure is delivered 
by the provinces through labour market development agreements 
with the Government of Canada. 
Those five programs help people get work and have active 
re-employment measures to help them get back into the labour 
force.  Employment insurance reform is generating savings of $800 
million that the government will reinvest annually in these 
measures.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the hon. member that the effects will not be 
disastrous. They will be highly beneficial to Canadian workers 
and to the Canadian economy and to Quebeckers and the Quebec 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 1998-99 Quebec will receive $5.3 million for active measures 
that will go toward helping workers in the hon. member's 
province.  No one can accuse this government of short changing 
Quebeckers.  But by golly members opposite, in terms of their 
fearmongering and their separatist rabble-rousing with their 
misleading information, are killing the economy.  They are 
causing the loss of jobs. Instead of recognizing the programs 
available and talking about them in Quebec and showing people how 
they can utilize them to get back into the force, they are out 
there with their separatist leanings which are killing the very 
economy we are trying to improve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's motion says that employment insurance does not 
have the capacity to adapt to the new realities of the labour 
market.  With all due respect, the member is wrong again.  He 
should try telling that to a woman in Chicoutimi or in the riding 
of the member for Acadie—Bathurst who works 14 hours in a 
department store before becoming unemployed. Under the old UI 
system that the member for Acadie—Bathurst supports as well she 
was just plain out of luck because none of her work was 
insurable. Under the new hours based system, after 30 weeks of 
work she will qualify for employment insurance benefits. What is 
more, under the hours based system women working part time are 
now eligible for maternity benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say it is not adaptable to the labour market.  Try telling 
that to the 270,000 women now covered by employment insurance for 
the first time in their lives.  And yes, mothers who left the 
workforce to stay home and raise their children and who now want 
to return to work are eligible for active re-employment measures. 
That is being adaptable and that is looking to the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member says employment insurance reforms are tough on 
youth.  No, they are not.  They are designed to discourage young 
people from throwing their lives away by leaving school before 
they have completed their education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do hon. members opposite want to encourage young Quebeckers and 
young New Brunswickers to throw away their lives by dropping out 
of school and ending up on the treadmill of short term work 
followed by employment insurance income?  I should think not, but 
their speeches lead me to believe otherwise. That is certainly 
not what the Government of Canada wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we have the youth employment strategy to break that 
cycle.  That is why we brought in the Canadian opportunities 
strategy to further provide young men and women with the 
opportunity to pursue their education and thus improve their 
chances of finding employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective, in case the hon. members do not get it, is not to 
see how many young people we can put on to employment insurance 
but how many we can find meaningful employment and long term work 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about seasonal workers?  Employment insurance is there for 
seasonal workers.  Again, the basic premise of employment 
insurance is to encourage workers to continue to work as long as 
possible.  We wanted to discourage people from falling into the 
old habit of using employment insurance as an income supplement. 
That is what created dependency on unemployment insurance.  It is 
too early to get the complete picture but it appears that workers 
are finding extra weeks of employment needed to qualify for 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we saw there was a flaw in the system in terms of the short 
weeks, we on this side instead of ranting and raving about it put 
in place pilot projects to ensure that those short weeks would 
not hurt workers and that the program would be there for those in 
the seasonal industries.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike members opposite, we on this side are moving forward to 
ensure that the system is in place for the workers in the future, 
that there is investment so that we have the kind of program and 
social safety net the workforce so direly believes in.

<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague has criticized my talking about a 
scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote a sentence from two of the five studies released on the 
1994 evaluation “For example, a woman working in the fishing 
industry and a man in forestry would have each received an 
average of 25 weeks of benefits a year before the new system. 
After the bill, the number of weeks was reduced to 20.  The 
effects of Bill C-17 were therefore disproportionate in provinces 
and industries relying most heavily on the insurance system”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another study, this time ordered by the government, noted “We 
have concluded that Bill C-17 has caused a 20.7% reduction in 
benefits paid out, essentially because of shorter qualifying 
periods”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are two scandalous effects of the 1994 reform in which the 
Liberals, three months after an election campaign in which they 
talked about moving forward and never repeating Conservative 
strategies.  Their results were worse than those of the 
Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore say to the hon. member in conclusion that he 
does not know what he is talking about on the subject of active 
measures.  These measures were transferred to the provinces for 
the good of all Quebeckers and Canadians, because this way they 
might be effective. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
Again as with so much of what the member opposite said 
previously, he has it wrong.  He is interested in raising fears 
and talking about disaster. The hon. member has heard this before 
but I think maybe he should hear it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada under this new system, under the labour 
market development agreements will invest $2.7 billion over five 
years to enable his province to deliver active re-employment 
measures. Those are measures designed to get people back to work 
and into the labour force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again want to emphasize that one of the reasons why we have to 
make that investment is that the separatist leanings across the 
way are killing the economy and driving people out of the 
province.  They are raising unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say that figure one more time.  The Government of Canada 
will invest $2.5 billion over five years to enable the province 
of Quebec to deliver active re-employment measures. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question will be very brief.  I wonder if my friend can tell 
workers and employers where the $15 billion EI fund is.  Is it in 
a vault somewhere?  Is it invested?  What exactly has happened to 
that $15 billion fund? I think workers and employers would like 
to know that it is stored away safely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is no question that 
this government has shown how credible it is in dealing with the 
finances of the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can be assured that with this government and our 
Minister of Finance in control the money is going to be there in 
the future for those workers who need it.  We see it as an 
investment.  When we came to power there was something like a $6 
billion deficit in terms of the unemployment insurance fund at 
that time. As a result, premiums were going up under the former 
Tory administration.  We were able to bring them down and still 
have surplus funds in the EI fund to be there to protect workers' 
interests in the future.  That is good management by this 
government. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is too bad 
my question has to be short because I could say a lot on this 
subject. My colleague spoke about Quebec separating, but I can 
guarantee one thing: New Brunswick has no plans to separate, but 
it does have problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member speaks of part time employees working 14 hours.  How 
does he explain the fact that fewer than 40% of workers qualify 
for employment insurance?  All the others were cut off 
employment insurance, because of the government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close on this question.  How does he explain that, before 
the election, his government said that changes to employment 
insurance would spell disaster for New Brunswick and, now that 
it is in power, it has made them? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member's figure of 40% 
is slightly off base.  In terms of his province, New Brunswick, 
the figure is actually 75%.  It shows that the system is working 
for him.  Instead of burying our heads in the sand, we have tried 
to put a system in place that gives people the skills and the 
opportunity to get back into the workforce rather than to the 
continue the cycle of being on EI and using it as an income 
supplement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise today to address the motion from the Bloc 
Quebecois.  Because time is so limited I will try to focus on one 
aspect of this motion. I wish to address the aspect of the EI 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of minutes ago I asked my friend a very direct question 
about the EI fund.  I said that I hoped the government had stored 
away this money very carefully and that workers and employers who 
have contributed more than $15 billion into the fund, which is 
more than they have received back in benefits, would want to know 
that it had been stored away very safely, that it had been 
invested and put away in a vault somewhere.  My friend provided 
an answer that was a little evasive, a little less than direct. 
My friend said in his speech that the government has been 
ensuring that the EI fund is there so that we can go into the 
future, or some bromide like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI fund is a myth. The EI fund does not exist in any real 
way.  There is no fund. It is a fairy tale.  It is not exactly 
one of the brothers Grimm fairy tales but it is a very grim fairy 
tale.  Just like leprechauns, unicorns and the fairies of the 
woods, the EI fund does not exist.  It never has existed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation where the government runs around telling 
people “If we mandate that money is taken off your cheques and 
sent to us, it will go into some fund”.  It is very much like 
the Bre-X disaster of a couple of years ago. Somebody told people 
“Invest in our company.  We have millions of dollars of gold 
reserves in the jungles of Indonesia that we will soon be drawing 
upon.  We just need a little money to get it out of the ground. 
Pretty soon it will all come back to you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just like the Indonesian goldfields, the EI fund is a myth.  It 
does not exist.  There is a note in the consolidated revenue 
fund, an IOU to the workers and employers who have contributed to 
this fund.  A $15 billion IOU. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend who was talking in a rather evasive way about the fund 
should be more direct and admit that the EI fund does not exist. 
There is no money in there.  People who have been paying into it 
for years and years have been misled. We see this happening often 
in a government that is armed with the ability to tax and to 
spend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see it as well in things like the Canada pension plan.  For 
years people were led to believe that all the money they paid in 
premiums was going into an account and it was building up for 
their retirement, only to find out that it was being lent to the 
provinces at below market rates of interest and there really was 
not any money. We see it happening with the federal 
superannuation pension fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever there is a fund of money, the federal government cannot 
wait to get its greedy little fingers on it.  No matter where it 
came from, no matter under what premise it was taken from people, 
in the end it never ever uses it for the purpose it was supposed 
to be used for.  This is another example of that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where did the $15 billion go?  It is a great mystery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Indonesia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Perhaps, who knows?  Maybe it went to 
Italy.  We do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we know is that it went into the consolidated revenue fund. 
We also know that the government is proposing to spend another 
$11 billion in the next few years.  So we have a situation where 
the money that has allegedly come into the EI fund does not 
exist. We also know the government is going to spend $11 billion 
in the next few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can only conclude that money is going to all kinds of things 
that workers and employers did not ask for and do not want.  The 
government says “We have a better idea. We will spend it for you 
because we think we know better”.  It speaks to the government's 
unspoken assumption that people do not know as well as the 
government does how to spend taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation now where the government is going to start 
to spend this money away. I would argue this is wrong headed. It 
is a much better approach to say to employers and employees “Why 
do we not allow you to run this fund?  Why do we not take this 
fund off budget?  Why do we not get workers and employers to 
decide between them which is the appropriate level of premiums to 
pay and what are the right benefits to pay”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately there will be a system where both parties will have 
their vested interests at the table and they will come up with a 
compromise that will somehow suit both parties.  That system is 
in place in other countries so we think it is a very plausible 
way to go. We would argue that if we did that we would have a 
fund that would actually be there for people when they need to 
draw upon it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends would say that in the past the government has 
honoured its IOUs.  Fair enough.  But in this case, if we go into 
a recession in the next couple of months, if as an example the 
economy suddenly turned down because the Asian crisis hits Canada 
in a hard way, we would be in the situation that because the 
government did not prudently set aside the $15 billion, we would 
have to go $15 billion into the hole.  We would have to start 
running deficits once again.  That is the effect of not putting 
that money aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who would pay to get out of that deficit hole again?  It would 
be the workers and employers because as the government has done 
over the last four years, it would raise taxes to get out of the 
deficit.   We would see workers and employers paying twice to get 
out of the soup. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We argue that instead of perpetuating the myth that there is a 
fund, as my friend did a few minutes ago, why not be honest with 
Canadians?  Why not tell them that the money has been spent away? 
Why not resolve not to do it again by setting up a separate 
account, hiving it from the actual budget and letting employers 
and employees run the account themselves?  That would be a much 
better plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another issue associated with this.  The other day the 
finance minister was before the finance committee.  Regrettably I 
was unable to be there.  He spoke about the EI surplus and was 
asked some questions about it.  One thing he said which was 
rather strange was that cutting EI premiums would not create 
jobs.  I found that very strange.  When the government cut EI 
premiums by so very little a few months ago, it issued a press 
release in which it said that cutting EI premiums would create 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which way is it?  Does the finance minister believe that cutting 
EI premiums will create jobs as he said a couple of months ago, 
or is he saying now that it will not, as he said on Thursday? 
The government should make up its mind.  One day it will create 
jobs, the next day it will not create jobs.  The finance minister 
better talk to some of the people in his own department and get 
it straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to see some cuts to EI premiums. 
I think they have made that very clear.  We know the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business has been after the government 
for years.  We know that the Reform Party has been after the 
government for years.  We ran in the election campaign on 
lowering EI premiums.  The finance minister had better get his 
act together and quit trying to engage in this type of 
doublespeak where he tells what he thinks they want to hear at 
different times.

quit perpetuating this myth, as my friend from Prince Edward 
Island did a couple of minutes ago, and start to give Canadians 
the honest truth.  Only then when we have the complete truth will 
we all be able to sit down together like adults and solve these 
problems.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I find it 
somewhat ironic that the member would stand today after a very 
successful convention in London where it was decided to reform 
the party into change.  Obviously the old Reform Party which has 
been around for 10 years was not working very well so now it is 
in the process of changing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on that I want to get the new Reform Party on record on 
where it stands on this issue.  The member wants to know whether 
there is such a thing as an EI account. We know there is an EI 
account because we know by law that this fund is set up to help 
unemployed workers through active measures, benefits and a 
combination of income support when people are laid off.  There 
are also some active measures to help people find jobs because 
the economy is changing very rapidly and those changes were 
needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most economists on Bay Street say the number one choice in 
making cuts to put more money in people's pockets is to cut 
personal income tax, not to cut EI premiums.  EI premiums have a 
very limited effect and the majority, except for one NDP 
economist in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, suggested that premium 
cuts are the way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the government has cut premiums substantially, they 
were rising to $3.30 under the Tories, they are now down to 
$2.70.  The government is on target to reduce premiums more this 
year.  I want the member to be aware of two things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an independent commission that does review it.  It has 
representatives of labour and employers.  It makes 
recommendations to the minister of human resources and to the 
Minister of Finance.  The member was incorrect in that. There is 
such a commission today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which is the new Reform Party's position on this issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, I point out to the 
member that the Reform Party has done fairly well.  It did 
displace eight Liberals in the west in the last election.  The 
old Reform Party functioned fairly effectively as well as the new 
Reform Party does, as the member puts it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is safe to say Reformers believe very strongly that we need 
to reduce EI premiums.  That was part of our election platform in 
the 1997 election.  We also point out the government should hold 
the line on spending instead of engaging in $11 billion in new 
spending initiatives and cooking the books to try to run up a big 
surplus.  If it would hold the line it would find it would have 
ample money to both reduce EI premiums and reduce personal income 
taxes and to start the process of paying down Canada's behemoth 
debt of $583 billion. Being a little disciplined opens up a world 
of options for the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the member talked 
about the EI fund being a myth.  He cannot have it both ways. 
On one hand the member says the fund does not exist and on the 
other he says the government will defend it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of government spending on this EI fund for the benefit 
of future employment, what is the member's view on the 
re-employment measures and the active measures and the millions 
of dollars we are spending to get people back to work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my friend 
across the way for the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course there is a line somewhere in the budget that says 
employment insurance account, but it is empty.  My friend knows 
it.  It is the actual account itself, the money in it, that is 
the myth.  There is no money there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend suggested there are various types of programs. I think 
he called them partnerships and strategies.  I think sometimes 
the strategies are tragedies because we know very well that after 
30 years of all types of strategies and partnerships and all 
kinds of programs unemployment is chronic in many parts of the 
country. We know in Atlantic Canada we have unemployment in some 
cases of 20%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply ask in return how well have these worked, all these 
strategies and partnerships that have left us with 20% 
unemployment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to express my support for the motion moved by the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, castigating the 
government: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—for the catastrophic effects of its reforms to unemployment 
insurance; for having taken over funds destined for unemployed 
persons; and for its inability to adapt the unemployment 
insurance system to the new realities of the labour market, 
particularly where young people, women, and self-employed persons 
are concerned. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI reforms are proof that the Liberal government is not 
listening to the Canadian people. Overly stringent eligibility 
criteria have condemned thousands of unemployed workers to 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague across the way boasted that now a woman working 14 
hours in an industry qualifies for EI.  But he kept quiet about 
the fact that fewer than 40% of workers are now eligible.  That 
was not mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did not mention that my predecessor, Doug Young, won the 
election by saying that the changes made by the Conservatives 
had been a disaster for New Brunswick.  Today, New Brunswick's 
premier, Camille Thériault, says that the province lost over 
$125 million annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals proudly tell us that they do want to encourage 
young people to go on EI.  The fact of the matter is that, 
instead of EI, the young people in my region are now turning to 
welfare, with benefits at $200 a month.  That is the reality in 
my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Countless times, I have invited the Minister of Human Resources 
Development to come and see our young people.  He has always 
declined.  Over and over, New Brunswick's Liberal ministers, 
Camille H. Thériault, Jean-Camille DeGrâce and Bernard Thériault, 
have denounced the federal government for taking money out of 
workers' pockets.  They are all from the same party, all 
Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overly tough EI eligibility criteria have driven thousands of 
workers into poverty.  Fewer than 40% of this country's 
unemployed workers are drawing benefits right now. 
This means that, in April 1998, almost 780,000 unemployed 
workers were denied access to their own program.  It is there 
for them, not to help the Minister of Finance pay down the debt. 
He has no claim on it whatsoever.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was sorry this morning when I realized that the Liberal member 
from PEI still has not got the message from Atlantic Canada; he 
may be the next one to be shown the door, because in Nova Scotia 
they got rid of all the Liberals, while in New Brunswick they 
dumped some senior ministers such as Doug Young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals must see the reality that prevails in the Atlantic 
provinces, the Gaspé Peninsula, northern Manitoba, northern 
Ontario and northern Alberta. They must see what is really going 
on in the country. We have a job problem. The government will 
not solve it by punishing families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals were canvassing during the election campaign, 
they did not tell people “We will make families suffer”. This is 
not what they said. 
Perhaps the members opposite who are laughing do so because they 
do not have in their ridings people who are starving and who 
shoot themselves in the head. They say we must not scare people. 
But this is what goes on in our ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals may laugh all they want, but this is the reality 
they created in this country. They took a measure which they had 
opposed when the Conservatives were in office. Indeed, when the 
Conservatives formed the government, the Liberals were telling 
Canadians from coast to coast that all these changes to the 
employment insurance program would be disastrous for workers. 
Now, they have the nerve to come and tell the public “We are 
lowering the debt”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member referred to the 400,000 people who got help, but 
there are 780,000 who no longer qualify. How can he have the 
nerve to rise in this House and say such things? This is 
absolutely shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some workers are being told “We will take money out of your 
contributions so that when you do not have a job, you can get 
one”. Then, there are employers who fire employees for 
absolutely no reason and these employees do not qualify for 
employment insurance even though they have contributed for 
years. How can the hon. member claim that this is a good 
program? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Liberal member from Prince Edward Island, in 
Atlantic Canada, dare talk the way he did this morning? This is 
truly shameful. He should pack his things and go home. I am 
convinced he will when the next election is held. People in 
Atlantic Canada and in Kapuskasing who elected Liberals will not 
forget. 
Their problems are the same. Nobody is begging not to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own area, companies that set up shop and needed, say, 200 
workers got thousands of applications. How can the government 
turn around and suggest employment insurance makes people 
dependent? How dare it say things like that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really is a shame that the government should take the 
workers' money through the back door to pay down the debt. It 
should be ashamed to use their money to balance the budget. This 
is shameful. And the only thing our Reform Party friends can 
think of is lowering the contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never seen workers take to the streets to demand lower 
contributions. 
But I did see workers, unemployed people along with priests and 
bishops in the streets condemning the federal government because 
what it is doing is wrong. I did see the whole community in the 
streets during the election campaign, on May 2, 1997, when 5,000 
people stood in front of the UI office in Bathurst with priests 
and bishops with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We even had priests telling the faithful in their churches they 
should participate in these demonstrations because it was their 
duty and our families are suffering. These demonstrations did 
occur. What the federal government is doing with the employment 
insurance is shameful and totally unacceptable. And then it has 
the gall to tell us the opposition is short of ideas and  is not 
talking about jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I keep talking about jobs every day. I keep telling the federal 
government, which is responsible for this, that we should keep 
our fish and process and reprocess it ourselves. 
I keep saying that we should process and reprocess our wood 
locally. 
Every day I say that we should process and reprocess our 
blueberries, to make jams or other products.

stand and say how nice the government is toward workers. This is 
a real shame.

by human beings to whom they cause hardship every day: women, 
children, fathers, entire families are suffering. 
The Liberals should be ashamed and should not even stand to ask 
questions, because they have doomed Canadians to poverty. This 
is what they have done. My colleague from Prince Edward Island

not know where his roots are.

Acadie—Bathurst on his speech. He described what life is really 
for the people in theirs regions. I congratulate him 
particularly because the Liberal majority wanted to blame this 
on us, to make it an issue concerning sovereignists, separatists 
who do not believe in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the case. This is a matter of social justice and 
that is what it is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In support of what he said, I will read from a letter dated 
February 17, 1993. I will read you one paragraph and let you 
guess who signed this letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, it is unacceptable for the people of Canada to 
continue in this disastrous direction and further penalize the 
victims of this recession. Things will change after the people 
have had a chance to vote in the 1993 election. 
I am sure that a new team with new approaches and directions 
will help Canadians regain the confidence and hope they have 
lost because of the present government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This statement was made with respect to the Conservative 
employment insurance bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who signed this letter? Who said it was unacceptable and things 
would change after the election? The current Prime Minister of 
Canada. This letter exists. It is available. It confirms what 
the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not a fact that the federal government unilaterally 
decided to break the agreement between source and manufacturing 
regions in Quebec and Canada? Some sort of an agreement had been 
in place for more than 25 or 30 years. 
Source regions supplied primary resources and the philosophy was 
to provide an employment insurance plan ensuring a good income 
the rest of the year because it helped create jobs, 
manufacturing jobs, year round in larger centres. All workers 
understood the need for this kind of solidarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With its successive EI reforms limiting duration of payments and 
eligibility, did the Liberal government not call into question 
this agreement between all regions of Quebec and Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Madam Speaker, as my colleague has just 
mentioned in quoting the letter, my predecessor, Doug Young, did 
the same thing to Inkerman, New Brunswick, before 1993.  He told 
700 people in a room there “If you elect me, I will fight on 
your behalf.  I will fight on your behalf for employment 
insurance, because otherwise it will be disastrous for New 
Brunswick”.  He sounded like the current Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You must understand that people at home do not want to be on 
employment insurance.  They want to work.  But what happens? 
With the cuts to EI, people stop receiving benefits in January 
and end up in the so-called black hole.  They get $165 a week 
before taxes, which amounts to $135.  No one on the other side 
of the House can live on so little. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague on the other side of the House who is shouting 
should have been here earlier to hear my speech.  He should be 
ashamed to be in this House.

rewarded him with $6 million for the highway between Fredericton

are bragging about.

Doug Young in Ottawa” He said “I need Doug Young in Ottawa” To 
do what?  To make cuts like those he made in transport, 
employment insurance and national defence.  That is what we were 
left with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At home the jobs are seasonal, whereas in the rest of the 
country there is much more manufacturing.  However, if they 
decided to set up some plants in our region today, 
I challenge my colleague opposite from Prince Edward Island to 
tell us whether our people are lazy and do-nothings, as our 
colleague Doug Young has described them.  Let him stand up and

very important issue that we have been debating from day one in 
committee and in the House of Commons. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before the House today is very important for the 
regions affected.  I listened carefully to my colleague from 
Acadie—Bathurst, who said what people are feeling. It is 
interesting to see the effect of his speech in the House, 
because people's feelings are just as he described. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to comment on the motion moved by the member 
for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I moved a motion at the human resources committee's first 
meeting on October 21, 1997. I moved that the committee review 
the changes made to the unemployment insurance program to assess 
their impact on Canadians and make recommendations to the 
government on how to make the EI program fairer for all workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the support of every opposition party and even some 
government members. My motion was defeated by six votes to five. 
It was very close. On the government side there are also some 
concerns. People are suffering. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why I brought this motion so early into committee after 
elections at the first committee is because it was urgent. People 
in Atlantic Canada and some other regions of Canada through the 
reform to the unemployment insurance act are suffering.  It is 
not that we want employment insurance.  People want to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal reform to EI has created much hardship among 
Canadians who are most in need, who are unable to defend 
themselves. That is why they elected us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw on June 2 what Atlantic Canadians said.  I think it was 
very clear.  They elected mostly Tories in New Brunswick.  There 
are not very many Liberals I do not think.  I heard comments from 
the hon. member from P.E.I. a while ago.  I am really surprised 
that it is coming from Atlantic Canada.  I am sure that he has 
citizens in his riding who are suffering from the employment 
insurance reform. 
I hope they heard what he said and I hope they remember what he 
said.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to come up with a strategy.  Our party has been lobbying 
from day one to reduce EI premiums.  That is a solution for job 
creation.  These people do not want unemployment.  They want 
jobs. One of the problems is that there are barriers to job 
creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>EI premiums are a tax on jobs.  We have been asking questions of 
the finance minister since day one.  I believe it was my first 
question in the House of Commons.  We called the Liberals 
pickpockets.  It was not considered unparliamentary after it was 
analysed.  This is a way to create jobs and to get people off 
unemployment and off welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said a while ago that if people are not on 
unemployment they will find jobs.  In some regions of Canada they 
are on welfare.  Believe me, that is not too appetising when we 
consider the fact that in order to get a job in today's economy 
one must have a good education.  In order to get a good education 
one has to have money.  If people do not have money they cannot 
get a good education and they will not get a job.  These people 
are behind the eight-ball and will be there for a while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada has been calling 
for the federal government to reduce EI premiums from $2.70 to $2 
per $100 of insurable earnings.  We have been saying that since 
day one.  Even the government's chief actuary agrees that the EI 
fund would maintain a sustainable surplus with the kind of EI 
premium cuts that we are proposing.  If the government does not 
take our word for it, it can at least take the word of the chief 
actuary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Independent Business has long opposed 
the government's tax grab on the EI surplus.  The Minister of 
Finance points smugly to what he likes to describe as a happy 
economy.  In that happy economy is some facts he chooses not to 
mention. I will mention a few he does not wish to mention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Per capita personal income is down after inflation and taxes are 
taken into account.  We do not hear anything about that.  The 
number of Canadians living below the poverty line has risen under 
the Liberals.  Those living below the poverty line are in a 
deeper hole than in 1993.  We do not hear the government bragging 
about that.  Canadians are saving less of their take home pay 
while taking on more debt.  Once again, we do not hear the 
government bragging about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear government members saying that the Tories were there 
before and it was over $3.  It is a broken record.  It is 
certainly not helping today's citizens.  If I were to go back to 
1971 when Pierre Trudeau was here, what would it do for today's 
society?  It would not do anything.  It is certainly not 
creative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will be interested to hear that more Canadians went 
bankrupt last year than ever before.  We have not heard about 
that.  We do not hear the Minister of Finance stating that.  Some 
85,000 Canadians declared personal bankruptcy last year.  This is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to work.  They do not want EI.  Until we are able 
to remove the barriers to job creation we have to protect the 
people who are going through difficult periods, people with 
families.  It is our responsibility as legislators, as members of 
parliament, to protect all Canadians.  In times of trouble and in 
difficult times it is up to us to bring the issue to this floor 
and to protect them.  We must treat them equitably and fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at Atlantic Canada, we look at the fisheries and we 
look at the wood industry.  We have seasonal workers in Atlantic 
Canada.  The reform to the Employment Insurance Act is certainly 
not providing for them.  I wonder how government members would 
feel fishing on top of six feet of ice.   They just cannot do it.

unemployment. Their jobless rate is twice the national average.

youth unemployment is only part of the larger problem of 
joblessness in Canada, there will be no viable solution to deal 
with youth unemployment as long as there is no lasting economic 
growth and development. We have a lot to do before young 
Canadians can become full members of our society. This is also 
why I moved that motion then.

violation of an exclusive area of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know about his position concerning the hepatitis C victims. 
I will never forget the shame I read on the face of several of 
my colleagues opposite when they had to vote against sick 
people. Why? Because the Prime Minister had ordered them to do 
so. They were forced to vote against their own conscience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what about his reforms to employment insurance? I say “his 
reforms”, because every decision is made by his own office. Last 
week, my colleagues, and in particular the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, with experts and 
former recipients, considered the negative impact of the 
employment insurance, which has become the poverty insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty insurance for our young people: one young worker in four 
is eligible for benefits, while, in 1990, three young workers in 
four who paid employment insurance premiums were eligible. That 
is possibly what the Liberals call the new youth employment 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty insurance for pregnant women: several of them are no 
longer eligible. 
Nice way to promote the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty insurance for seasonal workers in areas such as 
construction, fishing, agriculture, truck crop harvesting and 
many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have tried to find something positive in this reform. I have 
looked again and again, but I have not found anything yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come to bring back on the right track the Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Finance, who are using the 
employment insurance fund surplus as they see fit without giving 
any consideration to the real needs of workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to add my voice to those of my colleagues from the 
Bloc Quebecois who are in touch with the people of Quebec and 
who are not afraid to stand up for the most disadvantaged in our 
society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am adding my voice to theirs in condemning the Liberal 
government for the disastrous effects of the unemployment 
insurance reform and for what Ontario Premier Mike Harris has 
called theft, speaking about the use of the employment insurance 
fund surplus that comes from contributions paid by employers and 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois also condemns the federal Liberals, namely 
the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and those who hold 
the power in this increasingly centralizing government, for 
their inability to adapt the employment insurance program to the 
new realities of our society, particularly with regard to young 
people, women and independent workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about another problem stemming from this 
infamous reform, namely the fact that the Department of Human 
Resources Development has been fiddling with designated areas 
since the 1996 reform. The changes that were made penalize the 
majority of rural and semi-urban areas in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take, for example, my riding of Lotbinière. With this 
geographic gymnastics, we end up with two regional unemployment 
rates: one at 6% and the other at 11.4%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In everyday life, this means that a worker who lives in 
Leclerville, in the Lotbinière RCM, where the unemployment rate 
is at 6%, has to work 700 hours to be eligible for 14 weeks of 
EI benefits, while another worker living a few kilometres away 
in Parisville, in the Bécancour RCM, an area where unemployment 
stands at 11.4%, has to work only 490 hours to get EI benefits 
for 22 weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Try explaining that to the unemployed. It is sheer nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mouvement des sans-emploi de Lotbinière has made numerous 
representations to the human resources development department, 
but nobody in this department could tell us who made the 
decision on these territorial divisions, and nobody could tell 
us either who could correct those mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the minister is no longer answering the information 
requests of local citizens. What is he waiting for? 
He is probably busy handing out the EI fund surplus to the 
Minister of Finance. That is the Liberal priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn now to the people, very often young people, who work 
on the family farm. Revenue Canada and the human resources 
development department take the position that, because of 
kinship, these workers are very often excluded from the plan, 
even when these jobs have all the elements on a standard 
contract and the employer would have to hire other people 
anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, a father should say to his son that if he wants 
to make sure he is eligible for EI insurance, he should work for 
some other farmer. Nonsense. Most of the time, these young 
people will take over from their parents on the farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, these people whose jobs are deemed uninsurable by 
Revenue Canada are being deprived of benefits and must often 
reimburse benefits that they received in previous years. This 
approach is unfair and infringes on people's freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, this form of discrimination against those who employ 
relatives forces owners of farm businesses, where the bulk of 
the work is often seasonal, to hire workers from outside, 
instead of their own children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity today to say to the human resources 
development minister that I am deeply disappointed with his 
department's decision to shut down the student labour office in 
Plessisville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This office, which had been in place for several years, was 
meeting the needs of young people from the regional county 
municipality of L'Érable. 
The government has explained to us that, this year, in order to 
reach students, it is posting available jobs on at least five 
sites in the municipality. As if posters could talk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But where will students have to go to be entitled to the same 
services that were offered last year in Plessisville? To 
Victoriaville, where everything has been centralized for the 
summer season. This is yet another nice way to get closer to the 
local people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we know why the regional directorate of the Department of 
Human Resources Development acted in this way. This department 
went through so many cuts that regional directorates are limited 
to offering minimal and essential services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his last report, the auditor general, when commenting on 
services offered by the Department of Human Resources 
Development, said that individualized services in this 
department would no longer be as efficient, given the 
significant cuts made in the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, what is the minister waiting for to respond to the urgent 
requests of the maple syrup producers who were hard hit by the 
ice storm in January? Where are the millions of dollars missing? 
This department is a shambles.

especially a lack of compassion on the employment insurance 
issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, based on 
the fact the member is a sovereignist or separatist and is very 
much interested in seeing his province separate from the rest of 
Canada, I want to get some advice from him and his party's 
position on the employment insurance system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance system takes premiums from employees 
and employers and redistributes that money in provinces that have 
high unemployment.  In Quebec they get more money than they put 
into the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Quebec were to separate it would be running a deficit in that 
account if it had to create its own system. Would it not be to 
his benefit to tell us what kind of system he would put in place 
to deal with an issue like that or if he believes in the EI 
system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question deals with the active measures, part two.  We 
transfer federal dollars under the EI system to the province of 
Quebec to operate part two of the EI system.  The understanding 
is this fund was a consensus in Quebec, was supported by all 
factions of Quebec, both the labour movement and the employers. 
Can the member tell me if he is in favour or opposed to part two 
of the EI system? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like the hon. member across the floor to know that when Quebec 
is entirely on its own to administer the revenue and other taxes 
it collects from Quebeckers, particularly the employment 
insurance that will be repatriated to Quebec, we will certainly 
have a far more efficient and far more humane way of using that 
surplus.  In Quebec, our attitude is far more social democratic 
than that of all the hon. members over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see this as very positive, because in their present system 
they are penalizing workers by forcing them to go on welfare for 
no logical reason. If we ever administer the employment 
insurance fund, it will be done in a far more humane way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that some situations, or economic contexts, are 
difficult as far as employment is concerned. 
People may lose their jobs, but they then need training, they 
need help, and then, if they cannot manage to find work, they 
can be prepared for going on welfare.  That is the humane way of 
doing things, and that is the way things will be done in a 
sovereign Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened with considerable interest to the hon. member 
opposite and I want him to respond to the following. As he and 
all members know, under the EI legislation $2 billion is 
available to the provinces and territories for active 
re-employment measures and related labour market services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These provisions provide unemployed Canadians, including youth 
and women, with improved skills and opportunities for employment. 
Employment insurance also helps women by increasing their earned 
income through a $50 minimum earnings exemption and by removing 
the artificial 15 hour ceiling on part time work and through 
employment benefits such as wage subsidies and earnings 
supplement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would the member have against those two moves? 
On the one hand we have money being given over to the provinces 
and the territories and on the other we have assistance for 
women.  What exactly does he have against those two ideas?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to tell the 
hon. member across the floor, first of all, that the money comes 
from the provinces.  The money is collected from taxpayers 
living in all of the provinces of Canada.  That is the money the 
government is trying to administer in the employment insurance 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will see that, in Quebec, we are going to do things 
properly, because an agreement has been signed, not long ago, on 
manpower training. 
Judging by the way Minister Louise Harel and her colleagues in 
the National Assembly are preparing this program, I am sure that 
training will be far more appropriate and far more responsive to 
the needs of the community, because it will be in the hands of 
the Quebec government, and in the hands of the governments of 
the other provinces.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
cannot help but notice this morning, during the debate on a 
motion put forward by my colleague from 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, that the 
arrogance and cynicism shown last week by the Minister of 
Finance and also the Minister of Human Resources Development are 
contagious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Malpeque, in Prince Edward Island, and the 
hon. member for Kenora—Rainy River, in Manitoba, were laughing at 
us, making disparaging remarks while we were delivering our 
speeches, while we were talking about the poverty created 
entirely by the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. Their smiles, their cynicism and their 
disparaging remarks make them unworthy of speaking on behalf of 
those they claim to represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening earlier to the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst, 
who defeated Doug Young. During question period and debates 
concerning employment insurance, Doug Young used to demonstrate 
the same pompous arrogance and cynicism and make the same 
disparaging, uncalled for and unparliamentary remarks as these 
members of parliament. My hon. colleague from Acadie—Bathurst 
defeated him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the same thing will happen to the members for Malpeque 
and Kenora—Rainy River. If their constituents are watching us, I 
want to tell them “Defeat them in the next election. Go to their 
riding offices and hold them accountable for their actions. Ask 
them why they laughed when we were talking about the poor, the 
unemployed and all the people left out of the employment 
insurance reforms. Voters from Malpeque and Kenora—Rainy River, 
go knock on the doors of these pompous members of Parliament who 
claim that the people in their ridings are quite satisfied with 
the employment insurance program. Go tell these cynics that it 
is not true. 
Go tell these sarcastic members they are not worthy of the seat 
they are occupying. They are no more worthy than the finance 
minister”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His not being here today will not stop me from mentioning that 
last week he appeared before the Standing Committee on Finance 
to present his analysis of the supplementary estimates. Do you 
think that given the excellent job by the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques we were going to 
stick to the supplementary estimates? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about employment insurance and while I was presenting 
all the arguments against the Liberal reform implemented since 
1996, the finance minister did exactly the same thing as the 
members for Malpeque and Kenora—Rainy River. He was laughing at 
people's misery. He was laughing at the results of his policy. 
He was proudly boasting about his accomplishments as Minister of 
Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any dummy could have done what he did; it is easy to put your 
financial house in order when you choose two targets: students, 
who were hit with billions and billions of dollars in cuts to 
post-secondary education, and the unemployed, who were robbed 
year after year of $6 billion for a grand total of $19 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to my Liberal colleague for Malpeque, who makes fun 
of the unemployed and the underprivileged, saying that the EI 
fund does exist, but it does not really. What the finance 
minister has been doing for the past four years is basically 
this: he has been taking employee and employer contributions and 
putting them into his own pocket.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the time came to pay his debts to eliminate the deficit, he 
paid cash. That is why there is no money left in that fund. He 
stole it. At the end of the current fiscal year, he will have 
stolen $19 billion. Next year, it will be $25 billion, and that 
amount will continue to grow year after year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member is too thick-headed to know what is really going on 
with regard to employment insurance, he should not be here. He 
has no right to laugh about the terrible things that are 
happening in Canada, especially concerning the management of the 
employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is going on with regard to employment insurance? What is 
going on with regard to the job market? 
It is quite simple. Until the early 1990s, more than 80% of 
unemployed Canadians, including women and young people, were 
able to rely on a form of help called unemployment insurance. 
They could rely on that help for a certain amount of time, 
enough to relocate and to find another job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1996, since the reform brought in by the member for 
Lasalle—Émard and finance minister and by two successive human 
resources development ministers—the first being the one who was 
defeated by my colleague from Acadie—Bathurst and the second 
being the one whom it would be in our interest to defeat in the 
next election—, the proportion of employment insurance 
beneficiaries has shrunk almost by half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, only 42% of those who would normally qualify are eligible 
to receive benefits; less than half of those people, 42%, are 
now eligible because of the new requirements set by the Minister 
of Finance, by the Minister of Human Resources Development, in 
fact, by the Liberals. A lot of people no longer have access to 
employment insurance because of the reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are general figures. Only 42% of the unemployed qualify, 
which means the other 58% do not. More than half of those who 
are affected by the scourge of unemployment no longer qualify 
for EI benefits because of more stringent conditions and a 
longer qualifying period. In short, the unemployed have been 
thrown out on to the streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are telling us they want to help young people, but 
75% of all young workers who are unemployed, people who have 
graduated and are in their twenties, do not qualify for EI 
benefits. Some of them are less educated, but others have 
graduated and are out of work nonetheless. It can happen to 
anybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, the finance minister was quite proud to tell the 
finance committee that we may have a budget surplus next year, 
not a EI fund surplus, which we know about. He is making fun of 
us. 
He laughs at people right under their noses. He is cynical and 
sarcastic, as we saw this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his last budget, he told us there would be no surplus and no 
deficit for the next three years. He is laughing at us. If 
nothing changes, the budget surplus will be more than $20 
billion three years from now. He is cooking the books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was quite proud and he kept laughing when I told him that in 
1989, there were 400,000 fewer unemployed and $3 billion more in 
benefits being paid out. The finance minister was laughing this 
morning, and his colleagues too. His colleagues from Malpeque 
and Kenora—Rainy River laugh when we tell them we have 400,000 
more unemployed workers today and that they get $3 billion less 
in benefits. They find this very funny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, I asked the finance minister a question about this 
problem. I did not get any answer. I will ask my question again 
today. Perhaps, we never know, he is listening in a corner of 
his office, behind closed blinds because he does not want to 
meet anyone at this point. I have just one question for the 
finance minister: when he gets up in the morning and looks in 
the mirror, is he ashamed of himself? It is a real shame to have 
acted in such a way to put our financial house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two major sources: the Canadian social transfer, that 
is federal transfers to the provinces to fund welfare, 
post-secondary education and health care, and the employment 
insurance fund, into which the minister has been dipping, year 
after year. He puts the money in his pockets and when the time 
comes to sign a cheque, he uses the money he has taken from 
workers and employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister did not bother answering me. He did not 
because I am convinced that he now has doubts. If he does not 
have any doubts, there is a lack of intelligence somewhere.

</I></B></P><P align=left>But one cannot undertake a reform in this hurtful way and say 
with one's hand on one's heart: “But what is happening to 
Canada? Poverty has been on the rise for five years”. I should 
say so. There are more poor children than before. Why? There is 
no need to be a rocket scientist to know why. One cannot cut 
billions of dollars from the employment insurance fund and 
welfare and then expect to get away with it by saying “What is 
happening? There are more unemployed people than before”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the people responsible, the ones who are laughing this 
morning when they are shown the true face of poverty and 
unemployment. I hope that Quebeckers and Canadians will open 
their eyes and especially their ears wide. Such cynicism cannot 
go unchallenged.

attitude of a couple of members on this side of the House, myself 
included.  I hope Canadians listen to what we are saying and not 
the descriptions used by the member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House take very seriously the situation 
of the unemployed.  That is why we have tried to make 
improvements to the system.  The reality is that the system had 
to be changed to ensure it will be there in the future for the 
unemployed and the workers who need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member opposite suggesting that we take out the provision 
in the Employment Insurance Act that allows low income families 
with dependants to receive a higher benefit level than they did 
under the old legislation? Is he suggesting that we should do 
away with the hours based system?  This has brought 500,000 
people into the system who otherwise would not be entitled to 
benefits. Is he suggesting that we deny part time workers who 
work less than 15 hours a week?  Is he suggesting that we take 
them out of the system?  Two hundred and seventy thousand women 
benefit by that section of the legislation.  Is that what he is 
suggesting? Is he going to bury his head in the sand and go back 
to the old unemployment insurance system?  That system is an end 
run where people never try to maintain long term jobs.

fairness. Currently, everyone, without exception, contributes to 
the employment insurance program. This includes young people,

the program has been significantly reduced over the past 10 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before 1990, over 80% of unemployed workers were eligible for 
employment insurance. Now, only 42% qualify, and only one in

have equal rights and equal responsibilities; a Canada 
where there is equality for all and special status for no one; 
where a social safety net is there for those who need it and is 
not used as a dependent system; a Canada where justice is put 
back into the justice system and victims' rights are put first; 
where parliamentary institutions reflect the will of the people 
and not the political leadership of a party; where aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal people work together with equal rights to build a 
stronger future for all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government's purchasing rules say that whenever it 
buys anything costing more than $30,000 it has to go to 
competitive bidding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last winter, at a closed door cabinet meeting, this government 
decided to award a $2.85 billion contract to Bombardier without 
competitive bidding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What possible excuse does the Minister of Public Works have for 
awarding a contract of this size and complexity without a 
competitive bid? 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first, the contract went to a consortium 
that included Bombardier and other companies.  At the time it 
brought forward a proposal that was quite unique.  The proposal 
was such that no other competitor would have existed in this 
country.  There was absolutely no one else who could do something 
of this particular magnitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proceeded with the contract that will save some $200 million 
over 20 years in providing this service and 90% of the jobs that 
will be saved or created will be in western Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this contract is unique all right.  Let me show you how 
unique it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public Works' contracting guidelines expressly say that if the 
government is going to sole source a contract public notice must 
be given 14 days in advance of awarding the contract to give 
companies a chance to respond, to question or to express 
interest. In this case cabinet made a decision to bypass this 
rule and not advertise the procurement at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is in the ballpark of the Minister of Public Works.  Whose 
decision was it to bypass the regulations of his department?  Was 
it his decision? 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in addition to the fact that there was no 
other known competitor and that no other company could have 
matched a project of this magnitude, there was a timing problem. 
If we were going to be able to get other countries within NATO to 
become a part of this program, then a very timely decision had to 
be made.  Otherwise we would have lost any opportunity, if we had 
gone through a very lengthy process, where there would have been 
no other competitors in any event.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member seems to have a tough 
time understanding that no rules in fact were broken.  This was a 
government decision and it was the right decision to make in view 
of the timing.  Otherwise we would have lost the opportunity.  We 
would have had to close the base.  Would the member opposite like 
to have the base at Moose Jaw closed with the resulting loss of 
jobs in that area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have saved those jobs.  Ninety percent of $1 billion in 
industrial regional benefits will be in western Canada, with over 
5,000 person years of employment.  It is a good deal.  It is one 
in which the private sector will carry the risk and we will get 
training for our pilots.  It will amount to a saving of $200 
million over 20 years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the simple fact is that the 14 day requirement to 
publicly advertise a sole source contract was not kept.  If that 
rule was not kept, it could only be because of a decision by 
cabinet to override it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I will ask for the fourth time:  Was that decision the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me inform the House that this project was announced in

</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, in a 1988 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that a policy 
of making the French language predominant on commercial signs

better off working together with all Quebeckers, both French- and 
English-speaking. 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I

this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> I would therefore ask this government if, in 
any future court challenge involving the expenditure of public

grants to Alliance Quebec for this purpose.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for

Speaker, there are two sources of funding involved. First, there 
is the community component of the official languages support 
program, which benefits 90% of francophones outside Quebec. In 
this case, the Government of Canada could withdraw its grant 
should the mandate not be fulfilled. This remedy has never been 
used so far, but we have never ruled it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a court challenges program, but it is only for 
challenges concerning the Charter. It apparently does not apply 
to the president of Alliance Quebec, as he does not seem to 
understand that, on the contrary, the Charter safeguards the 
possibility of limiting access to English-speaking schools for as 
long as necessary to protect the French language in North 
America. 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, despite what 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs has just said, the new 
president of Alliance Quebec says he was assured by a Treasury 
Board official on the weekend that there would be no problem for 
the grant from Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this assurance, are we to understand that the case has in 
fact already been heard and that, regardless of Alliance 
Quebec's activities—including partition, which the minister did 
not mention, civil disobedience, and a court challenge of Bill 
101—the grant is in the bag? 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, just as the Government of Quebec does not cancel a 
grant to a sovereignist group that implies that the right to 
vote could be dependent on the French language, so the mere fact 
of electing a president does not mean the cancellation of a 
grant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this were the approach, all organizations in Canada, whether 
in the field of language or not, would rise up and ask what kind 
of world they were living in. 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister's 
answer is far from satisfactory.  I will give the minister 
another chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister think the Government of Canada should provide 
up to 90% of the funding of an organization that is proposing 
civil disobedience and the partition of Quebec?  Does he think 
that a 90% funding level is appropriate?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for

feel that regions wanting to remain within Canada should be 
allowed to do so.

passive measures, whereas the design and philosophy of our 
employment insurance plan is not to have people on employment 
insurance but to help them return to the labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we increased budgets for active measures in order to 
help them return to the labour force.  That is why we created

introduce Bill C-412, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (food 
expenses). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, very briefly the purpose of the bill is 
to allow people engaged in the bicycle courier business to deduct 
certain food expenses from their taxable income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment would allow recognition of the fact that couriers 
consume large amounts of extra fuel, so to speak, to perform 
their duties.  Those who use their cars for business purposes can 
deduct expenses under certain circumstances.  The bill is 
intended to extend such benefits to bicycle couriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy goal is to encourage greater use of bicycle couriers, 
given the health and environmental benefits of having fewer cars 
and more bicycles on our city streets.  This measure is also 
intended to encourage bicycle couriers to file tax returns, 
resulting in increased tax revenues for the federal government.

with reference to one existing road, to terminate any plans which 
would allow future tolls to be collected on the River Glade to 
Moncton portion of highway No. 2 in New Brunswick.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise today to speak to the motion before us. I 
believe it is important to set the record straight with regard 
to the Bloc's motion and the employment insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lately it has become obvious that the Bloc is living in the 
past. 
Instead of moving forward and looking for ways to help people 
escape unemployment and go back to work, the Bloc is still 
recommending ways for people to draw employment insurance as 
long as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc is still recommending ways to foster greater dependence 
on employment insurance while being critical of the new 
employment insurance plan designed to help people get back to 
work.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no interest in going back.  Our government and our 
reforms are about moving forward and helping Canadians meet the 
challenges of the 21st century.  The old EI system was in need of 
total overhaul.  The system was 25 years old and needed to be 
changed to adapt to today's labour market.  It was totally 
focused on passive income support.  It did nothing to help 
unemployed Canadians move toward work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new economy requires Canadians to constantly upgrade their 
skills and knowledge in order to be competitive in the world of 
work.  The new employment insurance system is precisely about 
finding a balance between giving people the temporary support 
they need when they lose a job and helping people with the tools 
they need to get back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We needed to reform employment insurance, to modernize the 
system, to make it fairer and more equitable, to break an ongoing 
cycle of dependence on employment insurance, to give unemployed 
Canadians access to programs that would help them get back to 
work and try to create jobs in areas of high unemployment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are convinced that, contrary to what Bloc members are saying, 
Canadians would rather work than receive employment insurance 
benefits. We believe they want to retrain to acquire the 
necessary skills to find employment in the new economy. We 
believe Canadians are more optimistic regarding their future 
than what the Bloc will ever say in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians' optimism, coupled with our budget policies, helps 
foster an economic climate favourable to job creation. Since 
1993, over 1.2 million new jobs have been created in Canada. 
Last year alone a further 450,000 Canadians found jobs in 
Canada. The unemployment rate is at its lowest in nearly eight 
years. In every province the number of people on welfare is 
down, including in Quebec where it is the lowest it has ever 
been in the past five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our review of the old unemployment insurance plan revealed a 
need for change in various areas. The old plan was based on 
weeks worked rather than hours. It was unfair. Whether you 
worked 15 hours or 60 hours a week did not make any difference. 
Your benefits were calculated according to the number of weeks 
you had worked. If you worked fewer than 15 hours a week, you 
were just not eligible for unemployment insurance. 
For thousands of workers, particularly women, this meant being 
trapped in a ghetto of 14 hour a week jobs because employers 
avoided paying EI premiums by giving them less than 15 hours of 
work every week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When these workers lost their jobs, they did not have access to 
income support or any other form of support to find another job. 
Now, for the first time, all part time workers are covered under 
the plan. Unemployment insurance was a passive income support 
system. However, a passive approach does not make people's lives 
better. It only maintains them in their current situation 
longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be a good thing for the opposition, but not for the many 
workers looking for help to find a new job, a better job, and 
not only for a cheque every two weeks. 
Our government chose to establish a plan designed to help 
workers prepare their future with optimism. That is why we came 
up with a series of active employment measures: to help people 
get back to work.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we have taken part of the savings generated by the 
employment insurance reform and reinvested them in measures that 
help people rejoin the workforce instead of maintaining them on 
employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are transferring $2.7 billion to the Quebec 
government, so that active employment measures designed to help 
people go back to work can be developed locally to meet local 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is because of this employment insurance reform that we were 
in a position to negotiate with the Quebec government a historic 
agreement on the development of the labour market. That 
agreement led to the solving of a difficult issue with the 
Quebec government, one that pleases everyone and shows that 
Canadian federalism is being modernized and is adjusting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to help people get back to work, we invested $300 
million in the transitional jobs fund. The purpose of that fund 
is to promote employment, specifically in very high unemployment 
regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We anticipate that this investment, made over a three year 
period, will ultimately result in the creation of 30,000 new 
jobs. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also felt that unemployment insurance encouraged dependence. 
The passive approach lured many Canadians into an ongoing cycle 
of short term jobs and unemployment insurance.  Worst of all, 
studies showed us that easy access to employment insurance often 
encouraged young people to leave school and start on a cycle of 
short term work and employment insurance.  Part of our changes 
had to be based on trying to break this cycle of dependence and 
to help people find and take available work. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have employment insurance reforms succeeded in helping 
Canadians? The Bloc should ask the woman in Sidney, Nova Scotia, 
who is working 14 hours per week in a departmental store. Under 
the former system, that woman would not have qualified, but now, 
after 30 weeks of work, she is eligible for benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc should also ask the young father from Trois-Rivières, 
who is working at three different jobs for 14 hours per week. 
Under the old system, none of these jobs would have qualified 
him, but that person can now collect benefits after 11 weeks of 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also put the same question to the young woman from the 
Cornwall area who, through our positive employment measures, 
received financial assistance to help her plan and set up her 
own business, after losing her job at the local office of a 
large insurance company. Her business, Excellent 
Secretarial Services, is doing very well indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to correct a misleading and incorrect 
statement the Bloc Quebecois keeps making about the negative 
impact of our employment insurance reforms on women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the Bloc members to tell us why they are against 
our employment insurance reforms, which eliminated the 14 hour 
trap for women. Around 270,000 women are now eligible for 
employment insurance for the first time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Close to 70% of those who are getting the new family income 
supplement are women who now qualify for this supplement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are more ambitious than the Bloc members. What we want is for 
workers, whether they are young people, women or experienced, to 
really be able to remain in the labour force. And should they 
lose their jobs, they will get from our system the tools and the 
means they need to get back to work, unlike the Bloc members who 
are simply trying to ensure the people stay on employment 
insurance benefits as long as possible. It is their only goal.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity, as brief as it 
is, to ask the hon. minister a question and put a comment or two 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seemed to me at least, unless I was getting the wrong 
impression, that he was bragging during his presentation about 
the 270,000 women who are now covered under EI for the first time 
with the changes brought forward by the government.  He was 
bragging about the new eligibility criteria.  He was quoting 
statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to a working mother in my riding I recently heard from. 
This lady works as a permanent part time employee with the school 
district as a bus driver.  Recently she had to take a six week 
medical leave of her duties and applied for medical benefits 
through employment insurance.  After waiting several weeks she 
finally received her cards to fill out. Shortly after a letter 
from HRDC arrived informing her she did not qualify for any 
benefits.  She did not have enough hours.  A claimant needs 700 
hours in a 52 week period and her total number of hours was only 
648. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her concern is, and I agree, that she is paying for insurance 
that she is ineligible to collect.  Legislation does not take 
into account consideration of this scenario and there are no 
exceptions to the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This woman is not alone.  I think these people see EI as simply 
another tax.  When some individuals call EI premiums a payroll 
tax, that is exactly what it is.  It is especially true when 
those individuals are ineligible to collect benefits.  To take 
those premiums off their pay, as small as it is, is unethical 
when they are in a situation where they have this additional tax, 
and it is simply a tax because they cannot get any benefits. We 
already have the highest tax in the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. minister would care to comment and refer 
his comments to the situation with this working mother and the 
fact that while on medical leave she was unable to get any 
benefits despite the fact that she pays her premiums like all 
other working Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased 
to see that the Reform Party is now hinting that maybe we should 
make it easier to give benefits to Canadians.  I do not know 
exactly what is the Reform position.  It is the first time I have 
heard such a statement from the Reform Party which normally 
thinks we are not tough enough on unemployed Canadians and that 
we should have even more difficult access to the employment 
insurance aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the woman he raised, she did not have the number 
of hours to qualify.  It is pretty obvious that if a worker has 
not reached the number of hours to be covered by the system at 
this stage, they cannot have unemployment benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When she has worked the additional 52 hours she needs to 
qualify, whether in this job or some other job, she will be 
covered by the employment insurance system because every hour 
counts and we will add it to what she has already worked.

Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Human Resources Development should

us the example of a woman from Sydney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try to be brief. In a region such as the Gaspé Peninsula, 
which is severely affected by TAGS, where active measures are 
sorely lacking, where nothing is being done and which is being 
deprived of $50 million because of reduced benefits and reduced 
eligibility, how does the minister think that people can find 
new jobs? Why can he not consider restoring some fairness in the 
system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from his leader. I will be very brief. The 
quote is from a letter sent in 1993 to a group called

measures put forward by the Conservatives as being very

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can assure you of one 
thing. Our government is sensitive to the concerns of these 
Canadians. The reason we have established a transitional jobs 
fund is to create jobs in areas where unemployment is too high. 
That is why we want to invest more money in high employment 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen that, so far, in Atlantic and eastern Canada, our 
reform has helped a lot of unemployed people find work to 
accumulate the additional number of weeks needed to maintain 
their level of benefits. I think this incentive to find work 
seems to be having positive results so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I believe the Minister of Human 
Resources misled the House when he spoke of the transitional 
jobs fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like all Canadians to take note that the fund—- 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. I think the hon. member is 
rising on a point of debate.  If there is a discrepancy between 
what the minister said and what the hon. member understood, that 
is not a point of order.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is both unfortunate and frustrating that the House is once 
again embroiled in a debate based on an outdated understanding of 
the employment insurance system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be no debate that the progressive and equitable 
reforms to employment insurance introduced by this government are 
good reforms.  They are good for Canadians out of work, good for 
the economy and good for the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians inherently know this and certainly the residents of my 
riding of Waterloo—Wellington know it and understand it, and 
this is in fact true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the new Employment Insurance Act this government is helping 
Canadians to find work.  Instead of just doling out cheques, we 
now respond to the real employment needs of people who have 
fallen on hard times and we tailor strategies to help them 
succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While our hon. colleagues on the opposite side of the Chamber 
seem stuck in a time warp, the so-called good old days when the 
system perpetuated dependency, we instead are moving forward, 
shifting the focus to one of dignity and self-sufficiency by 
creating meaningful opportunities for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new employment insurance system both reflects and responds 
to today's labour market.  Technological revolution and global 
trade are rapidly changing the world of work.  Jobs are 
disappearing in some sectors, while new positions are being 
created in others which require different skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Intense international competition is also pushing Canada to 
produce higher educated and higher skilled workers.  This new 
reality is very difficult for individuals who find themselves 
falling short of these requirements or who are already left 
behind.  That is why we are investing in programs that are more 
targeted, more results oriented and proven to work for the people 
who need them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new employment insurance system is designed to help 
unemployed Canadians not only cope with but capitalize on the new 
economy.  We are enabling individuals temporarily out of work to 
acquire the necessary skills to secure jobs in the new working 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are helping Canadians, especially those most at risk of 
exclusion, to adjust to the knowledge-based economy.  We are 
empowering them to adapt to economic change so they can once 
again lead productive and satisfying lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance reforms are fundamentally about finding a 
balance, about giving people the temporary support they need when 
they lose a job and providing people with the tools they need to 
get back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have to choose between economics and people.  Success 
is a question of making the right choices in order to build a 
better society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Societal development goes hand in hand with economic 
development. As our population becomes more productive, our 
country will be more productive.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An equally important benefit for all Canadians is that the new 
employment insurance system allows us to work more efficiently 
and less expensively, providing the public with the services they 
need and the services they can afford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Long term affordability of the system is at the heart of the 
reserve in the employment insurance account.  The government must 
pay employment insurance benefits in all circumstances, even when 
the account has a deficit, as it did during most of the 1980s and 
the early 1990s.  The reserve means that the money is there when 
it is most needed, during an economic downturn, and ensures that 
we do not have to raise premiums at the worst possible time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In modernizing the system we also make it fairer and more 
equitable.  For the first time, every hour of work counts. 
Counting total hours instead of meeting a minimum number of weeks 
makes it easier for most people, particularly women, young people 
and seasonal workers, to satisfy entrance requirements.  Whether 
we talk about the part time worker, the mother to be who will be 
able to collect maternity benefits, the construction worker laid 
off during the winter months or the student working as a 
department store clerk, employment insurance benefits have been 
restructured to strengthen the value of work.  The system now 
recognizes that whether work is full time, part time or 
integrated from time to time, every Canadian's contribution 
counts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the most important improvements are enhanced active 
employment measures that are helping countless unemployed 
Canadians get back into the workforce.  Wage subsidies, earning 
supplements, self-employment assistance, job creation 
partnerships and skills, loans and grants are giving many a real 
chance to start new careers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind my hon. colleagues that we have broadened eligibility 
so that all Canadians who received employment insurance or 
unemployment insurance in the past three years can benefit from 
these measures.  So too can people who collected maternity or 
parental benefits during the last five years and then withdrew 
from the labour force to care for their child.  This means that 
up to 45% of provincial social assistance recipients are eligible 
for active employment measures to get the skills and the 
experience they need in order to re-enter the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Improved claimant assistance such as counselling and closer case 
management will also help unemployed people return to work as 
quickly as possible.  That ultimately is what the changes are all 
about, helping Canadians to find and keep good jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The labour market development agreements with the provinces, 
long sought after by the province of Quebec, ensure that active 
employment measures are tailored to local needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc fails to acknowledge that these new measures, $2.7 
billion over the next five years in Quebec alone, are financed 
from savings the government is now achieving as a result of 
employment insurance reform.  Without these savings the 
government would not have the necessary funds to pay for skills 
upgrading which is essential to becoming more employable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not want a handout, they want a hand up.  They want 
the chance to acquire new skills and advance their education. 
They want to be able to provide a better standard of living and 
quality of life for their families.  We must enable them to 
achieve their dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would do no one any favours if we adopted the regressive 
measures proposed by my hon. colleagues.  They would have us 
return to the days of passive income support.  They would deny 
individuals the opportunity to upgrade their skills and make 
themselves more employable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point to the government's impressive track record as proof 
that our approach is working.  The unemployment rate is at its 
lowest level in almost eight years.  Since the beginning of 1997 
543,000 jobs have been created in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equally interesting, there was a 6% decline in job losses during 
the first year of reform.  So it is not surprising that the 
number of beneficiaries and the total employment insurance 
benefits paid out have decreased since March 1997.  Clearly we 
are on the right track, so let us stay on it and let us make sure 
we carry it forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to respond to the speech by my hon. colleague and to ask him a 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always react to categorical remarks and to accusations that 
the Bloc Quebecois is living in the past.  I believe we live in 
the present, but we do not share the current government's 
concept of what the present is. Allow me to explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up to this date, close to $16 billion have been collected in 
indirect taxes.  I call them indirect taxes because Canadians 
and Quebeckers pay provincial income tax, federal income tax, 
and both provincial and federal sales taxes, and then on their 
weekly paycheque another indirect tax is deducted, which adds up 
to $7 billion or $8 billion each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion consumers have had it with government taxes, and 
this one is an indirect tax. 
There is not even any provision for it in the government's 
books. It is sneakily collected from all workers and all 
employers, and it is years since this government has contributed 
to the fund.  Now it has taken upon itself to set the 
contribution rate as it pleases and to adjust this indirect tax 
to pay down its deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps my colleague could answer the following.  What is his 
answer to the voters in his riding when they say they are tired 
of paying taxes, taxes and more taxes, income and otherwise, and 
now just one more? What is his answer to this, particularly when 
we have already been told that in this government's employment 
enhancement measures a 10 cent reduction per $100 represents 
the creation of 30,000 jobs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not true, according to the way we see things. 
People are having problems with employment insurance, which is 
an indirect tax on people.  What is his answer to his 
constituents? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to say at the outset 
that there is a lot of evidence that we as a government can put 
forward in terms of the kinds of things we are doing for 
Canadians from coast to coast.  I reference specifically the 
programs that are in place to assist workers at a time when they 
need it most, which is most important.  I think Canadians across 
the country understand that and respect it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talks about being in the past.  I was doing some 
research into what the Bloc has recently introduced by way of 
private members' bills on this particular issue.  What those 
bills would do, in effect, would be to reverse the EI reforms 
that we as a government have put in place.  I would reference, 
for example, Bill C-295, Bill C-296, Bill C-297, Bill C-298 and 
Bill C-300. These five private members' bills would turn back the 
clock and reverse the kind of progressiveness that we as a 
government are ensuring is in place for all Canadians no matter 
where they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out to the hon. member that $2.7 billion over 
five years is going to Quebec alone in order to ensure that there 
are active employment measures in place.  That spells good news 
not only for Quebeckers, but for Canadians all across this great 
country of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a government are moving in the right direction with 
foresight, according to the needs of Canadians.

like to know is what stings a government when it comes into 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have here a letter from the Prime Minister sent to a region in 
Quebec, which says, and I will quote briefly from it, “Clearly 
the government is not very concerned about the victims of the 
economic crisis—he was talking about the Conservatives at the 
time—because instead of going after the heart of the problem, 
they go after the unemployed”.

so they could go after the unemployed too?  It is shameful.  I 
would like the hon. member to tell me what stung the Liberal 
members. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member 
opposite for the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am astounded at the fact that the NDP in this case would take 
us on in terms of what our position is.  It really has no 
financial credibility.  As members all know, that party's 
election platform, which was widely rejected by Canadians, 
proposed to spend an additional $18 billion in four years if it 
had been elected. It is the leader of the NDP who told Canadians 
that she never planned on forming a government, so I guess those 
kinds of outrageous statements can be made to try to rope the 
people in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people are not fooled by such nonsense.  Canadians have 
worked too hard to eliminate the deficit to allow their 
government to go on a free wheeling and irresponsible tax and 
spending spree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member opposite from the NDP makes those kinds of 
outrageous statements, it is incumbent upon those of us on the 
government side to ensure that that kind of nonsense is put in 
its place. It has no place in this great country of ours and as a 
government we will ensure that.

Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to join my colleagues, the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques and the 
member for Québec East, and to take part in the debate on the 
opposition motion they presented in this House, which reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the House castigate the government for the catastrophic 
effects of its reforms to unemployment insurance; for having 
taken over funds destined for unemployed persons; and for its 
inability to adapt the unemployment insurance system to the new 
realities of the labour market, particularly where young people, 
women and self-employed persons are concerned. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not yesterday that the Bloc Quebecois started criticizing 
the reforms to unemployment insurance and its devastating 
effects on the people of Quebec and Canada and more especially 
on groups of workers in vulnerable situations on the labour 
market, such as young people and women, who are being pushed 
into the maze of social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, the Bloc Quebecois initiated an employment insurance 
week to draw the government's attention to the experience of the 
unemployed in Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we might expect, the Liberal government again displayed its 
insensitivity to these groups of men and women, who, after 
contributing to the plan, are denied access to it when they need 
it most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the media did not ignore the questions raised by the 
Bloc Quebecois when it reminded us that only 41% of unemployed 
workers get benefits and that only 26% of young workers—one in 
four—who contribute to the plan end up getting benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of last week, we have seen and heard reports on television 
and on the radio highlighting the fact that the employment 
insurance plan is inadequate, given the conditions on the labour 
market. This is employment insurance in name only. We should 
rather be talking about a deficit insurance plan, because the 
government has had no qualms about diverting EI funds to erase 
the deficit first and now, with hardly any embarrassment, to 
build up budget surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole situation is utterly unacceptable, and groups all 
over Quebec are condemning the employment insurance plan and the 
government's policies that have thrown so many people into 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to stop this bleeding of public funds. The employment 
insurance should be redesigned to ensure a better balanced 
support for various groups of workers in Quebec and in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nothing short of shameful that the EI fund is bursting at 
the seams while the federal government has to admit the sorry 
state of poverty in Canada. In 1989, 14.5% of children lived in 
families below the poverty line. There are now 20.5%. There is a 
direct link between this and the finance minister's drastic cuts 
in social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government can try all it wants to counter through 
piecemeal programs the impact of poverty on children in Quebec 
and Canada, but it should first give the heads of single parent 
families better opportunities to enter the labour market and 
support them in between jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same for young Quebeckers and Canadians who hold 
precarious jobs, contract jobs for a few weeks or a few months. 
This is the reality of the workforce for several of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And to encourage them to accumulate this invaluable work 
experience that will allow them to apply for better paying and 
more stable jobs, the human resources development minister has 
found nothing better than to impose a minimum of 910 hours of 
work on these newcomers during their first year of employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what I could call an employment insurance welcome tax. 
Indeed, it is a welcome tax for new members in the workforce, 
workers who will be the foundation of our economy and who will 
ensure the existence of our social programs in the future. Is 
this not a situation that should be of concern? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is quite a gift from the Liberal government to our young 
people. 
On one side, it pushes them toward welfare and on the other, 
with red flags in hand, it claims to help these young people 
with the millennium scholarships slogan. Once again, Quebec's 
student group representatives came to say no to the Prime 
Minister and their speeches were eloquent, according to those 
who had the opportunity to listen to the RDI special program 
this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is more valuable than ever, given the 
arrogance of this government that pretends to be sensitive to 
the Canadian and Quebec people. Our clashing voice in this 
stagnant pool of Liberal members who are waiting for their 
leader's cue, even when their personal beliefs are at stake, is 
echoing the voice of Quebeckers who have been let down by this 
dominating and centralizing federal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the riding of Jonquière especially, my team and I have 
received many testimonies from people affected by the cuts in 
the employment insurance system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the situations experienced by my fellow citizens, there is 
the sad situation of several part time workers who used to be 
eligible for unemployment insurance and are now unable to 
accumulate the number of hours required in a 52 week period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal workers, especially construction workers in our region, 
are also greatly affected by the employment insurance reform. 
For these seasonal workers, it is almost impossible to 
accumulate the number of hours required to be eligible for 
employment insurance, because work periods in the construction 
field are limited and the reform encourages clandestine work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been told that some employers take advantage of the 
situation. They hire workers at a lower rate and do not pay any 
premium for these workers, which explains why about a hundred 
honest workers complain every week, because they are not 
eligible for employment insurance or welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other problems with section 17 of the employment insurance 
regulations have been brought to our attention. Some people who 
work for the same company but live in different regions, like 
the Chicoutimi—Jonquière area and northern Quebec, are being 
treated differently under the current employment insurance 
scheme.

that a resident of Alma could receive benefits during nine weeks 
more than a resident of Jonquière.

really “following this reform very closely in order to ensure 
that it continues to serve Canadians well”, I would invite him 
to take note of all the flaws the Bloc Quebecois has spotted in 
his reform of the employment insurance program.

ParticipAction. 
Let me encourage this organization to launch a new fitness 
program especially designed for the Liberal members, something 
to stimulate their brains and help them connect with today's 
reality, so they can notice the living conditions of the 
unemployed, since almost half of the contributors are no longer 
eligible for employment insurance benefits.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was very 
impressed by the speech of the hon. member for Jonquière. I know 
that she is an extremely hard working woman and that she is also 
very present in her riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What fascinates me most is the difference between the comments 
of the member for Jonquière and those of the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. My colleague referred to the 
insensitivity of the minister and of the Liberal members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if there are people in her riding who tell her that 
they have a hard time making ends meet at the end of the month, 
or that they used to qualify for a much better system that 
allowed them to make the transition to another job, whereas now 
they are pretty much left on their own. 
Because they are no longer eligible, these people end up on 
welfare, which means they have to rely on the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister continues to say “our government does not live in 
the past, but in the present”. This is another ill-conceived 
notion of the present. The minister says that they are taking 
active employment measures, that they are creating a 
transitional jobs fund. Incidentally, there is not one penny 
left in that fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is taking technocratic measures. I am sure the hon. 
member for Jonquière could provide us with examples of people 
who are in dire straits, people who, at the end of the month, 
have very little food left to put on the table, people who are 
overwhelmed by their situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member could elaborate on the insensitivity 
of that department, and compare it with the sensitivity she 
shows in her views and in her good work in the riding of 
Jonquière. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
asking me such an important question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who come to me in my riding are people who are no 
longer in the system. They do not qualify for employment 
insurance or for welfare. The lack of understanding on the part 
of this government for people who work hard is beyond me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My area has the highest rate of unemployment in Canada. It is 
nothing to be proud of. But I can tell you that people who come 
to me are people who have unstable jobs, who work 14, 15 or 16 
hours a week and do not accumulate enough hours to qualify for 
employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will certainly not get rich by working only a few hours at 
minimum wage. At the end of the day, their employment insurance 
cheque will not amount to much.

insurance reform does not take this into account. People are not 
treated with common sense as they should be.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder when the minister and his government are going to have 
the same common sense as ordinary people. The people in our area 
do not steal or cheat, they are hard working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I contribute to a health insurance plan, it means that when I 
am sick I am entitled to benefits. But people are paying 
employment insurance contributions and they cannot even benefit 
from them. They want protection against something they fear, 
protection that will help them get through tough times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But no. The minister opposite and his colleagues have decided 
that even if you contribute to an insurance plan, you cannot 
draw on it unless you meet some ironclad criteria. This is 
unacceptable; this is the reason why the Bloc Quebecois and the 
people in my area are denouncing these social iniquities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will give a brief historic overview. Just from 
the name of my riding, which includes the four RCMs in the Gaspé 
and the Magdalen Islands, it is obvious that we represent a 
large area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My region is a resource region where seasonal jobs represent 
more than one third of all jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of the minister opposite, there are 
approximately 12,000 seasonal jobs in the Gaspé and the Magdalen 
Islands, mainly in farming, fishing and forestry and the 
processing of these products, as well as the tourist industry, 
including lodging and food services. That pretty much describes 
our seasonal jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proportion of seasonal work in my region is three times that 
in the rest of Quebec. This means that, in the Gaspé and the 
Magdalen Islands, there are three times as many people on EI, 
10.7%, compared to the Quebec average of 3.9%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a labour market characterized by seasonal variations in 
employment, my riding was hard hit by the EI reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics from Human Resources Development Canada show that, 
since 1993, the number of EI recipients in my riding has dropped 
by 4,000, or one-third, but the number of jobs did not increase 
in the same proportion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the HRDC figures, changes to the employment 
insurance plan have reduced by $30 million the funds generated 
in my region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to seasonal jobs, there is a high proportion of part 
time jobs in the Gaspé Peninsula and the Magdalen Islands. In 
fact, 70% of local jobs are either part time or seasonal, 
compared with 46% in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But regions like the Gaspé and the Magdalen Islands are 
particularly hard hit by the tightening of eligibility criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the disastrous consequences of decisions made by the 
government opposite was that, as figures from the 1991 census 
showed, the average household income in the Gaspé was $34,800, 
compared with $40,800 in Quebec as a whole, a $6,000 difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1987 and 1995, we experienced a 15% drop in jobs in the 
Gaspé. These jobs have not been replaced, as shown by the growth 
in unemployment, which went from 16.4% in 1987, to 20.2% in 
1995, to 25.7% in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another disastrous consequence of the blind decisions made by 
the people over there is that the people are leaving. In the 
past 10 years, 7,300 people have left our region, a 7% drop in 
our population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With figures like these, we in the Gaspé and the Magdalen 
Islands have the dubious distinction of being possibly the 
poorest region in Canada.  It is not something we want to be 
known for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance program is a real catastrophe for 
regions where unemployment is rampant.  Only one in two jobless 
people is eligible.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would you buy life insurance if you had only a 50% chance of any 
death benefits being paid?  There is only one thing that is 
certain, Mr. Speaker, and that is that we are all going to die 
one day, but if we count on federal government coverage, our 
widows will not live very high off the hog. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance program is also catastrophic for 
regions with flourishing employment and a low unemployment rate. 
Employers and workers thought they were paying into insurance 
that would provide a measure of protection in case of job loss, 
but that is not the case.  The workers in those regions are 
directly funding federal programs they never asked for, and on 
which they were not consulted in the least. 
All the foregoing was just a bit of an overview of the situation 
in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues have spoken before me, but I would like to touch 
on the various measures presented by the Bloc Quebecois as 
private members' bills.  It would be nice if some of the hon. 
members over there, even those in government, would adopt them 
as their own and help them through.  I am talking about relaxing 
the eligibility criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has told us about a lady from Sydney who, much to 
her credit, worked 14 hours a week for 30 weeks.  But the 
minister is misleading the House in saying that the lady was not 
eligible for employment insurance before. This lady needs 910 
hours.  The minister does not know his multiplication tables, 
then, because in his example 14 times 30 is 420.  Strike 1 for 
the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has also told us just now that there is a transitional job 
creation fund. 
I dare him to rise in this House and tell us how much money is 
left in that fund. Not money that has already been committed, 
but money that is left to be spent. He said that the program 
will expire in 1999. How many projects can be submitted? Is 
there any money left, yes or no? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strike three: the same minister—and I hope he or his 
parliamentary secretary will have the courage to rise—told us 
that, as a second active job creation measure, he transferred 
$2.7 billion through administrative agreements with the province 
of Quebec. That is absolutely false on two points. The amount of 
$2.7 billion is not only for Quebec, but for Canada as a whole. 
The worst part is that they are thumbing their noses at us in 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless I am mistaken, in a memo that I have here regarding this 
$2.7 billion, the agreements provide that this money cannot be 
spent until 2002. The minister has knowingly misled the House on 
three points, which I have just mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Minister Saint Peter ever has to face Our Lord Jesus Christ, 
well I just told you that the cock crew three times. He misled 
the House three times, and that has to be rectified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If nobody rises on the other side in a few moments, I will take 
it as meaning that the members opposite are perfectly capable of 
saying anything they want but do not have the courage to right 
their wrongs. This is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like that the Prime Minister was there at the time, on 
the opposition side. 
I do not know if my colleagues read this letter in its entirety 
earlier, but it speaks volumes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter, signed by the member for Shawinigan, is dated 
February 17, 1993 and was sent to a group called Action-Chômage 
from Kamouraska. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I have to interrupt the member. He knows my 
knowledge of the French language is not perfect. I heard what he 
said and I inquired as to the English translation. He said that 
the minister has misled the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unparliamentary and I would ask the member to withdraw 
what he said, namely that the minister has misled the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the member will do this immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will withdraw these words if 
they are deemed unparliamentary, but could the clerks at the 
table suggest to the Chair and to me another way of describing 
what the minister has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have pointed out three statements in the minister's remarks 
that are incorrect. If this is unparliamentary, I am at a loss 
as to how this should be said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are always differences between members 
about what a member has said and what another member thinks he 
has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, the minister said something and the hon. member 
for Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok disagrees. They 
harbour different views. But it is obvious the minister did not 
do what the hon. member has accused him of doing, because there 
is a difference in opinion, and the hon. member was not 
convinced by the minister's arguments. 
The hon. member did not err, although the minister may have a 
different opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are differences like that all the time. It is the nature 
of debate in the House, but the hon. member cannot use 
unparliamentary terms to say that the minister did this or that. 
All members always want to speak the truth in the House, but the 
question of knowing what the truth is has been a matter for 
debate from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member can participate in the debate like all 
other members without using those words, and I thank him for 
withdrawing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank you, but if this is the 
new way of putting it, I have to say I profoundly disagree with 
the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nevertheless all to your credit, Mr. Speaker, that you 
picked up on my words, when I would have expected the minister 
to defend his honour himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close with a quote from the member for Shawinigan, who 
wrote the following to an Action-chômage group in February 1993. 
He said, about the Conservative government of the time, “Instead 
of going after the heart of the problem, they are going after 
the unemployed.  These measures will have troubling 
repercussions, because they discourage workers”. The current 
Prime Minister went on to say “When the people have an 
opportunity to speak in 1993, there will be a change in course. 
I am sure that a new team offering new approaches and policies 
will help Canadians recover the confidence and hope they lost 
with the present government”.  He was still talking about the 
Conservatives. The signature is that of the member for 
Shawinigan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to sing part of a famous 
song by Félix Leclerc, which goes like this: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the eve of election<BR> 
He'll call you his son<BR> 
The following day, a hundred to one<BR> 
Your name he will shun 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And that is exactly what happened.

<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I would 
like to congratulate my colleague from 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok for his presentation 
aimed at illustrating the problem we have in our region. In the 
Gaspé and the Acadian peninsulas, the problem is about the same.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my colleague whether he finds it acceptable for the 
present Prime Minister to accuse the former Conservative 
government as my predecessor, Doug Young, did by saying that 
this would be disastrous for New Brunswick. I would like to know 
what he thinks about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier to my colleague on the other side of the 
House, what happened to the Liberals between the time they were 
in opposition and the day they took office? Something happened 
to them, and the member, who has more experience than me, can 
perhaps explain this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for 
Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok may respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope that when you name my 
riding, my time is not shortened accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note, with my friend from Acadie—Bathurst, that this is 
deplorable. This may also be the reason why the people have lost 
confidence in politicians, because others who came before you 
and me did not keep their promises. They made all kinds of 
promises, they promised to look after their constituents' 
well-being but they did not deliver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1993 election, we told the people in Quebec that 
there was no difference between the Conservatives and the 
Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, I know you are very interested in the 
debate between the member for Acadie—Bathurst and myself, so I 
will address the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very regrettable, but the democratic system demands that 
we learn to live with the people across the way.  There is only 
one opportunity to get them to listen to reason and that is when 
there is an election.  In 1993, the Progressive Conservatives 
got a taste of it, and in 1997 the Liberals came close.  The 
hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst shook things up when he defeated 
Doug Young.  I did the same when I won Mr. Gagnon's seat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying is that it is up to the public to take action 
when the time comes.  Right now, if people want to see other 
amendments, they must continue to put pressure on their local 
MP.  And, with your leave, Mr. Speaker, I would urge all 
Canadians in the rest of Canada, in central and western Canada, 
to remember that the country to which they are so attached—it is 
perhaps sad that it is a sovereignist saying so, but I will say 
it anyway—owes its development to the east. 
The sun still rises in the east. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not yet learned how to gather strawberries in January 
and fish crab in February.  To everything there is a season, and 
we cannot change that.  The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
sets the periods during which we may fish.  It is not my fault 
if biology tells us that we cannot fish lobster for more than 10 
weeks in a given zone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what do we do with the fisher after that?  Do we send him to 
Montreal on a computer course?  If he became a good computer 
programmer, would he ever return to lobster fishing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of wanting to cut all the assistance programs, what 
steps have Fisheries and Oceans and Human Resources Development 
Canada taken with the provinces concerned to improve marketing 
of these species and see whether there are not other species 
that can be marketed at the same time, so as to increase the 
income of fishers, dockhands and plant workers?  We, too, would 
like not to need EI any more, but there is a difference between 
not needing it any more and starving.  It is frustrating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every weekend, I return to my riding, and what I find the most 
surprising today, here in the House, is that the public is still 
calm.  But I could not guarantee the physical safety of certain 
Liberal members across the way in the spots I visited again last 
weekend, because discontent is growing and it is palpable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin—Middlesex—London, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

the House that I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last comment from my hon. friend in the Bloc was that he 
cannot guarantee my safety in his riding because of the tension. 
This use of hyperbole, of gross exaggeration is so typical of 
when members of the Bloc Quebecois speak. It is ridiculous. 
We see this in its motion.  It talks about the catastrophic 
effects of the reforms that we have had in unemployment 
insurance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member, is it catastrophic that roughly one million 
more people are working today than were working in 1993?  Is it 
catastrophic that the unemployment rate has dropped from 11.2% to 
8.4% and is continuing to drop?  Is it catastrophic that our job 
creation numbers in the last four months have been outstanding? 
We have created more jobs on a percentage basis than has the 
United States.  Is it catastrophic that there were 171,000 new 
jobs in the first four months of 1998? Are these examples of the 
great catastrophe my friend in the Bloc Quebecois is talking 
about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it catastrophic that the OECD is forecasting the highest 
growth, 3.8% for Canada, of any of the countries in the G-7?  Is 
it catastrophic that inflation is at its lowest level in 30 
years?  When there is lower inflation we get lower interest rates 
and we get more investment by business. With more investment by 
business we get more jobs.  The jobs that we already have in our 
economy become more secure as businesses invest in new plant and 
equipment and make those jobs more sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it catastrophic that our deficit has dropped from $42 billion 
when we took office in 1993 to zero today, again putting more 
pressure on lowering interest rates and higher investments by 
firms? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final comment to my hon. friend about saying that the tension 
is so palpable that he cannot guarantee my safety in his riding, 
he should come to St. Thomas to see the new investments. He 
should come to see 1,000 new jobs coming out of investment by 
Magna corporation because of the upswing in the auto industry. He 
should come and see the new investment in a new truck plant by 
Freightliner which is a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz. Both those 
plants will be making products for the world. It represents a 
confidence in this country I wish my friend across the way and 
his colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois shared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Liberals will talk about the good news all day today 
and the people in the opposition will talk about the bad news. 
Clearly one thing is true, that we are better off as a country 
than we were in 1993.  That is why Canadians rewarded us with a 
second mandate and a majority government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, any examination of the unemployment insurance 
system today, or the employment insurance bill, should 
acknowledge that the benefits to unemployment ratio has dropped. 
It has dropped from roughly 80% sometime ago to 43%. That on the 
face of it suggests a problem.  We do have a surplus that is 
quite large.  Both those elements taken together should cause us 
to reflect some on the cuts we made to the EI system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without getting into it in some detail, I had a discussion with 
front line workers in my local Canada employment office on Friday. 
They thought that sick benefits needed to be looked at.  Right 
now the length of the term for people on sick benefits is 15 
weeks.  If we are going to make the system more generous we 
should expand the number of weeks available for sick benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point which was mentioned in the meeting was that we 
need to provide more support for unskilled workers.  If they get 
laid off from their job right now, the number of weeks on EI is 
calculated using a formula based on the number of weeks worked 
and the local unemployment level.  We need to identify people 
within the unemployed group who are in particular need of greater 
support. Maybe we could provide them with longer term income 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Older workers would also fit within this category.  It may make 
sense that we provide older workers with longer term income 
support. An article in Friday's Toronto <I>Star</I> reported that 
Statistics Canada had said, and which all of us probably know 
anyway, that older workers take longer to find jobs and are more 
likely to exhaust their benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we should take this time of dropping the EI ratio and the 
rising surplus to examine the whole issue of support we provide 
for older workers.  Perhaps that is an area that could have some 
tinkering or some extra benefits.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that comes up is the whole issue of dropping the 
EI premium rate.  The premium rate has to come down in a gradual 
and measured way.  The thing we want to avoid is taking premiums 
up when we enter the next recession, which none of us want to see 
come soon.  We all have to admit that the economy goes up and 
down. Eventually we are going to be in an economic downturn which 
would be the worst time to raise premium rates.  It makes sense 
to lower them only when we are confident that lowering them is 
somewhat permanent and can work its way through the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last three years the Government of Canada has dropped the 
employment insurance premiums paid by employees and employers by 
about $2.6 billion.  This year alone Canadians are paying $1.4 
billion less in EI premiums than they did last year.  They are 
paying less because the government has reduced the EI premium 
rate four times in the last four years, from $3.07 per $100 of 
earnings in 1994 to $2.70 this year.  This is the second largest 
reduction since the 1970s.  The downward trend began when the 
government took office and will continue as fiscal circumstances 
permit.  As premiums come down, it makes it easier to hire people 
and I think it is good news for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 EI premium rate was set by the employment insurance 
commission with the mandate given to it by the EI Act.  In making 
the announcement last November, the government said it had gone 
as far as it prudently could in lowering premiums at that time. 
The rate provides for a cumulative surplus at the end of 1998 in 
the range of $15 billion to $19 billion, depending on economic 
performance. Some of us would say that this huge surplus of $15 
billion to $19 billion is a catastrophe.  Let me tell the House 
what is a catastrophe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to 1993 we had a UI expense that had grown from roughly $8 
billion annually to about $18 billion annually. It was a social 
program that was fundamentally unsustainable and cried out for 
reform.  If we had not dealt with that problem the people who 
would have been hurt the worst would have been the unemployed 
themselves, because eventually the program would have collapsed 
on itself and we would have had no program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premium rate must also be set at a level that will ensure 
the EI account will have sufficient funds to pay benefits even 
during a recession.  The government wants to avoid raising 
premium rates if and when there is a downturn in the economy.  A 
major increase in EI premiums during such a time would be harmful 
to the economy and to Canadian workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians remember only too well what has happened in the past 
when the previous government lowered premiums one year when the 
times were good and raised them up the next year when times were 
bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the recession of the 1990s the account went into a $6 
billion deficit.  Major cuts to benefits and sharp premium rate 
increases were used to stop the account deficit from getting 
worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can all remember the bad old days when we were cutting 
benefits basically in the depths of the recession.  In effect the 
program acted as a destabilizer rather than an economic 
stabilizer.  That is exactly what we want to avoid in the future, 
keeping in mind the unpredictable nature of the business cycles. 
The experience of the last recession taught us a lesson and 
provides guidance for future decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current surplus makes prudent provisions against rate hikes 
in the event of unforeseen economic and global changes.  Being 
prudent now means we will not have to cut benefits and raise 
premiums when the unemployed premium paying workers and employers 
can least afford it. Being prudent means that we are prepared to 
respond to unpredictable shifts in the labour market. Being 
prudent also allows the government to address unemployment where 
it is most severe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rise in the EI surplus gives us a flexibility we did not 
have before. I would suggest that the hon. members from the Bloc 
not use such ridiculous terms as “catastrophe” and appreciate 
that the economy is in far better shape than when we took office

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>   Madam Speaker, 
I listened with interest to the member for 
Elgin—Middlesex—London talk about the EI fund and the money 
that was in there and how well the economy is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The discussion today about the $15 billion or $16 billion 
surplus in the EI fund reminded me a little bit about the famous 
Jim Carey, a Canadian of course who has done very well. 
In one of his movies, called “Dumb and Dumber”, they found a 
briefcase full of money.  They were in the process of returning 
it to a lady in Colorado Springs, travelling across the United 
States, and when they discovered what was in it they decided to 
borrow a bit to finance expenses along the way.  By the time they 
got there and returned it, it was full of IOUs.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That seems to me a good analogy to use for the EI surplus. 
Supposedly we have a surplus in the EI fund, but there is nothing 
there at all.  It is just a line entry in general revenue and 
there is nothing there.  The analogy I think is pretty good, 
“Dumb and Dumber”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks about how well the economy is doing.  We have 
an economy where we export a lot of product to the United States. 
Forty per cent of our GDP comes from exports.  But I notice in 
the last 30 some years that our unemployment rate has been about 
4% higher through good times and bad than that of the United 
States.  We can actually chart it.  In the 1980s we can see the 
4% spread.  In good times and in bad times it is always there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what the hon. member's explanation would be as to why 
Canada is in the position where it always has an unemployment 
rate which is 4% higher than the United States which is one of 
our major trading partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am delighted with the 
question that the hon. member has asked me.  I suggest that any 
understanding of basic economics would provide the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We provide more generous social programs.  We can walk down the 
main street of the city of Toronto and then walk down the main 
street of a city like Detroit and see the difference.  When my 
hon. friends were in London last weekend, if they had driven two 
hours and gone to the city of Detroit, down Michigan Avenue, they 
would have seen a host of differences between the way things are 
done in the United States and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  They all have jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson:</B>  They all have jobs, my friend is 
shouting across the way.  Then perhaps he could have taken two 
hours on the weekend and driven down Michigan Avenue.  He would 
have seen that they do not all have jobs.  A number of people are 
homeless.  A number of people are suffering.  There is an 
underclass in the United States which does not exist in this 
country.  Why?  Because we have more generous social programs. 
When people fall out of work they are not as desperate to find 
jobs.  They know they are not going to lose their health care 
benefits, at least under a Liberal government.  What would 
happen, God forbid, under a Reform government, who knows.  But 
they know they are not going to lose their health care benefits 
if they become unemployed.  They know there is a social program 
to take care of them for a while.  We have higher unemployment 
because we have better social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If hon. members would stop heckling and listen for a bit they 
would also have heard that in the last four months our economy, 
compared to the United States, has out performed the American 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  So why is there 4% more unemployment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson:</B>  There is 4% higher unemployment because 
we have better social programs.  When a person falls out of a job 
in Canada they are not faced with the same desperate problems as 
they are when they fall out of a job in the United States.  We 
are not prepared to tolerate the same things that the Americans 
tolerate.  We are not prepared to tolerate a permanent 
underclass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were prepared to tolerate a permanent underclass the way 
they do in the United States, we would have lower unemployment. 
If things are made more desperate, people will take jobs at low 
wages, even though they would prefer not to. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am going to strive mightily to focus my remarks 
through you.  I know that I sometimes tend to get into a dialogue 
with members across the way, but I will try to avoid that if I 
can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find what is going on here to be quite remarkable.  This is an 
attack on our success.  The normal tactic of an opposition party 
is to attack the failures, the shortcomings, the shortfalls.  The 
normal approach— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Attack the workers and the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Listen to the member from the NDP.  I 
am going to get to the NDP even though we are addressing the 
Bloc's motion.  I think the NDP's position in all of this should 
be aired publicly so that we can see exactly what its solutions 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is really an attack on the success of this government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT67"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT67"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1635

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we possibly be running a surplus when we have been 
reducing premiums?  The NDP would probably shout their solution, 
but the reality is because the economy has never been in better 
shape.  The reality is that unemployment has been reduced from 
11% to 8%.  In fact, as all members know, when this government 
took power in 1993 it inherited an unemployment insurance premium 
plan that was at $3.07 for every $100 of income.  Today it is 
down at $2.70.  We have reduced the premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does it work?  Premiums are reduced, which means there is 
lower revenue, but there is more of a surplus.  I think the 
equation is simple.  There has been a successful reform of 
unemployment insurance to make it employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not really consider employment insurance to be a social 
program.  I know it is referred to as that.  The NDP, of course, 
would say that we should just jack up the premiums.  That would 
put more of a burden on business which, at the end of the day, 
would cost jobs.  We all know that.  But I do not consider it to 
be a social program.  Welfare is a social program and an 
important one for people who need that assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could say that our health care system is a social program. 
But to me employment insurance is not unlike workers' 
compensation at the provincial level.  There is a premium and for 
that there is coverage.  It is more of a business plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this country if, through no fault of their own, a person 
loses their job, the company downsizes or it is seasonal 
employment, whatever the reason, this national government will 
stand behind them to help them survive and to help with 
retraining.  It is not done to the extent that the NDP would do 
it.  The NDP would just give everything away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I find interesting about this is that we are 
actually debating government policy in a motion put forward by 
the Bloc.  The wording is outrageous.  It tries to say that it is 
catastrophic.  It is just nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was sitting here thinking about Bloc members.  Why are they 
here?  Why are they in this place?  It is really quite amazing. 
They are putting forward issues on government policy when we all 
know why they are here.  They are here to tear the government 
apart.  They are here to tear the country apart.  That is why 
they are here.  That is their mandate.  That is their goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Beauharnois—Salaberry recently made a speech in 
the United States.  He explained the reason the Bloc wants to 
separate from what the Americans were saying is the greatest 
country in the world.  The Americans were having some difficulty 
understanding how a party which had been elected democratically 
to the House of Commons could actually be travelling around the 
world advocating the break-up of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans are pretty straightforward.  They are straight 
shooters.  It is pretty clear to them that they would not allow 
that in their government.  They would not allow that in their 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member was making a speech.  He said that the reason they 
want to separate from Canada is that they want to have a more 
democratic society.  Can you imagine a society more democratic 
than Canada, which would actually allow a party to be elected 
which is subversive and which wants to tear the country apart? 
How could we possibly get more democratic than that?  That is 
their agenda.  We know that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it interesting that the Bloc members would put forward a 
motion today that deals with an employment insurance fund which 
they do not want anything to do with anyway.  Or do they think 
they can separate from the country and still tap into a national 
employment insurance fund?  Maybe that is the game.  Maybe that 
is the thinking.  They can keep their national jobs if they 
separate from Canada.  It is truly amazing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This attack on the success of the government by a party that 
wants to destroy the country is sending a message to Canadians. 
Obviously the opposition parties are out of things to find the 
government at fault for, so now they are starting to attack the 
things the government does best.  What do they want? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say there is no surplus.  What did they say when there was 
a deficit?  They said that it was horrible.  Insurance premiums 
were too high and there was a deficit in the fund.  It was real 
then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a Reform member say that there is no money in the fund, 
that it is just a line entry.  When it was overdrawn there was 
sure as heck real money missing from the pot, so why can they not 
now admit that there is a surplus? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I use the analogy of “Dumb and Dumber”.  I think 
Reformers were making the sequel to “Dumb and Dumber” in London 
on the weekend.  I will leave it to the imagination of the House 
to determine who was dumb and who was dumber.  I will be 
anxiously awaiting the release of that wonderful new movie. 
Maybe one of the members opposite will play Jim Carey in the 
sequel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have compiled what I consider to be the top 10 facts 
concerning what this government has put into place and succeeded 
with in terms of employment insurance reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fact number one:  In 1997 premiums were cut by $1.4 billion. 
Since we have taken office the premiums have been cut by $4.5 
billion a year.  We have reduced premiums four times in the last 
four years, from a high of $3.07 per $100 of insurable earnings 
under the Tory government to $2.70.  It is even lower than the 
$2.80 forecast in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fact number two:  Last year this Liberal government under this 
Minister of Finance had the second largest reduction in 
employment insurance premiums in the history of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fact number three:  $2 billion is available to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fact number four:  69% of part time workers are women and under 
employment insurance approximately 270,000 women in part time 
jobs have their work insured for the first time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fact number five:  The 1998 budget contained a premium holiday 
for young Canadians between the ages of 18 and 24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fact number six:  This new measure builds upon the new hires 
program that ends in 1999.  All firms are eligible for this 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fact number seven:  These and other measures will save $1.4 
billion in payroll taxes for workers and businesses in 1998 
alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fact number eight:  The budget builds on the youth service 
Canada program currently funded at $50 million per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fact number nine:  It is true that EI revenues are important to 
achieving our fiscal targets, but employment insurance premiums 
are part of government revenues and benefits are part of 
government expenditures.  You cannot flip-flop and have it either 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fact number 10— 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Since many members wish to 
speak, in order to hear as many questions as possible, I will 
take two one-minute questions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint—Jean, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, first of 
all, I feel personally concerned by the remarks made by my 
colleague, who is asking members of the Bloc Quebecois what they 
are doing here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he think that the 22,000 voters in the riding of Saint-Jean 
who voted for me all did so by mistake? Democracy being what it 
is, 44 of our members were elected to this place and sent here 
by their constituents. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as democratic values are concerned, I think we must 
recognize that any decision made by the voters is the right 
decision. I wish the hon. member would not continually hassle us 
with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, he alluded to the nasty separatists bringing in a 
catastrophic motion. Is he suggesting that the premiers of 
Ontario—Mike Harris—of Alberta, of New Brunswick and of Nova 
Scotia, who would probably vote in favour of the motion before 
us if they were members of this House, area completely out of 
touch? Is he suggesting that they too are separatists? In my 
opinion, Mike Harris is not the biggest supporter of Quebec's 
sovereignty. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Harris could be called an 
anarchist, perhaps, not a separatist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To respond to the member, the final point that I could not make 
does respond.  The employment insurance commission and its 
actuary have recommended that the government maintain a 
substantial surplus in the fund to prevent the need to raise 
premiums in the event of a recession.  That 10th and final point 
is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure there were people who did not vote for the hon. 
gentleman and they should not be disenfranchised.  If they truly 
believe in democracy they should not have members travelling 
around the world under the guise of representing parliament 
telling people in other parts of the world that they want to 
separate so they could have a more democratic society.  That is 
absolutely outrageous. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault): </B>It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the 
hon. member for Charlotte, Hepatitis C. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the member talks about the good things the government has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the government came to power I was old enough to watch 
television and I remember that at that time the Liberals said 
they would get rid of the GST.  They never got rid of the GST. 
One Liberal member had to give her resignation and came back 
after an election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a letter from the Prime Minister dated February 17, 1993 
that states when the Conservatives were doing the changes to the 
EI it was a disaster.  It was taking from the working people and 
it was not morally right.  If he wanted to get elected in 1993 he 
would change all that.  Change how, by beating on the kids and 
the parents of this country?  That is how he did it.  That is how 
the government got rid of the deficit and balanced the budget. 
They are proud of that?  They should be ashamed of themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Madam Speaker, the NDP solution to 
everything in the world is simply to spend more.  “The myth that 
the solution to every problem is increased spending has been 
comprehensively dispelled under the Conservatives.  The level of 
public spending is no longer the best measure of the 
effectiveness of government action in the public interest”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member be surprised that the quote is from one of his 
gurus, the Hon. Prime Minister of Great Britain, Tony Blair, a 
Labour prime minister who has finally come around to realize that 
you do not solve all the problems in the world by throwing more 
money at them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the NDP would do.  That is what I saw them do in 
five years.  Talk about catastrophic, he should have been in the 
Ontario legislature under Bob Rae for five years.  I could show 
some catastrophes there.  That is their solution, spend more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not work anymore; a new reality.  You must run 
surpluses, pay your bills and build a better country.  That is 
what we are doing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, here 
we are again, another session of us giving the folks at home an 
update of what is happening in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To Henry and Martha in Rimbey, Alberta I say put your feet up on 
your chair and here we go. 
It is another lesson in what is happening with the EI fund. What 
it basically boils down to is a $15.7 billion surplus that is 
being collected by the finance minister.  People are probably 
asking themselves where it is going. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not actually being set up in an EI fund.  It is going 
toward general revenue, which means it is kind of being rolled 
along with everything else. Remember that Canada pension plan 
increase people are all feeling now. It is being rolled along 
with that as well.  It is all really part of a tax grab.  That is 
what it basically amounts to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people will not qualify for employment insurance out of 
this fund. One, they are collecting too much money to even 
reasonably be able to pay it out.  The other thing is that there 
are a lot of students who are paying into this fund who, because 
of the temporary nature of their work, will never qualify. Really 
it is amounting to a percentage tax on their income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask for unanimous consent for this motion to be votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Madam Speaker, basically what is 
happening is that there are students and part time workers who 
will never qualify for any benefits from the EI fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Self-employed people are not only paying the EI fund for an 
employee but because they are an employer, they are paying for 
being an employer as well.  Therefore it is double the amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they lose their job or if their business goes bankrupt or 
something happens they are never going to be able to collect on 
it.  In these cases it is a simple matter of a tax.  There is no 
linkage whatsoever to their employability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have heard mention today that this is basically a 
phantom account because it is going into general revenue.  It is 
a mythical account. It is as mythical as unicorns.  It is as 
mythical as leprechauns, as mythical as that pot of gold.  This 
is a pot of gold that the finance minister is hoarding.  He 
always says it is there, it is over the rainbow.  He says that if 
we ever run into trouble, it is going to be there for us. As a 
matter of fact, it is not.  There is no fund.  It is a joke.  It 
is a cruel joke on behalf of the finance minister to all us 
taxpayers.  It does not exist.  It is all being rolled in through 
general revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to appreciate the finance minister, the tax minister 
basically, for his humour on this.  He tries to humour us and 
twist it by saying he is not the one responsible, that it is 
actually the auditor general who is forcing him to put all this 
EI fund as it were into general revenue, that he would not want 
to do it.  He would not want to touch the idea with a 10 foot 
pole but the auditor general is the one to blame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if we buy that.  When the finance minister was in 
opposition he did not say payroll taxes were a problem for 
creating jobs.  He did not say they were an obstacle in creating 
jobs. He said they were a cancer on jobs. He said that payroll 
taxes kill jobs.  Now he sings a different tune.  He obviously 
has a different set of glasses on now and has the gall to stand 
in the House and say he is saving up his slush fund, which does 
not really exist anyhow, this pot of gold, for a rainy day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know when he was telling the truth, now or then, one 
of the times at least.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the EI surplus, the difference in the money that 
taxpayers put in and what was actually paid out, was $7.1 
billion.  Without the lowest interest rates in about 40 years and 
without the surplus in terms of employment insurance this 
government would not have a balanced budget.  It would not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government not come clean and make proper 
priorities?  Right now we have a government that is still 
continuing, while it is taxing every working Canadian with this 
employment insurance that is bringing in over $7 billion a year 
beyond what it pays out, to give money to corporate welfare. 
There are still profitable companies receiving grants and 
subsidies.  Bombardier was mentioned today in terms of a very 
lucrative contract it got because of contributions it made to the 
Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is continuing to spend close to $4 billion a year 
in foreign aid and on crown corporations like the CBC.  Yet it is 
going ahead and sapping this money out of jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some economists had some things to say about this.  A recent 
paper by Canadian economists Livio Di Matteo and Micheal Shannon 
found that for each one percentage point increase in payroll 
taxes it kills 44,400 jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the House and the finance minister, if he is watching, to 
dream with me.  For every single percentage point he could lower 
the payroll taxes, whether CPP or EI, he would be creating more 
than 44,000 jobs.  I ask him to please consider that and talk to 
that nasty auditor general who is forcing him to put all these 
funds toward the general revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just economists who are crying out about this.  Over 
the length of my speech I will go through a number of groups that 
have problems with what the finance minister is doing with this. 
Some of the premiers have problems with this.  Premier MacLellan 
of Nova Scotia has problems with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  A Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  That is right, a Liberal.  My goodness, 
imagine a fellow Liberal criticizing the EI situation. Premier 
Klein in Alberta, a Tory, is criticizing this.  The Premier of 
Ontario criticizing this.  I think many of the Liberals are 
elected in the province of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We noticed that all these people are saying we should have a cut 
in the EI premiums because it will create jobs.  Even the finance 
minister, once again a Liberal, the one who is making the 
decisions in this case, admitted when he was sitting over on the 
opposition side that cutting EI premiums creates jobs.  Does the 
finance minister remember that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Economist Dale Orr says the premiums could be reduced from $2.70 
to $1.85 and still cover the benefit costs.  That is now three 
economists, three premiers and the finance minister when he was 
in opposition.  It is starting to add up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on.  The Canadian Federation of Independent Business in 
a survey of 19,000 medium and small sized businesses in this 
country has come back with the results.  More than half of 
respondents said that if the finance minister cut the EI premiums 
they would be able to hire more workers.  I do not know who is a 
more credible source on job creation than the CFIB and 19,000 
small and medium sized businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up to this point we have had politicians and economists but we 
actually also have people who work for the government. The 
government's chief actuary believes we could cut it down from 
$2.70 to $2.00 and it would still provide a cushion of $10 
billion to $15 billion in the EI fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could anyone go against all these sources?  It is not just 
all these people.  We have a combination of all the opposition in 
the House of Commons and, just for the spice of life, Bob White 
with the Canadian Labour Congress.  If we have the Reform Party, 
the CFIB, Bob White of the Canadian Labour Congress, three 
premiers and other Liberals who are asking for a cut in the EI 
premium, how could anyone be against that?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go on with a few other comments to drive home a 
couple important points.  Alberta paid $1.86 billion into EI in 
1997.  Members are probably asking how much Alberta took out.  If 
we put in $1.86 billion, how much did Albertans draw upon?  It 
was $670 million.  If we do some quick math we come to the 
determination that it was in excess of $1 billion that Albertans 
paid in and never received anything back.  That includes training 
programs, by the way.  That is $1.19 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The labour force in Alberta comprises 1.513 million people. That 
amounts to $786.52 that Albertans could have had in their 
wallets. Let me repeat that $786.52 was what the finance minister 
took out of Albertans' wallets to put into his pot of gold scheme 
which he says the auditor general was forcing him to do, if we 
can believe that.  That is what Albertans could have had in their 
pockets as discretionary income to spend as they saw fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Albertans know that money in their wallets does a lot more than 
it does in the finance minister's wallet.  Let me say again that 
Albertans could have had $786.  That is what the finance minister 
is taking from Alberta workers.  Shame on him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us tally up some of the numbers.  Payroll taxes per employee 
in 1993 dollars but measured in 1966 were $803.  Today they are 
$3,272.  That is a big increase.  I do not know how any finance 
minister across the way could say he is doing a good job when 
payroll taxes have jumped like that.  Does the House remember the 
73% increase in the CPP? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I give notice that I am sharing my time with the 
member of parliament for Elk Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid it is 
already too late.  There are only seven minutes left in your 
speech.  You should have told the Chair about it before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Madam Speaker, here we go for seven 
minutes more in terms of this lesson on employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask a question for the folks at home.  If the finance 
minister kept up his practice of taking $7 billion a year more 
than he gives back, what would that amount to by the turn of the 
century?  It would be $26 billion.  The finance minister plans to 
take $26 billion more than what he is giving back in employment 
insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a big slush fund.  That is exactly what it is, 
unfortunately, because it is going into the general revenue fund. 
We will never see it coming back.  A lot of students will never 
be able to draw on it whatsoever. A lot of self-employed people 
will never be able to draw on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the amount of money the government is taking out of the 
province of Alberta with its younger demographic and its lower 
unemployment rates because of the Alberta advantage, there is no 
way we will ever see that amount of money coming back.  It just 
will not happen.  Let us face it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will this actually amount to?  The average taxpayer is 
paying $420 per year more than what he or she is getting out of 
the EI fund.  In Alberta, as I said, it was as much as $786 a 
year.  For every Canadian, if we average it out across the board, 
it is $420 the average Canadian is paying above and beyond what 
he or she is be able to collect in terms of programs, benefits, 
training or anything under this plan.  Shame on the finance 
minister for these types of numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One basic law of economics is that if we tax something we get 
less of it.  Thus taxing jobs means we will get less jobs and 
therefore will have higher unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the finance minister admits, as he did previously when he was 
sitting on this side of the House, that payroll taxes are a 
cancer on job creation, he must know—he certainly did back then 
unless he has forgotten—that by cutting the payroll tax he will 
be helping to create jobs. 
Once again I say that for every point we are able to decrease 
payroll taxes we create more than 44,000 jobs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go ahead and we figure out what has happened with the 
Canada pension plan, that being more than a four percentage point 
increase, and if we look at what we have in employment insurance 
where it is taking nearly a full point above and beyond what it 
should, that is five points right there that the Liberal 
government has put on job creation.  It has taken 200,000 jobs at 
the very minimum out of the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we argue with all the opposition parties and the unions? 
The Canadian Federation of Independent Business is arguing on 
behalf of job creators, the companies.  Economists across the 
board and even government bureaucrats are saying that these types 
of things should be addressed.  How can we possibly ignore that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only person who could ignore it is the finance minister who 
forgot his previous promises in previous statements and went 
ahead and took this money, along with the lowest interest rates 
in 40 years, and used it as an excuse to balance the budget.  He 
still allowed corporate welfare, money going to people overseas 
to fund dictators and some outrageous programs in the country. 
How could he do that?  I do not know how he justifies it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to bring home a little story from Alberta.  It is 
pertinent in this case.  Premier Ralph Klein of my province said 
that Canadian workers should be given a break and that the $5.7 
billion EI surplus should be used to lower premiums.  He got some 
agreement on that.  It was not just the premier who was saying 
it.  The representative of the Alberta Union of Provincial 
Employees, Dan McLennan, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly, we feel that the federal government could do a better 
job with EI— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just Bob White with the Canada Labour Congress.  Dan 
McLennan with the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees is 
agreeing that the federal government could do a better job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me run through the list one more time:  Bob White of the 
Canada Labour Congress, Dan McLennan of the Alberta Union of 
Provincial Employees, Premier MacLellan, Premier Klein, Premier 
Harris, the economists I have been quoting, all opposition 
parties, the finance minister when he was in opposition, and 
actual people within the government bureaucracy.  I do not know 
how the government can possibly justify any of these things.  It 
does not make any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will open it up now to allow some of my friends across the way 
to come forward with good questions as I know they will. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I never 
heard so much rubbish in my entire life.  This has to be the most 
regressive mathematics or antiquated theory I have ever heard in 
my entire life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it that they are asking?  Are they saying that if we 
were to charge retail taxes we should renovate supermarkets 
across the country?  Or, if we were to charge taxes on gasoline 
we should fix up the pumps, bridges and roads?  If we were to do 
this our government would not be able to function.  Society as a 
whole could not function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member and his party have to remember that if today we are 
charging for insurance policies we are not spending it because 
the economy is doing well.  What would happen if tomorrow the 
economic situation changed and we had a downturn in the economy? 
Is he saying that we should tell every employee in the country 
that we are sorry but the pot has run out of money because the 
Reform Party stood in the House of Commons and asked us to spend 
all the surplus we accumulated over the past three years during 
good times? 
Should we say that it is a bad time they will not be given 
anything at all?  What a depressing approach these guys have come 
up with.  It is absolutely terrible.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are complaining about the government trying to get its 
house in order when it comes to the insurance policy governing 
CPP, the insurance policy when people retire in the future.  They 
are telling us that we should not do that:  How dare we provide 
Canadians with the proper insurance policy so that if they want 
to retire in the future there will be a little money for them. 
They are saying it is terrible for the government to provide a 
proper policy and proper protection for the people of Canada in 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member telling the youth, people and workers of Canada 
that today the government should spend all the money it has in 
terms of surplus?  Is he telling Canadians who are working today 
that tomorrow if they do not have work and there is no more money 
left in what he is calling a pot, which is not a pot because it 
is general revenue, not to expect anything from the government? 
If that is the case he had better not stand up at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am going to put him down as questionable 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will tell the House what 
taxpayers expect.  They expect they will get that money back. 
They expect they will not overpay and that they are rightly owed 
what they deserve.  That means that the government should be 
giving that money back to them rather than taking it out of their 
pockets and that EI premiums should be cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can talk about regressive mathematics.  It is paying a half 
million dollars a year for every section 45 appeal to try to let 
a murderer walk free.  Regressive mathematics is giving money to 
crown corporations when they are cutting money in the Canada 
health and social transfer for education.  Regressive mathematics 
is sending money overseas and giving it as foreign aid and 
funding dictators when they are cutting money to the Canada 
health and social transfer for health care.  Regressive 
mathematics is giving out corporate welfare subsidies and grants 
to corporations when they are cutting seniors benefits and the 
old age security.  That is what is regressive mathematics, and 
the Liberals should be ashamed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a 
few comments as well as a question or two for my colleague.  I am 
intrigued with this idea of the surplus.  They keep saying that 
we have to have this surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have a surplus it means that the money will be 
accumulating somewhere.  The fact of the matter is that it is 
simply going into the general revenues of the government.  That 
is a fact.  We have it right from its documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very curious about the fact that the employers and 
employees are paying this money.  If it really were a surplus, if 
there really were a separate fund and even if they use it to 
reduce the indebtedness, should they, to be honest and fair to 
the employers and employees, use it as a loan from them to pay 
off other debts and attribute the interest? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not terribly good at math.  I just did it for 31 years. 
That is all.  If we have an accumulated surplus of $15 billion 
and we assume a nominal rate of 6%, it would provide $900 million 
in surplus, almost a billion dollars a year in interest alone. 
This is money that has been taken from employers and employees 
and applied toward the debt.  There is no accountability.  There 
is no answering for it at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my colleague to comment on that. I would also like 
him to comment a bit on something that is Reform Party policy. We 
would like to rationalize employment insurance funds and 
personalize them.  Again I have done a few calculations. 
If we take the maximum members are paying, employers and 
employees together, it comes to $210 a month over the year. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1715"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my colleague to take these numbers at face value and we 
can do the arithmetic together later. That money accumulates. If 
it were put into an individual fund it would give an incentive to 
an unemployed person to top up his or her income with as much 
part time employment as possible, whereas with the present scheme 
they get nothing.  It would also permit the person to look very 
hard for a job because he would be using his own money instead of 
somebody else's money when he is unemployed.  In the event that 
he is able to go through life without being unemployed, it could 
add to his retirement income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a nominal 6% if he were to pay for 10 years before asking for 
a benefit it could give him a benefit of $685 a week for a whole 
year, way more than we get under the present insurance plan.  But 
the money would be his besides. If he were to use it for 
retirement it could give a retirement benefit of $346 per week in 
perpetuity without ever touching the $300,000 which has been 
accumulated with interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That to me would be a very creative scheme to solve the 
unemployment insurance and also put a lot of money into the hands 
of the people who earned it instead of just having the government 
taking it away from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, those are some good ideas. I 
sit day in and day out on the human resources development 
committee that decides some of these things, or at least we like 
to pretend we do.  I think some of those ideas should be 
considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would be a system whereby people feel they have real 
ownership of their plan, where they know that the government is 
not going to abscond with the money and do with it as it pleases, 
a system whereby they have a real sense of ownership and a sense 
of pride and an ability to put more in if they like and an 
ability to have it roll over and become part of their retirement 
income.  I think those ideas are bang on.  I wish we could make 
the changes necessary to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see government members across the way who sit on the HRD 
committee as well.  I hope they give those ideas consideration. 
Money right now is going toward employment insurance. Students 
and some self-employed Canadians have no ability to collect on 
the fund. With the high premiums that are charged to everybody 
else there is little likelihood they are ever going to see back 
in a given province or a territory the type of money they have 
put into it.  If they had the ability to put that money into 
their own type of fund and therefore draw out what they needed 
when times are tough, whatever surplus was left, whether it is 
$300,000 or more, with they would be able to roll that over into 
a pension fund.  Would that not be impressive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a great incentive for them to want to make sure they 
maintain the funds in their own private fund.  It would give them 
a real nest egg for retirement, something totally unlike what we 
have with the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chile has a plan where people feel they have a sense of 
ownership.  They brag about the benefits of that plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I know the hon. member has more to add but 
the time has run out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been pointed out to me that I mentioned that the member 
for Ottawa Centre was questionable.  I did not mean that he was 
questionable.  I meant that he was questioning some of the 
statements made.  I hope he will accept my apologies 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will now hear from the member for Bourassa. I would like to 
ask him if he will be sharing his time with another member. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the member for Oak Ridges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise today to speak to the motion before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this motion is another example of the attitude of the 
member and his colleagues from his party who are trying to 
demolish the progressive legislation that our government put in 
place during its first mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have listened to Canadians. The Government of Canada has 
modified the outdated unemployment insurance program to adapt it 
to the new realities of the job market. After two years of 
consultations, we have fulfilled the wishes expressed by 
Canadians in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have created a forward looking employment insurance program 
that is more flexible, that meets the needs of a greater number 
of workers and—I really want to stress this last point—that is 
self-sustaining.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main purpose of the new employment insurance program is to 
help all unemployed Canadians, regardless of where they live, to 
go back to work, and that includes Quebeckers from the member's 
riding. The government is very pleased to have been able to help 
more than 3,100 residents of the riding of 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques to find jobs since 
1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With employment insurance, we have put in place a system that is 
more fair and equitable. We wanted to put an end to the vicious 
circle of dependency encouraged by the previous system. The 
employment insurance program is better equipped to create jobs 
in regions where unemployment is high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our employment insurance system strikes a balance between 
providing workers who lose their job the income support they 
need, and giving them the means to return to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the system is specifically geared to workers who 
are entitled to the family income supplement, which helps low 
income claimants with children. For these people, this 
supplement is more than double the weekly benefit supplement 
that they used to receive under the old system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the employment insurance system sets at $50 the 
minimum amount of eligible supplementary earnings, thus allowing 
low income claimants to increase their employment income without 
having their employment insurance benefits cut. Those who are 
entitled to the family income supplement are exempt from the 
intensity rule. 
Moreover, the system pays back the employment insurance 
contributions made by those who earn less than $2,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance system is not only compassionate, it is 
also well thought out. For example, by determining eligibility 
based on the number of hours worked instead of the weeks of 
employment, the system is more fair and gives greater 
consideration to the realities of the current labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that people must work for a reasonable period of time 
before qualifying for benefits, but this is only reasonable. 
Again, the system is compassionate towards those who did not 
work long enough to receive benefits. The new system provides 
better support than did the old one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, any person who collected ordinary benefits in the 
past three years can benefit from active re-employment measures. 
The same goes for those who collected maternity or parental 
benefits during the last five years, and who left the workforce 
to take care of a child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These active re-employment measures give unemployed workers an 
opportunity to gain the skills and experience necessary to find 
a job. We are helping, among others, up to 45% of provincial 
welfare recipients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his motion, the hon. member claims that employment insurance 
treats women unfairly. I do not know where he got this idea. The 
system is far from unfair to women, quite the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the employment insurance plan has been implemented, part 
time workers, a number of whom are women, are not limited to 14 
hours a week jobs like they used to be. Does the hon. member 
realize that the plan now covers about 270,000 women who were 
not eligible under the former unemployment insurance plan? Does 
he realize that nearly 70% of recipients—I must be touching a 
nerve, because members opposite are hollering—who get the 
family income supplement are women, and that nearly 700,000 
women who work part time will have their contributions 
reimbursed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, contrary to measures promoted by the Bloc 
Quebecois, we are well on our way to helping women re-enter the 
labour market through active employment measures and job 
creation projects. Any reasonable person will admit that putting 
people back to work is better that keeping them on benefits for 
a longer period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is worrying about the impact of employment 
insurance on young people. Let me tell you that young people 
today would agree that developing their full intellectual 
potential is crucial if they are to get a well paid job in 
today's knowledge based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fact that eligibility criteria have been made more 
stringent for newcomers on the labour market, but the intent is 
not to penalize young people. Quite the contrary, studies have 
proven that too easy an access to the former unemployment 
insurance plan was an incentive to drop out of school for small 
short term jobs followed by dependency on benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that what the hon. member wants? I am sure his constituents 
will be happy to hear that. The government does not think it is 
a good idea to encourage young people to become dependent on 
benefits. 
Our goal is to encourage them to stay in school as long as they 
can and then help them make the often difficult transition from 
school to the labour market.

know that the new employment insurance plan is very advantageous 
for seasonal workers. Many of them work long hours and are 
therefore at an advantage under the new system, which is based 
on the number of hours worked. I repeat: many seasonal workers 
work long hours and are therefore very much at an advantage 
under the new system, which is based on the number of hours 
worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Bloc Quebecois had its way, it would revert to the old 
unemployment insurance system, that passive system that 
Canadians, including Quebeckers, rejected as outdated. 
We will not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look toward the future and the future has already begun. The 
Government of Canada and the Government of Quebec signed a 
labour market development agreement under which we will invest 
$2.7 billion in the next five years. The province will be able 
to develop and manage programs specifically tailored to the 
needs of Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, as usual, for the Bloc Quebecois, there is nothing good and 
bad things are our fault.

program has a role to play in that future, even though the

we find the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just like workers in provinces or industries where unemployment 
is high, in particular the Atlantic provinces and to a certain 
extent the province of Quebec, primary industries and the 
construction sector are much more likely to lose jobs. Any 
worker chosen at random from these provinces or these industries 
could expect to lose a lot more weeks of benefits than a worker 
in any other region of Canada, under Bill C-17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, a fish plant worker and a forestry worker both 
received an average of 25 weeks of benefits before the new 
system came into force. Since the reform, that number has fallen 
to 20, which means that Bill C-17 has had a disproportionate 
impact on the provinces and the industries that need this 
insurance program the most.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The system the Liberals have set up was highly and vehemently 
criticized by none other that the current Prime Minister, a few 
months before the last general election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the hon. member for Bourassa have to say to all these 
experts who state that the employment insurance reform acts more 
or less like a tunnel leading to social welfare? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the separatists were 
serious, they would remember there was a consensus in Quebec to 
bring about major reforms in the old unemployment insurance 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is strange, because the separatists are advocating the same 
philosophy of active measures to put people back to work, but 
this time on the welfare issue. They proposed a welfare reform 
based on need. This is what we have done in fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing is for people to get back into the 
workforce. I do not want a society that relies solely and 
constantly on these benefits. I want to find active measures for 
women, for seasonal workers and for young people to put them 
back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the members of the Bloc Quebecois want is to live like in 
the good old system. It is clear that they are totally out of 
touch with reality. This is not what Quebeckers want. 
They want active employment measures and this is what the 
minister has done.

talks about people who are out of touch with reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the current Prime Minister who, when he was in the 
opposition in 1993, said that, instead of dealing with the roots 
of the problem, the Conservatives were attacking the unemployed? 
What happened to the hon. member's Prime Minister? Can he 
explain this to me, without looking for all kinds of excuses?

Minister?

me this seat because I was telling the truth. I am very happy to 
be a member of this political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will remind my dear friend opposite that, when we came into 
office, with the huge deficit we inherited, and when I see what 
deficit the NDP had, for example in Ontario, when that party was 
in power, I do not need the hon. member's advice on the 
definition of truth or the definition of management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that we did our homework, that we took adequate 
economic measures. There is never a perfect system, but I can 
tell you this: 700,000 more workers benefited from it. 
The people in my riding are very happy. In the riding of 
Kamouraska, 3,100 more people are benefiting from the new 
measures and this is what is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Before resuming debate, I would like to remind you 
that questions and answers should always be put through the 
Chair. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's debate. 
There are a few clarifications I would like to make with respect 
to this motion as its wording places a negative connotation on 
the government's approach to employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I would like to put this topic in some context of the 
government's overall fiscal management and deficit reduction 
strategy.  When the government took office in 1993, it recognized 
that the key to a prosperous future for Canadians was getting 
Canada's books in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the government's determined and balanced approach, the 
vicious cycle of high deficits, high interest rates and slow 
economic growth was transformed into a virtuous cycle where lower 
deficits have helped produce lower interest rates leading to 
higher economic growth and lower unemployment and leading 
ultimately to the elimination of the deficit last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members are aware that the deficit is now dead.  It is dead 
for 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000.  This is the first time 
Canada has had a balanced budget in 30 years.  This will be the 
first time in almost 50 years that the Canadian government will 
have had three consecutive balanced budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada I am pleased to report in the current economic cycle has 
had the first balanced budget of any G-7 nation.  In addition, 
the debt to GDP ratio fell last year, the first meaningful 
decline in 20 years.  Again it will fall even more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also pursued budgets of balance, budgets that recognize 
the need to continue to make key economic and social investments 
even with demands of fiscal constraint.  Over the last four years 
we have invested in children by enriching the child tax benefit. 
We have improved tax assistance for the disabled and for 
charities.  We have provided more help for post-secondary 
students and for those supporting them.  We have placed a high 
priority on improving Canadian health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the books improved, one of our first and most significant 
initiatives was to introduce legislation to increase the Canada 
health and social transfer cash floor from $11 billion to $12.5 
billion.  This will provide provinces with over $7 billion more 
in cash from 1997-98 to 2002-03. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now with the deficit millstone gone, we can afford to take even 
stronger action to help Canadians meet the challenges they face 
and take advantage of the opportunities of tomorrow.  We will do 
this by pursuing and pushing the balanced strategy we have 
followed since coming to office, to build a strong economy and a 
secure future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we remain committed to responsible management of the 
nation's finances.  We will reduce Canada's debt burden to a two 
front strategy of stronger economic growth and a debt repayment 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the improvement in our finances means we can make 
strategic investments such as the Canadian opportunities 
strategy.  This strategy will improve access to knowledge and 
skills Canadians will need in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the 1998 budget launches the process of general tax 
relief starting with those who need it most.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next three years $7 billion in tax savings is being 
provided primarily to low and middle income Canadians.  These 
measures must be modest in the beginning because the fiscal 
dividend that makes them possible is modest as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made it clear though that it will not allow 
unsustainable tax reductions to put in jeopardy either Canada's 
regard for fiscal health or delivery on the country's priorities 
such as health care and education. As the fiscal situation 
improves and the debt becomes more manageable relative to the 
growth of the economy, the amount of resources that can be 
channelled into other areas, such as increased tax relief, will 
grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the subject at hand, employment insurance.  As 
hon. members know, employment insurance first and foremost is an 
insurance system to help the unemployed bridge the gap between 
jobs.  I can assure the House that our government has no 
intention of breaking that very important link. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of our critics have suggested, and quite wrongfully, that 
the government is being too prudent and is hiding surpluses that 
could be used now for other purposes like lower taxes and in 
particular the tax that supports EI. This is simply not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no denying that the EI account has a material impact on 
the government's fiscal health and stability.  The annual 
surpluses in the EI account have contributed significantly to 
achieving the fiscal targets over the last four years.  However, 
we should also remember that the government's improved fiscal 
outlook has a positive impact on employment and the EI account. 
The decline in the unemployment rate from 11.2% in 1993 to 8.4% 
at present makes that clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at what else has been happening.  The government has 
lowered the EI rate four times, from $3.07 in 1994 to $2.70 in 
1998.  We would like to reduce the EI premiums further but the 
premium rate must be set to ensure that the EI account will have 
sufficient funds to pay benefits even during a recession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the event of an economic downturn a major increase in EI 
premiums would be harmful to the economy, as I think the members 
opposite would agree, and to Canadian workers.  Clearly we must 
avoid that at all costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premium rate will continue to come down but in a balanced 
manner and in the way to meet all the priorities indicated to us 
by Canadians, for example, personal tax cuts and health care 
spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will return once more to the word balanced.  Canadians asked 
for a balanced approach and that is what this government is 
giving them.  We have reduced both the debt and tax burden and 
increased our spending priorities such as on health care. The 
fact is that the EI premiums are part of what makes the balanced 
approach work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to say that we are not reducing the EI premiums 
because we are.  For 1998 alone, we cut premiums by $1.4 billion. 
I have just indicated that we will continue to reduce them in a 
measured way in the future.  To those who would say we should cut 
them faster and deeper than we are already doing, my question 
would be how?  By not cutting the debt?  By not reducing taxes? 
By not spending on health care?  I do not think that is what 
Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should remind hon. members that the EI surplus is currently in 
the range recommended by the chief actuary of Canada.  Let me 
provide the House with three important facts on which to reflect. 
The EI premium rate must ensure there is sufficient revenue each 
business cycle to pay EI costs at relatively stable rates.  The 
current surplus makes prudent provision against rate hikes in the 
event of unforeseen economic and global changes.  It also allows 
the government to address unemployment where it is most severe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, similar in concept to the 1997-98 new hires 
programs, the 1998 budget gives employers who hire young 
Canadians in 1999 and 2000 an EI premium holiday.  We must also 
remember that just a few years ago the federal government deficit 
was $42 billion. 
At that time the government looked at all aspects of the fiscal 
situation and there was no denying the EI surpluses played a role 
in restoring fiscal health.  This was not done in isolation 
however and contemplated other difficult decisions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion put forward by my colleagues opposite uses phrases 
such as “catastrophic effects”, “taking over funds destined 
for unemployed persons” and the government not adapting “to the 
new realities of the labour market”. I do not believe this is 
the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians and the government and no one else will make the 
economic and policy decisions for this nation.  We have regained 
control of our fiscal future. By regaining control over the 
finances, we are setting out a plan to help all Canadians gain 
access to the tools of tomorrow's success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we have taken a balanced approach on this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. member's speech.  I must say 
that some parts surprised me; however, I can see that other 
members want to ask questions so I will be very brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech, the hon. member opposite said that he was glad 
that some premium money was retained, that everything was not 
redistributed.  He talked a lot about the fact that the 
government balanced its books, but when it comes to the 
employment insurance fund he is glad that it is not balanced, 
that there is more money coming in than going out. 
He said he was pleased about that and hoped that there would be 
enough money in the fund to face the next recession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member whether he knows that the 
Minister of Finance has already used the surplus to pay down the 
deficit, and that, therefore, his dream of being prepared for 
the next recession is not likely to come true?  If this is what 
he wants, is he ready to side with the Bloc Quebecois and vote 
in favour of the private members' bills we have introduced to 
establish an employment insurance fund that would not be part of 
general revenue? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is clear that in my 
comments I have indicated that the government is taking a 
balanced approach. It is very clear that the government has to 
make prudent fiscal decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly there is no question that in having that money set 
aside, if there is a recession in the future, and we of course 
hope there is not, we need to be prepared.  The member seems to 
forget the fact that this government has reduced EI premiums 
continually over four years. There is no question that EI is used 
as a bridge between people who are unemployed and their next job. 
I believe the government's strategy is taking a very clear 
approach, one which will benefit all concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that I cannot support the Bloc's position 
because I think the government strategy is one that has been 
working.  It is one which will prove certainly in the short and 
long term to be the right approach. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to set the record straight quickly as I know there 
are others who would like to speak. I would like to talk to some 
of the information which my hon. colleague provided with regard 
to things such as the balanced budget, debt repayment plan and a 
few other things such as comments he made regarding the EI fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague said that the government is taking credit for a 
balanced budget. We applaud that and we think that is very good. 
But we also want to make note that this was done by Canadians and 
the rate of taxes they have paid. There have been a number of 
increases in taxes made by this Liberal government.  The credit 
should go where it is deserved and that is to Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Name them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  My hon. colleague would like me to 
name them.  I do not have enough time in this brief period to 
name the numerous, over 30, taxes that have been applied by this 
government since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government also talks about being the defender of health 
care which I find quite incredible.  There have been over $7 
billion in cuts to health care and education through the CHST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out to my hon. colleague the fact 
that the debt repayment plan he mentioned is a contingency fund 
that the finance minister has said would be used only if money is 
available.  That is not a concrete plan for debt repayment. The 
debt has not been decreased as my hon. colleague may have alluded 
to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to ask my colleague about the $15 billion 
surplus.  That would seem to indicate to me that the premiums are 
in fact too high and could be reduced. I would like to ask him a 
question regarding a comment made by his own finance minister 
when he was in opposition and said that high EI premiums are a 
cancer to job creation.  I want to ask the hon. member if he 
agrees with his own finance minister.  Yes or no?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if on this side of the 
House we walked on water the opposition would say “why can't you 
swim”.  It seems we continually hear from the other side that it 
could do it better.  I think we are demonstrating that we are 
doing it better.  I agree with the finance minister because 
obviously this government has taken the approach in the last four 
years of reducing EI premiums continually, which had not been the 
case previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course it was a partnership.  There is no question that 
Canadians as a whole worked very hard to make sure we were able 
to reduce this deficit.  It is now that the government through 
the fiscal dividend is able to share, in particular in health 
care. The national round table on health said that the government 
allocation of dollars was right on. I think the approach we have 
taken is the correct one. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Saint-Jean.  Is he going to 
share his time? 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
splitting my time with my hon. colleague from Mercier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have found this afternoon most interesting, one of the 
questions from my hon. colleague from Acadie—Bathurst in 
particular.  He asked one of our colleagues on the other side 
“Exactly what could have bitten you to make you end up in such a 
situation?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a few minutes I will refer to the letter from the current 
Prime Minister, then Leader of the Opposition.  I think that 
what bit the Liberals was the forgetfulness bug.  In other 
words, they have forgotten their past.  They have lost their 
past history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is this party, which often pats itself on the back for 
its liberal values of openness and solidarity, proposing a bill 
like this one, but its entire policy leads us to believe that it 
is exactly the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one with the most serious case of amnesia of all is probably 
the former Leader of the Opposition, the current Prime Minister. 
I refer to a letter he sent in 1993. This afternoon I heard 
reference to it, but I think it would be very important to quote 
the entire letter and to comment on it, in order to have a look 
at the situation the Liberals are in today.  They have 
completely forgotten their past, their values of solidarity, the 
position they took at that time with respect to the matter we 
are dealing  with now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first quote from the letter by the current Prime Minister, 
then Leader of the Opposition, is the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the Minister of Finance 
</UL>
<—the Conservative finance minister at the time— 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>says that not only will he reintroduce the same taxation, 
monetary and trade policies—-but he will reduce government 
expenditures at the expense of the unemployed. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the Leader of the Opposition at that time, now the Prime 
Minister, who sponsored the measure we have before us today, 
employment insurance reform, and who put people in the mess they 
are now in.  The current Prime Minister is the one who said that 
back then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about now? 
The basic problem is not being addressed. Instead the unemployed 
are being hit hard. Their benefits are being reduced, and they 
are having trouble qualifying for employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In passing I would like to get back to what my colleague who 
spoke before me said about the importance of balancing the 
budget, the importance of a zero deficit. How was it achieved? 
First by slashing transfers to the provinces to the tune last 
year of $1.4 billion in Quebec alone, and on the back of the 
unemployed. Exactly the opposite of what the former opposition 
leader used to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read some more of the letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures fill Liberals with consternation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is their consternation today? I listened to every Liberal 
speech made this afternoon in support of the Prime Minister and 
his cabinet. What happened to their consternation? In those days 
they were filled with consternation at the thought the 
unemployed were going to be harmed, but today they are doing 
even worse than the previous government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote some more: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By reducing benefits and penalizing more those who willingly 
leave their jobs, the government obviously does not care about 
the victims of the economic crisis. Instead of dealing with the 
root of the problem, the government goes after the unemployed. 
These measures will have disturbing effects as they will prevent 
workers from reporting cases of harassment and unacceptable 
working conditions. 
</UL>

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is going to happen now? Will workers faced with 
unacceptable conditions dare say “We are going to have to quit 
our job?” Will women who are harassed be able to say “I am going 
to quit my job, I am going to try to find something else, but in 
the meantime I can rely on the social safety net”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, and the statistics are here to prove it; nobody will contest 
them. Only 41% of unemployed workers qualify for employment 
insurance, half of them are forgotten. When it comes to young 
people this rate drops to 26%. And yet all we have heard so far 
is that young people should stay in school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the young guy or girl who gets a job to put 
himself or herself through school starts contributing to the 
employment insurance plan from the first cent earned, the first 
hour worked. These young people contribute to the plan but 
cannot benefit from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find absolutely deplorable all the remarks I have heard there 
this afternoon. The letter from the current Prime Minister and 
former leader of the opposition reads further: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, it is unacceptable for the people of Canada to 
continue in this disastrous direction and further penalize the 
victims of this recession. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only did this government go further than the previous one, 
but I think it has gone much further in terms of the unfair 
conditions imposed on the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being criticized for this great disaster, for being 
disaster stricken. 
They say we only talk of disasters. Given the statistics I just 
gave you, in a region like the one represented by my colleague, 
where nearly 40% of the population is unemployed, it is a 
disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This minister would better drop the function and technocratic 
approach and come in ridings to see what it is like in the 
field, because my colleagues and I know how it is, and it is 
disastrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether our colleagues opposite like it or not, facts are what 
matter to us. That is why I have looked at questions in terms of 
the concept of reality this afternoon. It is as if these people 
were completely out of touch with reality and just follow the 
minister's lead or that of their Prime Minister and not consider 
the motion before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc Quebecois members are not the only ones who happen to think 
this is outright theft, and that the victims end up paying the 
price. The premiers of Alberta and Ontario have said that this 
is nothing short of theft, and you can hardly suggest these 
people are out of touch with reality. They support our motion. 
People from all walks of life are behind the Bloc Quebecois on 
this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what about the unanimous support of the Assemblée nationale? 
Are there not Liberal members of the Assemblée nationale who are 
part of the great Liberal family and who claim to share 
fundamental values of solidarity? It may be true in Quebec, but 
it is certainly not the case in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government acts alone; it does not give a hoot about the 
victims and imposes its decisions. 
And then it brags about having a zero deficit this year and in 
the coming years. It should be said that the government achieved 
this at the expense of the unemployed and of provincial 
transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the Liberal Party of the compassionate 
values it has always stood for. It should govern itself 
accordingly today. If this plan is a safety net, and if wealth 
redistribution is important, let the government turn to the 
wealthy, to the banks and the big corporations, and not to those 
who are on employment insurance because their region has been 
devastated by the lack of jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should come to its senses, have some compassion 
and uphold the values it has always advocated. 
I therefore ask the government to support the motion put forward 
by my colleague, which is before us today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many who are listening to us on television today realize that I 
am frustrated. My frustration stems from the fact that there is 
real problem when, every day, we see in our riding families and 
children who are suffering because of the changes to employment 
insurance. In 1993, the Liberals promised they would not change 
the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often hear from the other side that employment insurance 
leads to dependency, that it deters young people from trying to 
find work. Back home, it does not deter young people from 
working. 
The problem is that when they do not find work, they are forced 
to go on welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you have the same problem in your area? Do people have to go 
on welfare, instead of collecting employment insurance and 
preserving a minimum of dignity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague 
from Acadie—Bathurst for his question. He mentions a problem that 
is indeed omnipresent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that the Liberal government has been bragging about 
eliminating the deficit and getting it quickly to zero, but not 
only did it do it at the expense of the unemployed, it did it by 
slashing the transfers to the provinces. In fact, transfers to 
the province of Quebec has been reduced by $1.4 billion. That 
includes transfers for health, social assistance services and 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, when workers are unable to qualify for unemployment 
insurance, they end up on welfare and it is up to the provinces 
to take care of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only has the government cut the transfers, not only is it 
making the unemployed pay, but it is also pushing people toward 
social welfare and saddling the provinces with the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a $16 billion surplus over two years, the solution to the 
problem we are currently facing is quite simple. We are not 
asking for a revolutionary solution. We only want to improve the 
system, to ensure that workers in regions like the Gaspé area my 
colleague represents can more easily become eligible. These 
regions need this insurance program and it is important that we 
do it this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other solution would be to reduce the unemployment insurance 
premiums, as we have always heard it mentioned. A decrease of 10 
cents would create up to 30,000 jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the two solutions: improve the system for those who 
need it, who need a social security system, and reduce the 
unemployment insurance premiums to create jobs and get people 
back to work. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for my distinguished colleague from Saint-Jean regarding 
the fiduciary role that the federal government has when it 
collects money from workers and employers and has the authority, 
at least morally if not legally, to distribute that money to 
those who paid it. It is still employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professional associations all have a trust account and, despite 
the loftiest of intentions, if we take money from a trust 
account and use it for other things than what it was intended 
for, just like the federal government is doing, if we use it to 
pay for groceries and other things instead of using it for its 
original purpose, can this not be challenged before the courts, 
as some people are beginning to suggest? I would like my 
colleague to clarify that for us since I missed that in his 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad my colleague raised 
this question. He missed that in my speech for the very good 
reason that I did not talk about it, but I thank him for giving 
me the opportunity to do so now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the auditor general has proposed that the money 
be put into a trust account and be used to help those people who 
need it. I remind you of a question I asked and a point I raised 
earlier. What we have here is an indirect tax. People pay 
provincial taxes and federal taxes, and every week there is an 
indirect tax on their paycheque. This tax is not used to help 
people. For the last two years, it has been used to eliminate 
the government's deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think my colleague has made an excellent suggestion. A trust 
account is indeed what we need.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I in turn 
would urge all members of the House to support the Bloc 
Quebecois motion.  I will reread the major elements: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—castigate the government for the catastrophic effects of its 
reforms to unemployment insurance— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody can deny the catastrophic effects. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—for having taken over funds destined for unemployed persons— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I am going to take a closer look at, and nobody can 
deny that either. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—and for its inability to adapt the unemployment insurance system 
to the new realities of the labour market. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No argument here either. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—particularly where young people, women, and self-employed persons 
are concerned. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one aspect of the present situation that can only be 
described as scandalous, and I am choosing my words carefully. 
That is the fact that the now $15 billion surplus—around 
December, it was estimated at $12 or $13 billion—came about, as 
my colleagues and I have pointed out, and many people have added 
their voices to ours over the years, because the government cut 
benefits to unemployed workers, but also because it continued to 
levy a payroll tax that, let us be honest, is expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister says he has reduced EI premiums to $2.70 for 1998. 
But what members should know is that the department's senior 
actuary said that the present regime is costing only about $2. 
That is the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the Bloc Quebecois say?  We say that the government 
can have a surplus to cover the unforeseen.  It does not have to 
be so high, because, as it is now, the system is so weakened 
that the fund will never be used up. 
It is like a bottomless pit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the fund stood at $12 billion when the government 
brought down its budget in the spring, members should know that 
it had planned a surplus of at least $6 billion.  If half of 
this $6 billion were used to lower premiums and the other half to 
improve the system, so that more young people, women and 
seasonal workers were eligible, the system would make more sense 
and be better adapted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The workers paying EI premiums, because this is the important 
point, are those earning up to $39,000.  This is the main point. 
Above $39,000, workers no longer pay EI premiums. 
Why is it that people who work overtime, those who make higher 
salaries or who are not in danger of being forced to use 
employment insurance do not pay for what we call economic 
stabilization? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance is not a welfare system, but an instrument 
of economic stabilization. What is the finance minister doing? 
He is changing it into another welfare system, but with the 
difference that it is funded by middle income workers. This is 
out of the ordinary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second element is that businesses are paying. Businesses 
that pay their employees less than $39,000 are mostly small 
businesses. A small business employee will seldom earn more than 
$39,000, except perhaps a few management people. This means that 
on these $39,000, the tax paid by the business is 1.4 times the 
one paid by the employee. 
Small businesses do not pay this with their profits, but with 
their revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means we are in an absurd economic situation in a country 
that wonders why its productivity is low and the unemployment 
rate is too high, where workers who earn up to $39,000, not the 
others, pay once again to reduce the deficit and to restore a 
bit a social solidarity in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance was saying “We reduced taxes for 
83% of Canadians and eliminated them for 400,000 people”. But 
what he is saying? He is saying that the government did so with 
money paid mainly by small businesses and by workers earning 
less than $39,000. This is redistributing poverty, to a certain 
extent. It is clear that this makes no economic or social sense. 
I would be inclined to say this makes no political sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> This makes no sense at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> What this means is that the Minister of 
Finance, who said he wanted to reduce taxes, did not dare to 
make everyone pay, all those who do not necessarily earn income 
from a job, but from profits and speculation. 
They do not contribute. They benefit from the overall tax 
reduction, but they do not contribute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Big corporations with their huge profits are not contributing 
either. The redistribution is done on the back of those earning 
$39,000 or less and the businesses who pay their salary. This is 
absurd. This is even borderline illegal. How do they explain to 
workers and SMEs that they are the ones carrying the load of 
economic stabilization and redistribution? There is something 
utterly illogical in there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister says “Our clients are the 
underprivileged”. Since when should workers alone have to look 
after redistribution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, even without touching the $12 billion surplus, there is 
still another $6 billion planned surplus. 
After paying everything, half of it could go to improving the 
plan and the other half to reducing contributions, particularly 
those of the SMEs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI surplus must somehow bother the consciences of all my 
colleagues, including the Liberals. When the finance minister 
boasts he is redistributing, they conveniently forget that those 
who are paying for it are those who make $39,000 or less. Yes, 
workers are ready to do their part, and so are SMEs, but not 
alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is illegal, scandalous, it does not make any sense, it is 
economically counter-productive. There are many questions which 
are not raised in this country, including why we do not seem to 
be able to eradicate high unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is at the point where it will be at head of the pack when 
it comes to unemployment, and at the tail end with regard to 
social spending. Under this government, Canada will have the 
worst of both worlds.

Mr. Speaker, I would first like to congratulate my colleague 
from Mercier for her speech.  In the last session, she worked 
with us on Standing Committee on Human Resources Development. 
Clearly her heart is with the unemployed.  She is still very 
much aware, she experiences it, she still talks about it and she 
moves us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish she could continue.  I imagine there is no point asking 
the House for unanimous consent to allow her to continue longer, 
but I will offer her time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to educate the Liberals a little 
about the system, the $39,000, the cutoff point.  Before it was 
$43,000. But I think there was something more hidden away in all 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was it not also to try to staunch the flow of money from out of 
the system, since now the limit is not $43,000 but $39,000. 
Is it not bad enough that the Liberals are double dipping? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, they set up a procedure that costs them less 
and, on the other, they establish a limit.  I would ask the hon. 
member to continue on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, what my colleague is drawing 
attention to is the fact that, prior to this reform, the maximum 
amount on which a worker could be required to contribute was 
$42,500.  For some incomprehensible reason, the Minister of 
Finance cut that back to $39,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked the reason when we were in committee, with an 
approximate French translation, and the answer we got was that 
people earning between $39,000 and $42,500 did not make much use 
of employment insurance.  What an answer.  So the people paying 
into the program should be only those most likely to use it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not all.  The reform has surprised a lot of people, 
particularly many workers in new sectors.  There are sectors 
that involve contract workers.  People get hired for a set 
period of time, and can earn a fairly high income during that 
time.  In the past, there was a weekly maximum on which 
deductions could be taken.  Now, for such cases, there is no 
weekly ceiling. 
This means that a young person who earns $5,000 in one week, for 
instance, would have to pay EI on the entire amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Curiously, an older person working in another sector and earning 
$5,000 would have his deductions stop once $39,000 had been 
reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This comes pretty close to being illegal.  I would not say it is 
a program that favours the middle wage-earners, but it is one 
intended to fill up the employment insurance coffers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
what a difference a day or a week or a year or four years makes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember not that long ago a government that sat in this House 
with a $6 billion deficit account in EI.  That deficit account 
was of tremendous concern to every Canadian. Who was making the 
payments for that deficit account?  It was clearly the Government 
of Canada. Just a few short years before that there was a surplus 
of $2 billion.  What caused the change from a $2 billion surplus 
to a $6 billion debt?  Obviously it is a cycle that does occur 
from time to time.  It is a cycle of good employment, steady 
growth and then a downturn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely no question that the responsibility of 
government is to smooth out those tremendous downturns and peaks 
into some realistic form to make sure workers have fair and 
equitable treatment whether it is in a difficult time when many 
are laid off or when we are doing well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have established several programs to smooth out the cycle of 
work and the business practice changes in this country in order 
to make sure that is done.  EI is one of those programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look back to 1993 and the economy at that time I did not 
hear Conservative members suggesting reductions in premiums.  As 
a matter of fact, the premiums were at $3.07 and they were 
suggesting an increase at that time.  They were suggesting that 
the premiums should rise to $3.25 or more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  $3.30. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  The parliamentary secretary points out 
that it was $3.30. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the right wing element of this House been elected there is 
absolutely no question that the premiums would have increased and 
the cost of business would have increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also recall that we had a deficit of $42 billion at that time 
and the Reform Party, more than any other party, was clamouring 
that we should cut spending and make programs responsible.  It 
said we should do the things that needed to be done to get this 
country back on a business scale that was reasonable.  Yes, that 
is what it was suggesting.  What would it have done with EI?  We 
might not have an EI program in place today if the Reform Party 
had its way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI program was very much in jeopardy, as well as the social 
programs in this country, from <I>a</I> to <I>z</I>.  The Reform 
Party was clamouring for the government to cut and chop, cut and 
chop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall the debate.  Mr. Speaker, you were involved in that 
debate, so you can certainly recall it too.  These fellows who 
are mourning today the fact that we have only cut EI premiums 
four times were saying we would have to increase those premiums 
and cut everything out from the support programs to make this 
government operate properly.  They have totally reversed 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in the House for three years watching the Reform in 
opposition.  I heard them say three years ago “Chop and burn. 
Slash and burn”.  I remember Liberal government members saying 
“It is bad news.  The slash and burn policies they are 
suggesting will destroy the economy of this country”. That was 
what the the finance minister said.  I do not think anything 
could have been more true than his statement that slash and burn 
would do no good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had to set reasonable targets.  We had to look at each 
program and deal with each program.  We had to move the agenda 
ahead in a proper and orderly way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In four years we took a $42 billion deficit and reduced it to 
zero.  Why is the government being challenged today?  It has had 
tremendous success.  It has taken a program of overspending by 
$42 billion every year and reduced it to zero.  It then, with the 
EI program, took a $6 billion deficit, turned it around and now 
there is a surplus.  Building that surplus will cushion the 
unemployed, businesses and people who need support so that in the 
future when business plans change, when we run into a minor 
recession or when some other problem arises we will be prepared.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals have always looked very carefully at what is happening 
in the economy at any specific time and have made certain that in 
good, solid years of business we do not bring in programs that 
will hurt people.  Instead we plan for the future to guard 
against the difficulties that will come downstream.  That is 
exactly what we are doing with the EI program.  We are guarding 
against the potential of difficult times in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly it is very responsible to do that because so many 
businesses suffered so badly during the recession when the 
Mulroney Conservatives had to jack up the rates again and again 
because of the tough times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are in the House today, these Reformers who were the 
Tories.  There is no question about that.  This weekend in London 
their leader said “Unite the right, but call them Reform.  Don't 
call them Tories”.  That is interesting.  Call them Reform and 
make Preston Manning the leader.  He wants the old Conservative 
Party— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member is an experienced 
member.  He knows that he must not refer to an hon. member by 
name, but by constituency or title.  I would invite him to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I got so caught up in 
this that I went a little overboard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the hon. leader of the Reform Party suggested that he 
wanted to unite the party.  In other words, he wants to take the 
old right wing party, the Progressive Conservative Party, put in 
a new leader in, the present leader of the Reform Party, and call 
it the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some problems with that.  I have some problems with how 
day by day, month by month, year by year the policies of the 
parties opposite change dramatically.  There is good reason that 
has occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes right down to it, we have been extremely 
successful at turning the economy of this country around.  We 
have been extremely responsible in our actions toward small 
business, in our actions toward business in general in this 
country and in our actions toward preparing for any problems in 
the future.  We are not leaving it to chance, pulling the support 
out and running at a full run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can anyone think of any reason the finance minister of this 
country would be prepared to do anything that would not be 
beneficial to the business of this country?  Clearly he is 
working.  He is consulting.  He is getting input from people 
right across this country on a regular basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He knows that the smoother the ride the better the opportunities 
will be for business to compete.  The better prepared workers are 
for any ups or downs in the economy, the better off this country 
will be.  Stability is really the key. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our finance minister has brought stability to this country.  He 
has stabilized our finances so that other countries are now 
looking at Canada and saying “What a remarkable transition. 
What a remarkable change has occurred”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister pointed out just a short time ago, before we 
eliminated the deficit, to all members of the House that 
governing gets tougher and tougher as we pay down the debt, as we 
pay down the deficit and move toward the situation where we have 
positive moneys coming in because quickly the opposition will 
latch on to spending.  That is what I am hearing now.  The

things which will alter the whole economic structure of this

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I believe the time will be expiring at 6.30 p.m.  I 
wonder if the hon. member would give me one minute or 30 seconds 
for a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find the intervention 
quite incredible because I have never had a Reform member give me 
time to speak.  If that is a practice of the House, it is an 
interesting practice, but I have some issues that I want to bring 
forward and I believe I have 15 minutes to bring them forward. 
Now I am being asked to cut my time to 10 minutes and to give 
part of my time to the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, they have spoken all day.  They have had all 
kinds of speakers up.  If they have omitted something, I am not 
going to relinquish my time in order to give them extra time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at where we are with our EI reforms.  We have 
modernized the system and we have made it far more fair to 
everyone.  In reality the thrust in this country has to be to 
create more jobs, to do things to get people to work and not to 
focus on unemployment totally.  We must focus on job creation 
because that runs hand in hand with EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>EI premiums have been talked about a tremendous amount today. 
But let us look at the other programs the government has put in 
place to support business and to help business down the line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new hires program very clearly makes an issue out of what is 
happening in this country.  We have actually given businesses who 
are going to hire youth between the ages of 18 and 24 a premium 
year off so they will not have to pay those extra premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made benefits available to women who are among the

programs that we have put in place to help them, they were not 
the people who got major support from EI programs, but we are 
certainly doing what we can to get jobs for the young people of 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have done what we can to make sure that women, who form the 
major part of the part time workforce in this country, will 
benefit from the opportunities in the EI program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are building a fund which will make certain that there will 
be stability for those people who will need stability when they 
are laid off. 
We have downsizing, company changes and an EI support fund that 
is in a positive economic position that will be able to help 
those people in the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, tonight I 
am on the hepatitis C issue again.  It goes back to the original 
compensation package that was announced by the government some 
months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us are concerned about the package because it only 
includes those innocent victims from the years 1986 to 1990.  I 
think that most Canadians expect more than that for a number of 
reasons.  We have to realize that these are innocent victims of a 
tainted blood supply.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to the original Krever inquiry and the report of 
Justice Krever, he states that all victims should be compensated 
regardless of the years when they were infected. That is only 
fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have mentioned in this House time and time again, Canada by 
far is the number one country in the world.  We are rated as the 
best country in the world by the United Nations.  We are a very 
fair and a very generous country. Most Canadians want to see that 
fairness and generosity expressed in that compensation package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had some pretty heated discussions in this House on that 
compensation package. Up to now those victims prior to 1986 are 
not being compensated. We do not have any consideration being 
given to those victims after 1990.  We are talking I suppose 
conservatively about a group of people which could be less than 
20,000.  The government has led us to believe that the number 
could be over 60,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the government cannot substantiate that number. 
One would ask why it would use a number that cannot be 
substantiated. I think the reason the government did that is that 
it might go beyond the government's capacity to pay if the number 
was large enough. That is the sort of convoluted logic in my way 
of thinking. That is why the hepatitis C association tells us 
that yes, the government officials inflated the number making it 
appear as if it was beyond the capacity of the government to pay 
compensation to those victims.  The number is far less than that. 
Some experts put the number down as low as 8,000 to 12,000 yet to 
be compensated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good news out of all of this to this point, if there is any 
good news at all, if there is a little comfort we can take in 
what has happened is that the provinces and the federal 
government are back at the negotiating table.  They are back 
today as we speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is a glimmer of hope that the federal government 
might come up with something for those victims left outside the 
package.  At the end of the day, it is not the provinces, it is 
not the provincial health ministers that are responsible for the 
safety of Canada's blood supply system.  Members know that the 
buck stops at the doorstep of the federal health minister. The 
federal health minister himself is responsible for the safety of 
Canada's blood supply system.  He is back at the bargaining table 
with the provinces today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hopeful that a package will be arrived at.  We are looking 
for generosity on the part of the federal government on behalf of 
the Prime Minister and his government and we are hoping that is 
what happens in the next couple of days. We are hopeful that that 
will happen.  What we want to see is simply compensation for all 
those innocent victims of a tainted blood supply system 
regardless of when they were infected.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to take up where the hon. 
member left off with the themes of generosity and fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he will be among the first to recognize that prior to 
the actions of the federal government and the minister, there was 
a reluctance to apply either one of those two terms to the entire 
process as seen through the eyes of the victims, those he quite 
rightly calls the innocent victims of a terrible tragedy in 
Canadian blood history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He would also at the same time acknowledge that the federal 
government has acted with great generosity.  It has acted with a 
great sense of fairness. It has acted with great deliberateness 
in bringing all of the partners together to the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He well knows that a mere one year ago these concepts were not 
even on the table.  There was no discussion of compensation.  The 
only issue was how well all the governments of Canada would 
disseminate information that would allow victims to deal with 
their sickness, with their disease in relative comfort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now looking at a package arrived at, cobbled together by 
all the governments, the territories, the provinces and the 
federal government on, number one, a package of compensation. 
Equally important and perhaps even more so in the eyes of many is 
that there is an entire package for additional services for those 
who have been smitten by this disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of us have been taken up with the issue of compensating one 
group as opposed to another but there has never been a 
distinction on the part of the federal government.  The idea was 
that it would act on behalf of all our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With due regard to the issue that the opposition have raised up 
until this point which is the question of avoidability, if 
governments could have acted differently and did not do so, then 
there should be compensation.  But in all cases there should be 
at least a series of measures in place to allow people to live 
their lives as normally as possible under the circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly the House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1).
