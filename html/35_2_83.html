	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ind.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to present a petition on behalf of constituents from Ontario with 
respect to concerned parents across the country who support the 
effort to create a national pedophile registry.
<P>
	The petitioners I represent are concerned about making our 
streets and homes safer for our children. They are opposed to the 
current status quo in the screening of pedophiles as they enter our 
communities.
<P>
	The petitioners pray that a federally implemented pedophile 
registry will be established in order to better secure the safety of 
our children.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have with me over 1,000 pages of petitions, bearing a total of 
26,021 names.
<P>
	Citizens from across Canada are demanding the following of the 
government: Whereas incidents of serious personal injury crimes 
and sexual offences involving children are becoming more and 
more frequent, whereas each incident harms the public, and 
whereas there would be fewer such incidents if certain legislative 
measures were taken, the petitioners pray and request that 
Parliament establish a procedure of public notification of a sex 
offender being released and allow  such notification to be made 
available for viewing at RCMP stations and other government 
agencies. They also request a central registry, amendments to the 
Criminal Records Act and the Criminal Code.
<P>
	I hope the solicitor general and Parliament will listen to the plea 
of 26,000 more Canadians who are demanding greater protection 
from sexual predators.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CHILDLABOUR">CHILD LABOUR</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have the honour to present two petitions today.
<P>
	The first petition was prepared by the third quarter French 
students of Madam Cadorette's grade 10 class at Cowichan 
Secondary School who were inspired by young Craig Kielburger to 
gather signatures for the following petition. That children as young 
as four years old in the third world are forced into cruel bondage to 
work as labourers on sugar and coffee plantations and the garment 
industries requiring inexpensive, intensive manual labour.
<P>
	For that reason the petitioners call on Parliament to voice formal 
objections to the United Nations and to enact legislation requiring 
all goods coming into Canada to be clearly labelled as not having 
used children under the age of 15 in their production.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GENERICDRUGS">GENERIC DRUGS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have the honour to present a second petition which was 
gathered by the United Senior Citizens of Ontario Inc. and which is 
supported by the New Democrat MPP for Windsor-Riverside, Dave 
Cooke. The petition is signed by residents of his constituency and 
elsewhere.
<P>
	The petition notes that the safety of consumers, and senior 
citizens in particular, is at risk because brand name drug 
manufacturers are attempting to force generic drug manufacturers 
to market their equivalent products in a different size, shape and 
colour than the brand name medication. Any action which affects 
the look of generic drugs could endanger patient safety through 
improper use of medicines.
<P>
	Therefore, the petitioners request that Parliament regulate the 
longstanding Canadian practice of marketing generic drugs in a 
size, shape and colour which is similar to that of its brand name 
equivalent.

<P>
Question No. 53-<B>Ms. Meredith:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Pursuant to the modification agreement between the Department/Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development and Stone Ridge Estates Ltd. (British 
Columbia) for a 20-year extension on the leasing of lands on the Tzeachten Indian 
Reserve #13, what amount was paid by Stone Ridge Estates Ltd. to the 
Minister/Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development for this 
extension?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> The amount paid by Stone Ridge Estates Ltd. 
to the Minister/Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, in trust for the band, for the 20-year extension to the 
lease is simply the amount of ongoing rents during the extended 
term. Ongoing rents are determined by the minister, based on fair 
market rent, at the start of each four-year period during the term of 
the lease. The rent paid form 1992 to 1996 was $86,400 per year.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be 
allowed to stand.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to ask the government House leader when I 
can expect to receive an answer to my question on the Order Paper 
numbered Q-52.
<P>
	I would like to give the House a little background. The question 
was placed on notice on May 16, 1996.
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	I requested an answer from the government within 45 days. As of 
today, 146 days have passed. The answer to this question is about 
the destruction of millions of dollars worth of assets by the 
government.
<P>
	The government has established a pattern of not answering 
questions within the 45-day time frame. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I 
am asking how long you are going to allow this oversight to 
continue.
<P>
	I have had another question on the Order Paper, Q-4, for a very 
long period of time. If the government does not provide me with 
this information to do my job, I am unable to represent my 
constituents in this House. That is the concern.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is important that the hon. member not 
misrepresent some of the facts. The facts are that the information 
he requested is very comprehensive. It requires thousands of 
inquiries throughout the country.
<P>
	In theory the 45 days is a guideline that we try to respect. If 
members look at the record, 75 per cent of all answers are returned 
before the 45-day period. There are situations with which the hon. 
member is more than familiar. He has two of the most 
comprehensive questions that have been put on the Order Paper.
<P>
	Thousands and thousands of person hours and dollars are going 
into preparing the information. Perhaps at some other point we 
could debate the merits of the system but the hon. member should 
not misrepresent the facts about the information he requested.
<P>
	An inquiry is going out to the RCMP stations throughout the 
country asking a very specific question. In order to give a specific 
answer, we do not want to mislead anybody with the information 
that is coming forward.

	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak 
in support of this legislation and to the amendments that have been 
put forward.
<P>
	The Canadian government has been seized with the actions south 
of the border with respect to the reprehensible piece of legislation 
put forward, not affectionately know here as the Helms-Burton 
legislation.
<P>
	The Helms-Burton legislation is a piece of work that has come at 
the height of the U.S. presidential silly season of U.S. politics. The 
Helms-Burton bill defies the recent trend both in the United States 
and in most western countries to try to remove those impediments 
to free trade in goods and services.
<P>
	When we speak of the free trade agreement that has been 
negotiated between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, the 
Helms-Burton bill-it is the strong view of the Government of 
Canada and I think of most in this Chamber-is not only 
extraterritorial in its application but is contrary to the free trade 
agreement that was negotiated between these three sovereign 
states.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	In order to figure out exactly what Helms-Burton seeks to do and 
to figure out the response of the government and the amendments 
we are debating today, one has to look back and understand that 
there has been an increasingly protectionist move in the right wing 
of the U.S. Congress.
<P>
	We have to recognize that during the period in question when we 
see these pieces of legislation which are contrary to the direction 
forged over the last number of years, we must recognize that it is 
the U.S. presidential election season. In the United States there 
some on both the Republican and Democratic sides who will try to 
curry favour with Cuban Americans who are very important 
electors in some states such as Florida.
<P>
	Because the president did not veto this piece of legislation, he 
allowed this backward looking revisionist piece of legislation to be 
put before the U.S. Congress and passed. It seeks to punish 
Canadian and other foreign companies that are doing normal 
business in Cuba. The Canadian government has followed a foreign 
policy with respect to Cuba that is different from the foreign policy 
followed by the United States for a number of years. We have done 
so because we believe that it is only through a policy of 
engagement, of increased trade in goods and services and also 
investment that the current regime in Cuba will be replaced by one 
that is more respectful of human rights and which would be more 
democratic in its orientation.
<P>
	We have not followed the policy of the United States of 
isolationism, whereby it seeks to cripple not only the economy of 
Cuba but also to bring undue hardship to its people because the 
United States government has an aversion to the political regime 
which is in place.
<P>
	The Canadian government has voiced its concerns about human 
rights abuses in Cuba. The Canadian government voiced a strong 
objection when the Cuban government shot down a plane a few 
months ago which in many respects precipitated this piece of 
legislation, the Helms-Burton Bill, being passed by the U.S. 
Congress.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5206"> 5206 </A></B>
<P>
	The Canadian government is strong in its resolve to continue its 
policy of engagement economically with  Cuba. We believe that 
Canadian businesses and the Canadian government have a role to 
play to ensure that the good people of Cuba are not further 
disadvantaged by protectionist rhetoric from places like the United 
States.
<P>
	The Helms-Burton legislation seeks to punish Canadian and 
foreign companies that are doing business in Cuba. The Canadian 
government voiced very strong reaction to this type of legislation 
immediately upon its passage. The Prime Minister and other 
ministers of crown, the Minister for International Trade, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, have consulted widely with our friends 
around the world and with our friends in the European Union and in 
Mexico. We have launched a number of initiatives on a variety of 
fronts to clearly indicate that we believe that this type of legislation 
has no place in a modern trading system. We believe that this 
Helms-Burton legislation is a blatant exercise in extraterritoriality 
by the United States. Indeed, it is in violation of the responsibilities 
and rules of both NAFTA and the world trading organizations.
<P>
	The bill we have introduced is a measured response. The bill and 
the amendments we are debating here today seek to ensure that any 
judgments which are rendered in U.S. courts as a result of the 
Helms-Burton legislation will not be enforceable in Canada. It 
allows for blocking orders to be issued, which is extremely 
important so that judgments which are rendered against Canadian 
companies and against Canadian property, individuals and 
businesses doing business in Cuba, the laws will not be enforceable 
in Canada.
<P>
	It also ensures that under the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures 
Act the penalties which can be applied under the U.S. legislation 
are equal in measure. This is very important. We do not want to 
penalize Canadian companies that may be penalized under the act. 
We want to make exactly sure that Canadian companies do not 
make choices which may be contrary to their interests and indeed 
contrary to international law because of a difference in potential 
penalties in the United States jurisdiction and in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	Under this legislation we have made sure that we are not going to 
play the same games as the Americans have with respect to other 
measures such as trying to give ministers of the crown in Canada 
the right to block individuals from coming into our country.
<P>
	We believe that some of the measures that are inherent in the 
Helms-Burton legislation go beyond the realm of reason in trying 
to stop principals or families of Canadian companies that may be 
named according to the U.S. in trafficking in confiscated property.
<P>
	We believe that is contrary to the rules and regulations under the 
NAFTA. We have made sure that in our response we have not 
become, as the U.S. has been, contrary to the rules and regulations 
under the NAFTA.
<P>
	The amendments put forward today, the ones we are debating 
now, are measures which strengthen the bill. They are measures 
that have been discussed with all members of the committee under 
the chairmanship of the member for Rosedale, who has done an 
expert job in ensuring that this bill gets the type of quick passage 
required to give the Canadian government the tools it needs to 
defend against the intrusion into our jurisdiction and into our 
sovereignty.
<P>
	Members of the opposition have seen this as a very positive 
piece of legislation, one required in order to ensure these incursions 
outside of jurisdiction by the United States do not go unanswered 
by our government.
<P>
	I want to commend the members of the committee for not only 
ensuring the speedy passage through the committee of this 
legislation but also for their support of the amendments which have 
been put forward today which vastly strengthen the bill.
<P>
	It is my hope that at the end of the day, at the end of third reading 
after we hear from the chairman of the committee and from 
members of the opposition who support the bill, the bill will 
received speedy passage at report stage and as well at third reading 
so that the Government of Canada has the tools at its disposal that 
are required under the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act to 
counter the most negative consequences of this piece of legislation, 
the Helms-Burton act in the U.S. Congress.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, later 
on in my speech I will explain to the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister for International Trade why I was so surprised when he 
said that the government was producing a measured response. I 
would like to elaborate on this aspect later on, because I think the 
expression ``measured response'' means one thing to our party and 
another thing to theirs.
<P>
	The government has tabled five minor changes, five minor 
amendments to Bill C-54, which was tabled in two stages, seven 
months later. My they are quick, those Liberals! The American 
government acted seven months ago by imposing extraterritorial 
measures, and now, seven months later, we are discussing an 
amendment before we adopt our own legislation.
<P>
	The five amendments proposed by the Liberal Party are minor 
amendments, and as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for 
International Trade pointed out earlier, the Bloc Quebecois will 
support those amendments as, I assume, will our Reform Party 
colleagues.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5207"> 5207 </A></B>
<P>
	However, since these five amendments have been divided in two 
blocks, the first two amendments made us wonder about this direct 
reference to the Helms-Burton act, or should I say its formal name, 
in Bill C-54.
<P>
	Had the government given this more thought or taken a more 
practical approach, had it said the following in amendments 1 and 
2: ``bills extraterritorial in nature, pursuant to schedule 1'', as it 
appears in the bill, there would have been no need to open Bill C-54 
if in the future-and we should adopt legislation with the future in 
mind-other countries implement extraterritorial measures.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	By introducing these first two amendments to Bill C-54, the 
Liberal Party is, as it were, painting itself into a corner. In other 
words, if there is more legislation of this kind, we will have to 
come back to the House, reopen Bill C-54, which will be law by 
that time, to add these extraterritorial bills to the schedule and 
amend these two amendments.
<P>
	We tried to influence the Liberal Party somewhat by making this 
suggestion. We got these amendments, be it somewhat late. We in 
the Bloc Quebecois understand that it is very important to protect 
Quebec and Canadian businesses. That is why we will go along 
with the case by case approach, as described, and we will 
agree-let us hope it will not be necessary-to reopen the act if we 
are faced with further extraterritorial bills.
<P>
	I repeat, the amendments tabled by the government are really 
technical amendments. That is why we cannot object, but we 
cannot improve on them, because these amendments are intended 
to make Bill C-54 refer specifically to the Helms-Burton act. They 
said it was a mirror of the Helms-Burton bill.
<P>
	The changes proposed in the amendments do not alter the 
substance of the bill, but rather help clarify it. Anyway, as I said in 
my first speech on Bill C-54, at second reading, we will vote for the 
bill since its thrust is to protect Canadian and Quebec companies 
doing business in Cuba.
<P>
	However, as I said before, we are wondering why the Canadian 
government has waited seven month to take action. We know that 
first it trails behind the US foreign policy, second there is the 
American presidential campaign, and third international foreign 
policy.
<P>
	Just when, to all intents and purposes, dangers have disappeared 
from the political map, the Canadian government says: ``the 
American president has decided to postpone the implementation of 
title III of the Helms-Burton act, which could penalize Canadian 
and Quebec companies; since it does not cause too much harm, we 
might consider doing something about it''. This is the kind of 
rigour, or vigour, the Minister of International Trade and the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs are showing here.
<P>
	However, even with the five amendments introduced this 
morning by the government, title IV, under which relatives or 
descendants of employees of Canadian or Quebec firms may be 
banned from entering the United States-as is currently the case of 
the Sherritt corporation-is still in force.
<P>
	There is no mention of title IV in these amendments. Earlier, the 
parliamentary secretary said that we did not want to do like the 
Americans who, under the Helms-Burton act, are trying rather 
clumsily to block Canadians doing business in Cuba from entering 
their country. We do not want to do the same thing.
<P>
	Then why did the government call Bill C-54 a mirror image of 
the Helms-Burton act if it does not want to do the same thing? The 
parliamentary secretary said: ``As much as possible, we 
oppose-''. I will respectfully mention that, talking about what is 
possible, his government and himself could have appealed to a 
NAFTA panel since July.
<P>
	Everybody agrees, the Helms-Burton act contravenes NAFTA. 
Everyone is now in agreement with that. Since July, the Liberal 
government could have appealed to a panel to have the 
Helms-Burton act declared invalid. The Canadian government 
knows that, since Bill C-54 cannot be amended to defeat title IV, 
the only way to do that is to ask a panel to declare the Hems-Burton 
law invalid.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	The Canadian government has had this bargaining chip in its 
hands since July. It is clear it will not use it before the next 
elections in the United States. Meanwhile, we see what is 
happening to Canadian companies like Sherritt and others. Are we 
going to wait for other business managers, and even their families, 
to be denied entry in the United States before we contravene title 
IV?
<P>
	In conclusion, we will support these five amendments to Bill 
C-54 because we want to protect Canadian companies and Quebec 
companies doing business in Cuba. However, we also want to 
reiterate, to restate our dissatisfaction with the federal government, 
which acted first too late and then, too quickly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Reform Party will be supporting these five amendments which are 
of a technical nature to bolster Bill C-54, commonly known as the 
blocking legislation for Helms-Burton.
<P>
	It is clear that the United States has a dispute with Cuba that 
needs to be resolved. However, it is a dispute that should not be 
taken outside of the United States.
<P>
	The question here is whether the United States has the ability or 
the right to apply its law outside of its country. I submit it clearly 
does not. It is in contravention of NAFTA and Canada should have 
moved this dispute to a NAFTA panel long ago.

	My colleague from the Bloc has said that Canada has been 
sitting on this problem since July, and I support that view. We have 
fought long and hard to have a dispute mechanism set up to settle 
these kinds of problems both at NAFTA and at GATT. We now 
have the World Trade Organization, and Canada seems to be afraid 
to take these matters to final resolution at these international 
bodies.
<P>
	What is the use of having negotiated agreements through a long 
period of time to settle problems of this nature if we never use 
them?
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary pointed out that this was an election 
year in the United States and sometimes during an election year 
things get a little strange down there in terms of foreign of policy. I 
support that view, but I do submit that the democratic president of 
the United States did sign the Helms-Burton bill. This is not a bill 
that just came out of the Republicans. The president did give a bit 
of an exemption to Canada for a period of time, but the meter is 
still ticking.
<P>
	The Canadian companies involved still have liabilities accruing 
and I believe that C-54 does not address a couple of issues. It does 
not address the issue of liabilities that are continuing to accrue. It 
does not address the issue of blocking Canadian executives and 
their families of companies that are affected from entering the 
United States. Therefore I see Bill C-54 as a half measure, one that 
needs to be taken, but we should have taken this to a dispute panel 
at NAFTA long ago.
<P>
	I believe there is a disturbing trend coming out of this Liberal 
government. We saw it back in 1994 when we had a dispute with 
the United States over durum wheat where Canada accepted export 
caps. Is that in the spirit of free trade? I submit it is not.
<P>
	Clearly Canada and the United States agreed under the 
Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement that there should be no 
restriction on trade between the two countries, there should be a 
phase down of tariffs and that the whole idea was to try to establish 
a market economy based on the ability of producers to have some 
regional advantage possibly.
<P>
	However, what we have is a government that seems to be willing 
to cave in to the United States every time we have a dispute. This is 
just one more example of it. We saw it in the Canada-U.S. wheat 
dispute in 1994. We saw it again in the softwood lumber dispute 
where Canada has decided to impose restrictive quotas on 
ourselves which is very cumbersome to put in place and to 
administer. In fact, the whole process has been delayed another 
month because they cannot agree on how provincial allocations 
should be set out and we have not even arrived at the allocations 
that go to individual companies yet.
<P>
<B>(1035 )</B>
<P>
	Now we have a dispute over a situation in which the United 
States is trying to apply its law outside of its own country which is 
clearly in contravention of a NAFTA deal that we have signed, and 
this government continues to use a process of stalling. If we had 
taken this issue to a NAFTA panel it probably would have been 
resolved by now. I believe the panel would have found in favour of 
Canada.
<P>
	We support the amendments which strengthen Bill C-54. They 
are of a technical nature. The bill will be of some help to Canadian 
companies but clearly this dispute should be resolved on the basis 
of the international agreement between Canada, the United States 
and Mexico.
<P>
	We will be supporting this bill, but this government must start to 
show some backbone in responding to the United States. With 
regard to trade policy the United States tends to act like a bit of a 
bully. If we do not respond with corresponding strength I do not 
think the Americans will respect us. We must show them we have 
some strength and are willing to stand up to them in this type of 
dispute.
<P>
	Therefore we will be supporting these amendments at report 
stage, but we must move far beyond this, show some strength and 
challenge countries like the United States when they try to apply 
their laws outside their own countries.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to participate in the report stage 
debate of Bill C-54. This gives members of the Canadian 
Parliament who speak on behalf of the people of Canada a clear 
opportunity to send a very strong message, a strong message to 
American politicians, to the American people. It is also a message 
of solidarity to the people of Cuba. I support the principle of this 
bill and I support the amendments which strengthen the bill.
<P>
	It is important to look at the context of this legislation. It is very 
clear what is happening in the United States. A small group of 
powerful and influential legislators led by Senator Jesse Helms and 
Representative Dan Burton are pandering to what I have called the 
Miami mafia, the Mas Canosas, the Cuban-American Foundation. 
In doing so they are not only in breach of international law but they 
are promoting policies which I believe are profoundly immoral and 
repugnant in a civilized society.
<P>
	This is an opportunity for the Parliament of Canada not only to 
condemn the Helms-Burton law, a law which is clearly in breach of 
international law with respect to the application of extraterritorial 
measures to foreign countries, but I think this Parliament should go 
further. This Parliament should also clearly and unequivocally 
condemn the longstanding American blockade of Cuba.
<P>
	I am a member of the Canada-Cuba Parliamentary Friendship 
Association, an all-party grouping of members  of this House and 
the other place. We have attempted to promote dialogue and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5209"> 5209 </A></B>
<P>
understanding between the people of Canada and the people of 
Cuba. The member for Bourassa and the member for 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore are active members of that group as well.
<P>
	We had the opportunity to visit Cuba to meet with 
representatives of that government and to meet with President 
Fidel Castro. We also met with ordinary Cuban citizens. Earlier this 
year we hosted a visiting delegation from Cuba which was led by 
the minister of education, Luis Gomes.
<P>
	It was very clear to all members of the parliamentary friendship 
group that the people of Cuba at this very difficult time are 
struggling against terrible odds. This blockade, this illegal, 
immoral blockade which has been condemned in ever increasing 
numbers at the United Nations, must be strongly condemned by our 
own government and by this Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	The people of Cuba and the Government of Cuba are challenging 
the wave of right wing orthodoxy, the neo-conservative wave that 
has taken hold in too many parts of the world. What they are saying 
is that an economy should serve human needs, an economy should 
not just be there to serve the interests of the corporate elite to 
maximize profits. The Government of Cuba and the people of Cuba 
have had great success despite terrible odds when we look at the 
socioeconomic indicators: one of the lowest rates of infant 
mortality in Latin American, one of the highest rates of literacy. 
The rate of child poverty is far lower than anywhere else. This is 
despite the terrible difficulties faced by Cuba following the 
collapse of the former Soviet Union.
<P>
	I would note that when one looks at the conditions in eastern 
Europe and the former Soviet Union with the advent of unbridled 
capitalism, when one looks at the corruption, at the growing gap 
between rich and poor, at the poverty among young people and 
seniors, I certainly understand why the people of Cuba and the 
Government of Cuba have said they reject that model, they believe 
in an economic model, a model of socialism based on Cuban needs 
and the unique aspirations and conditions of the people of Cuba. 
That is what really angers the American political establishment.
<P>
	Yes, there are concerns about human rights in Cuba. The United 
Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights has visited Cuba 
and has reported. Those concerns are real and I know they must be 
addressed. However, I suggest that the approach of the American 
government in lecturing the people of Cuba, lecturing the 
Government of Cuba on human rights violations is in fact steeped 
in hypocrisy.
<P>
	This same government that lectures the people of Cuba on 
human rights violations of course was and is silent on massive 
human rights violations in other parts  of the world, the genocidal 
policies of Indonesia in East Timor, massive human rights 
violations elsewhere in Latin America. Not only were the 
Americans silent on the death squads in El Salvador, the brutal 
bloodshed in Guatemala and the blood thirsty junta in Chile, but the 
CIA was actively involved in those countries. The Americans have 
no business lecturing other countries on human rights.
<P>
	What about basic economic, social and cultural rights? Look at 
the growing gap between rich and poor, between powerful and 
powerless in the United States itself. What about democracy and 
free elections? Look what it costs to run as a candidate; millions 
and millions of dollars in that great bastion of democracy in the 
United States of America.
<P>
	The tragic irony of the U.S. blockade is that it even hurts the 
American people. I visited a biomedical technology centre, and 
Cuba is one of the leading countries in the world on biomedical 
technology. It was pointed out to me that one of the drugs produced 
in Cuba for dealing with trauma, cardiac arrest and so on, which 
can save lives by taking precious moments off the response time, a 
drug called streptokinase, is not available to the people of the 
United States because of this blockade. It is madness.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity during this debate as well to pay 
tribute to the many Canadian individuals and organizations 
working in solidarity with the people of Cuba at this very difficult 
time, the groups helping to ship medical supplies, computers and 
other badly needed supplies.
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	There are various solidarity groups in the labour movement. 
Brigadista groups are travelling to Cuba and other groups are 
working closely with the people of Cuba at this time.
<P>
	I want to encourage Canadian businesses to invest in Cuba. 
Congratulations to Sherritt Gordon which is standing up to this 
legislative thuggery by the United States Congress. It has recently 
convened a directors meeting in Havana.
<P>
	I encourage Canadians to seriously consider spending their 
winter holiday in Cuba rather than in Florida. That would be a 
tangible expression of our support. It is a beautiful country.
<P>
	I support this bill. I urge the people of Canada and the 
Government of Canada to support the people of Cuba by speaking 
out strongly against that repugnant piece of legislation.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise today to speak on the second group of amendments to the 
anti-Helms-Burton legislation which was introduced in the House 
today.
<P>
	Before turning to some of the technical purposes behind these 
amendments I would like to add to some of the comments which 
my colleagues in the House have made, particularly the hon. 
member for Terrebonne, the hon. member for Peace River and the 
hon. member for Burnaby-Kingsway. All of them have indicated 
that they are in agreement with the principles espoused in the bill 
and with the purposes of the amendments.
<P>
	The hon. member for Terrebonne expressed some reservations in 
respect of the timing of the amendments. The hon. member for 
Peace River felt that we should be more aggressively pursuing 
action against the Americans. Perhaps he is getting the tanks in 
Peace River ready to drive down the highway toward the U.S. 
border. His grain trucks will be surrounded by mounted patrols. We 
will see what we can do in that respect.
<P>
	I would like to remind members of the House about the principle 
reasons for which the bill was introduced and then turn to the 
amendments.
<P>
	The hon. member for Peace River put it well when he said that 
we are entering into a period when we have to recognize that while 
we live in a world of free trade rhetoric, in fact, there are constant 
threats against the free trade regime of which the United States 
government purports to be the greatest proponent. The United 
States while talking free trade has long been an active user of other 
non-free trade vehicles.
<P>
	The U.S. uses unilateralism, as it does in section 301 of the 
Trade and Tariff Act. It says to countries: ``If you do not do it our 
way we are going to hit you with trade sanctions, even if it may be 
contrary to our international legal obligations''. It does it 
particularly offensively when it uses extraterritorial measures as a 
way of trying to bring other countries to heel.
<P>
	This is an old problem. We lived through this in the 1950s when 
Ford Motor Company was told under the U.S. export control laws 
that it could not export trucks to Red China from Canada, even 
though it was a Canadian company doing business in China. 
Canadian workers suffered and Canadian jobs were lost, but the 
U.S. made Canada do that because it was part of its foreign policy.
<P>
	Similarly, anti-trust laws were applied in an extraterritorial 
manner to enforce American anti-trust laws which, however 
laudable they might be in their own way, when they are enforced in 
another country contrary to the espoused political purposes of that 
country are unacceptable.
<P>
	As a result, in the last Parliament the Foreign Extraterritorial 
Measures Act was introduced and adopted by the House. It follows 
the model of British legislation and French legislation which has 
both blocking provisions in it and an opportunity to claw back 
excessive damages which have been awarded by United States 
courts. That is another unfortunate aspect of the American legal 
system. That legal system is such that it allows what are called 
treble damages claims.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	This is the threat of Helms-Burton if we want to get into the legal 
nicety of it. The problem that Helms-Burton and much of this 
American legislation when it is applied extraterritorially represents 
is that a Canadian, a non-United States citizen, is threatened with a 
legal action in which $5 million in damages is claimed, multiplied 
by three, which is $15 million.
<P>
	These are used as interim measures to drag people into the U.S. 
courts or ultimately to achieve what has been achieved to some 
extent by this Helms-Burton legislation, a chilling effect. It says to 
people that if they have assets in the United States, if they carry on 
business in the United States, the Americans are going to make it so 
expensive for them that it is not going to be worth their while to go 
to Cuba. It is not going to be worth their while to go to Libya. It is 
not going to be worth their while to go anywhere the Americans do 
not approve of. That is where we have problems with the 
Helms-Burton legislation.
<P>
	We have problems with it because it has been applied in a way 
that is totally contrary to public international law. It gives a cause 
of action for expropriation not to people like the Americans who 
had property in Cuba at the time it was taken. That might be 
acceptable. But it gives it to people who were Cubans at the time. 
These actions will not be started by people whose property was 
expropriated. It will be started by their families, their 
grandchildren.
<P>
	We sympathize with people whose property was taken. We do 
not believe that in public international law property should be 
taken, but it is very clear there have to be rules in public 
international law which set out the parameters under which actions 
of this nature can be undertaken. That is where Helms-Burton goes 
beyond and gives a cause of action for the political reasons the 
member for Burnaby-Kingsway alluded to in his speech to people 
who in normal situations would not have it. As such it is extremely 
troubling to international trading arrangements.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5211"> 5211 </A></B>
<P>
	I have pointed out to my American colleagues what is going 
to happen if Canada decides to do the same thing for example with 
Ukraine. There are one million Ukrainians in this country. Why 
not give a cause of action about all the property that was taken 
in Ukraine? How would we ever be able to do business with 
Ukraine if we adopted that type of approach?
<P>
	What will happen to the United States of America when China 
says to the United States of America that it is going to adopt 
Helms-Burton type legislation in respect of Taiwan? What will be 
the principled response of the United States of America when the 
Chinese government with all its force says to the Americans: ``If 
you carry on business in Taiwan, you will not be able to carry on 
business here. We will do the same to you for the same legal 
reasons that you say you are using for Helms-Burton''. What will 
be the response?
<P>
	The Americans will have no response and that is why 
fundamentally the bill is not really in the interests of the United 
States of America. It is not in the interests of anyone who believes 
in an open trading system because if other countries choose to 
adopt similar measures, we will soon have created a world in which 
no business, no capital and no labour will be able to move around 
the walls that have been created by these treble damages actions.
<P>
	The response we have in Bill C-54 is a principled response to 
that problem. It blocks American attempts to enforce the judgment 
here. It gives a clawback which we are not talking about in 
connection with these amendments. It also increases fines against 
companies which carry on American policy decisions out of this 
country instead of Canadian policy decisions.
<P>
	We believe that an open trading system with Cuba is the best way 
to advance the cause of liberty in that country, the cause of human 
rights in that country, the cause of justice in that country. We have 
pursued those goals consistently and we will continue to pursue 
them. It is not something we are doing on behalf of Mr. Castro or 
some regime in Cuba.
<P>
	This bill ensures an open trading system. We believe if properly 
applied it will ensure that we have open doors, that we will have 
cultural exchanges to enable the Cuban people to see the benefits of 
democracy, the benefits of an open system. That is the way in 
which we will achieve change in that country. We have applied that 
principle consistently in other countries, for example, Vietnam and 
China. There is no logical reason why the same approach cannot be 
applied in respect of Cuba.
<P>
	The second group of amendments which I am presently 
addressing are basically of a technical nature. They address 
problems which relate to the fact that we have had to specifically 
make Helms-Burton unenforceable in Canada. I appreciate the 
acceptance of the amendments by the opposition parties. I 
appreciate their comments that these came forward after the bill 
had been introduced in our committee. The members were there 
when we discussed it.
<P>
	It was felt on mature reflection that we had to address a specific 
problem. The problem is if we in Canada are threatened with a 
treble damages lawsuit in the United States, it is all very well to 
say: ``When that is over, we will get an order from the Minister of 
Justice to block the application of that order in Canada and we will 
be safe in Canada''. But our lawyers are going to ask us how we 
know we will get that order from the Minister of Justice, how do we 
know we will not be dragged into that American lawsuit.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	The lawyers will probably say that we will have to go to the 
United States and defend ourselves. We will probably have to 
spend hundreds of thousands of dollars, maybe even millions of 
dollars, in these large, complicated United States lawsuits to 
defend against a claim which is unmeritorious and should be totally 
unenforceable in this country.
<P>
	For greater certainty, the government has introduced a provision 
which says that right here and now, no judgment under 
Helms-Burton will be enforced in this country. This is a clear 
marker to enable Canadians doing business in this country to know 
that they do not have to participate in a U.S. lawsuit.
<P>
	In my view, this and the other amendments which we are 
presently discussing on the same issue, are clearly a way in which 
we enable our citizens and others carrying on business here to 
know they will not have to participate in that expensive litigation 
game the Americans like to play. They will not have to worry about 
a treble damages lawsuit.
<P>
	I will finish by making just one comment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To conclude, I will make comment on the statements made by 
my colleague from Terrebonne. He said we have been waiting for 
seven months.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you know, and members of this House know very 
well that international negotiations with the Americans are tricky 
and difficult. We acted very responsibly by waiting to see what the 
President of the United States was going to do, since he had a veto 
on this law.
<P>
	As soon as it became apparent that the President would not 
exercise his veto authority on this law, we took action. We took 
action as soon as possible. We introduced this bill to the House at 
the opening of this session. We could have acted more rapidly, but I 
think we could not have acted reasonably to protect Quebecers and 
Canadians on the international trade issue.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>September 19, 1996:-The Minister of Transport-Second reading and reference 
to the Standing Committee on Transport of Bill C-58, an act to amend the Canada 
Shipping Act (maritime liability).</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-58, an act to amend the Canada Shipping Act (maritime liability) be 
referred forthwith to the Standing Committee on Transport.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to begin debate on the 
bill, an act respecting ship owners liability for maritime claims in 
general and for oil pollution damage in particular.
<P>
<B>(1100 )</B>
<P>
	The purpose of this act is to modernize Canadian legislation 
concerning the limitation of liability of maritime claims, which are 
set out in part IX of the Canada Shipping Act and with liability and 
compensation for oil pollution damage set out in part XVI of the 
same act.
<P>
	The revision of the existing limitation of liability for maritime 
claims is a very important step toward modernizing this legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This regime is unique to the marine mode. Its intent is to allow 
shipowners to limit the amount of their financial responsibility for 
certain types of damages occurring in connection with the 
operation of a ship. The limitation is calculated on the basis of ship 
size and applies to all claims arising from the same accident. This 
feature enables the shipowners to assess their potential liability, 
which is an essential condition for commercial insurability.
<P>
	Over the years, the current limitation of liability as set out in the 
Canada Shipping Act has become hopelessly outdated.
<P>
	The regime is based on an international convention adopted in 
1957 and, consequently, the limits of liability have lost much in 
their value due to inflation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This has led to constant efforts by claimants and the courts to 
find ways to break the limitation order and to recover fully the 
losses incurred.
<P>
	Another area of concern is the limitation of liability to the 
owners of vessels of below 300 tonnes, including pleasure craft. 
Recreational boating has by far the largest number of accidents and 
these involve, many times, serious injuries and loss of life.
<P>
	Therefore we need to raise substantially the current limit of 
liability which stands at approximately $140,000, which is 
applicable to pleasure craft so that claimants have a better chance 
of recovering their losses.
<P>
	In short, the inadequacy of the limitation amounts, coupled with 
consistent efforts by claimants to break the limitation to obtain full 
compensation, is the principal reason for the revision of this 
regime.
<P>
	Maritime claims were adopted by the International Maritime 
Organization to replace the 1957 convention. Because the limits of 
the 1976 convention have been eroded also by inflation, the 
International Maritime Organization revised the limits by a 
protocol adopted in May of this year. Thus, our proposal provides 
for the  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5213"> 5213 </A></B>
<P>
adoption of new limits which meet fully Canadian needs at this 
time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	With regard to pleasure vessels, the proposed limit of liability of 
$1 million for loss of life or personal injury will be more in line 
with the liability levels long established in the automobile sector.
<P>
	The new limit is not expected to have any dramatic impact on the 
insurance cost of pleasure vessels. As with other types of 
insurance, it will be the future claims experience of pleasure vessel 
owners which will determine the cost of their insurance under the 
new regime.
<P>
	I will now turn to the second issue presented in this bill, the 
revision of the existing legislation concerning shipowners liability 
for oil pollution damage.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have come a long way since the <I>Nestucca</I> and <I>Exxon Valdez</I> 
incidents on the west coast of North America which first brought 
home to us, particularly to those in my home province of British 
Columbia, the dangers of marine oil spills.
<P>
	In British Columbia we have benefited from the province's role 
as an international maritime gateway, one whose dynamic ports 
channel millions of tonnes of goods around the globe.
<P>
	On the other hand, we must live with heavy maritime traffic 
negotiating some of the narrowest passages in the world and 
bearing cargo that if spilled would spell disaster for our fragile and 
irreplaceable marine ecosystem.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	More than 20 years ago in this House I founded the House of 
Commons Special Committee on Environmental Pollution.
<P>
	From 1969 to 1973, along with various other groups including 
the Canadian Wildlife Federation, the Environmental Defence 
Fund, the Cordova District Fishermen's Union of Alaska and the 
Friends of the Earth in the United States, we were before the U.S. 
courts under the National Environmental Policy Act, 1969 to deal 
with the issue of the then proposed Alaska pipeline.
<P>
	Our court activities were successful. We did, through the courts, 
require that an environmental assessment, including an 
environmental assessment of the marine aspects of that proposal, 
be done.
<P>
	At the time there was an Arab oil embargo, an OPEC oil 
embargo, and President Nixon was determined to change the 
outcome of our legal case.
<P>
	Therefore through a little used device in the American system 
which required the executive and legislative arms of government 
determining that their legislation should not go before the courts, 
we ultimately were denied the fruits of our legal victory.
<P>
	Even so, I should add the issue was hard fought and in the final 
vote in the Senate of the United States there was a tie vote. Then 
Vice-President Spiro Agnew cast the deciding ballot against our 
case.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the battle was worthwhile and success did come in 
a somewhat unexpected way. To obtain the approval of the line, 
many concessions were made.
<P>
	With respect to the sea route, which is the major cause of 
concern for Canadians, many concessions were made with respect 
to the type of ships and marine safety. Yes, there was some eight 
years ago the <I>Exxon Valdez</I> incident. Yes, it is possible there will be 
another, but the risk to our coast was substantially reduced by that 
battle some 20 years ago.
<P>
	In 1989 I again studied this matter for the provincial 
government. It gives me a great deal of satisfaction to recommend 
to the House my study at that time, which runs to 184 
recommendations which I am sure members will find of interest.
<P>
	It also gives me great pleasure at this time to bring forward the 
legislation that will do a great deal to deal with the issue of 
compensation. Bill C-58 will enable Canada to accede to the 1992 
protocols on civil liability and the fund convention.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, the hon. minister's time has 
expired. Is there unanimous consent to give him another minute or 
two?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson:</B> I thank hon. members. I have only a couple of 
sentences left.
<P>
	The amendments to the Canada Shipping Act contained in Bill 
C-58 will harmonize our Canadian maritime liability legislation 
with that of other maritime nations. Equally if not more important, 
the amendments will improve the amount of compensation 
available to claimants for maritime claims in general and oil 
pollution claims in particular.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak on the motion to refer to committee before second reading 
Bill C-58, an act to amend the Canada Shipping Act.
<P>
	As the minister indicated, this bill is to bring the Canada 
Shipping Act up to date and increase the shipowners' limits of 
liability to public and private claimants for oil pollution damage in 
particular.
<P>
	The bill will also bring Canadian legislation in line with a 
number of protocols and international conventions signed over the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5214"> 5214 </A></B>
<P>
past 20 years. The Bloc Quebecois  obviously agrees in principle 
with the objective of the bill.
<P>
	I can tell you up front that all these fine principles will be 
carefully considered in committee to see if they are just as fine in 
practice.
<P>
	In his speech, the minister mentioned the <I>Exxon Valdez</I> disaster.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	We would have liked him to mention the <I>Irving Whale</I> disaster as 
well. As you know, decades ago, this barge sank off the Magdalen 
Islands. This summer, the barge was lifted. It was the property of a 
large Canadian corporation well known not only for its commercial 
activities, but also for certain characteristics that became known to 
the public after the owner died.
<P>
	It became obvious that the owner, the promoter, the founder of 
the Company had made it clear to his heirs that, in business, what 
mattered was interest, but not public interest. The fact that the 
company benefitted from the support of the people and the 
legislation of the various levels of government in the province and 
the country where it was established did not count as much as the 
bottom line, interest.
<P>
	On the positive side, this reminds us that a business is a business 
and, as such, it is ruled by its interests. The expression ``corporate 
citizen'' should be banned from our vocabulary. There are citizens, 
individuals who are dignified with the status of citizens, but, as 
committed as a business may be to the community, it does not have 
that dignity.
<P>
	That is why I think we should ban the expression ``corporate 
citizen''. Without any negative or bitter attitude toward business, it 
is from this perspective that we will be examining the legislation. 
We will ensure that this act goes beyond the current one and makes 
shipowners more responsible, particularly when accidents result in 
the leakage of hydrocarbons in the waters.
<P>
	It is very important to implement a recognized principle in our 
society, namely that the polluter must pay. This is indeed a popular 
principle, but we have to be careful. These days, to justify certain 
bills and given the new ideology, governments often say that 
polluters must pay and so should users, which seems perfectly 
normal.
<P>
	However, implementing this principle is often much more 
problematic, as we recently saw in the legislation imposing user 
fees for Canadian Coast Guard services. As you know, the Bloc 
opposed a number of measures. We fought hard and people said 
time and again that, before imposing new fees, the government 
ought to first clean up the coast guard.
<P>
	We were told about truly shocking administrative practices. Still, 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans dismissed all these arguments 
and did not follow up on any recommendation made by those who 
came to submit briefs. Seventy-five per cent of all those who 
submitted briefs and who made representations were opposed to 
the new fees. Eastern Canada, and particularly the St. Lawrence 
and Great Lakes region, is clearly penalized by this new fee 
structure.
<P>
	This is how a commonly recognized principle in our society, 
namely that the user pays for the services provided to him, is 
applied. This principle was applied to justify measures which are 
harmful to a region of Canada, the St. Lawrence Seaway and the 
Great Lakes, but which benefit the Atlantic coast-but we will not 
get into this again.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc will carefully examine the bill in committee and keep 
in mind what happened with the <I>Irving Whale</I>.
<P>
	To Canadians, it is totally unacceptable that a company could 
renege on its responsibilities, let the government, in other words 
the Canadian taxpayers, pay to refloat its barge and then have the 
government, pursuant to the current legislation, obliged to give the 
barge back to its owner. In a year or two, or maybe just in a few 
months depending on how long it will take to repair the barge, we 
might see the <I>Irving Whale</I> off the Magdalen Islands. It is 
outrageous, since it cost $30 million to Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	The government might be looking for ways to get compensated, 
but I do not think that current legislation gives it the power to do so. 
We will examine the bill in committee in the light of recent events. 
I think we will have some interesting amendments to bring 
forward, based on the briefs we will receive and the evidence the 
witnesses will give during the committee's hearings.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as you are aware, the 
Reform Party's critic for transport, along with several other 
members of the transport committee, was involved in a transport 
problem. Their bus was hit by a flying wheel from another vehicle, 
and so today you are getting the B team. It is most unfortunate. It 
seems to be endemic in the province of Ontario. Maybe they should 
start tying the wheels on to their equipment.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports the hon. minister's motion that this 
bill be sent to committee forthwith. It is good legislation. It 
addresses a problem of great magnitude.
<P>
	There is a longstanding and ongoing problem in the shipping 
industry relative to this which is the indirect cause of an awful lot 
of problems in the marine environment. Many ships are flying flags 
of convenience and therefore it is very difficult to enforce 
environmental regulations, safety regulations, labour regulations 
and so on against them.
<P>
	Canada has some means under existing law of exerting pressure 
on its nationals to register. This mechanism is  simply to deny 
access to Canadian ports to foreign registered ships that do not 
meet our safety, sanitation and environmental standards. However, 
some ships that fly flags of convenience will slip through that net 
even though they do meet those standards. They fly flags of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5215"> 5215 </A></B>
<P>
convenience primarily to avoid labour laws and taxes. It is very 
difficult to deal with these ships.
<P>
	I have a very modest proposal. Since the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage is giving away free Canadian flags, maybe she could give 
some to the Minister of Finance to put on certain ships, of which 
we are all well aware in this House, that are presently flying foreign 
flags.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the Minister of Transport. I 
would also like to put on the record that the official opposition 
parties appear to be in favour of this legislation.
<P>
	It is an historic day for the House of Commons. This legislation 
will complete the job of environmental protection, as far as 
substances such as PCBs are concerned, as it will regulate their use 
and transport in Canada.
<P>
	We have a law in Canada today which prohibits the use of 
polychlorinated biphenyls. That law was brought in by a former 
minister of the environment in a previous Liberal administration, 
Madam Sauvé. It followed the adoption of other great bills by the 
Liberal administration of the day: the Environmental Protection 
Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and the Fisheries Act, 
which govern the protection of the environment as far as the oceans 
are concerned. This will complete that protection. It will not only 
ensure that polychlorinated biphenyls are not present in our 
environment, it will also increase the liability for those companies 
which have to move the PCBs.
<P>
	It is one thing to outlaw a substance such as polychlorinated 
biphenyls, but it is another matter to move it to the location which 
has been chosen to destroy it.
<P>
	I would again like to congratulate the Minister of Transport. This 
is a wonderful bill. I also congratulate the opposition parties for 
agreeing with it.

	The House resumed from October 7, 1996, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-26, an Act respecting the oceans of Canada, be 
read for the third time and passed, and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I stand today to speak on Bill C-26, an act 
respecting the oceans of Canada.
<P>
	Many speakers have dealt with this bill since it was introduced in 
Parliament, and everything would indicate that, true to the spirit of 
his party and of the government, the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans will refuse to entertain the amendments proposed by the 
official opposition.
<P>
	It must be said that the Prime Minister and his cabinet have a 
tendency to draft legislation without taking into account the official 
opposition's criticisms and analyses, which are all the more 
significant since they often represent the concerns of those most 
affected by the actions of the government, and that the government 
responds only to the large corporations that give substantial 
amounts to the Liberal coffers. The lobbyists that gravitate around 
the government are so powerful that we have to ask ourselves who 
really runs the country. Is it the Prime Minister, from his offices in 
the Langevin Block, or the Yonge Street moguls?
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	In any case, there are so many examples of this that it would take 
all the time allocated to this debate to list them all. I propose to 
examine Bill C-26, before the House today, and you be in a better 
position to understand my point of view.
<P>
	The rules proposed by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans are 
certainly commendable in many respects. Setting up a system of 
standards to regulate the marine sector and allied industries 
demonstrates a willingness to harmonize the government's vision 
with the outlook of the major players in this field. However, if we 
take a closer look at the main elements of this bill, we see, 
surprisingly, that this is not the case.
<P>
	Let us take, for example, the pleasure craft registration plan. If 
the minister limited this scheme to the registration of merchant 
vessels and tourist ships, it would provide for a better control of 
shipping. In this perspective, the government could ensure a logical 
and accurate classification of craft. But this is not the case. The 
minister is proposing to have all types of craft registered, whatever 
their intended use. Can you imagine the costs related to such an 
initiative? I think the minister's idea is totally absurd and suggests 
a certain lack of vision on the part of his advisers.
<P>
	The minister's bill proposes a fee schedule based on the type of 
craft, ranging from $5 to $35 annually. Would it really be
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5216"> 5216 </A></B>
<P>
necessary and appropriate to register one's pedal boat for $5 a 
year? I ask the question, Mr. Speaker, and it has nothing to do with 
the minimal costs involved.
<P>
	Of course, the first year, Canadians will be told they must pay a 
$5 annual fee to register their pedal boat. So it may be $5 the first 
year, but since the government will have the self-financing of this 
registration system as a short term objective, I can assure you that, 
within five years, the cost of registering a pedal boat will no longer 
be $5, but $20, $25 or $30 annually. But the government is not 
telling us that now.
<P>
	It is nice to know that ridicule never killed anyone because if it 
did, while we are debating this absurd idea, all the flags in this 
country would be lowered at half-mast and Canadians would be in 
mourning for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	But let us get back to what interests us, rather than the minister's 
state of mind. Setting aside the legislative excesses of the minister 
himself, this bill is the result of public consultations. At least, that 
is what the minister says. According to research done by the Bloc 
Quebecois, three quarters of the witnesses that appeared before the 
fisheries committee said they were against the introduction of this 
legislative measure. The Canadian coast guard itself carried out a 
series of consultations in which almost all those interviewed were 
against the proposed fee structure.
<P>
	If you are still with me, and I am sure you are, you should see the 
connection with my introduction very easily. I continue.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	In no way has the coast guard taken into consideration the 
representations and testimony heard during its consultations. From 
this point of view, what makes the minister think he can draft even 
the most elementary bill? I put the question again.
<P>
	With a consultation process that was biased from the beginning, 
it was inevitable that they would come up with a hodge podge of 
vaguely logical standards that are so ridiculous as to defy 
comprehension, which in the end is rather typical of the present 
government and its leader.
<P>
	Furthermore, one is entitled to wonder how appropriate it is for 
the coast guard to register all pleasure craft for control purposes, 
when this body, which reports through the department, only patrols 
the St. Lawrence, the Saguenay, the Richelieu and the Ottawa 
rivers.
<P>
	Why should the coast guard take it upon itself to tax pedal boats 
on the Lac de l'Est, when the coast guard will never in its life be 
seen on that lake, its work in Quebec being limited at present to the 
St. Lawrence, the Saguenay, the Richelieu and the Ottawa rivers.
<P>
	They would have us believe that the user pay concept is 
involved, but what about the thousands of lakes and the hundreds 
and hundreds of navigable rivers in Quebec? In my region, for 
example, there is Lac Aylmer, little Lac Saint-François, big Lac 
Saint-François, Lac Bisby, Lac Rond, Lac à la Truite, Lac William, 
Lac Bécancour, and Lac Bolduc by Saint-Méthode, where people 
will eventually have to pay to register their rowboats, 6 h.p. 
outboards, and pedal boats, but where no Canadian coast guard 
officer will ever be seen.
<P>
	The real reason, the reason the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
is trying so desperately to keep from us, is very simple. 
Furthermore, the coast guard official from Quebec mentioned it. 
He came right out and said it: ``We are $14 million short in our 
operating budget''. I bet that getting the missing $14 million will 
cost the coast guard some $16, $18, or $20 million in 
administration costs, salaries and paper work. That is 
administration as this government sees it, and clear proof of what 
the federal government really has in mind, and particularly of its 
roundabout way of getting what it wants.
<P>
	Still, I never would have believed that the government would 
stoop so low as to make people register pedal boats, rowboats or 
kayaks. Why not those little rafts that we probably all built as 
teenagers in May, then left to rot away on shore when fall came 
around? And all for the purpose of cost recovery.
<P>
	Of course, people might well support charging registration fees 
for seadoos or high power launches. But imposing a fee for a 
sailboard, when the coast guard provides no services to its owner, 
might be overdoing it just a bit. And they dare bring up the concept 
that is so popular right now: user pay.
<P>
	The minister does not even stop there; he proposes a pleasure 
craft handling course, and fines, somewhat along the line of the 
firearms safety courses that are given everywhere in the country. 
Could the department be intending to make the owners or operators 
or rowboats and pedal boats take training? You can see just how 
silly it could all get.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	I cannot help but be amused at the idea of my children having to 
take a pedal boat handling course, or my son Martin having to pay a 
fine for having done some fancy acrobatics on his sailboard. Of 
course he would have to have been caught in such an act on the 
St.Lawrence, Richelieu, Saguenay or Ottawa rivers, for the coast 
guard does not, of course, patrol Lac Aylmer behind my house, nor 
indeed other lakes such as big Lac Saint-François or Lac de l'Est.
<P>
	I just mentioned the less subtle measures in this bill. I could have 
taken an entirely different approach to demonstrate the absurdity of 
the proposed legislation. The hon. member for Gaspé broached the 
subject, without getting the slightest bit of attention from the 
minister. At best, certain amendments may be discussed, but the 
impact of that exercise is predictable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5217"> 5217 </A></B>
<P>
	The federal government, through its Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans, has once again shown its lack of concern for public 
consultation. The public disagrees with the principle of this bill, 
and the government insists on adopting it regardless. One wonders 
about the real motives of this government, in the course of an 
exercise that has been under way for nearly a year.
<P>
	We can readily conclude that the federal government is once 
again trying to invade the jurisdictions of the provinces, not only 
by wanting to control vessels on the waterways of Quebec and 
other provinces but also by setting certain environmental control 
standards, which clearly gives more extensive powers to the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans while diminishing the role of the 
Department of the Environment.
<P>
	The minister is intent on duplicating controls within the federal 
government itself, at a time when we are all desperately trying to 
limit and reduce this phenomenon as it occurs between the central 
government and the provinces. No doubt about it, the minister is 
going through a serious power crisis, which may explain the 
leadership problems within cabinet and the Prime Minister's 
failure to make him see reason.
<P>
	Before I finish my speech, I would like to draw your attention to 
a situation that is even more critical and revealing of the 
government's intentions. Bill C-26 does not make it incumbent on 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to reach agreement with other 
members of cabinet, any more than with officials of the 
Department of the Environment. This situation could lead to the 
kind of overlap and duplication that has not existed so far but will 
with the forthcoming passage of Bill C-26, since the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, on the basis of the mission he has given 
himself, will be able to appropriate the role of the Minister of the 
Environment as he sees fit.
<P>
	The federal government would have the public believe it is intent 
on putting its financial house in order. Why not call a spade a 
spade? The people of Quebec are starting to understand what the 
federal government is really driving at and it will soon be in a 
position to establish its own rules, and I for one certainly hope so.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	Instead of chasing after people with pedal boats or rowboats 
using them for recreation on provincial waterways such as Lac 
Saint-François, Lac William, Lac du Huit, Lac à la Truite or Lac de 
l'Est, in my riding, the Liberal government would be better off 
ensuring that the 2,000 jobs in our asbestos mines can be kept.
<P>
	Instead of going after young people, instead of asking that boats 
such as pedal boats be registered, what is the government waiting 
for to invest equivalent amounts of money in defending the 
asbestos industry, to fight against  the type of misrepresentations 
that were aired on TV5 in the special report called ``Amiante: 50 
ans de mensonges''-50 years of lying about asbestos?
<P>
	To conclude, I again urge the government to listen to its 
ambassador to France, who only two weeks ago suggested it launch 
a major campaign to promote the safe use of asbestos.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member from the Bloc who just spoke is doing 
exactly the same thing as the other Bloc members are doing 
concerning this bill.
<P>
	He is concentrating, as the hon. member from the Gaspé did, on 
just six or seven clauses in the bill. There are 109 clauses in the bill. 
The Bloc has picked out six clauses, about that, from clause 47 to 
52, regarding the wording that the minister ``may''. It is not the 
minister ``shall''. It is not the minister ``will''. It is not the minister 
``has to''. It says ``the minister may'' do this or that.
<P>
	Then it has to be published in the <I>Canada Gazette</I> after 30 days 
of its passing. Then it goes before a committee of the Statutory 
Instruments Act and to be reviewed by a House of Commons 
standing committee.
<P>
	The hon. member has not even commented on the main thrust of 
this bill, which is that the Canadian government on behalf of the 
people of Canada is declaring an economic zone, that there will be 
an exclusive economic zone that runs 200 nautical miles out from 
the territorial sea which goes to the low water mark.
<P>
	An historic bill in the House of Commons by the Government of 
Canada to protect the marine resources and the seabed of Canada is 
the main purpose of this bill.
<P>
	All one has to do is read what the Department of Justice has put 
in the summary of the bill, which is exactly what I said, to meet the 
changing law at the United Nations under the United Nations law of 
the sea convention.
<P>
	They decide to not even comment on that. What they are talking 
about are fees that were introduced under previous legislation that 
enabled the minister to do this or that in the past. Under this act, the 
six sections they are dealing with, it does not say the minister 
``shall''. It says the minister ``may''. There is a whole procedure 
under this act that the minister has to go through.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member will stand in the House and praise the 
government for the general thrust of this bill that will protect the 
fishing rights of the fishermen of the north shore of Quebec and the 
Gaspé.
<P>
	For once a government in Canada is turning around and doing 
what a lot of other nations have done in this world. We should have 
done this years and years ago. However, it is to the credit of this 
administration that it is now being done.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, if my colleague had 
only listened to my whole speech, and not only to the parts he did 
not like, he would know that I think some components of Bill C-26 
are commendable.
<P>
	However, for this strategy to be implemented successfully, we 
had better define the relations between partners clearly. Why is the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans interfering in provincial 
jurisdiction once again? There is Lac Aylmer, big Lac 
Saint-François, and Lac Bisby, where the water is barely 18 inches 
deep. You want to have licences for pedal boats? This is utterly 
ridiculous. These taxpayers will never see a coast guard officer.
<P>
	I can just imagine the Minister trying to get teenagers of 14, 15 
or 16 years of age to take a training course on the basics of pedal 
boating. Are you seriously trying to run the country, Canada, by 
interfering in such a blatant and clumsy way in areas under 
provincial jurisdiction?
<P>
	Then there is Saint-François River, that I used to go down on a 
makeshift raft when I was a kid. Will children at play have to get a 
$5 to $20 licence from the department when everybody knows that, 
according to the user pay principle, we should pay for services we 
get, patrols for instance?
<P>
	In this regard, I named the bodies of water where the coast guard 
mighty be seen, but in my riding, in all of the Eastern Townships, 
we never see a coast guard officer. What we will see is collectors. 
To begin with, the fee for a pedal boat will be $5 but, again, in five, 
six or seven years, $5 will escalate to $60 or $70. This is utterly 
ridiculous.
<P>
	This is why we in the Bloc Quebecois are afraid of these new fee 
setting powers, and why we did not hesitate a moment to 
vigorously condemn Bill C-26; of course, all of us in the Bloc 
Quebecois will vote against it. I sincerely hope that the Liberal 
government will sit down and go over the consultations it held, as 
well as those held by the coast guard, and change its mind. To err is 
human, and going ahead with this piece of legislation will be one of 
the worst mistakes the government has made over the past two 
years.
<P>
	In spite of a few good things in Bill C-26, when you look at the 
whole thing, it is glaringly obvious that it must be defeated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague, the 
member for Frontenac, explained the position of the Bloc 
Quebecois on Bill C-26 very forcefully in his comments to the 
member for Gander-Grand Falls, and I admire him for it.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is not opposed to the purpose, to the validity 
of a national strategy on ocean management. However, we have 
always said that the relationships between the partners involved 
should be better defined, and this was supposed to be at the core of 
the bill. That is what my colleague said; failing such a clear 
definition, we are very concerned about the new powers the 
minister is grabbing under this bill.
<P>
	The minister did not have all those powers before, and look at 
the horrendous things that went on last spring. It is certainly not for 
the beauty or the grandeur of Canada they are proposing a national 
strategy. There are other reasons behind these new powers of set 
fees.
<P>
	If Canada really wants its national strategy to succeed, it will 
have to establish clear relationships with its partners. The member 
for Gander-Grand Falls knows what I mean. He has been in this 
House for 22 or 24 years in this House; he has seen Tory prime 
ministers. He will recall that there once was a Liberal premier in 
his province called Brian Peckford. Mr. Peckford was a fervent 
defender of cod conservation but he never got a hearing in Ottawa 
as long as the Tories were in office.
<P>
	If we want to avoid repeating past mistakes-and the hon. 
member for Gander-Grand Falls will surely agree that the good 
standing of the prime minister or his success on the campaign trail, 
both in Ottawa and Newfoundland, will not go on forever-so, if 
we want to prevent bickering in the future, we must clearly define 
the roles of all partners and the relationships between them. That is 
what we must do. I am sure that my colleague shares my views on 
this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, under the Constitution 
Act of 1867, there is a division of powers. There is little doubt that 
navigable waters come under federal jurisdiction, since many 
people in this huge country could use waters like the St. Lawrence 
River, the Richelieu River or the Ottawa River, too name only a 
few. We agree with that.
<P>
	However, I mentioned a moment ago some lakes in Northern 
Quebec. There are thousands and thousands of lakes and rivers 
which, I am sure, are totally under Quebec jurisdiction. The 
minister is trying to assume control of navigation on lakes by 
requiring the registration of boats, and I am not prepared to accept 
that. We must condemn such action.
<P>
	I remember the former Liberal Prime Minister, Mr. Trudeau, 
who, little by little, assumed powers which were not federal to start 
with. His philosophy was a weak Quebec and a strong Canada, the 
goal was to bring the provinces down to the level of small 
municipalities. These was your goal, was it not? You were in this 
House at the time. We will not let you do it. We will not let this 
government do it and I can guarantee that we will make sure that 
Quebec jurisdiction is fully protected.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5219"> 5219 </A></B>
<P>
	Once again it is shameful that the Liberal Party, using its 
majority in the House, should impose a fee structure so ridiculous 
that it will require registration of all boats and penalize children 
who are simply going to play on the rivers and the lakes. The 
Liberal Party will be held responsible for penalizing young people, 
in Quebec and elsewhere in this huge country.
<P>
	Once again I urge the government to sit down with the provinces 
and talk strategy with its partners. You are not the only government 
in this country. There are other provinces, there are two territories. 
Do you think that the other provinces are willing to give up their 
jurisdiction? I do not think so. If you give an inch to the federal 
government it will take a foot and if you give it a foot it will take 
every last body of water.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	I hope the government will review its positions and will reread 
the notes from consultations it held throughout the country, since 
more than three quarters of those who were consulted are opposed 
to Bill C-26.
<P>
	This reminds me of the Prime Minister, who said last week that 
General Boyle was the best and that there would not be a new 
defence minister every 12 months, as under the Conservatives. He 
insisted on defending his general and his defence minister, and 
today, the whole house of cards is collapsing. I think you and I, Mr. 
Speaker, could get a bet going on how long General Boyle will keep 
his job. Will he hang on till the end of the week?
<P>
	In conclusion, I urge the government to show some humility by 
withdrawing large portions of Bill C-26, particularly with regard to 
the registration of craft on small bodies of water under provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-26, the oceans act.
<P>
	I am going to deal with very specific areas that the government 
and previous governments have failed to deal with in an extremely 
important aspect of Canadian society. The oceans surround our 
country on three sides. Within those oceans exist enormous 
opportunity and responsibility: commercially, socially, with 
respect to protecting the environment and the species that live 
within them. These waters can benefit not only Canadians but also 
people around the world.
<P>
	First I want to speak about the minister's plan dealing with the 
commercial fishing strategy, which to me, living in British 
Columbia, is a huge disappointment. The various sectors in the 
commercial fishing groups have met with the minister and have 
expressed concrete, specific and reasonable proposals that are fair 
to everybody and would save our fisheries for today and into the 
future.
<P>
	Instead, the minister proposed the Mifflin plan which 
unfortunately is going to decimate the commercial fishing strategy 
on the west coast. It will produce an east coast disaster on the west 
coast. This is an entirely preventable situation. What is the minister 
going to do?
<P>
	The minister is going to centre the commercial fishery into a 
very small number of hands. He is decreasing the number of fishing 
boats, which is a good thing, but instead of doing it in a fair way, he 
is making sure that commercial fishing in British Columbia is in 
the hands of a very small number of large players. The outcome 
will be great unemployment among the commercial fishing sector. 
The little communities up and down the coast of British Columbia 
that have survived for decades on fishing for their livelihood will 
be decimated. The social implications cannot be underestimated.
<P>
	It is clear to everybody in the House what it means to a small 
community to have its single industry ripped from it. This does not 
need to happen. Because of the fees being implemented, the 
commercial fisheries in British Columbia will be in the hands of 
the large boats and producers. The little people will be out of a job, 
out of work and up the creek.
<P>
	An intelligent strategy needs to be put forward. Along with 
scientists, the minister should define what the allowable catch 
should be. That information should be given to the different groups 
that will decide for themselves how they are going to divide it up. 
In that way the government does not get involved in how this will 
be done and it does not get the flack for it. The sole responsibility 
lies within the different commercial fishing strategies themselves. 
It would also include the sports fishing strategy which must not be 
underestimated as it has been in the past.
<P>
	In British Columbia there are 300,000 sports fishermen. These 
individuals inject billions of dollars into the British Columbia 
economy every year.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	This minister and previous governments have utterly ignored 
this important sector. They tell them how much fish they can catch 
every year far too late. For example, beginning in January are the 
first trade shows for the sports fishing groups in British Columbia. 
They need to know before these shows how much they are allowed 
to catch, where they are allowed to fish, to be able to get visitors 
and tourists from around the world to come to our waters to fish.
<P>
	Last year those data came down in the spring. As a result visitors 
who would normally come to the waters of British Columbia to fish 
said they are not coming because they believe there will not be any 
fish to fish and they do not know how much they can fish. A lot of 
people from around the world felt there was simply no salmon to 
catch in British Columbia. That is an avoidable tragedy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5220"> 5220 </A></B>
<P>
	If this continues the sports fishing groups within British 
Columbia will be decimated at a huge loss to British Columbia 
and the Canadian economy.
<P>
	These data are available in November. I am proposing that the 
minister, with scientists, determine how many fish the sports 
fishing groups can take and where they can take it from. The 
minister will let them know what that catch is going to be by 
December 1. That is a challenge I put to the minister of fisheries 
and the people who work in the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans.
<P>
	If he can do that one thing then our sports fishing groups will 
have the opportunity and the ability to get fishermen from around 
the world to come to Canada, to spend their money and inject 
money into the Canadian economy. This can happen and I implore 
him to do this now rather than waiting until the spring when it is too 
late.
<P>
	One of the things the minister is not doing is addressing the 
commercial fishing strategy in an intelligent fashion. He is not 
setting appropriate limits, he is setting them too late and he is not 
enabling them to divide up the catch among themselves in a way 
that is appropriate.
<P>
	Many intelligent ideas have come from commercial fishing 
groups such as catching at the mouths of rivers or outside of certain 
areas and not setting up a wall of net so that the fish do not get 
vacuumed out of the ocean. The minister must let the fish go up the 
river in adequate numbers to lay their eggs and smaller fish to come 
down later one. If he does not do this the stream will die.
<P>
	The minister has been negligent in addressing the whole aspect 
of enforcement. It is critically important when you are speaking 
about enforcement that it take place fairly and equitably regardless 
of nationality, the colour of skin or ethic origin. It is imperative that 
the minister tell his Department of Fisheries and Oceans officers 
who are currently hamstrung by the upper echelons in the 
bureaucracy that they must enforce the law to the benefit of all.
<P>
	I do not care who you are, everybody will benefit by the fair and 
equitable enforcement of the law. Currently that is not happening. 
A blind eye is given to certain segments of our society that fish and 
poach. The officers of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and 
the RCMP are told not to deal with them because the government is 
afraid of having a confrontation with these people or being labelled 
racist or anti-aboriginal, and that is not acceptable.
<P>
	It does a huge disservice to the aboriginal people who, for 
example, are fishing within their limits in a fair and equitable way, 
as the vast majority are, and who are interested in having a long 
term sustainable fishery. It does a huge disservice to the 
non-aboriginal community members who feel left out of the loop 
and who feel they are being treated as second class citizens. One 
law for  everybody and it has to be enforced. That way you get 
respect for the laws of the land. Without that no respect exists.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	The minister must also bring together the people who actually 
damaged the environment in which the fish are living. Habitat 
rejuvenation is one of the key elements in rejuvenating our west 
coast fishery. There are a large number of streams that have been 
decimated by logging and mining.
<P>
	It is important that these streams get back to where they were but 
it is equally important that the taxpayer not pay for that. Those who 
actually polluted are those who should pay. That is where the 
minister's job comes in. That is where the minister has to take a 
leadership role and say ``you damaged the stream, you are going to 
fix it up but we are going to work in a co-ordinated way to provide 
you with the ability to do this''. Perhaps some tax benefits for 
doing this would be advisable.
<P>
	In doing that we can rejuvenate our streams, increase the flows 
of wild stocks of salmon and thereby increase the economic 
viability of our west coast fishery. All of these things are 
interwoven and all of them must be addressed: adequate dealings 
with the commercial and sports fishing sectors, setting adequate 
limits for all of those groups, habitat rejuvenation, law 
enforcement.
<P>
	If the minister could stop studying these issues and start acting 
on them, perhaps we will be able to save our west coast fishery 
instead of looking into the eyes of the east coast disaster.
<P>
	Another aspect that is critically important on the west coast 
which this bill could deal with but does not is the whole aspect or 
lighthouses. It has been shown quite unequivocally that the 
destaffing of lighthouses on the west coast is going to have a 
negative effect on the safety of the people who ply our waters in 
that area. It has been shown not only from a safety aspect but, more 
important, from an economic aspect. If we are going to deal with 
cold, hard facts, let us deal with them.
<P>
	If we destaff a lighthouse it is going to cost the taxpayer more 
money to service that lighthouse than if there were somebody there 
right now. The amount of money that person actually puts into 
maintaining that lighthouse far exceeds that person's wages, far 
exceeds the cost to the taxpayer. It is senseless and utterly idiotic to 
destaff lighthouses on the west coast.
<P>
	I implore the minister before it is too late to look at this again, 
look at it intelligently, look at the facts. I am sure he will come to 
the conclusion that it is better not to deman our lighthouses on the 
west coast.
<P>
	There are also other local initiatives that can be supported. The 
western marine community in British Columbia has put a proposal 
for the funding of our coast guard. It is a sensible proposal. It is a 
proposal that would not cost the taxpayer more money. It is a 
proposal that would provide for effective coast guard search and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5221"> 5221 </A></B>
<P>
rescue responses in British Columbia. I ask the minister again to 
look at this very good proposal by the western marine community.
<P>
	As well, there are a lot of local initiatives where the people have 
come together to put forth search and rescue capabilities in the 
smaller communities which are not easily serviced by the coast 
guard. These are inexpensive ways of providing safety on the west 
coast. The minister can take a leadership role not by putting more 
money into the system but by encouraging these initiatives with the 
local groups and again have a user pay situation.
<P>
	I am sure the boaters who ply the waters on the west coast will 
not mind paying for this service that they will desperately need at 
some time in their lives.
<P>
	Another large area that this bill does not deal with and one that is 
very close to my heart and I am sure the hearts of many Canadians, 
in particular the youth of Canada, is the environment. As we speak, 
there are huge problems with respect to pollution within our 
oceans. That is manifested, for example, in the elevation of toxic 
carcinogenic, teratogenic materials such as PCBs and many other 
substances that are going through our food chain and are 
magnifying themselves as they go up the food chain. The outcome 
of that is these animals are dying but in the larger area we can see 
that if we are at the top of the food chain, these toxins and 
carcinogens are also accumulating within us.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	We may think this is not a problem, but I would draw the 
attention of the House to the Arctic. The people who live in the 
Arctic are suffering from greater teratogenic effects, genetic 
abnormalities and cancer rates than would normally occur. The 
reason this is occurring is that toxins and carcinogens are 
accumulating in the food chain. When people eat, the toxins and 
carcinogens accumulate in them and the outcome is a medical 
disaster.
<P>
	I plead with the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, the Minister 
of Health and the Minister of the Environment to bring forth 
intelligent and effective solutions to this problem. It cannot be done 
in isolation. The pollutants in our Arctic also come from other 
Arctic countries.
<P>
	I was in Yellowknife earlier this year where the countries of the 
Arctic got together to discuss this issue. I had hoped to see some 
action. Unfortunately they chose to study the problem and create an 
Arctic council to look at the problem. The time for studying and 
examining has run out. The time has long past for another royal 
commission or for a House of Commons committee to study the 
problem. We need action now. The people of the Arctic need action 
now. If anyone doubts me, let them go to the Arctic and let them 
look at the horrible  diseases which are affecting those people. It is 
going to get worse.
<P>
	We are a leader in a number of areas. One of the areas in which 
we are a leader is research. On the west coast, in Victoria, there is a 
superb research facility which provides research that is 
commercially applicable and scientifically applicable. Scientists 
from all over the world look to us and derive information from our 
research for their own uses.
<P>
	Cuts must be made, but we should not cut important research. 
The research done in these areas will have a dramatic effect on our 
society which will benefit all of us. It would be penny wise and 
pound foolish for us to cut research in these areas.
<P>
	A few years ago we had an excellent opportunity to be a world 
leader in fish farming. The Chileans took it away from us because 
we let them. Icelanders came to us a few years ago and said: 
``Canada, we are very good at fish farming. We are very good at 
managing our fisheries. Let us work with you in developing 
co-operative strategies to improve commercial and sports fishing 
within Canada''. They went home disgusted. They went home 
despondent. They could not believe that Canada did absolutely 
nothing to save its fisheries. They saw the potential which existed 
within our great country. Why could we not?
<P>
	Our fisheries and our oceans provide an enormous opportunity. 
With that opportunity comes a great responsibility. We have done a 
huge disservice to the oceans. Instead of taking a proactive, 
intelligent and effective role in managing our fisheries and oceans 
we have abrogated that responsibility to the detriment of this 
sector. We will pay for it in the future. It is not too late to do 
something about it. I know the minister would like to work with my 
colleagues in the Reform Party and with members of the Bloc 
Quebecois. Together we can work with members of the public and 
interested sectors to provide good, effective strategies to save our 
commercial and sports fishing and our oceans and their 
environment.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	I put that challenge to the minister. I welcome his response 
forthwith.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I wonder if the hon. member could comment on the 
general thrust of the bill which is of course aimed at conservation, 
aimed at better fisheries management and the fact that Canada is 
now declaring its own 200-mile exclusive economic zone outside 
the territorial sea for management and conservation purposes. 
Perhaps the member would praise the federal government, praise 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the parliamentary 
secretary for finally taking this magnificent move for the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned the fact that toxins and pollutants 
are getting into the streams and waterways in the province of 
British Columbia and in other parts of  Canada. Does he agree with 
a recent move by the Canadian government, this administration, 
instead of using toxic chemicals such as Matacil and fenitrothion 
and other chemicals over wide areas of forest land in our provinces, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5222"> 5222 </A></B>
<P>
to the biological use of bacillus thuringiensis, commonly referred 
to as BT? This was developed in Canada by Canadian scientists. In 
fact, the scientist who developed it was Professor Smirnoss in the 
Quebec region.
<P>
	Does the member agree with the shift away from the use of 
chemicals in forest protection and in other areas, which chemicals 
inevitably find their way into the streams and thereby into the 
oceans?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
fact is that we cannot manage a 20-mile zone, let alone a 200-mile 
zone. That is the reality we face on the west coast.
<P>
	For example, right now fishing boats are vacuuming our oceans, 
going offshore taking fish and putting them on commercial packing 
and freezing vessels from other countries on the Pacific rim. This is 
all done under the table. Enforcement officers and the coast guard 
know this and absolutely nothing is done.
<P>
	I know the member is very sympathetic and is involved and has 
done a lot of good work for the people in his area. He knows this is 
happening.
<P>
	We can extend the zone out to 500 miles if we want to, but it will 
not make any difference because there is no political will to do 
anything about it. That is the problem: political will. The rest is 
merely a sham.
<P>
	I implore the hon. member who has worked so hard for his 
people to put pressure on the minister, as we are trying to do, to 
provide effective solutions within the 20-mile zone, the 200-mile 
zone, or whatever zone he wants to extend it to, because it is not 
happening now.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	To answer the member's other question, the DFO bureaucracy is 
extremely top heavy. It is working against the very good people in 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans on the ground who feel 
extraordinarily frustrated. The best DFO officers are moved away 
from their areas of most effectiveness to areas where they are least 
effective. This is happening to them right now purely because of 
political reasons. They are doing this because the DFO bureaucracy 
at the top do not want to see these people carrying out their jobs 
because part of their job is politically incorrect.
<P>
	The DFO bureaucracy are afraid of actually living up to the rules 
and regulations upon which they are supposed to operate but do 
not. The DFO officers on the ground who are committed, hard 
working individuals want very much to save our fishery for 
everybody. It breaks their hearts and demoralizes them to see their 
own bureaucracy hampering them. Those are the facts.
<P>
	To answer the hon. member's last question, I agree with him that 
the movement away from chemicals that are teratogenic and 
carcinogenic and damaging to the environment is excellent. He 
raised the example of BT, a Canadian discovery. I would also 
remind the hon. member that we are probably not going to have any 
more BT discoveries in Canada because research has been gutted 
by his own bureaucracy and ministry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened with a 
great deal of interest to the member's speech. The facts are quite 
different from the arguments he made here.
<P>
	The member is trying to do two things at the same time. His 
party makes an argument as to why there should be further cuts in 
every department of government. Then he gets up in his own local 
interest, decries the government for the cuts it has made in trying to 
balance the budget and have a streamlined administration of 
departments, such as fisheries and oceans.
<P>
	Quite clearly he cannot have it both ways. He cannot have the 
leader of his party or his finance critic get up day after day in this 
place and say: ``Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut'', and then get up during 
debates in the House of Commons and criticize the government and 
say: ``Do not cut; put more resources in''.
<P>
	I am quite familiar with this diverse view that is shared by 
members of the Reform Party. As chairman of the committee that 
examined this bill, I had to live with it almost daily. Members of 
the Reform Party would sit down and agree with the individuals 
who came and made submissions. They indicated quite clearly that 
this bill was long overdue, that it was a courageous act by the 
minister of fisheries of the day, who is now the premier of 
Newfoundland, and the Prime Minister of Canada to come forward 
with such a consolidation.
<P>
	Each time they would agree with the witness but when it came 
time to debate the principles and to support what the evidence had 
told us during the committee hearings, they ran away and scattered. 
And then they get other members who were not on the committee 
to stand up in this place and try to have it both ways. That is not 
going to be the case today.
<P>
	The member just said that this government and the current 
minister and the previous minister basically did not have the 
intestinal fortitude to deal with the issues of the day. I would ask 
him whether or not his party supported, when we were at 
committee, the consolidation of programs and legislation inherent 
in the oceans act.
<P>
	Did Reform support the efforts of this government to go in and 
reduce a bloated bureaucracy in many departments, including 
fisheries and oceans which was reduced by 40 per cent, most of 
which was at head office? Did Reform support the efforts of the 
former minister of fisheries and this government in going before 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5223"> 5223 </A></B>
<P>
the court of world opinion and saying no to overfishing when it 
came to Spain and the raiding of our turbot stock on the nose and 
tail of the Grand Banks?
<P>
	The member cannot have it both ways. Is he prepared to get up 
and tell us that yes, in those areas we have been courageous and 
yes, that what we have done is right, not always what was easy but 
that we have taken our responsibilities as we should have as a 
government? If he is, then it is fairly clear to me he is more 
concerned about playing to a diminishing local audience of 
supporters in his riding instead of getting up here and engaging in 
the type of vigorous and knowledgeable debate that is normally the 
case when bills come before this place.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am glad the hon. member agrees with me that the former minister 
did not have the intestinal fortitude to make the changes that are 
required to save our country's fisheries.
<P>
	Let us examine the kinds of cuts this government is prepared to 
make. In my riding, in Sooke which is about 35 or 40 kilometres 
from Victoria, the government closed the local DFO office. Why 
did it take two active enforcement fisheries officers away from 
Sooke, one of the most active fishing areas on the west coast? Why 
did it close that office? Because it wanted a half day secretarial 
position in Victoria. These are the types of cuts this government is 
prepared to make, what it calls effective cuts. It gets rid of two 
enforcement officers and puts forth one half time equivalent in a 
secretarial position.
<P>
	I would like to go on but I know I do not have the time. If those 
are the kinds of cuts this government is prepared to make and is 
making, we do not support that at all. We support effective cuts that 
will get rid of the bloated bureaucracy here in Ottawa in an 
effective way. Bring the power to the local people. Support local 
initiatives and give the DFO officers the backing they require.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-26, an act respecting the oceans of 
Canada.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to allow the coast guard to charge for 
its services, including navigational aids and ice breaking, by giving 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans the power to impose such 
fees.
<P>
	This bill also deals with the environment, as well as the 
registration of pleasure craft by the coast guard and related fees, 
aspects I will address later.
<P>
	The imposition of fees for coast guard services is another fine 
example of a measure taken without really consulting or 
co-operating with the main stakeholders, and without knowing the 
real impact this will have on the affected regions.
<P>
	Bill C-26 is a fine example of the current Liberal government's 
real consideration for the respective roles of the federal 
government and the provinces. In fact, it is impossible to 
understand or to accept that this bill places the provinces on the 
same level as any other player like lobby groups, municipalities 
and industries. This shows a blatant lack of respect and common 
sense, and we are entitled to think this bill may provoke several 
other conflicts between Ottawa, the provinces and the various 
stakeholders.
<P>
	As for consultations, the Liberal government behaved in its 
usual fashion. It pretended to consult and listen, but it always ends 
up doing what it wants without considering the comments made by 
other parties. All the witnesses who appeared at the hearings held 
by the fisheries and oceans committee deplored the coast guard's 
decision making and consultation process, especially the fact that 
the minister went ahead with the new fee structure without first 
assessing the economic impact on shipping and related industries.
<P>
	Furthermore, 75 per cent of witnesses asked the minister to call a 
moratorium on the new fees while waiting for the impact studies 
commissioned for this fall. The witnesses also suggested that the 
minister co-operate with the shipping industry in carrying out 
economic impact studies. Finally, there was a clear consensus 
among the stakeholders from the St. Lawrence River and the Great 
Lakes, in particular the Governments of Quebec and Ontario, 
against the minister's proposal, which was deemed totally 
unacceptable.
<P>
	Everyone agreed that, to avoid causing irreparable harm, we 
should wait for the results of ongoing studies. But, not surprisingly, 
the minister completely disregarded all these recommendations 
and objections, and decided to go ahead with his fee structure, with 
no regard for its potentially devastating effects on jobs in the 
shipping industry, a very developed economic sector, especially in 
Quebec.
<P>
	How else can we explain that, after weeks of consultations where 
stakeholders from all regions and all sectors told the government 
not to go ahead with its proposal, the original version of the bill 
was not amended in any way? Once again, the costs will trickle 
down to the public through the user pay principle. This is nothing 
but a smoke screen.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	What is really ridiculous is that there is no indication that the 
coast guard even tried to downsize its operations before passing on 
these costs. According to the testimony, the government simply did 
not do its homework and ensure that such an effort was made.
<P>
	We therefore find ourselves in the situation where, instead of 
downsizing its staff, the government is imposing fees on the 
industry and thus jeopardizing not only the industry but the jobs 
that depend on it. There is no indication that the coast guard made 
any effort at all. If the coast guard, which is costing us over $860 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5224"> 5224 </A></B>
<P>
million a year, had managed to streamline its operations, that 
would have meant less money to collect from those who use its 
services.
<P>
	Moreover, it is difficult to know what services are actually 
provided by the coast guard. There was no real effort to make in the 
most logical and convincing way possible a rational demonstration 
of the services actually provided to those users and that from now 
on will have to be paid by the population.
<P>
	The federal government, for the purpose at hand, is dividing 
Canada into three regions in order to regionalize its fee policy. 
Even though the problem is completely the same from east to west, 
the government is dividing Canada into three big regions: west, 
central, that is the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River, and 
finally the maritimes. As if by chance, Quebec is the one being 
taken for a ride since, along with the Great Lakes region, it will 
assume some 48 per cent of the $20 million that will be collected 
this year.
<P>
	Thus Bill C-26 is dividing up the fee structure very badly 
between different regions and different Canadian harbours. 
Consider for example the ship crossing the Atlantic to unload its 
cargo at Sept-Îles. It will have to pay a much higher fee for services 
whereas the ship going to Thunder Bay will have nothing to pay. 
Yet the latter navigated 3,700 kilometres more on the river, a 
waterway maintained by Canada.
<P>
	Another example: the Canadian owner of a ship registered in a 
foreign country will pay seven times less than the owner of a ship 
registered in Canada. The finance minister is certainly aware of this 
fact. These two examples show that the fee structure presented in 
Bill C-26 is causing problems. Many things are unfair in this piece 
of legislation. Whether it is plan B or mere chance, this bill is sure 
to greatly impair the competitiveness of Quebec ports compared 
with ports in the maritime provinces.
<P>
	Another major problem is the drop in competitiveness of ports in 
the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes compared with American 
ports. On the one hand, ships passing through the St. Lawrence and 
the seaway to reach the United States will not pay for coast guard 
services if they do not stop at Canadian ports. That is a serious 
threat to the competitiveness of the St. Lawrence and Great Lakes 
ports.
<P>
	How competitive will our ports be, as compared to those in the 
northern U.S. states? Take for instance a ship coming from Europe. 
It goes in the St. Lawrence River estuary, makes its way up the 
river, goes by Saint-Lambert, ends up in the Great Lakes and heads 
straight for Pittsburgh. It pays nothing, even though it used the 
channel, the water and the St. Lawrence. It pays for the locks in 
Saint-Lambert, but it is getting the rest free. On the other hand, the 
small coastal trade carrier on the North Shore, or on both shores of 
the St. Lawrence will be hit hard.
<P>
	Moreover, the user pay principle advocated by the minister is not 
consistently applied. In several instances, in Sept-Îles and 
Port-Cartier for example, users will pay up to $5 million a year for 
only one buoy.
<P>
	Finally, the fees the minister intends to apply are only the tip of 
the iceberg since they cover only navigational aids. Harbour and 
seaway dredging and icebreaking in the seaway are other targeted 
services for the imposition of fees.
<P>
	These other fees might be much higher than those for 
navigational aids and we have every right to be concerned about the 
survival and competitiveness of the St. Lawrence harbours, 
especially the port of Montreal and several ports in the regions.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	However, several amendments to these clauses were brought 
forward by the Bloc Quebecois, especially by my colleague, the 
hon. member for Gaspé, who went to great pains to find a way to 
work with the government. The proposed amendments tried, for 
instance, to make the fees principle more fair and to force the 
minister to co-operate with the industry and the provinces before 
applying or increasing the fees.
<P>
	The amendments would have prevented the minister from acting 
unilaterally, without taking into consideration public consultations, 
as he did when the fees were first introduced back in June 1996. Of 
course, the minister continued to turn a deaf ear, as his government 
likes to do.
<P>
	Now let us turn to the environment aspect of the bill. The bill 
also deals with environmental issues in a way that will affect the 
Department of the Environment. This new bill will transfer to the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans powers currently belonging to the 
Minister of the Environment. This is a further example of overlap 
between these two departments. Again, it is like yin and yang, as 
the former Minister of Fisheries Brian Tobin told a parliamentary 
committee last year, when he commented on the relationship 
between him and Sheila Copps, the Minister of the Environment at 
the time, by saying that it was like yin and yang.
<P>
	By creating more overlap, Bill C-26 seems to establish a sectoral 
environment department, something like a department of coastal 
environment.
<P>
	If each department did that, we would end up with an 
environment transport department in the Department of Transport, 
or with an environment industry department, and all the 
government's ministers would have powers regarding 
environmental protection and preservation. We can easily imagine 
how dangerous it could get if environmental issues were to be 
addressed by various 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5225"> 5225 </A></B>
<P>
departments. If this is the way this government wants to go, then it 
only has to abolish the environment department.
<P>
	The government's approach to the environment is to centralize 
powers in Ottawa because of the national interest and of the 
globalization of environmental problems. Of course, Bill C-26 
matches this approach.
<P>
	Some clauses give the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans the 
powers to develop and implement a national strategy for the 
management of estuarine, coastal and marine ecosystems. This 
strategy calls for the development of activity management plans, of 
managing or advisory agencies, of numerous programs and of 
environmental standards, as well as the collecting and analysis of 
scientific data on the ecosystems concerned.
<P>
	We must realize that several of these activities were already 
being carried out by the Department of the Environment. This is 
another case of duplication, as if we could afford such overlap 
among federal departments.
<P>
	Nothing in the legislation compels the minister to reach 
agreements with other federal departments or the provinces. In 
most cases, he can ask for the co-operation of other authorities, but 
only if he wishes to do so.
<P>
	Such duplication, in the long run, will jeopardize the 
effectiveness of environmental action. It is incomprehensible and 
unacceptable for the minister not to have to work in co-operation 
with the officials of other federal departments, in particular the 
Department of the Environment. There should have been more 
reflection and more consultations on these points before such 
changes were made, since in environmental matters, partial 
responsibility is tantamount to responsibility for the whole 
ecosystem. When one tries to do too much, one ends up doing 
nothing right.
<P>
	Finally, Bill C-26 is another step towards centralization in 
environmental matters. In 1988, the Supreme Court of Canada, in a 
four to three decision, dispossessed the provinces of the 
management of the marine environment and territory in favour of 
the federal government. Today, with Bill C-26, the federal 
government is trying to get the most out of that ruling. This trend 
toward centralization may lead the federal government in the 
medium or long term to try to claim overall management of waters 
and their use.
<P>
	Let us talk now of pleasure boating. A real user pay principle 
implies that we go and ask the people who use these services which 
one they really want to have. Furthermore, the people who are 
going to have to pay for this service have the right to be heard. 
They are asking the government if the service will be offered to 
them at the lowest cost, taking into account what the 
socioeconomic and human impacts will be for them.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	The principle of user fees is not respected at all in Bill C-26 
since the coast guard has announced it intends to make major 
changes to pleasure boating in all the country's waters. 
Consultations have been announced, but knowing the importance 
the federal government attributes to the results of consultations, we 
have no reason to believe that it will be any different with the coast 
guard.
<P>
	In its partnership plan, the government neglected to say that, 
behind this initiative, there is the recovery of $14 million, whatever 
what the people will say during the consultations. This is basically 
a hidden tax hike badly disguised as an effort to promote user 
safety.
<P>
	Among other measures, the coast guard wishes to register all 
types of craft, from the 30 foot sail boat to the row boat. Moreover, 
fees for all types of craft will be collected by requiring all users to 
get a registration permit at cost of $20 to $35 annually. The 
governement also wants to require minimum skills for everyone 
who handles a boat and to introduce a system of fines similar to 
those that apply to drivers.
<P>
	According to the coast guard, these measures are essentially 
aimed at increasing safety on the water by improving the skills of 
small pleasure craft users. But one has to be blind not to see that 
safety is only an excuse to impose a fee structure. It is hard to see 
how paying a $20 to $35 fee to put a boat in the water will make 
people more cautious. It is a well known fact that information and 
awareness are the best ways to change behaviour.
<P>
	I would also like to take this opportunity to say a few words on 
the impact of this bill in a riding like Drummond. In Drummond, 
there are great numbers of pleasure craft, and water sports are very 
popular. In those conditions, you can imagine the impact of a fee 
system on pleasure craft in an area like mine. Even the possibility 
of fees on pedal boats and sailboards has been raised.
<P>
	Just think of the impact on all the small and medium size 
businesses which rent this kind of equipment during summer 
months and which will have to pay registration fees in addition to 
all their other expenses. All these companies, which do not make a 
lot of money, will have to pay additional costs to register their 
boats. Will people who rent this kind of equipment be more 
cautious because of the fees?
<P>
	People who own boats, for their pleasure or for renting, are being 
designated as users of coast guard services. But in a riding like 
Drummond, there is no coast guard. The main waterway used for 
pleasure boating is the Saint-François River, a small river running 
between Lake Champlain and Lake St-Pierre. It is not a river like 
the Ottawa, the Richelieu or the Saguenay, which are patrolled by 
the coast guard.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5226"> 5226 </A></B>
<P>
	But the thousands of recreational boaters who use the small 
navigable portion of that river will have to pay for coast guard 
services in the same way as those who sail on the St. Lawrence. 
And yet the least we can say is that we do not often see icebreakers 
on that river during the winter.
<P>
	In conclusion, why should we adopt this type of fee structure 
today? Have we done all we can to try and find another solution? 
Absolutely not. Through Bill C-26, the federal government is 
launching an attack against Quebec by imposing service fees, and 
we must not forget that this comes with the divestment of ports.
<P>
	On the one hand, the government is opening the door to an 
interesting future by decentralizing the management of ports but, 
on the other, it is increasing service fees on the St. Lawrence, which 
will make ports in the maritimes a lot more competitive. So what 
the government is giving in terms of autonomy, it is taking away by 
changing the rules and by imposing service fees that are unfair to 
Quebec ports.
<P>
	In Bill C-26, the government takes the liberty of transferring the 
coast guard to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans without 
knowing exactly if there will be a reform and if services provided 
by the coast guard meet users' needs, all that without allowing 
users to have their say in the matter.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	We cannot predict the economic consequences Bill C-26 will 
have on users. No serious study has been made. Yet the government 
is going ahead with this legislation, saying that we will see how it 
goes. When we look at the various pieces of legislation the Liberals 
have introduced, very often it has not gone well because of 
constitutional or economic problems.
<P>
	The government does a lot but achieves nothing. This bill is very 
typical of the way this government has been acting. Again it is 
interfering unilaterally in all areas without any real consultation, 
which does not solve anything. On the contrary, it creates 
problems.
<P>
	As a member of the Bloc Quebecois, I will vote against this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I understand what the hon. member is doing. Like other 
members of the Bloc, she is concentrating on fees which will be 
charged by the coast guard. She is suggesting that the fees will be 
charged on bathtubs as well as on pedal boats.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member could comment on the main 
purpose of the bill before the House today. I wonder if she could 
comment on the main thrust of the bill. It is an incredible piece of 
legislation. It is an historic piece of legislation.
<P>
	There is no agreement with another nation. It is taking a 
convention of the United Nations and it is saying that Canada will 
manage conservation systems on behalf of the people of Canada. 
The zone will be extended 200 nautical miles outside the territorial 
sea, which is 12 miles, which goes from the low water mark all 
around the coasts of Canada.
<P>
	This is an incredible piece of legislation. We have not seen the 
likes of it since Canada was created. It is what is commonly called 
the EEZ, the exclusive economic zone. The Liberal administration 
promised to bring in this bill during the last election campaign. The 
United Nations has held meetings on this subject for years, 
advocating that this was the way to go for conservation purposes.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member can stand in her place to praise the 
Liberal government for taking such an historic step as declaring the 
exclusive economic zone, which is the main purpose of the 
legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard: </B>Madam Speaker, I believe these are the same as 
the comments and question directed at my colleague, the member 
for Frontenac, so my discourse will be almost the same as his as 
well.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is not against a national oceans strategy. 
What the Bloc Quebecois is critical of in Bill C-26 is that the 
minister had announced that he would take the various partners in 
the shipping industry and the provinces into account. Right now, 
what we are seeing in Bill C-26 is that he did not do this. Instead, 
he turned a deaf ear, as usual.
<P>
	I congratulate my colleague, the opposition critic for fisheries 
and oceans. He did an excellent job, and tabled amendments, which 
once again the government has ignored.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	I think that one person who truly saw the need for changes in this 
bill, because he comes from a region that depends on the fishery, is 
my colleague, the hon. member for Gaspé. He was completely 
ignored, as were the various stakeholders in the shipping industries 
and the provincial governments.
<P>
	What we are criticizing is the lack of a clear policy to define the 
relations between the various partners. We are also criticizing the 
fact that, under the Constitution, it was established that navigable 
waters come under federal jurisdiction. Along comes Bill C-26 and 
in they charge once again, as my colleague, the member for 
Frontenac was saying, duplicating services and meddling in 
provincial affairs.
<P>
	I was referring earlier to my riding. In my riding of Drummond, 
there are people who use the small Saint-François river, people who 
belong to organizations such as Chasse et Pêche, recreational 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5227"> 5227 </A></B>
<P>
boaters, owners of small sailboats and so on. My mandate is to 
represent  these people, who came to me and said that they hoped I 
would speak out against this completely ridiculous fee structure. 
That is why I have taken part in the debate on Bill C-26 today, to 
make known the needs of my riding and the wishes of those who 
elected me.
<P>
	It would seem that government members have no problem. They 
have no representatives, no small lakes, no small rivers, and no 
constituents opposed to this bill.
<P>
	It is revolting that they should ask my daughters, who have a 
pedal boat, to register it, telling them they must do so because the 
coast guard is supposed to be looking out for their safety. The 
public is not stupid. That is my comment in response to the 
question from my Liberal colleague.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened with a 
great deal of interest to the hon. member's speech. I understand that 
the member opposite is doing what she thinks is best with respect 
to protecting the interests of her constituents.
<P>
	I want to say two things. She devoted most of her speech to the 
proposed fee structure for recreational vessels. I guess that is fine. 
It is her nickel, she can do what she sees fit.
<P>
	I believe it would have been wise for the member to check the 
degree of consultation that went into the formulation of the bill and 
the almost unprecedented level of acceptance by the government of 
recommendations from committee members to change the bill after 
it came to committee.
<P>
	The member said something which is not true, which is not 
based in fact. Members of the Bloc Quebecois would like to stand 
in their place on every single issue that comes to the House and 
paint it black and white, that everything is somehow against the 
rights of Quebecers. This government governs as a national 
government. For the member to stand in her place and indicate that 
the province of Quebec was not consulted on this legislation is 
simply untrue.
<P>
	In the lead-up to this legislation the department and the minister 
consulted extensively with the bureaucracy of the government of 
the province of Quebec. Indeed, in a previous life as chair of the 
committee that studied the bill, I can tell the House we asked the 
minister responsible in the province of Quebec to come and testify 
before the standing committee so we could find out the concerns of 
the Government of Quebec. However, the minister declined. What 
were we supposed to do? Were we supposed to play footsie with the 
separatists in Quebec City and drag them kicking and screaming to 
a House of Commons public hearing on this legislation to find out 
what was their position?
<P>
	Members of the Bloc Quebecois sat on the committee and had 
full access through me as the chair to talk about the interests of 
Quebec and since they are supposed to be a national opposition, to 
talk about the interests of Canada with respect to this bill.
<P>
	I am quite frankly getting a little tired of accepting these 
statements by the Bloc Quebecois which are not based in fact. The 
people of Quebec, like the people of Ontario, Nova Scotia, British 
Columbia and the Northwest Territories, had access to the 
committee throughout the process. They still have access through 
members of Parliament. For anybody from the Bloc Quebecois to 
get up and say that access was denied to the people of Quebec is 
simply false and cannot be tolerated in this place.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Madam Speaker, the Liberal member can go ahead 
and make a fine long speech, but I would like to point out to him 
that the problem at present is that the relationships between the 
various partners are not clear.
<P>
	What I would like to have him think about is this: how can it be 
that, last June, the B.C. representatives slammed the door because 
they felt they were not being paid attention to? Just as I feel that my 
Liberal colleague is not paying attention to me, the same principle. 
How is it that the B.C. representatives slammed the door?
<P>
	Let him spare us the reply that they are just the Bloc Quebecois' 
demands, that it is just Quebec, and that it would be done just for 
Quebec. We too are in agreement with a national strategy, but one 
discussed among the various partners, not unilateral.
<P>
	What is being asked for and what all the partners are asking for is 
very clear: a six month time frame in order to study the situation 
and reach an agreement between the partners. That is what is being 
asked for.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it seems to be 
quite a long time ago since we first had an opportunity as a 
Parliament to debate this legislation. It was introduced in a 
previous session of Parliament, but the government, and I think all 
members of the House, in their wisdom thought that this was the 
type of bill that should be reintroduced and not be allowed to die.
<P>
	This legislation is very important. As my colleague from Gander 
said earlier, it is historic legislation. Many times in opposition and 
in government I have been critical of the slow processes of 
government when it comes to rectifying wrongs by way of process 
or when it comes to trying to consolidate various arms and 
regulatory bodies of government so that the public good is 
executed and dispatched in a fairly hasty manner.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5228"> 5228 </A></B>
<P>
	One of the areas I have always been concerned with is that when 
we start dealing with ocean management as distinct from fishery 
management there are far too many cooks at the pot. Far too many 
departments and programs have some vague cross jurisdiction that 
really stops the imperative of coming up with a comprehensive 
policy for the management of Canada's oceans and the resources 
that are inherent in it.
<P>
	As the member from Gander indicated, even to modernize the 
territorial boundaries, the water boundaries, the economic zone, the 
12-mile limit, all those regulations and legislation had to be 
modernized. Because over 14 different departments all could claim 
some degree of responsibility in jurisdiction for the various and 
complex issues relating to ocean management, many times the 
problems would be identified but leadership was clearly lacking in 
the past to try to pull all of those various departments, programs 
and ministers together and to have someone who instinctively, 
inherently and by law had the responsibility to lead on this issue.
<P>
	This bill sought to rectify that. It is for the first time a 
comprehensive approach to ocean management based on the 
precautionary principle of sustainable development and integrated 
resource management.
<P>
	This bill was first introduced by the former minister of fisheries, 
who is now the premier of Newfoundland. It staked out his territory 
very firmly after he was appointed minister of fisheries. It 
indicated that he was prepared not just to talk tough but to take 
tough action in order to preserve our fish stocks.
<P>
	If anybody doubts the resolve of that former minister of 
fisheries, currently the premier of the province of Newfoundland, 
he need only look back and see that for the first time in our history 
he stood up against international bullying in the rape of some of our 
transborder and highly migratory stocks off the east coast of 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	He was the minister who stood up and said: ``I am prepared to 
say that there will not be another species lost in our ocean on my 
watch''. He was prepared to take on the Spanish and the European 
Union. He was prepared to stand tall. He was prepared to lead to 
ensure that the wrongs of the past, the scattered responsibility with 
management of our ocean resources with regard to the fisheries, 
were going to come to a close.
<P>
	That former minister of fisheries did not just gain the support of 
his colleagues on the government side, he gained the support of his 
colleagues in the Reform Party, in the New Democratic Party, in 
the Conservative Party and indeed in the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	As I recall, looking back at the issue of the great turbot dispute, 
the current premier of the province of Quebec, who was the then 
leader of the opposition, supported the  measures which we put into 
legislation in this place to ensure that we had the legal tools at our 
disposal to stop that type of overfishing which had decimated 
stocks on the east coast of Canada and was a contributing factor to 
thousands of Canadians on the Atlantic coast of Canada being 
thrown out of work.
<P>
	It should not be any surprise to the Bloc Quebecois, to the 
Reform Party or to any Canadian that it was that same minister at 
the time who said there is another piece of unfinished business, to 
come up with a comprehensive consolidated approach not just to 
fisheries management but to ocean management.
<P>
	I do not think it is easy at any time to go to cabinet and say to 
other ministers: ``There are certain pieces of legislation and certain 
jurisdictions which we have in our departments and are part of our 
responsibilities as ministers. But I think they should be removed 
from your areas of responsibility because it is in the greater public 
good that it be a consolidated approach to ocean management''. 
That minister did that and the current minister continues in his 
footsteps. He saw fit to make sure that this bill, the bill that we are 
debating today, was reintroduced in this Parliament.
<P>
	This bill consolidated activities in 14 different departments. It 
made it extremely clear that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
was the one in the government, in the cabinet who had primary 
responsibilities to ensure that Canada had a comprehensive oceans 
policy. It made sure that some areas of jurisdiction which dealt with 
Canada's oceans and how we manage them were consolidated into 
one department. It put the Canadian Hydrographic Service, the 
coast guard services and many other programs and agencies of 
government under one roof and put them under the sole jurisdiction 
of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	The opposition has talked at great length about the fee structure. 
I can understand its concerns. This government has ensured that 
when it came to the striking of new fees with respect to coast guard 
services that there has been broad consultation.
<P>
	For the member opposite to indicate there has not been some 
type of a public process by which the proposals could be debated, 
adjudicated and if necessary changed is simply not the case. I 
remember quite clearly, because I am concerned about the impact 
of coast guard fees on the commercial shipping and also as they are 
applied to recreational boaters, that there was a process in place 
which was led by the commissioner, Mr. Thomas of the coast 
guard, now the associated deputy minister of fisheries and oceans. 
He led a very open and transparent approach. He went into the 
lion's den in places like Quebec City, Halifax, Saint John and St. 
John's. He was also on the west coast of Canada. He said: ``These 
are the fees that we are proposing for coast guard cost recovery. I 
am prepared to listen and to find out what the impact is of these 
fees and what is a fairer approach''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5229"> 5229 </A></B>
<P>
	As much as I may be concerned about the impact I know that 
I and the people I represent have been allowed to have a say 
through a very transparent process. For the opposition to hone in 
on this one area where it has concerns and to neglect to speak 
about the rest of the bill tells me what an effective opposition it 
has not become after three or four years in this place.
<P>
	The other thing this bill does, and it is very important, is for the 
first time it recognizes the importance and sets up a structure to 
implement a thing called marine protected areas. Many lobbyists in 
the past said that because we were first and foremost a maritime 
nation with literally tens of thousands of miles of nooks and 
crannies along our three coasts, the Arctic, the Pacific and the 
Atlantic oceans, there was a requirement in the management 
structure and in the line of responsibility for the establishment of 
marine protected areas.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Indeed this government has received accolades not just from 
those in Canada who have an interest in this field but from people 
around the world.
<P>
	This piece of legislation sets in place a process for the 
establishment of marine protected areas. Once again Canada has 
shown that it is prepared to put its money where its mouth is when 
it talks about conservation not just within Canadian national waters 
but also in the international waters for species which are 
endangered for whatever reason, whether toxic pollution, 
overfishing or any other reason.
<P>
	We had unprecedented consultations. If opposition members 
wish to give a true reflection of how this bill came about they will 
have to acknowledge from the documents that were provided to 
them as opposition members of the committee that there was an 
almost unprecedented level of consultation with those affected in 
the industry prior to this bill.
<P>
	The Canadian Arctic Resources Committee did a tremendous 
amount of invaluable work to ensure that those in its sphere of 
influence who had a reason to be concerned about the new Canada 
oceans act were fully consulted. At the end of the day, the Canadian 
Arctic Resources Committee gave full marks to the federal 
government and to the ministers involved for being bold enough 
and for having the foresight to come through with such a 
comprehensive piece of legislation.
<P>
	In the committee which I was very pleased to chair at the time 
we heard from individuals from around the country. In the interest 
of trying to save money, the committee did not travel since its takes 
a lot of the members' time which they need for other 
responsibilities in this place and in their constituencies. Instead we 
used teleconferencing which other committees have done in the 
past.
<P>
	We used teleconferencing in Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and the 
west coast. We listened intently.  Positions were put forward by 
many of the presenters to indicate there could be improvements in 
this bill. The committee examined those improvements. I believe 
many of those individuals who participated in that very broad 
consultative process would agree with me that if there were ever a 
committee that did its work and that truly had an impact on a final 
piece of legislation it was this committee.
<P>
	The minister responsible at the time had given me his 
undertaking that if we dealt with the bill in a fair and reasonable 
manner, he would be prepared to accept any amendments that 
bettered the bill. As a result, what we heard in these very broad 
consultations at the committee stage resulted in a substantial 
number of amendments which were moved and agreed to and 
which have now found their way into this piece of legislation. In 
my view they have made this piece of legislation a much stronger, 
more enforceable and supportable piece of legislation.
<P>
	The member for Gaspé, who is not only a good friend of mine 
but also has a deep and abiding interest in the fisheries and oceans 
portfolio, might remember this, as we would all remember. During 
one of our teleconferences we heard from some fishermen in Nova 
Scotia. The member for St. John's West will remember this clearly. 
The fishermen were wailing away at the government and the 
committee for coming in with these changes which were going to 
do all these terrible things with respect to access fees in the 
fisheries.
<P>
	We all scratched our heads and out of respect for our witnesses I 
asked: ``Has anybody there read this bill?'' They answered that 
they had not read it all but that Mr. Chisholm had. As it turned out 
he was the person who would soon become the leader of the New 
Democratic Party in the province of Nova Scotia.
<P>
	He had done something which I think was very unfortunate. I 
want to put it on record today that he was irresponsible in his 
approach to this bill. He obviously did not read it. If he did read it, 
he did not comprehend what was in it, which would not be a 
surprise.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	What he did was misrepresent, in a major way, the provisions of 
the bill. He tried to tell the fishermen in Nova Scotia whom he 
purports to want to represent as the premier of the province of Nova 
Scotia, since he is now the leader of the New Democratic Party, that 
this bill had to be opposed because it was going to impact on access 
fees for the fisheries. This bill does absolutely nothing of the sort.
<P>
	Anyway, I digress. I just wanted to make sure that the record 
showed unfortunately that the time we spent with some of our very 
good witnesses who gave up their time in Nova Scotia was spent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5230"> 5230 </A></B>
<P>
trying to correct a misapprehension that was either intentionally or 
unintentionally put forward about the impact of this bill  by the 
current leader of the New Democratic Party in the province of 
Nova Scotia.
<P>
	This is a good piece of legislation. I would have hoped that the 
Bloc Quebec would have recognized it. I understand it has have a 
particular bend. Every time something comes up in the House of 
Commons it feels compelled to get up and see it as somehow 
something that infringes on the legal rights and obligations of the 
people of Quebec.
<P>
	I also understand, because I can be highly partisan at times, that 
this can take on a partisan tone. I would have thought that in 
dealing with a bill that had such broad support across Canada and 
internationally, the Bloc for once would have laid down the 
increasingly discredited arguments for sovereignty and dealt with 
the substance of the bill on behalf of those Quebecers, just like the 
rest of those in Canada, who have an interest in Canada's oceans 
and conservation who would have been well served by this bill.
<P>
	I still appeal to them-there are still probably a few more 
speakers left-to drop this silly approach to legislation. After all, 
in the greatest of democratic traditions, although it is somewhat 
repulsive to some Canadians, the Bloc Quebecois is the official 
opposition, properly and duly elected by its constituents. It holds 
the second highest number of seats in this place.
<P>
	As such, in dealing with bills such as this, which have broad 
implications and very positive implications for Canadians in all our 
provinces, it should deal not as a separatist opposition but as the 
official opposition and work with the government, not just in 
committee but also on the floor of the House.
<P>
	I guess, again, it is not in its interests to show that the House of 
Commons and the committee structure work well for all 
Canadians, no matter what their language, no matter what their 
colour, no matter what their creed or their province of origin.
<P>
	To Reform Party members I would like to say that we heard 
during the committee hearings and since then that they have some 
concerns with respect to the fee structures as proposed by the 
Canadian coast guard on cost recovery. They have a right and a 
responsibility to debate those things on behalf of their constituents 
and indeed all Canadians. I look forward to the continuing debate 
on that issue.
<P>
	Let Reform members also look beyond this narrow yet important 
aspect of the subject matter at hand today and deal with the overall 
bill, whether or not this government and its ministers should be 
applauded for being so bold, so innovative and so forthright that 
they opened up a process and asked Canadians to give their input in 
a consultative process. It has taken many of their suggestions and 
come forward with what most in the world who have an interest in 
this area would agree is a  milestone piece of legislation, a piece of 
legislation that will become a model for many other states.
<P>
	In conclusion, there is still some unfinished business with 
respect to the consolidation of various pieces of legislation and 
responsibilities. At the end of our hearings we had indicated that 
we wanted to see a few more things done with respect to the oceans 
act.
<P>
	We thought there should be a further committee study done, 
perhaps a joint committee, between the Standing Committee on the 
Environment and the Standing Committee on Fisheries and 
Oceans, to look at a further consolidation of part VI of the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act relating to ocean dumping, 
pollution and waste as well as certain provisions of the Arctic 
Waters Pollution Prevention Act within the Canada oceans act.
<P>
	In recognizing that we have gone quite a long way, we must also 
recognize there may be a ways to go yet.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	Let us not condemn the government for being bold and taking an 
initiative that was difficult to put together but has such positive 
results for Canadians. I hope that this bill would be able to garner 
the high level and degree of support in this place that it has 
garnered with the Canadian public and the international 
community.
<P>
	Because it is probably the last time I can do this with regard to a 
bill that I might have had something to do with by way of process, I 
want to thank all the members of the committee, my colleagues in 
the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party, and in particular my 
vice-chair at the time, the member for St. John's West, for their 
incredible dedication and hard work. At the end of the day they 
proved that this place does work when you get good people who are 
committed to public service. I want to thank them for that type of 
commitment and for the example they have shown.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, to begin with 
I would like to say hello to my colleague for Dartmouth. I had not 
seen him for a while. It is true that we no longer sit on the same 
committees.
<P>
	I would like to go over some of the points he made in his speech, 
and above all mention that indeed the Bloc Quebecois did help 
improve this particular point in the bill. We did not oppose the 
main thrust of this legislation, namely the national oceans 
management strategy.
<P>
	Nobody can oppose virtue, but to make sure that we go beyond 
wishful thinking and that this becomes more than a pile of papers 
on a shelf, we must ensure that the partners in charge of developing 
and implementing this management strategy feel comfortable with 
the lines of communication that are established with them. I can 
tell you right away that if we cannot define clearly, with 
everybody's agreement, the kind of partnership it will be, the 
national oceans management strategy will not be  worth the paper it 
will be written on. This is the gist of what we have been saying in 
the House, and this is also what we opposed in committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5231"> 5231 </A></B>
<P>
	The member for Dartmouth is quite aware of this. The then 
fisheries minister, Mr. Brian Tobin, even assured us that the spirit 
of partnership would be respected. But when people are told that 
they will be respected, when an individual provides a definition and 
is told that there is no problem with it, how is it that it does not 
appear as the preamble to the definition of what the national oceans 
management strategy will be? How can this be?
<P>
	If the member for Dartmouth had carefully looked at the subject 
of today's debate, he would know that we are dealing with an 
amendment to postpone third reading for six months. Why? In fact, 
to give the government a chance to remedy these flaws, define 
partnership, and clarify the grey areas in the bill. With regard to the 
environment and open spaces, we are told by the federal 
government that it does not want to intrude on matters of provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Fine. You do not want to intrude? Fine. We will make sure this is 
very clear when we enter into partnerships. Since the government 
needs the provinces to act as partners with respect to this strategy it 
should say so. Why all the secrecy? They accuse us of partisanship. 
Let me remind you, and the member must remember, that the Bloc 
was the first to extend a helping hand when Brian Tobin wanted 
legislation against overfishing on the nose of the Grand Banks. We 
reached out and offered our co-operation.
<P>
	I remember, and I think the parliamentary secretary was present 
at the time, that we passed a bill through all three stages in one 
single day. That is real co-operation, not stubbornness. Today we 
ask that the same good faith be applied in the case of a strategy we 
feel is necessary. If we want it to pass and be efficient afterwards, 
we must respect that.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	To conclude my comments, I would like to ask the parliamentary 
secretary a question: if relationships are so clearly established, why 
is it that a premier, namely Mr. Glen Clark, a man I greatly respect, 
slammed the door during the premiers' conference in June because 
he felt Ottawa was not listening to what he had to say on fisheries 
management and all related problems he was faced with at home?
<P>
	Mr. Clark has now reached an agreement with the present 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans whereby they will see what 
powers they can share. That is the type of relationship we must 
develop and should find in this bill. So if what the Bloc member 
said is false, if we are blinded by sovereignty, how is it that 
someone at the other end of the country, someone definitely in a 
different party, is reporting the same problems as we are? How can 
that be? That is my question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Madam Speaker, it is good to get into a bit of a 
debate with my good friend and colleague from Gaspé. However, 
members of the Bloc Quebecois have to learn at some point that 
each piece of legislation which comes before this place is not an 
opportunity to rewrite the Constitution of Canada. That is exactly 
what they do. Every time something comes up they either see it as 
an affront to the powers of the province of Quebec or they think the 
bill should be rewritten to give more powers to the province of 
Quebec.
<P>
	It is obvious that the previous government sought, within the 
Canadian context, to rebalance the powers between the federal and 
provincial governments. There is a process to do that. It should not 
be done, with the greatest of respect to my colleagues, on every 
piece of legislation that comes before this place.
<P>
	I want to make this abundantly clear to anybody who cares to 
listen. This bill does not shift powers away from or to any 
government in Canada. The powers of the province of Quebec are 
respected in this legislation. The powers of the federal government 
are not enhanced by this legislation. The responsibilities of 14 
different departments have been consolidated and transferred to the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans, under the jurisdiction of the 
minister.
<P>
	Perhaps Bloc members could speak to the principles of the bill 
instead of wasting their time in the House by getting up and talking 
about constitutional matters.
<P>
	I say to the member, as I said to the previous speaker, it is 
absolute nonsense for any member of the Bloc Quebecois to 
indicate that, under the Canada oceans act, the government of 
Quebec was not asked for input and did not have an avenue to be 
heard. The member's voice was loud. It was strong. He participated 
in the committee process, as did some of his colleagues. It was a 
very transparent and open process which showed what can happen 
when we have transparent and open processes and people who are 
prepared to work within the committee structure of this place. It 
was a model, in my view, of what can be done when good people sit 
down and use the rules which they are given through the 
parliamentary committee structure.
<P>
	I say once again that there was plenty of opportunity. We heard 
from Quebecers during our committee deliberations. We did not 
hear from the minister responsible in Quebec. That was not because 
we did not ask, it was because the minister did not want to appear.
<P>
	Perhaps the vision of Bloc members is clouded. Perhaps their 
minds are clouded by visions of grandeur and a separate state of 
Quebec. Surely to goodness, when we are elected by democratic 
principles in every province in this great nation, we have a 
fundamental responsibility to participate in the processes on behalf 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5232"> 5232 </A></B>
<P>
of the people. The minister responsible from the province of 
Quebec chose to be negligent in that regard and did not participate 
when asked.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	With respect to my colleagues on the other side, and I have a 
great deal of respect for many of them, they would serve their 
constituents and all Canadians better if instead of constantly going 
off on their jurisdictional rants, they leave it for other forums and 
venues. They should use the grey power that some have to try to 
ensure that the processes we are privileged to avail ourselves of as 
members of the House of Commons, the highest court in the land, 
are used appropriately on behalf of their constituents to ensure that 
the legislation that comes before this place is the best it can be for 
all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Question 
period has now expired. The period of 20-minute speeches 
followed by 10 minutes of questions or comments has also expired 
for this bill. We will now start the period of 10-minute speeches.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I had 
prepared a 20-minute speech, but still. Stimulated as I was by the 
hon. member for Dartmouth, I could have gone even longer. At the 
outset, I would like to say it is annoying to be called to order when, 
on the introduction of a Canadian bill, we, of the official 
opposition, claim the issue of power sharing is not relevant.
<P>
	It is exactly because we are the official opposition that we have 
to point out that, in a bill like this one, the confusion is such that it 
can only cause major problems, or else, and this is another 
possibility, this bill does not mean anything.
<P>
	Before continuing, I would like to remind the House that when 
provincial premiers met recently on the unity train, they were 
confronted with a new document on social union proposed by 
Ontario. A document by Mr. Tom Courchene proposing what 
exactly? The co-ordinated management of Canadian federalism by 
the provinces, without taking into account the province of Quebec 
and the willingness of a great number of Quebecers to achieve 
sovereignty and to negotiate a partnership.
<P>
	There is a problem of distribution of powers within Canada. Our 
reform colleagues talk about it in their own way by saying there 
must be decentralization. Others, such as Ontario and British 
Columbia, talk about it differently, saying the provinces must 
manage Canada. And there is Quebec, which jealously wants to 
maintain its historic prerogatives for its people. I do not accept the 
lesson given by the hon. member for Dartmouth. And I think I can 
say on behalf of the Bloc that we do not accept it.
<P>
	Let us talk now about this great bill, worthy of a Captain Canada, 
who has invaded territorial waters that were not his, to seize a ship 
he had no right to. The motive was noble, but the means amounted 
to taking justice into one's own hands. In international institutions, 
this is not particularly appreciated.
<P>
	I would like to talk about the ``whereases'' that precede the bill 
and that seem to make it a proposal from a convention rather than a 
bill, even though Parliament is mentioned.
<P>
	Since I do not have much time, I will go right away to the first 
and third amendment. We could talk about the others, but I think 
these are the most important.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas Parliament wishes to reaffirm Canada's role as a world leader in oceans 
and marine resource management;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Of course, no one will object to that. To wish to be a world leader 
is one thing, but to claim to be the world leader in oceans 
management is pushing it. What kind of actions back this statement 
remains to be seen. It is understandable to want to be, but to 
proclaim oneself is another story.
<P>
	The third element reads, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas Parliament wishes to affirm-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	in Canadian domestic law-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-Canada's sovereign rights, jurisdiction and responsibilities in the exclusive 
economic zone of Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Does this means that Parliament is giving itself new sovereign 
rights on Canadian territory? Because it is not saying reaffirm but 
affirm. This could raise concerns about oceans, rivers and all 
waterways.
<P>
	I raise this whereas clause because it seems to me that, like the 
rest of this bill, it is vague and opens the door to, at best, 
interdepartmental quarrelling. What does this bill say about the 
provinces? I just said that, at the social and economic levels, they 
have started to look at managing things together. I did not mention 
Quebec, however.
<P>
	Historically, even before the days of sovereignist governments, 
Quebec has made it clear that it wanted to look after the economy 
and social affairs of the province, considered by many to be an 
``état'', a future country. I am talking about the provinces on the 
ocean, because they are in this situation I am describing. How 
much attention is paid to the provinces in this bill?
<P>
	Consultation has been promised. But consulting the provinces 
will not be a requirement, even in the cases where regulations are 
put in place that affect them. Suffice it to mention the regulations 
with respect to the fee structure, which would appear to come under 
provincial control. Even in this case, consulting the provinces will 
not actually be a requirement. Looking at the role of the provinces 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5233"> 5233 </A></B>
<P>
in this bill reminds us that Canada, and I am excluding Quebec 
here, is far from having settled its problem of ``governance'' as it is 
called today in intellectual circles.
<P>
	I wonder if the member who sponsored it at the time would still 
agree now that he is premier of a province that must deal with this 
issue on a continuing basis, but this bill leaves only crumbs to the 
provinces and shows that the will of the first Prime Minister, John 
A. Macdonald-who wanted to create an undivided country but 
was unable to do so because eastern Canada, which is now Quebec, 
objected-is still alive and well in today's Canada.
<P>
	There is a problem in the division of powers and responsibilities. 
There is an effectiveness problem, which eventually becomes a 
money problem. Being a world leader in the management of oceans 
and their resources requires money. Where is the money to 
implement this bill?
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	I saw no money anywhere. The only money I can see will come 
from fees that are unfair to Quebec and to the ports along the St. 
Lawrence. I hope these fees are not the only way to finance 
Canada's intended role as a world leader in the management of 
fisheries and oceans.
<P>
	This project is disturbing in several respects, including the 
environmental aspects. As we know, Environment Canada's budget 
will be cut by 32 per cent over three years. This bill allows the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to form his own department in 
this area. There is a serious co-ordination problem within cabinet, 
not to mention the co-ordination problem with the provinces.
<P>
	Perhaps cabinet did not really review this bill, because we 
wonder how it can be managed jointly by the Minister of the 
Environment and the minister of fisheries. We will vote for the 
amendment, because I think we demonstrated convincingly that 
this bill is not worthy of its stated objective of making Canada a 
world leader in the management of oceans and their resources.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate, at third reading, on Bill C-26. As 
you know, the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this bill, which, like 
several others introduced in this House since the beginning of the 
second session of the 35th Parliament, does not at all take into 
account the interests of the provinces.
<P>
	More specifically, this bill makes no attempt whatsoever to get 
the provinces involved in the management of fishery resources. 
During the debate at report stage, in June, the Bloc Quebecois 
tabled numerous amendments proposed by the hon. member for 
Gaspé, who sits on the Standing Committee on Fisheries and 
Oceans, precisely to ensure that the provisions contained in the bill 
would force the federal government to take into account the 
provinces' interests regarding the management of marine 
resources.
<P>
	The bill does refer to the provinces, but merely to put them in the 
same category as any other organization such as a municipality, a 
public or private law entity, an aboriginal organization, or a coastal 
community.
<P>
	In spite of the nice rhetoric used by the Prime Minister and his 
lieutenants on progressive and co-operative federalism, the fact is 
that this government, like its predecessors, is unable to renew 
federalism because federalism is not renewable.
<P>
	So, in June, the Bloc proposed amendments to the bill that would 
have allowed the provinces to get involved in the management of 
marine resources even though, according to the Constitution of 
1867, oceans comes under federal jurisdiction. A true 
federal-provincial partnership could have been established to 
ensure the sound management of our marine resources.
<P>
	Instead of promoting such partnership, the government preferred 
to turn a deaf ear and flatly rejected all the requests made by the 
Bloc Quebecois. Clearly, the government is adamant about holding 
on to these areas of jurisdiction and has no intention of sharing 
them with the provinces.
<P>
	What are the arguments used by this government to continue to 
refuse to share this responsibility with the provinces? One is the 
requirement to comply with the UN convention on the law of the 
sea, which came into effect on November 14, 1994. According to 
the comments made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans during the June 10 debate, our proposed 
amendments went against this international convention.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	In fact, on June 10, 1996, the parliamentary secretary said, as we 
can see on page 3606 of <I>Hansard</I>, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bloc Motions Nos. 15 and 16 regarding the continental shelf make the same 
erroneous implications, namely that the continental shelf could be within the 
boundary of a province. The continental shelf is well beyond provincial boundaries. 
To amend this bill as proposed by the Bloc would make Canada's new ocean statute 
contravene international law. This is neither proper nor legally correct.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is important to note, by the way, that it is always easy for 
government members to accuse us of making erroneous 
implications rather than debate the real issues.
<P>
	However, in the United States, the federation closest to Canada, 
at least physically, the central government shares with the States its 
responsibilities over part of its coastal territory. That does not mean 
that the United States are contravening international law. It does 
not prevent the United States from exercising unfettered 
jurisdiction over their coasts and territorial waters. It is rather a 
new vision of federation.
<P>
	Another argument used to refuse to clearly state the role 
provinces could play in the management of marine resources is that 
it would go against the Constitution of  Canada and it is not up to 
this House to make constitutional amendments. But that is nothing 
new. For the federal government, everything that is in Quebec's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5234"> 5234 </A></B>
<P>
interest goes against the Constitution. Again, I find such an 
argument rather astonishing.
<P>
	Since the throne speech last February, the Prime Minister keeps 
on saying that Canadian federalism is constantly evolving, that we 
do not need constitutional amendments for the provinces to become 
more involved in various areas, that administrative arrangements 
are the way to go in the future.
<P>
	In fact, when the time comes to adopt clear legislative 
provisions, when the time comes to share jurisdictions with the 
provinces or even to respect the provinces's jurisdictions, the 
federal government rejects Quebec's demands and falls back on a 
Constitution that is cast in stone.
<P>
	Indeed the federal government shows little respect for the 
Constitution when it wants to interfere in areas under provincial 
jurisdiction. That was the main point I wanted to make concerning 
this bill which, like many others, does not show any willingness to 
co-operate with Quebec and the other provinces on the part of the 
federal government.
<P>
	This government is showing us once again that it does not want 
things to change, and Quebecers will clearly express their feeling 
about that the next time they are consulted about Quebec's future.
<P>
	Of course, I am concerned about other aspects of this bill, 
particularly about the impact they will have on Quebec ridings that 
have a port.
<P>
	First of all, concerning the whole issue of fees for services 
provided by the Canadian Coast Guard, we feel the government is 
acting much too fast. The maritime industry is not totally opposed 
to some charging of fees, but it does want studies in order to find 
out the effects this would have. This is the reason the great majority 
of witnesses heard by the fisheries and oceans committee have 
called for a moratorium on coast guard fees. The impression we get 
from the government's attitude is that it wants to get its hands on 
considerable amounts of money without any regard for the 
consequences.
<P>
	Another aspect of this bill which affects all ridings is the fees for 
pleasure craft. If such fees were charged, organizations in all 
ridings would be affected.
<P>
	Non-profit organizations concerned with preserving the flora 
and fauna of our rivers and educating the public about these issues 
would be affected.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Funding of these organizations is partially public and partially 
private, and they will have to face the consequences. A group can 
own 10 war-canoes, 120 canoes or 20 kayaks, while another has 10 
rowboats, 26 pedal boats, and so on. They will be affected by the 
fees  provided for in the bill. The survival of these groups, which 
have always played an important role in the economic and social 
activities of the communities in which they are located, will be 
compromised.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> I apologize, Madam Speaker, 
but I rushed in when I saw there were fewer speakers from the other 
parties than scheduled in this important debate. I welcome this 
opportunity to rise in the House to object to the adoption of Bill 
C-26. Among other things, the government wanted to put pressure 
not only on the opposition but also on the stakeholders in this area. 
For that reason alone, the bill is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	We heard Liberal members say earlier that this was an historic 
bill, and we heard them brag about the broad impact of this bill on 
the lives of Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	Before going any further, since I believe I will be one of the last 
speakers in this debate, I would like to congratulate the hon. 
member for Gaspé on a job well done. Thanks to his persuasive 
arguments and the groundswell they provoked-I am referring 
particularly to what I called the rowboat debate-he managed to 
make the minister backtrack temporarily. I say temporarily, 
because this should not be a reason for the hon. member for Gaspé 
to relax his vigilance concerning the registration of rowboats, 
pedalboats and light craft.
<P>
	All Bloc members talked to their constituents, and as people 
heard about the government's plans, they said it was ridiculous and 
incredible. Since when is the coast guard interested in the light 
craft that navigate on our lakes? The presence of DFO makes sense 
if you are on the Pacific, the Arctic or the Atlantic ocean, and even 
on the St. Lawrence River. We are used to seeing them there. But 
on the tributaries of the St. Lawrence? People could not believe 
their ears.
<P>
	The work done by the hon. member for Gaspé raised the interest 
of the media, so that the minister delayed the coming into force of 
the registration of light craft. I admit I am still apprehensive, 
because after all, this is a pre-election year. We do not know when 
the Prime Minister will call an election, and it is clear that the 
government is playing for time.
<P>
	With this bill the minister wants to make it easier to issue such 
regulations. In a previous attempt, he used legislation on financial 
administration. In this case, he wants to make it much easier. This 
is exactly what people do not want.
<P>
	The worst thing is certainly the lack of consultation, of listening, 
of understanding on the part of the minister as to what the 
participants said. He listened to them, but he did not take their 
suggestions into account, except for postponing registration of 
small craft. As for the rest, the minister wants to reaffirm Canada's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5235"> 5235 </A></B>
<P>
sovereignty on its inland waters but also extend and confirm the 
200 mile  zone. We have no objection to his speaking of 
sovereignty.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	We Quebec sovereignists are well aware of the true meaning of 
the word sovereignty. However, when speaking of co-operation, the 
government says it is possible, but we know its habits. We did not 
have that many examples of co-operation between the federal 
government and the provinces up to now, over the past three years, 
and we have been following all the debates closely. There was 
some talk of co-operation, but rarely, and I daresay almost never, 
did it translate into action.
<P>
	This bill is a further example of this bad habit. The minister 
wants to decide with his officials in Ottawa. Whatever the 
provinces may say, the minister will do as he pleases. He did not 
even listen to the Premier of British Columbia. In his last speech, 
the hon. member for Gaspé reminded us of the time when, during a 
first ministers' conference, the Premier of British Columbia-not 
Quebec-walked out, saying that he felt he was wasting his time, 
that it did not serve any purpose, they did not listen, they did not 
want to know.
<P>
	So a bill was introduced. I see some members, for example the 
hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls who, with elections in the 
offing, wants to make a name for himself-he has a reputation as a 
dissident, even a critic, one of the rare ones within the government 
party to voice his opinions-and suddenly he has found a mission 
for himself: Bloc bashing.
<P>
	That is a well known trick. It has been used many times. I am a 
fairly new MP. I have been here only three years. But the hon. 
members for Richelieu and Rosemont, who have more experience, 
have often told me that it has always been that way. What do MPs 
or government members do to make a name for themselves outside 
Quebec? They attack Quebec, they attack MPs, they sometimes try 
to insult them. This was not the case here. The hon. member did not 
stoop so low, even though his comments were not particularly 
appropriate.
<P>
	Having sat on the opposition side for a long time, he should 
understand that members of the Bloc Quebecois are trying to do an 
important job in this place, to be the official opposition and as such 
to represent those who feel the government has not listened to 
them, or at least has not understood them.
<P>
	But no, the government is forging ahead, passing this bill the 
member for Gander-Grand Falls called the most important piece 
of legislation since Confederation. I believe in his view it is, 
especially in his area bordering the Atlantic ocean. I can 
understand his point of view. But then, if it is that important, why 
not proceed more carefully and clarify many areas which are still 
grey.
<P>
	I worked a long time for the former Quebec agriculture and 
fisheries minister and I remember that, up to 1984, the federal 
government was delegating part  of its responsibilities regarding 
fisheries management to the provinces. And it worked. We were 
doing fine in those days. We know what happened to the fisheries 
after this was taken away from Quebec; we are actually looking for 
fish now. The stocks of just about every species are dwindling. 
Things have been going wrong since that time.
<P>
	Instead of broadening its horizon in order to protect the fisheries 
through its strategy, the government is saying that it will be done in 
Ottawa, by Ottawa.
<P>
	I remember a historic remark a politician made in Quebec to the 
effect that it was harder to have a bureaucrat leave Ottawa to go and 
see what was actually going on in the fisheries that to have a fish 
swim from the Gaspé to Ottawa.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, after 
those impressive speeches on the part of the member facing me and 
of the member for Lévis, I am surprised that our Liberal colleagues 
are not rising to approve these very sensible arguments.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	The member for Quebec explained quite well the unfair situation 
this bill would create for Quebec. When a government is so 
irresponsible as to table a bill taxing pedal boats and rowboats, 
there is definitely something wrong, something out of whack in the 
operation.
<P>
	By tabling this bill and not realizing that it will adversely affect 
all small touristic parks and outdoor recreational parks in regions 
like Quebec and other provinces, the government is showing to 
what extent it is oblivious of the day-to-day life of ordinary 
citizens.
<P>
	We have seen that this fee for pedal boats and small rowboats 
will have an incredible financial impact on small outdoor 
recreational businesses which can barely make ends meet 
sometimes, particularly when we get rainy summers like we did 
this year.
<P>
	Fortunately, the Bloc proposed some amendments and brought 
witnesses to be heard by the committee to make the government 
understand to some extent, maybe temporarily, that it was taking a 
wrong path.
<P>
	In the documents the government used to explain its position, we 
can see that, once again, its actions are diametrically opposed to its 
red book commitments, where the government said it would reduce 
the public service, really streamline it, and it would legislate less in 
order to give businesses-
<P>

	At present, in Quebec, some 1,000 acres have been set aside to

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadian farmers are noted as masters of understatement. 
Therefore suffice it to say that 1996 will not go down in history as a 
banner year for agriculture in western Canada.
<P>
	Farmers in Prince George-Peace River are accustomed to tough 
years and hard conditions. As someone who has been directly 
involved in agriculture for most of my life, I am well aware of what 
a year like this means to a farm family.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	After suffering years of low returns the future was finally 
beginning to look a bit brighter with the improvement of grain 
prices, but then crop year 1996 came along. A long cold winter and 
a late wet spring, followed by almost continuous rain over the 
growing season, have resulted in a dangerously late harvest.
<P>
	Hundreds of thousands of Canadians from coast to coast depend 
on the successful grain harvest for their livelihood. Farmers not 
only in my riding but across Canada are struggling to bring in the 
crop. I ask all colleagues to join with me in wishing them the very 
best in their endeavours.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
other day I asked a question of the Minister of the Environment 
with respect to rail line abandonment. I asked him if he was willing 
to bring forward an environmental assessment of the various 
abandonments which are affecting my home province of Manitoba, 
for instance the possible abandonment of rail lines in the north and 
the Lyleton subdivision in the south.
<P>
	I got a cute answer. The minister got up and said: ``Not yet''. It 
seems that the Trudeau shrug is back in style.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is there is a good case to be made for doing 
an environmental assessment of these various rail line 
abandonments and what effect they have on the environment by 
increasing truck traffic and a variety of other things which need to 
be considered.
<P>
	I would urge the government, pursuant to its commitment to the 
Bruntland commission, to do these kinds of environmental 
assessments. That is what governments around the world 
committed themselves to do when they endorsed the work of the 
Bruntland commission to environmentally assess all major policy 
initiatives; not just the environmental ones, but  transportation and 
all kinds of

Birchall Way. The new street name, officially unveiled by Kingston 
Mayor Gary  Bennett and Kingston Township Reeve Isabel Turner, 
recognized Air Commodore Leonard Birchall, a former 
commandant of the Royal Military College.
<P>
	On April 4, 1942 Leonard Birchall was on air patrol off the coast 
of Ceylon, where the British navy was stationed. He was turning 
around when he spotted the whole Japanese fleet heading toward 
Ceylon. It is said the Japanese were planning an attack similar to 
the one at Pearl Harbour. Leonard Birchall managed to signal the 
British fleet before the Japanese shot him down. He was captured 
and survived four years of beatings and torture in a Japanese 
prisoner of war camp.
<P>
	Sir Winston Churchill hailed Leonard Birchall as the saviour of 
Ceylon. Had the Japanese attacked, they could have wiped out the 
British navy, with unknown consequences for the outcome of the 
war. Air Commodore Birchall is truly a great Canadian war hero. 
He was well saluted last Sunday.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, before we begin question period 
today, I noticed that in the statements over the last few days we 
have been using the term ``you'' as if speaking directly to another 
person or a minister. I have been loath to intervene, but we do not 
use that particular word when we are having questions or answers. I 
wonder if you would consider putting it in a more roundabout way 
rather than attacking directly.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have just learned a few minutes ago that General 
Boyle, the chief of defence staff, has handed in his resignation.
<P>
	We have known since yesterday that the discussions between the 
Office of the Prime Minister and his own department, the Privy 
Council, and General Boyle have been very lengthy and probably 
very difficult. However that may be, members will recall that, for 
over a month now, in response to our questions, the Prime Minister 
has been rising in this House and telling us time and again that he 
has confidence in his minister, in his former Minister of National 
Defence, and that he has confidence, every confidence, he said, in 
General Boyle.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister explain his sudden about-face today 
regarding the individual in whom he had such confidence a few 
days ago? What has changed?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, General Boyle, who met with the defence minister, sent 
me his letter of resignation this morning. I accepted it with regret. I 
did not ask him to resign, but he felt it was in the interest of the 
Canadian armed forces and of the defence minister that he hand in 
his resignation.
<P>
	It was his personal decision. He made it in the interest of the 
troops. We were of the opinion that he could have waited until the 
end of the inquiry to see whether he had committed an error or not. 
But he thought, because of the controversy in which he found 
himself, that it was in the interest of the new defence minister to be 
able to choose his staff. I think his consideration is very admirable 
and very courageous.
<P>
	I thanked him for his service to the country. Now that he has 
gone, the defence minister will recommend, in the near future I 
hope, a successor. In the meantime, General Boyle's assistant will 
perform his duties on an acting basis.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, last week the Prime Minister tried to convince us that the 
former defence minister had resigned over an action that had 
absolutely nothing to do with the Somalia inquiry. The minister 
was saved by an unfortunate letter.
<P>
	Now, he is trying to convince us that the chief of defence staff 
has resigned, but that nobody had anything to do with it, when we 
know that officials from his own department were talking with the 
general for several hours yesterday afternoon. The Prime Minister 
can always take another run at it.
<P>
	I would simply like to say this: Will the Prime Minister not 
admit that the fact is that he was too protective of his friend, the 
former defence minister, who in turn protected his friend the chief 
of defence staff, all in order to avoid admitting that he made a 
mistake in choosing the former defence minister, who made a 
mistake in choosing General Boyle?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the defence minister's letter of resignation Friday was 
very clear, and that was his only reason for resigning. He sent me a 
letter of resignation, which I accepted, because he had been 
informed that he had committed an error, in contravention of the 
guidelines issued to all ministers. He assumed his responsibilities 
with great honesty. I know that all members in this House will want 
to acknowledge that over the last three years the Minister of 
National Defence who resigned Friday did an exceptional job, 
efficiently carrying out the necessary cuts, closing bases, and 
reducing the number of employees and generals. I am very proud of 
him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, perhaps we should take a leaf from the army's book and 
record the exploits of the former defence minister on video?
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister assure us, first of all, that the lengthy 
discussions in his own department yesterday, between his officials 
and General Boyle, were not for the purpose of making General 
Boyle's exit an easy one, and second, will he promise that no offer 
will be made to General Boyle before we know the conclusions of 
an interim report that will shed light on the falsification of 
documents in the Canadian armed forces?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, General Boyle has handed in his resignation. He has not 
asked the government for any favours. He even clearly said that he 
did not wish to receive an appointment, even if we had wanted to 
offer him one. And he will leave under conditions suitable for a 
retiring chief of defence staff.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Defence.
<P>
	Yesterday, the new Minister of National Defence stated that the 
problem would not be solved by assigning responsibility to a single 
individual, but by tackling the whole system.
<P>
	Yesterday, the new Minister of National Defence said that the 
idea of an interim report to cast light on operation document 
tampering, as demanded by the official opposition, was an 
interesting one.
<P>
	Does the minister realize now that this is not merely an 
interesting idea; the government has no choice but to require an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5241"> 5241 </A></B>
<P>
interim report, and promptly, if it wishes to get to the bottom of this 
scandal and find out all those involved.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is very 
important to keep tabs on what one says in this House and 
elsewhere. What I said to the hon. member and others is that I was 
going to look at the suggestions made by Mps and others.
<P>
	What is important for me at this time is to acknowledge that the 
chief of staff has submitted his resignation and that it has been 
accepted. Now we will proceed to investigate the Somalia situation 
thoroughly.
<P>
	Perhaps this is the time to indicate that those calling for an 
interim report on what has been found out to date in the Somalia 
inquiry ought to keep in mind as well that it is also important to 
find out exactly what went on in Somalia.
<P>
	We ought not to lose sight of the fact that what is important here 
for Canadians is to know what happened there, who was 
responsible, how such a thing could happen, and how it can be 
prevented from happening again. That is what we will be trying to 
find out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, having 
an interim report does nothing to prevent a complete investigation 
of what else went on in Somalia.
<P>
	Does the explanation of the minister's reticence to call for an 
interim report not lie in the fact that his government does not want 
a report on document tampering to come out before the next 
elections. This could smear not only General Boyle but also, of 
course, the former Minister of Defence and the Prime Minister 
himself?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, in recent days, 
two people have taken some very difficult steps. First my 
colleague, the former Minister of National Defence, resigned, and 
now today, General Boyle has done so as well.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	I will take advantage of this opportunity to ask my honourable 
colleague whether he is serious about wanting to find out just what 
happened in this entire incident, as he was calling for yesterday in 
terms of an interim report on the entire Somalia situation. I am 
prepared to commit the government, provided we have the support 
of the opposition and the other members of this House, to making a 
request to the Parliament of Canada from the House of Commons, 
asking those who are investigating the Somalia events not only to 
provide us with an interim report, but also to give us a report on 
what went on in Somalia so that action may be taken as soon as we 
have it in hand, by the end of March, as set out in the instructions 
given to the inquiry.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as all members know, on Friday the Minister of National 
Defence resigned and today the chief of defence staff has resigned. 
These resignations have been accepted by the government. We 
want to congratulate the Prime Minister on belatedly and finally 
acknowledging that there has been a leadership problem at the top.
<P>
	As recently as last week the Prime Minister was telling this 
House that General Boyle and the former Minister of National 
Defence enjoyed the government's complete confidence. Will the 
Prime Minister explain to the House what happened between last 
Thursday and today to destroy that confidence?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on Friday the Minister of National Defence gave me a 
letter of resignation. I accepted it. The letter of resignation was 
very clear. The letter of acceptance of the resignation was very 
clear. They are public documentation.
<P>
	The former Minister of National Defence showed a high degree 
of public service when he said: ``Unfortunately, I broke the 
guidelines that you have established, Prime Minister. I resign''. I 
said that I hope some day I will have the opportunity to welcome 
him back in the cabinet. He is a very honourable man, a good 
parliamentarian and a dedicated Canadian.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister's explanation is incomplete and 
contradictory.
<P>
	The former defence minister was allegedly forced to resign for 
interfering with a quasi-judicial tribunal. This apparently violated 
an ethical guideline of cabinet. Yet over the last two years, seven 
other ministers of the government have interfered with the CRTC, a 
quasi-judicial tribunal, and have gotten off scot free.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister release to this House these ethical 
guidelines which permit seven cabinet ministers to interfere with 
the tribunal without penalty, but which required the minister of 
defence to resign for doing so?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when I formed the government three years ago, there were 
no guidelines of conduct for ministers in relation to their 
communications with quasi-judicial bodies.
<P>
	When we had a controversy in the House, I said that they were to 
be clarified. I have clarified them. The ministers received new 
instructions after that. Unfortunately, in the case of the former 
Minister of National Defence, he broke the guidelines.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5242"> 5242 </A></B>
<P>
	These guidelines existed in writing in previous governments. 
They were never made public. They are instructions from the 
Prime Minister to his ministers. It is for the ministers to deal with 
the Prime Minister.
<P>
	In the case on Friday, I received a letter of resignation and I 
accepted the letter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question was simply, would the Prime Minister 
release to this House these guidelines that permit this contradictory 
behaviour.
<P>
	Some of us come from jurisdictions, for example a jurisdiction 
in Alberta, where the most rookie minister of the government 
knows there are only three ways to communicate to a quasi-judicial 
tribunal: through the statutes, through an order in council, or 
through public testimony before the tribunal.
<P>
	Why is it so difficult for that rule to get established in practice 
here? I ask the Prime Minister, will he submit to the House these 
ethical guidelines which permit such contradictory behaviour from 
his ministers?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is a reality that we debated in this House. A minister 
of the crown at the same time is a member of Parliament. He has 
some obligation to the people who vote for him to try to help them 
solve their problems. The minister as a member of Parliament 
indicated in his letter what he had done. He broke the guidelines 
but he will always have the responsibility of being a member of 
Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	It is very difficult to combine the two responsibilities. I advise 
the ministers to be very prudent. In this case the minister felt that 
he had been imprudent. I checked and the guidelines were broken 
and I have accepted his resignation. It is a very honourable thing.
<P>
	If the hon. member thinks that this is not severe enough, tell me, 
should there not be any members of Parliament made cabinet 
ministers? It is that way in other jurisdictions. In France a member 
of Parliament has to resign his seat as a member of Parliament to 
become a member of the cabinet, but I am a defender of the British 
tradition and I am following the British rules.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	According to today's issue of the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, the 
government has devised a parallel system enabling the Prime 
Minister's Office to organize as it pleases the management of 
information requested under the Access to Information Act.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister confirm the existence of such a system?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government is the government. The Privy Council 
must ensure that what goes on in all the departments is 
co-ordinated and that, if there is any problem in the public 
administration, the Prime Minister is informed.
<P>
	Putting in place the necessary mechanisms to know what goes on 
in the public service is the first rule of good management for a 
Prime Minister. This is precisely the way I run the government.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the access to information request concerning the former 
defence minister goes back to August.
<P>
	How does the Prime Minister explain that he stood up for his 
former minister throughout this period, when he was fully aware 
that his minister might have violated the code of ethics for cabinet 
members?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, every day, hundreds and even thousands of information 
requests are made by journalists, academics and members of 
Parliament. It costs millions of dollars for the public service to find 
the related documents.
<P>
	My office was informed on Tuesday evening. I was personally 
informed on Wednesday morning, and the minister handed me his 
resignation on Friday morning. I think the government did what it 
had to do. Once we were informed, we took action within hours.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	For months now the Prime Minister has said that the former 
defence minister and General Boyle were operating the armed 
forces to the satisfaction of the government, no major crisis. Since 
then the minister and the chief of defence staff have resigned under 
a cloud and on the heels of many scandals. Yesterday the new 
defence minister admitted that the armed forces face a major crisis.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister explain the flip flop? Does the 
Prime Minister believe there is a major crisis in the armed forces or 
not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the first place 
the hon. member alleges something the Prime Minister had said, 
that there is no crisis in the armed forces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5243"> 5243 </A></B>
<P>
	I know that the hon. member and every member of the House 
is aware of the Somalia inquiry, not just the situation with respect 
to the inquiry surrounding the activities of General Boyle. General 
Boyle was not in Somalia. General Boyle was not in the videos 
that the hon. member and others have seen. General Boyle was 
not a commanding officer in Somalia.
<P>
	The hon. member I think does the House a service in raising the 
question as to whether or not there is a crisis in the armed forces. I 
said yesterday and I repeat today, the replacement of a defence 
minister and the resignation of the chief of defence staff will not 
correct serious problems in the Canadian Armed Forces that were 
reflected in the activities in Somalia.
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member will join with me in ensuring that we 
encourage the commission to report as quickly as possible on what 
happened, why it happened and who was responsible for what 
happened in Somalia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, again Canadians are getting used to no answers in the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	We have to remember that nothing honourable happened today. 
The person who resigned admitted to lying to the military police. 
They have admitted to lying and to breaking the spirit of the Access 
to Information Act. The government is responsible for those 
actions.
<P>
	The Canadian public have listened month after month, day in 
and day out to this Prime Minister saying there was no problem at 
the Department of National Defence. Does the Prime Minister 
accept full responsibility for the mishandling of the appointment of 
the former chief of defence staff, General Jean Boyle?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, members of the 
House and Canadians have listened to questions being put with 
respect to the situation which surrounded General Boyle.
<P>
	The hon. member refers to honour and that there was no honour 
in what was done today. I believe that anyone who has as much 
respect as the hon. member does for the armed forces would 
recognize what kind of a heart wrenching situation it had to be for 
an officer of the calibre and the age of General Boyle to have to 
come to the conclusion that it was in the best interests of the men 
and women of the Canadian Armed Forces and in the best interests 
of Canada for him to offer his resignation to the government.
<P>
	The hon. member and I may agree on some things, but I have to 
disagree, and I believe that most fair thinking Canadians would 
disagree, when he suggests in any way that what General Boyle did 
today was not the honourable thing to do.

	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Solicitor General. While on probation, inmate 
Marcel Blanchette was involved in the horrendous murder of 
Isabelle Bolduc, committed near Sherbrooke, last July. However, 
the probation officers in charge of his case had refused to punish 
him, even if they very well knew that he had broken the conditions 
of his parole.
<P>
	Can the Solicitor General tell this House why this offender, who 
was not abiding by any of his parole conditions, could remain free 
instead of being sent back to prison?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows 
full well that the National Parole Board is a quasi-judicial body. We 
should get its recommendations any time now.
<P>
	I cannot comment on the decision made by the National Parole 
Board, because it is a quasi-judicial body. However, I can tell the 
hon. member that the board is investigating and that we should 
receive its report in a few weeks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
specific guarantees can the minister give the House that there will 
never be another case like the Marcel Blanchette incident ever 
again in the Canadian prison system?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one such incident is one 
too many, I agree. However, our system is working very well. I 
cannot believe that the hon. member is suggesting that we get rid of 
the review process and the National Parole Board.
<P>
	The system is working very well and has been fully tried and 
tested. In this case, we will check with our sources and, as I said

his own news conferences, but he prefers to come to mine in order 
to guarantee some attention.
<P>
	On Friday I had the opportunity to outline to the news media in 
Regina and across western Canada the general directions being 
pursued by the government with respect to grain marketing and 
changes in the Canadian grain marketing system. Yesterday a very 
detailed statement was issued outlining the focus of those changes.
<P>
	Legislation is presently being prepared. It will be presented to 
the House of Commons at the earliest possible moment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I certainly had a lesson on how not to hold a press 
conference. It is a good thing the minister is not the chief electoral 
officer because our democratic process would be in shambles.
<P>
	How can the minister call a plebiscite of producers when he does 
not know what the question will be, he does not know who can 
vote, he does not know what constitutes a majority and he does not 
know if the vote will be binding?
<P>
	Will the minister commit today in the House to giving all 
western Canadian barley producers a clear, honest question on 
whether they want the choice of how they market their barley?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I indicated very clearly on Friday 
and very clearly again yesterday what the nature of the question 
would be.
<P>
	Let me quote: ``They'', that is farmers, ``will be asked a clear cut 
question about whether they wish to put all barley, both feed and 
malting, on to the completely open market for all sales or would 
they prefer to retain the current marketing system through which 
the Canadian Wheat Board, as modernized by the other changes 
announced by the government, remains the single desk seller for all 
barley sales for export and domestic barley sales for human 
consumption''. It is very clear and very specific.

pension plan payments to Canadian seniors. This will mean less 
income for seniors and breaks a promise that the Prime Minister 
made during the last Quebec referendum.
<P>
	Why is the government reducing Canada pension plan benefits 
when it promised it would not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the government has not made a proposal along those lines. When 
the federal and provincial governments came together, both 
examined a series of options. This happens to be one of the options. 
It was set out in the consultation book that was signed on by all of 
the provinces unanimously.
<P>
	That option was discussed. A number of individuals throughout 
the consultation process, in fact some in the hon. member's own 
province, subscribed to this as a thesis. However, no decision has 
been taken. What was agreed to by the finance ministers was that 
we would examine the situation, look at the total package and 
eventually come to a consensus.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the minister for his response because there are a 
good number of seniors who are very nervous about what is likely 
going to happen to their pensions and other income. The last budget 
cost seniors up to $1,200 each through the elimination of the age 
limitation tax credits.
<P>
	We know that the provinces are very upset about allowing the 
federal government to use unemployment insurance premiums to 
offset the cost of the CPP premiums. They think the two should be 
linked in that the unemployment insurance premium should be 
reduced while the others go up.
<P>
	Why would the government break faith with Canadian seniors, 
especially the most needy seniors, when we look at all of these 
threats to them, particularly the 50 per cent tax on income? Why 
are the Liberals breaking their promise?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think I can answer the question, but first I have to figure out what 
the question is.
<P>
	The government made it possible for Canadian seniors and for a 
whole generation of young Canadians to know that the Canada 
pension plan, the OAS and the guaranteed income supplement 
would be there for them. We did not want to make the same mistake 
the previous generations of politicians did, which was simply to 
defer this problem until such time as the Canada pension plan got 
into such difficulty that there would be no other solution except the 
terrible one that is advocated by the members of the Reform Party.
<P>
	In our budget we brought down a seniors benefit that will be as 
good if not better for 75 per cent of Canadians, better for nine out 
of ten women in the country, that will allow Canadians to hold their 
heads high as they recognize the-

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is directed to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	Since 1986, the Canadian government has required Portuguese 
citizens visiting Canada to have a visa. However, Portugal does not 
require Canadians to have a visa to visit that country. In fact, it is 
the only country in the European Union on which Canada imposes 
this requirement. When it was in the opposition, the Liberal Party 
was against this requirement.
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	When will the minister decide to remove the visa requirement 
for Portuguese visitors as it has in the case of other countries?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as you know, we regularly 
review our visa policy in this country.
<P>
	A number of factors are taken into consideration. As you know, 
many visitors come to Canada, and at the same time we must also 
control our borders. As for the situation concerning Portugal, this 
week I will have the pleasure of discussing the matter with the 
Secretary of State of Portugal who will be visiting us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I may 
remind the minister that this measure is utterly discriminatory 
against a friendly and allied country.
<P>
	Could the minister explain why she has maintained this visa 
requirement, although Portugal is the only country in the European 
Union to which it applies?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as you know, situations vary 
from country to country. We decided some time ago to remove 
the visa requirement for Chile. As you know, we have to reinstate 
this visa due to a very particular problem we have with illegal 
immigrants to this country coming from Chile.
<P>
	When we make a decision of this kind, we have to look at several 
factors, which means finding out whether the country where these 
people come from properly controls the passports and visas it 
issues and whether or not a large percentage of visa applications are 
turned down.
<P>
	That is the context we are looking at. And that is why I am quite 
prepared to the reopen discussions with the Portuguese authorities 
on this question.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
is national family week and it is a good time to focus on the safety 
and security of Canadian families.
<P>
	This morning I presented a petition from more than 25,000 
people from across Canada asking the minister to toughen up the 
justice system for criminals who have committed sexual acts and 
crimes against children.
<P>
	Does the solicitor general agree with these petitioners? Does he 
agree with their specific demand that local RCMP officers be given 
permission to notify Canadians whenever sexual offenders are 
about to be released back into their communities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was just those concerns that lead 
the government to consult and then produce Bill C-55 which was 
tabled in the House some two weeks ago.
<P>
	Through Bill C-55 changes were proposed to the criminal justice 
system that will enable us to take that burden from the shoulders of 
police. This will be done by enabling sentencing judges, in the 
cases of repeat sexual offenders, to impose not only a prison term 
but to ensure that at the end of that prison term there is an 
appropriate period of supervision in the community to safeguard 
the interests of Canadians and their families.
<P>
	After the sex offender is out of prison at the end of the sentence, 
there will be a period during which the offender will have to report, 
if appropriate, to police, let authorities know of the whereabouts of 
the offender, continue treatment if that is required and even in the 
appropriate cases wear an electronic monitor. That is the most 
effective way to deal with this threat to our security.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister should know that in Bill C-55 the only communities that 
must be notified of a release of a sexual predator are aboriginal 
communities. There is no such provision in his bill for the rest of 
the communities. It is a weakness in that bill.
<P>
	Since April of this year there has been a delegation order sitting 
on the solicitor general's desk. The solicitor general merely has to 
sign that order and local police officers will be given the authority 
and the permission, the delegation, to release that information to 
communities when those sexual predators are released back into 
the community.
<P>
	Will the solicitor general sign that delegation order and will he 
do it today?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not aware of that 
order but I will bring it to the attention of the solicitor general at the

the minister for continuing the moratorium on the closing of rural 
post offices. Rural Canadians thank her for that.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	In one of her recommendations the minister directs Canada Post 
to improve rather than reduce the quality of service in rural areas 
and to include the establishment of a reasonable delivery standard 
for rural areas.
<P>
	Will the minister guarantee to the House today that she will 
establish these standards, ensure that rural service will meet the 
needs of rural Canadians and not just Canada Post and include all 
rural Canadians in setting up these standards?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and

responded immediately to certain areas of recommendation in Mr.

francophones stopped using French during the same period. In 
other words, their assimilation continues.

	Why is the minister trying the hide the fact that a total of 
340,000 out of the 1 million francophones outside Quebec have 
become anglicized and that the assimilation rate is growing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we should keep in mind 
that the question comes from a member who compared 
francophones outside Quebec to paraplegics in wheelchairs.

	We should also emphasize that this member, who speaks French 
rather well, is a Franco-Ontarian who learned to speak French in

	The House resumed consideration of the motion and the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will just 
take a moment to conclude by reminding this house that the 
amendment we have brought forward is in keeping not only with 
Quebec's claims but also with the claims of other provinces.
<P>
	We will recall that the federal and British Columbia government 
have agreed, for instance, to a bilateral review of salmon fishing. 
After British Columbia withdrew from a provincial table where all 
the provinces were represented, a bilateral relationship was 
eventually established. The review of the responsibilities should be 
completed by February 1997, that means in five or six months from 
now. In the release issued in July, the federal and British Columbia 
governments announced this as good news.
<P>
<B>(1505)</B>
<P>
	Our amendment goes along the same lines, more or less. Let us 
take the time, with regard to part II of the act, to clearly define the 
role of each partner, their responsibilities, and so on. Let us give 
ourselves a few more months, to ensure that the bill will have the 
desired effect, as stated at the beginning, and that it goes along the 
same lines as the claims made by British Columbia and other 
provinces asking for the same thing, including Quebec, as far as 
this bill is concerned.
<P>
	Asking for a six month period as we do in this amendment, 
which we hope all the hon. members will support when it is put to a 
vote later today, seems perfectly justified to me. In terms of time 
frame, of timing, it seems quite reasonable to table this amendment 
today, since bilateral agreements like this one have already been 
entered into in relation to a fee structure in similar areas or other 
areas. Discussions could take place between the provinces to 
determine what the needs are. Then, as I said earlier, the role of 
each partner could be established, so that we could achieve a better 
result and make this bill more useful.
<P>
	I will close on this, hoping that the government will listen to 
these legitimate demands of the opposition for a six month 
extension through this amendment.

	The House resumed from September 27, 1996, consideration of 
the motion that Bill C-29, an act to regulate interprovincial trade in 
and the importation for commercial purposes of certain 
manganese-based substances, be read the third time and passed, 
and the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today, like my colleagues did earlier, to oppose Bill C-29, an act to 
regulate interprovincial trade in and the importation for 
commercial purposes of certain manganese-based substances.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5249"> 5249 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill, as its title indicates, seeks to prohibit the importation 
of certain manganese-based substances, specifically MMT, in 
Canada, and their interprovincial trade.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	The debate on this bill is very interesting, because this is a rather 
unusual piece of legislation.
<P>
	It is unusual in that this government attempts to prohibit the use 
of MMT, not through the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 
as one would expect, but through a roundabout means, at the 
commercial level, by using a false pretence, namely the harmful 
effects of this product on health and on the environment.
<P>
	Instead of prohibiting the sale of MMT in Canada, or simply 
saying that this is a toxic or dangerous product, the government is 
trying to legislate to prohibit the importation of this product and its 
trade between the provinces. This is a blatant violation of NAFTA 
and interference in a field of provincial jurisdiction. It is strange 
however that a company could produce and sell MMT in a province 
without violating in any way the provisions of Bill C-29.
<P>
	If the government is so afraid of the alleged toxic effects of 
MMT, why did it not completely prohibit its use, instead of 
restricting its importation and its interprovincial trade?
<P>
	If the Minister of the Environment had any proof of MMT's 
harmful effects on health or on the environment, he would have 
drafted his bill differently but, unfortunately for him, the minister 
does not have any such proof. Incidentally, the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, the EPA, also tried to prove that MMT is 
harmful to one's health, but it failed in its attempt to do so.
<P>
	Until last year, the use of MMT in unleaded gasoline was 
prohibited in certain American states. However, in April 1995, 
Ethyl Corporation, won a legal battle against the EPA. The U.S. 
court of appeal for the district of Columbia ruled that the EPA had 
not proved its allegations to the effect that MMT is harmful to 
one's health.
<P>
	As for the auto industry, it was not able to prove that MMT is 
harmful to cars' anti-pollution systems. The EPA did not appeal the 
decision. Therefore MMT is now allowed in some American states. 
In the circumstances, I wonder why the Minister of the 
Environment assumes he could prove this product is harmful.
<P>
	Furthermore, on December 6, 1994, Health Canada published 
the results of an independent study on the so-called risks connected 
with the use of MMT. The study concluded that the use of MMT in 
gas did not constitute a health risk for any section of the Canadian 
public.
<P>
	Finally, a number of international and Canadian scientific 
organizations have all concluded that low levels of manganese, as 
in the case of MMT in unleaded gas, do not represent a health risk.
<P>
	Therefore, contrary to what the Minister of the Environment 
seems to think, for the time being there is no hard evidence for 
banning MMT. Consequently, Bill C-29 is redundant until such 
time as respected and serious studies provide evidence of a 
negative impact of MMT on health and the environment.
<P>
	To prohibit MMT and replace it with another product such as 
ethanol, for instance, which does cause environmental problems, is 
merely deferring the problem. It would be better to do a number of 
serious studies before passing a bill than to do so after the fact.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is, of course, very concerned about the 
health of Quebecers and Canadians, as it is about environmental 
issues, and that is why we want these studies to be done before 
prohibiting MMT.
<P>
	I might as well say right now that the bill in its present form will 
always be unacceptable, since the Minister of the Environment 
wants to regulate the market, not the environment.
<P>
	And in that case we have some serious questions about the real 
motives of the Minister of the Environment for going ahead with 
Bill C-29, although he knows perfectly well that the bill will 
generate considerable costs for Quebec and Canadian taxpayers, 
including a likely increase in the price of gas, loss of jobs in the oil 
industry and the cost of a possible request for compensation under 
NAFTA.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	It may be that privately, and I am sure unconsciously, the present 
Minister of the Environment, like his predecessor, has realized that 
the product that would replace MMT-by the way MMT is 
manufactured exclusively by Ethyl, an American company-is 
ethanol, which, coincidentally, is manufactured using corn, which 
is grown mainly in Ontario. We note that ethanol creates 
environmental problems.
<P>
	However, there is one aspect the minister has not yet understood, 
although his colleague for international trade may have tried to 
explain it to him. Bill C-29 goes counter to a trade agreement we 
signed with the United States and Mexico: NAFTA. Under this 
agreement, the Canadian government does not have the right to 
restrict trade and allow goods to be produced only within its 
borders, as it intends to do with this bill. 
<P>
	By banning interprovincial trade in and the importation of MMT, 
the bill before us today requires that all MMT sold in Canada be 
produced in this country. Furthermore, the minister wants to stop 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5250"> 5250 </A></B>
<P>
the importation of a product that is not necessarily harmful to the 
environment by hindering the free flow of goods. By violating 
NAFTA,  the federal government lays itself open to a compensation 
claim as provided for in NAFTA.
<P>
	In a letter dated February 23, the Minister for International Trade 
warned the Minister of the Environment that Bill C-29 violates 
some of NAFTA's basic principles and that, if this bill is adopted, 
Canada might receive a compensation claim under NAFTA. But the 
Minister of the Environment dug in his heels, preferring to expose 
the Canadian people to possible, even probable prosecution 
involving millions of dollars. I feel like quoting an excerpt from 
this very eloquent letter. The Minister for International Trade feels 
that, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``An import prohibition on MMT would be inconsistent with 
Canada's obligations under the WTO and the NAFTA: (1) it would 
constitute an impermissible prohibition on imports, particularly if 
domestic production, sale or use is not similarly prohibited; and (2) 
it could not be justified on health or environmental grounds given 
current scientific evidence''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Minister for International Trade concludes by asking his 
colleague to drop Bill C-29. The possibility of a lawsuit looms 
closer every day since a notice of intent to submit a claim was 
formally filed September 10 by Ethyl Corporation from the U.S. 
Ethyl is asking for US$201 million in compensation. A claim may 
be submitted within 90 days of the notice of intent.
<P>
	This claim process under article 1116 of NAFTA has already 
been used in the past in two other areas. In fact, two other notices of 
intent to submit a claim under article 1116 of NAFTA have already 
been filed against Canada this year and are still pending. One is 
from a Mexican pharmaceutical company called Signa for $50 
million, and the other is from Waste Management Inc. for a secret 
amount.
<P>
	The U.S. company feels that its Canadian subsidiary will be hurt 
by Bill C-29 and that is why it is asking for compensation under 
article 1116 of NAFTA. This article provides that an investor of a 
party may submit to arbitration a claim that another party has 
breached an obligation under NAFTA and that the investor has 
incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.
<P>
	Some say that NAFTA allows the Canadian government to pass 
legislation aimed at protecting human, animal or plant life and 
health. The exception procedure under NAFTA is complex and the 
Canadian government must at least be able to demonstrate that the 
substance in question has an adverse effect and that there is indeed 
a need to restrict this substance. The Canadian government could 
not do that in the case of MMT.
<P>
	The tragedy is that, if Ethyl wins and the Canadian government 
has to pay the company several millions of dollars in 
compensation, this money will come out of the pockets of 
taxpayers in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	Ethyl Corporation, the sole manufacturer of MMT and sole 
exporter of this substance to Canada, claims that the Canadian 
government was in breach of its obligations under NAFTA on three 
counts: article 1110 on expropriation and compensation; article 
1106 on performance requirements; and article 1102 on national 
treatment.
<P>
	Under the expropriation provisions, Ethyl complained first about 
a loss of goodwill because Canada tarnished its reputation both 
nationally and internationally by saying without proving it that 
MMT is harmful. The American company also complained about 
the expropriation of its Canadian investments since Bill C-29 
would preclude the commercial use of MMT by Ethyl Canada.
<P>
	Moreover, Ethyl claims that the bill would create a preference 
for national content by authorizing the production of MMT in 
Canada, which violates article 1106 of NAFTA. International law 
requires governments to pay compensation each time they 
expropriate.
<P>
	Finally, Ethyl claims that article 1102 dealing with national 
treatment was violated because it is discriminatory for the 
Canadian government to prohibit the import of MMT knowing full 
well that Ethyl is the sole manufacturer of this product.
<P>
	In closing, how much is the government prepared to pay in 
compensation? As the Minister of the Environment so eloquently 
said, in response to a question I asked him on September 25, a U.S. 
multinational corporation should not dictate what the Government 
of Canada should do in the best interests of Canadians, both 
environmentally and healthwise. However, such a corporation has 
every right to remind the Government of Canada of the trade 
agreements it has signed.
<P>
	Considering the enormous cost for Quebec and Canada 
taxpayers due to the absence of any advantage in prohibiting MMT 
in the bill proposed by the Minister of the Environment, I can only 
ask members to vote against Bill C-29, thus avoiding a financial 
disaster in Canada.
<P>
	In closing, I would ask unanimous consent of the House to table 
a letter written by the Minister of International Trade to the 
Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Terrebonne is asking for 
permission to table the letter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent to table this letter here in the House 
of Commons?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5251"> 5251 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I hear a no so we will proceed from there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, am I to take it from the member's remarks that his party 
supports the continuing use of MMT as a gasoline additive? We 
now understand that this additive contributes to the build up of 
ozone levels and smog in urban areas. It is suspected but not proven 
to be a health hazard. It very clearly harms the diagnostic systems 
of currently built motor vehicles in North America and indirectly 
contributes to increasing smog if those diagnostic systems are not 
maintained properly.
<P>
	Second, he suggested that the replacement additive ethanol was a 
health hazard. I believe he said that. If he means it I hope he will be 
in a position to explain why his party believes that ethanol, which is 
proposed here in Canada to be a replacement additive for MMT, is 
a health hazard or not a good replacement for MMT.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be pleased to try to answer 
the two questions put by the hon. member.
<P>
	First, I am somewhat surprised that he would ask me to prove 
that ethanol is a good product, given that he says, without any proof 
to support his claim, that MMT is not a good product. I should ask 
you to prove to me that MMT is a good product.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member claims that MMT is harmful to 
one's health, that it contributes to smog, that it is harmful to the 
ozone layer and that it creates problems when diagnosing 
automotive systems. Where does he get his information, regardless 
of how accurate it may be? Let him prove his claims in this House.
<P>
	If the EPA came to the conclusion that MMT is not harmful to 
one's health and to the environment, and if major automakers 
cannot come up with a sound study confirming that MMT is 
harmful to the exhaust system of cars, how can the hon. member 
say that MMT is harmful?
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is only asking the member to prove that he 
is right. And we are not the only ones. Sometimes, when we form 
the opposition we may wonder whether we oppose a measure just 
for the sake of it.
<P>
	But this time I am not the only one opposing this measure. Even 
the Minister for International Trade, whose letter I was not allowed 
to table in the House, wrote to the Minister of the Environment to 
tell him this: what you are doing is dangerous; first, because it is 
not a proven fact; second, because this bill is not the appropriate 
measure, since it deals with trade, not health; and third, because it 
violates at least four or five articles under NAFTA.
<P>
	I will reply to the member's question by asking him a question of 
my own, as the Minister of Finance often does. First: does this bill 
violate three or four articles under NAFTA, yes or no? Second: can 
you, or your government, prove to me that MMT is harmful? Third: 
if you do this, I will answer your question about ethanol.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to commend my colleague on his speech. Obviously, we are 
not here to oppose everything systematically.
<P>
	However, if you read the amendment I put forward in this House 
a few weeks ago carefully, we were simply asking the government 
to wait six more months so that we could have conclusive studies, 
and I stress conclusive, that would prove something to us. The fact 
is that we have nothing of the sort for the moment; when we asked 
the automakers to provide us with specific and clear studies, they 
told us that their studies were confidential. It is rather strange for 
Parliament to be told that something is confidential.
<P>
	We asked the health department to confirm whether this 
substance was dangerous to health. The most recent study confirms 
that it is not. That is why we are asking the government to wait, to 
make sure that the right decision is made. As for a North American 
market, the United States have just reintroduced this product on the 
market, but we are going contrary to a North American policy.
<P>
	Ethanol too is an additive. Nothing shows that ethanol will do a 
better job than MMT. It is a new product on the market. The real 
solution would be that one day we no longer have to use any 
additives at all. That is the dream solution. But we are not there yet.
<P>
	I will tell you something that happened in my riding. The electric 
car has been launched there. That is the solution of the future. 
However the technology has not yet been sufficiently developed to 
commercialize it.
<P>
	I would like to know what my colleague thinks about the idea of 
developing in the near future a different but truly environmentally 
friendly technology, instead of replacing one additive by another. 
We are talking about two lobbies.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, very briefly, I agree with my 
colleague for Laurentides that we have to choose the lesser of two 
evils, but we would still be better off trying to find a better 
alternative.
<P>
	Obviously, I support all research and development on an electric 
car or another more environmentally friendly vehicle, but I would 
also like to comment on the remarks of my hon. friend.
<P>
	If in fact he is right when he says that MMT is bad for human 
health, for the environment, for cars and all the rest, why was it not 
declared a toxic and dangerous substance? What the Liberals are 
trying to do is simply to prevent the importation of MMT in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5252"> 5252 </A></B>
<P>
Canada, period. We will be able to go on producing it, selling it, 
using it and what not, but not importing it.
<P>
	If what the hon. member says is true, he should advocate a total 
ban on the use and sale of MMT.
<P>
	As my colleague said, we are suggesting a six month moratorium 
so they can bring some coherence into what they think and say. 
After that, we will take concrete and coherent measures.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the member's comments 
about the bill. As he said, this is not the first time we have debated 
the potential banning of the substance MMT in this Chamber. I am 
quite appalled, as I am sure he is, that this piece of legislation is 
back before us in an unamended form.
<P>
	I would like to quickly point out that it is very unusual for the 
Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party of Canada to agree on 
anything. In this case, we are in agreement that this is a bad piece 
of legislation. Any time it was to happen that both opposition 
parties were united in their opposition to a piece of legislation, I 
would hope the federal government would take note. Maybe some 
alarm bells would go off and the government would say that maybe 
there really is something wrong with the legislation. I put that 
forward for the hon. member's comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, my answer will probably take less 
than one minute. I am really happy to hear that my Reform 
colleague is proud we can agree on something. One more step and 
we can agree on sovereignty and partnership.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are two fundamental questions we should ask 
ourselves during this debate on Bill C-29 to ban the use of MMT in 
Canada.
<P>
	The first one is: Do the Canadian government and the Minister of 
the Environment have the authority and the right to pass an 
environmental act concerning the composition of the gasoline sold 
in Canada and, by the same token, to promote the use of alternative 
fuels, or should we give up this right for the sake of an American 
multinational corporation, that is threatening to take us to court for 
hundreds of millions of dollars?
<P>
	I see that the Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois have entered 
in a very interesting alliance. The Ethyl Corporation does not even 
need lobbyists with all the friends it already has on the other side of 
the House.
<P>
	The second question is: Is MMT the safest fuel additive we can 
have or are there other alternatives that present no health hazards to 
Canadians? These are the two main questions that need to be asked.
<P>
	In answer to the first one, I want to say that I do not support the 
Ethyl Corporation, a company that spends all of its time in court in 
the United States, that has spent years in court in the States to fight 
the EPA and that is now threatening to take the Minister of the 
Environment to court for $201 million, hoping that the Canadian 
government would soon retreat.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	We are talking about a very powerful American multinational 
that, up until recently, only sold its product in Canada. Japan was 
not buying, Germany was not buying, Denmark was not buying, 
Sweden was not buying, no other country besides Canada uses 
MMT.
<P>
	Everybody is wrong, except for us. But we now have come to 
realize that there are safer, more secure alternatives. In this battle, 
Canadians do not want to be used as guinea pigs by the Ethyl 
Corporation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We do not want to be the guinea pigs of the Ethyl Corporation. In 
fact, EPA in the United States lost the battle in the courts but it 
certainly is still very much of the opinion today that MMT is 
unfavourable to Americans.
<P>
	To quote from the head of the EPA, Carol Browner: ``The 
Environmental Protection Agency believes that the American 
public should not be used as a laboratory to test the safety of 
MMT''. Nor do we Canadians want to be the laboratory for the 
Ethyl Corporation in regard to MMT.
<P>
	In the United States today, despite the court challenges on MMT 
and the fact that MMT got a reprieve, it is not allowed as an 
additive in reformulated gas in California, in New York, in 
Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin. Almost one-third of the United States 
want nothing to do with MMT. These states use reformulated gas 
which includes additives which they believe are much safer for the 
health of Americans.
<P>
	I hear there has been no conclusive proof that it is harmful to the 
health of Canadians, yet I have quoted several studies that raise the 
precaution that MMT can be potentially very dangerous to human 
health. I will quote again from a study I received before the last 
debate in November 1995. It was completed by three scientists: 
Kimberley Treinen of the Sanofi Research Division of 
Collegeville, Pennsylvania; Tim Gray of the Alnwick Research 
Centre in Alnwick, Northumberland, England; and William Blazak 
of Nycomed, Collegeville, Pennsylvania:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5253"> 5253 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In summary, the data presented here indicate that a specific syndrome of skeletal 
malformation in rats was induced by  MnDPDP, which occurred in the absence of 
maternal toxicity at four times the intended clinical dose. The same specific 
malformations were also seen with intravenous administration of equivalent or lower 
doses of manganese. Since manganese has been shown to cross the placenta 
(Jarvinen and Ahlstrom, '75; Koshida et al, '63; Rojas et al, '67) it appears that 
manganese is the active teratogenic moeity in MnDPDP.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If we wait to find out if manganese is bad for human beings, if it 
affects people's brains after it affected the brains of rats and other 
lab animals, is that the precautionary principle Canadians should 
use?
<P>
	This is what we used to say about DDT when Rachel Carson 
wrote her famous book. This is what we used to say about PCBs; 
they were also safe. This is what we used to say about CFC gases. 
They were the intended gases that were the purest of gases until we 
found out they perforated the ozone layer. It is what we used to say 
about lead. We used lead in gasoline every day of our lives. Many 
people in the world used lead in gasoline until we found out that it 
causes cancer.
<P>
	So do we wait until we have this final and conclusive proof that 
will satisfy my friends from the Reform Party and my friends from 
the Bloc Quebecois? When we find out, what happens if it is too 
late and the effects are irreversible? If there were no alternatives, 
they would have a case, but we have alternatives.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Before going to Montreal from Ottawa I stop at McEwen's 
gasoline station on Bank Street. It serves an ethanol blend of 
gasoline. My car runs just as well on that as it does on ordinary 
gasoline with MMT. In fact, as my colleague says, it runs better.
<P>
	My friend from the Bloc Quebecois said this was a plug by the 
Liberals to sell corn in Ontario. I could introduce him to a big firm 
in Quebec that produces ethanol from wood. Ethanol can be 
produced from sugar cane remnants, from wood and from all kinds 
of things. It is not a plug by the Liberals to sell corn.
<P>
	The time has come to say that manganese is not good for us. In 
the latest surveys in Canada, surveys about health and the 
environment, at least 75 per cent of Canadians consistently said 
that until we are sure, we should not use manganese. They said it 
should be banned.
<P>
	The people who are for the banning of MMT are not just those 
involved with General Motors and Honda. They are those involved 
in the Asthma Information Association, the Canadian Institute of 
Child Health, the City of North York Public Health Department, the 
City of Toronto Public Health Department, the Environmental 
Defence Fund, the Learning Disabilities Association of Canada, the 
Ontario Public Health Association, Pollution Probe and Sierra Club 
of Canada. They are not automobile manufacturers. They are all 
terribly worried about manganese.
<P>
	I do not care about Ethyl Corporation. I do not care if it loses 
money, so long as the health of Canadians will be better off.
<P>
	The challenge is: Do we let Ethyl Corporation threaten us? Do 
we let Ethyl Corporation dictate the policy of Canada? Why does it 
not sell its product in Japan, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and 
Holland? Those countries believe in the environment. They do not 
use it. Why should we be the only guinea pigs in the world? Why 
should we accede to the threat of an American multinational which 
uses the courts to browbeat us into a policy that is supposed to be so 
wonderful? If it is so wonderful, why do so many countries in the 
world not want it?
<P>
	The case is: the environment, the health of Canadians, the 
precautionary principle and the autonomy of the Government of 
Canada and of the Minister of the Environment to decide that yes, 
we will ban MMT and use better alternatives. That is the case and I 
make it today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
make a few comments and ask a question to my colleage across the 
way.
<P>
	I took some notes during his speech. The member started his 
speech by saying: ``Does Canada have the power to legislate in this 
matter?'' His answer was yes. ``Would it be the good solution to 
ban MMT?'' Yes, he said. He ended his speech by talking about the 
pressures exerted by American multinationals. However, he said 
nothing about the pressures exerted by the auto makers lobby, 
which do want to get rid of MMT.
<P>
	Is the member across the way saying: ``No, we will not give in to 
pressures by American multinationals; however, we are ready to 
give in to pressures exerted by multinationals that build cars here''.
<P>
	The real point at issue here, and I think the Bloc and the Reform 
Party made it quite clear, is the amendment of the member for 
Laurentides to postpone third reading of this bill for six months. 
Why? And this is where we, of the Bloc, are not giving in to any 
pressure. We are not giving in to any pressure.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	We expect impact studies on MMT to be made. We want to know 
the impacts of this product and we want to know if there are 
substitute additives that could be used. Those studies are needed. 
Why does the government want to have its bill adopted so quickly 
since we could get clear answers to our questions six months from 
now?
<P>
	We have to ask ourselves this kind of question. We must ask why 
the government is so anxious to pass its bill when the Bloc and the 
Reform Party are making a constructive proposal and asking that 
passage of the bill be postponed for six months. If the hon. member 
across  the way is truly sincere when he says that health and a clean 
environment must be considered, that his main concern is the 
health of Canadians and Quebecers, I think that a six month delay, 
which would allow us to find out what the alternatives and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5254"> 5254 </A></B>
<P>
impacts of MMT are, would be an wise, fair and reasonable 
decision.
<P>
	I would ask the following question of the hon. member: 
Considering his concern for the well-being of Quebecers, does he 
not think that it would be advisable to wait six months and have all 
the necessary information to make the right decision?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln: </B>Mr. Speaker, first of all, I do not think that the 
member listened carefully to what I said. I was not speaking only 
about automobile manufacturers. That is their business. They have 
their lobby, and that is their business. I mentioned companies, 
health institutions and environmental institutions. I said that a poll 
showed that 75 per cent of Canadians felt that if MMT and 
manganese cannot be shown to be 100 per cent safe, they should be 
banned.
<P>
	Furthermore, the fundamental issue is this: we are going to wait 
another six months to please the official opposition. But that is not 
what we are talking about today. I think that the predecessor of my 
colleague, the member for Lambton-Middlesex, Ralph Ferguson, 
had been talking about it since 1988.
<P>
	If the members of the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party are 
interested in this issue, let them look over the proceedings of the 
House committees, which have discussed this issue ad infinitum. 
Mr. Ferguson himself made it a personal crusade here in the House 
of Commons. The time has come for action.
<P>
	Manganese is potentially dangerous to the health. Even Mrs. 
Browner of the EPA says so. We do not want to be guinea pigs for 
Ethyl corporation. That is not what Canadians want. They can go 
sell their manganese somewhere else if it is so good. Nobody wants 
to buy it. Why would we be the only ones in the world to do so?
<P>
	That is why MMT must be banned now. Enough stalling around. 
This is a cause that the great majority of Canadians support.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened quite attentively to the hon. member. I noted 
that early in his remarks he said that we must not capitulate to Ethyl 
Corporation. It is threatening to take us to court. He accused the 
Reform Party and the Bloc of somehow being in cahoots, being 
lobbyists for this huge multinational.
<P>
	The member from the Bloc raised a good point. It is not only the 
lobbyists on one side of the argument who are making points here. 
If we want to get into throwing accusations across the floor, some 
Liberal members of Parliament could be accused of being lobbyists 
for  automobile manufacturers. I do not think that would do us any 
good in the debate today.
<P>
	I have a couple of questions for the hon. member. I noted that he 
used the words ``potentially harmful health effects of MMT''. He 
was very careful to use the word ``potentially''.
<P>
	Why did the Department of Health not support the findings of 
this raft of studies he has put forward. If it can be substantiated why 
did the Department of Health not recommend an outright ban on 
MMT?
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	The second question is if that is the case, that he truly believes 
and his government believes that MMT is harmful and has been 
proven to be harmful, which I do not believe it has been proven to 
be so, why is his government not moving to completely ban MMT 
instead of bringing forward this half measure of banning the 
transportation of MMT across borders?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Health confirmed in 
July 1996 that he is totally supportive of the ban on MMT. That is 
the first fact.
<P>
	The second fact is that the responsibility happens to be that of 
the Minister of the Environment. It was the minister of the 
environment in 1988 who proposed the banning of lead from 
gasoline, not the Minister of Health. That is his prerogative and the 
Minister of Health is fully supportive as is the total Government of 
Canada. That is the position. Even the Minister for International 
Trade, after having issued a caution, has now reversed himself and 
said: ``Yes, after studying it, I agree there is no problem with 
NAFTA''.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Would you let me speak, please.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Let me just see if I can help 
the hon. member and ask for the House's co-operation that we 
might be able to resume this debate and facilitate even more 
questions and consequently more answers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> My point is I am not a lobbyist for the automobile 
industry. I do not care about the automobile industry. It is big 
enough to fend for itself.
<P>
	I resent the threat of a multinational corporation which sold its 
product exclusively in Canada, until it won a court case in the 
United States, to brow beat us into saying: ``If you don't keep 
MMT, and remain the only territory in the world, the only suckers 
that sell MMT all over the world, if you don't do it, then I'm going 
to take you to court for $200 million''. As far as I know the 
automobile industry is not taking Canada to court or any of the 
members here for $200 million.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5255"> 5255 </A></B>
<P>
	Why do we ban MMT? For my sake, as one member, it is 
because I think the potential risks-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Will you please allow me to speak. The potential 
risks to health and the environment are not worth taking the chance. 
If the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform are so keen about MMT that 
they want to take a chance, we do not want to take a chance. We 
think there are severe potential dangers and we want to ban MMT. 
That is what we are going to do.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to start by pointing out to my hon. colleague for 
Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis that I understand, since he is a former 
environment minister, that he would get carried away about a bill 
affecting the environment.
<P>
	Quite simply, my question is a kind of follow-up to the question 
asked by our colleague from the Reform Party. Mr. Speaker, I 
would ask the hon. member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, 
through you, to point out where in my speech I formally support the 
sale or production of MMT. That is not what I am saying.
<P>
	If this product is as toxic or dangerous as he suggests, why is the 
bill aimed at banning its importation, thus opening the door to 
actions under NAFTA? The Minister of International Trade has 
also said this. Why is its importation banned, and why is its 
production, use and consumption in Canada not banned as well, 
through another department and another bill?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not the Minister of the 
Environment, I am not in the Canadian cabinet. The government 
chooses the alternatives it deems most appropriate in a given 
circumstance. In this case, it has chosen this bill. What is important 
is the facts.
<P>
	What we are aiming at is results, one way or another, and we 
have chosen this bill as the most expeditious means to an end. We 
want to ban MMT, no matter what. We do not want it in Canada. 
Quite simply, that is what we want.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think we are all at the point of exhaustion with this piece 
of legislation. For a year and a half we have debated the issue of the 
gasoline additive MMT. To say the least, we have debated the issue 
enough that by now the Liberals I think should be embarrassed, but 
we drag along while more pressing issues remain.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	Since the bill was first introduced in May 1995 by the former 
minister of the environment, arguments have been made on both 
sides of the House, round and round. The government states that 
MMT should be banned from being used in gasoline in order to 
protect the environment as well as the health of Canadians. Yet this 
bill does not directly ban MMT. It merely bans the importation and 
the interprovincial trade of MMT.
<P>
	When one bans something from being allowed to enter the 
country does it necessarily mean that it is harmful? What about 
prohibiting something from being moved across the country 
freely? If it is harmful should not banning it once be enough?
<P>
	When a particular substance is harmful to our health or to the 
environment there is a regulatory authority in place to take care of 
such a problem. It is called the Canadian Environmental Protection 
Act, better known as CEPA. Within CEPA there is a schedule of 
substances that have been deemed to be hazardous either to our 
health or to the environment. CEPA is in place to protect 
Canadians. In fact, this government is responsible for making 
amendments to CEPA in order to place added protection on our 
already fragile environment.
<P>
	However, if we take CEPA and look at the back of the act in the 
schedule section, MMT is not to be found nor will it ever be found 
in that section. Why? It is not harmful to our health nor is it 
harmful to the environment.
<P>
	For a substance to be placed on the schedule under CEPA it must 
first be declared hazardous by Health Canada. I believe the public 
has a right to know how Health Canada views MMT. Anyone who 
has listened to any of the debate on this bill over the last year and 
half is well aware of the December 6, 1994 Health Canada report 
entitled ``Risk Assessment for the Combustion Products of MMT''.
<P>
	Even though the following statement is on the record, I feel it is 
such an integral part of the issue that it should be read again. The 
study states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All analyses indicate that the combustion products of MMT in gasoline do not 
represent an added health risk to the Canadian population.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I suppose it appears that MMT is no more harmful than benign 
dust on the ground.
<P>
	On October 18, 1995 a Health Canada official appeared before 
the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable 
Development and concurred that the 1994 report remained the 
position of the department.
<P>
	Therefore I want to urge all members of the House not to include 
in their speeches during this third reading stage any reference that 
the removal of MMT will improve health quality. I heard several 
government members make mention of this during second reading. 
It is false and inaccurate information. A member may make an 
unprecedented or unpredicted mistake; however, in this case the 
evidence gives very clear direction.
<P>
	I want to bring up one more revelation from Health Canada. It 
has to do with MTBE, of which Environment Canada officials say 
could be a replacement for MMT.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5256"> 5256 </A></B>
<P>
	On October 18, 1995 Mr. Rod Raphael, the chief of the 
monitoring and criteria division of Health Canada, appeared 
before the environment committee with the following revelation 
about MTBE:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We have concerns with respect to MTBE. MTBE was on the CEPA priority 
substances list, an evaluation was done under a particular scenario, and that is the 
present use and containment situation for MTBE. Should MTBE be added to 
Canadian fuel as a replacement for MMT? That exposure scenario changes for us 
and we are in the process of evaluating it at the request of the Canadian General 
Standards Board which is considering MTBE as part of gasoline formulation. We are 
also concerned about MTBE because of new data that is now available but was not 
available at the time of the original CEPA evaluation. There is a long term cancer 
study now available and it needs to be evaluated and brought into the assessment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	From the very beginning, Reformers have unequivocally stated 
that they would support the banning of MMT if the government 
could prove through independent scientific tests that MMT was 
harmful to automakers onboard diagnostic systems in cars or to the 
health of Canadians and the environment.
<P>
	Let us talk a bit about these OBDs. Onboard diagnostic systems 
simply monitor the emission control systems on most late model 
automobiles. It needs to be reiterated that they do not reduce 
emissions directly. In fact, if the OBD system were removed from 
the automobile completely it would make absolutely no difference 
to the exhaust coming out of the tail pipe.
<P>
	The OBDs were set to be installed in the 1996 line-up of 
automobiles. The former environment minister had assured the 
automakers that this bill we are talking about today would be 
quickly passed in 1995 in time for manuals to be printed up and the 
OBDs to be hooked up. Well, such was not the case.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	Within the auto industry it is no secret that the technology 
surrounding the OBD systems is new and full of bugs. In the United 
States where MMT is not currently being used widely in 
gasoline-although I might add that a recent court decision has 
allowed MMT to be sold-OBDs have been found to malfunction.
<P>
	This poses the question: Is it MMT that is causing the problem or 
is it simply the fault of the new technology malfunctions? If I 
happened to be a betting man I would go with the latter.
<P>
	In response to these malfunctions in the U.S., automakers have a 
bevy of scapegoats that they are using to justify the problems: 
altitude, temperature, sulphur, poor fuel quality, road conditions, 
customer driving habits and extreme weather conditions. However, 
in Canada according to the automakers, there is only one reason for 
the OBD malfunctions, namely, MMT.
<P>
	What is wrong with this picture? The government and our two 
environment ministers have been hoodwinked into believing that 
keeping MMT will cause catastrophic  events to occur. Sadly they 
have convinced many of their colleagues into thinking the same. 
However, what is interesting is to see how the Liberal cabinet is 
split on this whole issue.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry stated that he hoped for a uniform 
standard in fuels between the U.S. and Canada only to see this all 
crushed with a U.S. court decision permitting the sale of MMT. The 
Minister of Natural Resources has been particularly quiet on this 
whole issue because she knows what the costs will be to refineries 
in her Edmonton riding should the bill pass.
<P>
	Then there is the Minister for International Trade who on 
February 23 of this year wrote a strong letter to the Minister of the 
Environment urging him to put the bill on the shelf for good. The 
trade minister stated ``the claims of the automotive and petroleum 
industries conflict markedly with common ground between them''. 
The minister went on to say that the bill ``could have many adverse 
implications for Canadian trade, without compensating 
environmental benefits''.
<P>
	These are only three ministers that have declared their 
frustrations publicly. It would not surprise me if many more 
ministers are expressing doubts about the validity of this 
legislation behind closed cabinet doors.
<P>
	The Reform Party's position is very solid. We want protection 
for Canadians with respect to their health. We also want to keep our 
environment clean and free from harmful pollutants. The Reform 
Party will support this legislation if the government can prove that 
MMT is harmful to our health and to our environment. Otherwise 
we are totally opposed. Ours is a reasonable approach as there are 
environmental benefits for the use of MMT.
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment has a choice and the choice is 
rather simple. Withdraw the bill from the Order Paper and conduct 
a series of third party independent tests to prove without a shadow 
of a doubt the effects of MMT. Canadians do not want to see tests 
from the automakers nor do they want to see tests from the oil 
companies. We know how tests can be skewed to reflect the views 
of those paying to have the tests done and I think this is what has 
happened so far. There needs to be a fair process and it needs to be 
done by someone not connected with either of the interested 
parties.
<P>
	The minister is going to have MMT as his political legacy and 
the legacy will not be favourable. He inherited the environment 
portfolio from a minister who acts before she thinks. Bill C-94 
came into being because the Deputy Prime Minister reacted to one 
lobby group without knowing all the facts. Now the same minister 
has covered herself in the flag, not realizing how much trouble she 
is in.
<P>
	I want to encourage the environment minister to do the right 
thing, withdraw the bill and instead proceed with tabling legislation 
that will really bring protection to our environment, namely, 
changes to the Canadian  Environmental Protection Act and bring 
forward a new federal endangered species act.
<P>
	In closing I want to read two letters that pertain to Bill C-29. My 
colleague for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca recently read to this House 
several letters from provincial environment ministers who opposed 
the passage of Bill C-29. Further to this I want to read a letter 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5257"> 5257 </A></B>
<P>
written to the Prime Minister from the chairman of the board of the 
Federated Co-operatives Limited based in Saskatchewan. It was 
addressed to the Prime Minister with copies to three cabinet 
ministers on September 23 of this year:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We were very disappointed to learn that Bill C-29, an act effectively banning the 
use of MMT in gasoline in Canada is again being considered.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Federated Co-operative Limited (FCL) owns Consumers' Co-operative Refineries 
Limited (CCRL), which operates a petroleum refinery in Regina. CCRL produces 
gasoline and diesel fuel for co-op members and other customers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On behalf of our members, we oppose any legislation that would ban the use of 
MMT as a gasoline additive until an adequate technical evaluation has taken place. 
We have used MMT for 18 years with no consumer complaints. MMT has allowed 
the production of high quality gasolines from our refinery at a lower cost and with 
lower environmental emissions that would have been required without MMT.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We do not believe the petroleum refining industry, and ultimately our members 
and other customers, should bear the costs of MMT elimination unless it can be 
shown conclusively that there is a legitimate need.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We had believed that if MMT were approved for use in the United States that, in 
the interests of harmonization of gasoline qualities, the proposed Bill C-29 would no 
longer be considered necessary. Certainly, a substantial amount of fleet testing and 
study took place prior to the approval of MMT in gasoline in the U.S.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If further scientific study and testing is to be carried out in Canada, we suggest 
that it be done in conjunction with the petroleum industry (CPPI), and the Motor 
Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, (MVMA), under the auspices of the CCME task 
force on cleaner vehicles and fuels. We believe the banning of MMT without 
scientific evidence of negative effects due to the use of this additive is premature.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We also wish to emphasize that there is no relationship between the banning of 
MMT and increased utilization of ethanol. MMT is an octane-enhancing additive 
and ethanol is a high octane blending material that has both positive and negative 
effects when blended in gasolines. The refiners preferred route to offset this 
proposed ban on MMT would be to increase the severity of gasoline processing (at 
an increased cost). Ethanol considerations are a totally separate issue that our 
organization is very familiar with.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>FCL provides central wholesaling, manufacturing and administrative services to 
more than 800 locally-owned retail co-operatives across western Canada and 
western Ontario. FCL is owned by its member retailers, which are in turn owned by 
an estimated 750,000 individual co-op members. Together, FCL and its member 
co-operatives are known as the Co-operative Retailing System in western Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Yours truly,<BR>
 E. Klassen, President, Chair of the Board.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	Last, I want to read a letter that was sent to the Minister of 
Natural Resources from the co-chair of the Council of Energy 
Ministers. It is dated September 20, 1996. It is addressed to the 
Prime Minister, the Minister of Industry and the Minister of the 
Environment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Minister:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>During the 1996 meeting of the Council of Energy Ministers in Yellowknife, 
Northwest Territories, ministers discussed the federal Bill C-29, the 
Manganese-based Fuel Additives Act, the bill to eliminate import and trade of MMT.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>During the meeting, concern was expressed about the lack of effective 
consultation of both industry and provinces on a proposal which will impose direct 
costs on industry and consumers and will directly affect provincial jurisdiction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Additionally, it is apparent that there is no clear consensus from a technical point 
of view concerning the impact of MMT, and whether or not MMT is, in fact, a 
significant problem for vehicle diagnostic systems.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Ministers are aware of the very helpful September 11, 1996 proposal to the Prime 
Minister from the Canadian Petroleum Products Institute and would like to 
recommend it to the federal government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In brief, the CPPI has offered that ``CPPI member companies will stop using 
MMT if an impartial review process involving ourselves, the federal government, 
and any other stakeholders you deem should participate, determine that the product 
is flawed in terms of impact on human health, air quality, or vehicle compatibility''. 
The CPPI suggests that a credible evaluation process could be completed within a 
matter of three months.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The CPPI proposal is very constructive. Provincial and territorial ministers in 
attendance at the Council meeting (Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, 
Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta) and the Deputy Ministers and officials on behalf 
of Quebec, Prince Edward Island and Yukon urge the federal government to 
immediately announce delay in passage of Bill C-29 to enable the time limited 
evaluation process suggested by CPPI to be convened to report on technical related 
issues.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Sincerely,<BR>
 Stephen Kakfwi
<P>
	Canadians expect government legislation to be drafted following 
extensive study and scientific reasoning. Canadians expect the best 
from their government. Passage of Bill C-29 will only show 
Canadians that changes to regulations can be bought if the price is 
right. Passage of Bill C-29 will surely be a sad day for the 
democratic process of this country.
<P>
	Delay the bill and let the independent science come in. Let the 
government demonstrate, then legislate, and then we will support 
to do the right thing, rather than the bidding of special interests. As 
a country, let us be good neighbours and not violate our 
international trade promises and also the goal of complete 
economic union within our Canadian borders.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
opposite has raised a number of good points,  particularly around 
the issue of independent science. However, this seems to be a game 
of whose science is on whose side.
<P>
	We have studies that indicate that MMT can cause neurological 
damage, both in terms of speech and physical movements in 
humans. I would like to know what side the Reform and Bloc 
parties stand on? Do they stand on the side of public interest and 
public good, or do they stand on the side of CPPI, the refineries.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	I would like to ask the member why he would side against the 
majority of Canadians when it is his party that purports to be a 
party of the people. The majority of Canadians overwhelmingly 
support our initiatives on this matter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5258"> 5258 </A></B>
<P>
	I would also like to ask him why he would stand against the 
Allergy Asthma Association, the Canadian Institute of Child 
Health, the city of North York public health, the city of Toronto 
public health, the Council of Canadians, the Environmental 
Defence Fund, the Learning Disabilities Association of Canada, the 
Ontario Public Health Association, Pollution Probe and Sierra Club 
when these organization quite clearly are not asking in the name of 
any particular vested interest other than the public good?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Mr. Speaker, that comment just highlights what I 
have been trying to point out, that the comments are all over the 
map. We have been proposing conclusive independent evidence. To 
say that my list of lobby groups is longer than your list of lobby 
groups really does not add anything to the debate.
<P>
	The issue is that all the scientific material was taken into account 
by Health Canada and it was determined that the use of MMT in a 
vehicle was no more harmful than dust on the ground. We do not 
recommend that people eat the dust from the ground, however, 
Health Canada stated MMT is essentially benign and not relevant 
to the previous problem of lead in gasoline.
<P>
	The lead in gasoline was a health issue. Scientists were very 
clear on that point and Parliament finally moved on it. But the 
science on MMT is completely different. We take no position on 
one side or the other.
<P>
	We challenged the government that it had better demonstrate 
scientifically before it legislates. Because it has not done that and 
has gone the trade route, it is now in trouble as being a bad 
neighbour under NAFTA and it will be challenged. We have been 
warning about this for quite some time.
<P>
	We say that we are not in support of one side or the other. Let the 
true scientific evidence come forward and then we will do the right 
thing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a little 
earlier, the hon. member for Terrebonne tried to  table a letter here 
in the House but was denied permission to do so. I would like to 
quote a few excerpts from this letter, which was written by the 
Minister for International Trade on February 23, 1996, and 
addressed to the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``My department continues to have certain reservations 
concerning this measure which I wish to draw to your attention. 
Recently the U.S. Court of Appeal overturned the U.S. ban. This 
has effectively removed harmonization arguments in support of 
Bill C-94. Indeed, since adding MMT to petroleum products is now 
permissible in the U.S., harmonization would now be promoted by 
introducing no new Canadian regulations.
<P>
	An import prohibition on MMT would be inconsistent with 
Canada's obligation under the WTO and the NAFTA. The 
possibility is that the United States could mount a challenge either 
on USDR's own initiative or pursuant to a section 301 petition. 
Also Ethyl Corporation may try to advance an argument that such a 
ban would be a measure tantamount to expropriation of Ethyl's 
investment in Canada. Thus Canada may also be susceptible to an 
investor state challenge under chapter 11 of the NAFTA.
<P>
	In view of the presidential and congressional election this year, 
American politicians are particularly sensitive to any foreign 
initiative which might injure their domestic industries.
<P>
	In conclusion, let me stress my department's belief that Bill 
C-94 should not be reintroduced, as it could have many adverse 
implications for Canadian trade without compensating 
environmental benefits''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, for once we agree with the Reform Party, and we 
repeat our request for a six months' hoist.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	We know that today, in fact for the first time, the automobile 
industry has invested enormous amounts in research and studies to 
determine if MMT is really harmful to automobiles and to our 
health.
<P>
	Let us wait for the results of these studies and have our say at 
that time, instead of adopting a bill in a terrible rush-because that 
is what we are doing-without waiting for the findings of these 
studies. We are not taking sides, not for Ethyl and not for the 
automobile association, although I am not sure we could afford 
being sued for $201 million in American currency, considering 
Canada's financial situation.
<P>
	I would appreciate the opinion of my Reform colleague on the 
subject.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is good that we were able to put the 
letter on the record. It indicates that the Liberal cabinet is split on 
this issue. There is not conclusive scientific evidence to do what is 
being proposed by the bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5259"> 5259 </A></B>
<P>
	In view of the long debate in which we have been involved on 
this matter, one begins to wonder who really is in charge. Is the 
minister in charge, or is the bureaucracy in charge? We can change 
ministers but the same unsubstantiated stuff still comes forward. 
Sometimes departments develop a life of their own. I am 
wondering who is in charge in the government. Is it the minister 
and the cabinet, or is it the bureaucrats who, once they get an 
agenda, are going to drive it home?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to take part in the 
third reading and final debate on Bill C-29, formerly Bill C-94. The 
primary purpose of the bill is to ban the additive MMT from 
gasoline in Canada. As hon. members are well aware, this debate 
has been going on in the House since May 19, 1995 when Bill C-94 
was tabled and read for the first time. It is time for the House to 
make a decision on the bill.
<P>
	The bill has been characterized as a war of interests between two 
powerful groups: the automobile manufacturers who want the ban, 
and the manufacturer of MMT, Ethyl Corporation, and its oil 
industry allies, that want MMT to remain in Canadian gasoline. For 
us on this side of the House it is not one way or the other; it is 
purely a debate on environmental and health issues, on sustainable 
development issues resulting from automobile emissions that are 
the greatest source of noxious gases in the atmosphere.
<P>
	We are taking this action because we need to protect the latest 
onboard diagnostic systems that North American car 
manufacturers are installing in their vehicles. These systems are 
extremely important for the environment. They are responsible for 
monitoring the vehicle emissions controls and for alerting the 
driver of malfunctions. Without this kind of technology one cannot 
be aware of how well the car is working or if it is functioning at all 
in terms of its emissions control processes.
<P>
	These systems ensure that the cleaner burning engines of today 
and tomorrow operate as designed. They ensure that automobiles 
are properly maintained, resulting in decreased tailpipe emissions 
and improved fuel economy. In other words, this new technology is 
one more important tool to help us address air pollution, smog and 
climate change.
<P>
	This government will not allow MMT to get in the way of the 
automobile industry's efforts to make cars cleaner, more efficient 
and less polluting. Canada's environment and Canadian consumers 
have the right to  the best anti-pollution technology possible. In 
fact, it is our duty as parliamentarians to do all we can to maximize 
environmental conditions through the legislation we pass in the 
House.
<P>
	Yet Ethyl Corporation, the manufacturer of MMT, through its 
subsidiary Ethyl Canada, denies the vehicle industry's conclusions 
regarding the ill effects of MMT on vehicle emissions control 
systems. In fact, it makes the counterclaim that MMT is 
environmentally beneficial. Whom do we believe?
<P>
	What is certain is that the efforts to reduce motor vehicle 
pollution can no longer be addressed by just the petroleum 
industry, the auto industry or the federal government. Progress in 
reducing vehicle pollution requires simultaneous action by all. The 
petroleum industry needs to keep making improvements in the 
composition and the properties of the fuels that engines burn. The 
automobile industry needs to keep making improvements in the 
vehicle emissions control systems, such as those offered by 
onboard diagnostic systems. The government needs to take 
decisive action in Bill C-29 which will remove a major obstacle to 
the introduction of these technologies. That obstacle is MMT.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	An Environment Canada report states that on a national basis, 
gasoline and diesel powered vehicles still contribute some 60 per 
cent of the carbon monoxide emissions that are present in the 
atmosphere, 35 per cent of nitrous oxide emissions or smog, 25 per 
cent of our hydrocarbon emissions and 20 per cent of carbon 
dioxide emissions. Obviously these vehicles, both gasoline and 
diesel powered, are very big contributors to our smog and pollution 
problems.
<P>
	The same report stresses the need to proceed on all fronts at the 
same time in all these areas. It states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Vehicle technology and fuel composition, although two separate industry sectors, 
must be treated as an integrated system in the development of policies and programs 
in order to successfully reduce emissions from motor vehicles.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is very sound advice. It should complement this 
government's work in preparing our comprehensive motor vehicle 
emissions standards. To meet these standards we are counting on 
integrating improvements achieved in emissions control 
technologies and fuels. However, we clearly cannot hope to meet 
these standards without the kind of action we are taking against 
MMT as contained in Bill C-29.
<P>
	This is not an act of impatience as some members opposite have 
suggested. On the contrary. Since 1985 the federal government has 
waited for the automotive and petroleum industries to resolve the 
situation without legislation. It has not been resolved. The time for 
waiting is over. It is now time for the government to act.
<P>
	In October 1994 the former Minister of the Environment gave a 
final warning to both the petroleum  and automotive industries to 
voluntarily resolve the issue of MMT in Canada by the end of 1994, 
otherwise the government would take action. The deadline was 
subsequently extended to February 1995 with no resolution in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5260"> 5260 </A></B>
<P>
sight. Therefore the government tabled Bill C-94 in May 1995 and 
we have been debating it and its successor, Bill C-29, ever since.
<P>
	The MMT issue is no longer an industry dispute. Its outcome can 
affect the vehicle emissions program which we as a government are 
putting into place, such as the new emissions standards recently 
announced by the Minister of the Environment for the cars in the 
1998 model year. Part of these new emissions standards will 
include mandatory testing which will ensure that the only 
automobiles allowed on the road will be those that are equipped 
with proper emissions systems.
<P>
	As was recently pointed out to me by one of my constituents, a 
retired zone service manager for Ford Motor Company of Canada, 
one of the main reasons for vehicles pumping huge amounts of 
pollutants into the air is that many cars have been equipped with 
cheaper but inferior after market exhaust systems. Mandatory 
testing would ensure that these inferior exhaust systems are 
replaced by the latest systems.
<P>
	However, all these efforts will go for naught if they are not 
accompanied by laws that require cleaner burning fuels. That is 
what Bill C-29 is all about. In the long term, failure to take action 
could also negatively impact on the entire automotive sector.
<P>
	Canadians are ready for this legislative action. The results of a 
poll conducted last May by Compas Incorporated show that 
Canadians have some clearly defined opinions on this issue. The 
most revealing finding from the survey reflects Canadians' 
preference to exercise caution when asked to choose between two 
potential approaches of dealing with MMT.
<P>
	The question was: In assessing whether MMT should be used in 
Canada, which one of the following two points of view best reflects 
your own: MMT should be banned unless it is proven that it does 
not have any negative effects on people's health; or, MMT should 
be allowed to be used unless it is proven to have negative effects on 
people's health?
<P>
	The survey showed that 64 per cent of Canadians believed MMT 
should be banned unless it is proven that it does not have any 
negative effects on people's health. In other words, approximately 
two out of three Canadians are concerned enough about the 
potential health effects associated with MMT that they would 
prefer to have it banned.
<P>
	Canadians do not want to be used as laboratory rats. They have 
heard enough evidence regarding the toxic effects of manganese. 
Canadians remember hearing the argument from oil companies 
concerning the use of lead in gasoline. We were all told not to 
worry about it.  Manganese, like lead, is also a heavy metal and like 
lead, manganese definitely acts as a neurotoxin.
<P>
	A full 75 per cent of the respondents to the survey said that the 
argument that MMT should be banned in Canada because scientific 
evidence suggests airborne manganese has adverse effects on 
people is at the very least a good argument in support of a ban. 
Somewhat fewer but still a strong 65 per cent also said this about 
the argument: ``MMT should be banned in Canada because it harms 
emissions control components in automobiles which monitor and 
reduce automobile air emissions''.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	I believe the jury is out concerning the reactions of the Canadian 
people to the legislative initiatives before us today. It is quite clear 
to me that the Canadian people support us in our desire to finally 
remove MMT from Canadian gasoline.
<P>
	Passing this legislation will accomplish a number of important 
things. It will deliver a long standing commitment to ban MMT in 
Canadian automotive fuels. It will advance efforts to reduce 
vehicle emissions and to contribute to air quality improvement in a 
manner consistent with the recommendations of the Canadian 
Council of Ministers of Environment in its October 1995 report. It 
will minimize the potential risk to the health of current and future 
generations of Canadians by taking a precautionary approach until 
the effects of chronic low level exposure are fully understood. It 
will defend the interests of consumers by ensuring that gasoline 
free of MMT is available across Canada. It will expand existing 
and new market opportunities for acceptable alternatives to 
manganese based gasoline additives, such as renewable fuels like 
ethanol which are already widely available in Canada.
<P>
	I urge my colleagues in this House to support the bill. Ensuring 
that fuels free of MMT are available means that Canadian 
consumers will receive the emissions reductions and air quality 
they have demanded and have every right to expect. As their 
representatives, we owe it to the Canadian people to pass this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to remind the hon. member that six out of ten provinces are 
opposed to Bill C-29. Once again, the federal government has 
interfered by deciding to go ahead with this bill. It wants to replace 
MMT with ethanol. I do not know if studies have been done on 
ethanol production, but we have received nothing so far. Ethanol 
production is very expensive and its environmental impact is 
unknown.
<P>
	We know that ethanol production causes considerable soil 
pollution. Ethanol is made with corn. Is ethanol production viable? 
It is highly subsidized by the government, but will this product 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5261"> 5261 </A></B>
<P>
eventually become  viable? Will we have to switch back to MMT 
five years from now?
<P>
	Can the government not wait six months as we requested? Six 
months is not the end of the world. Can the government not wait six 
months for independent researchers, not lobby groups, to carry out 
conclusive studies so we can find out if MMT is really dangerous?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ur:</B> Mr. Speaker, there appears to be a great concern in this 
House as to whether ethanol is a pollutant and to its cost.
<P>
	I would strongly encourage members to take the time to read the 
information on ethanol to see how cost effective it is. Burning 
wood, using corn, as pollutants I can hardly see that being a heavy 
metal. I would strongly encourage members to read that 
information.
<P>
	There is ethanol, there is MTBE, there is ETBE, but there seems 
to be a red flag in this House when we mention ethanol. It is not a 
polluting agent when we use a byproduct such as wood shavings 
and corn to produce a product like this. It is an environmental 
concern that helps all Canadians to breathe cleaner air.
<P>
	All of us should be on the bandwagon to support this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened, as I always do, very attentively to the hon. 
member's dialogue on Bill C-29.
<P>
	During her speech she referred to the fact that the government 
had been hoping that the automobile industry and the oil industry, 
and specifically Ethyl Canada as a subsidiary of Ethyl Corporation 
of the United States, would have come to some voluntary 
arrangement on the issue of MMT. That is what she said during her 
discourse.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	What I found interesting in that is that 1984 to 1996, by my 
calculation, is 12 years. I would have thought that in 12 years, if 
this government and the government before had really wanted to do 
something to drive this to resolution, as she said, they would have 
insisted that these two opposing factions would have got together 
and had an independent study done, which is what the Bloc and the 
Reform have been calling for for a year and a half. Clearly we have 
had 12 years where we have had conflicting testimony and studies.
<P>
	It is interesting to note, as an hon. Bloc member did before, that 
the automobile industry has been very reluctant to bring forward 
any proof of its studies and its findings. All they say is that they do 
find that MMT is harmful to the onboard diagnostic systems and to 
health.
<P>
	I have two quick points. In the hon. member's speech she said, as 
did a preceding Liberal member, that MMT is harmful to the health 
of Canadians. Yet Health Canada  does not support that, as the hon. 
member from Burnaby stated earlier in his remarks.
<P>
	The second point is whether the hon. member is aware, when she 
makes the point about how MMT gums up the onboard diagnostic 
systems in new automobiles, that it is claimed by the automobile 
manufacturers that they are experiencing just as many problems 
with the onboard diagnostic systems in the new automobiles in the 
United States. In the United States MMT has not been in fuel for 
some years now. What is the problem down there?
<P>
	If this government is going to blame the malfunctioning of 
onboard diagnostic systems on the use of MMT in Canadian 
gasoline, then clearly there should not be a problem in the United 
States. However, my information is that there is. Does the member 
know that?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his 
question.
<P>
	As to knowing the concerns of the automobile diagnostic 
systems in the United States, I am not totally aware of that. I am 
going by the recommendation of one of my constituents, whose 
party partisans I do not know, who told me emphatically that it was 
my duty as a Canadian, because of the knowledge he had working 
in the industry, to come to this House and support Bill C-29 
because of information he had at his fingertips.
<P>
	I am not a service manager. I do not know the components, but 
he told me that once MMT was in the gasoline, all kinds of cases 
with spark plugs in the mobile service managers' cars or vans and 
catalytic converters rose in numbers because of the MMT. He feels 
that banning MMT would certainly be the right approach for this 
government to move forward with.
<P>
	The statement was made that MMT was not used in the United 
States. Actually 85 per cent of U.S. oil refineries have confirmed 
they are not currently using MMT. Obviously they have inside 
knowledge not to promote MMT in their fuels because of what the 
hon. member is talking about. One does not have to be a rocket 
scientist to put those two things together.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 
38, it is my duty to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member 
for Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing-Unemployment insurance; the 
hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake-Canadian 
Wheat Board; the hon. member for Bourassa-Immigration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Bill C-29 would prohibit the importation of the manganese-based 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5262"> 5262 </A></B>
<P>
gasoline additive methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl, 
a chemical expression that sounds complicated but is  sometimes 
more straightforward than the government's logic.
<P>
	When the people of my riding chose a young person to represent 
them in this House, I think they were fully aware of the fact that 
one of the benefits of electing young politicians is to be able to plan 
ahead, 30 years ahead maybe.
<P>
	The environment is an issue very close to my heart because 
decisions made today might have disastrous effects 30 years down 
the road. I hope that I will still be around in 30 years. There is a 
fairly good chance of that. At least, I hope so.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Carbon monoxide emissions must be reduced to an absolute 
minimum. Studies show that there is a gasoline additive that helps 
reduce by up to 20 per cent these carbon monoxide emissions 
which are so harmful to our environment and to our health.
<P>
	This additive is manganese, or MMT if you prefer. Even those 
who oppose the use of MMT agree that using this substance helps 
cut carbon monoxide emissions by approximately 5 per cent.
<P>
	So, if we try to understand the reasoning of the Liberal 
government, something not always easy to do, it agrees and even 
seeks to let our atmosphere get polluted even more than it already 
is. Once again, the government wants the public to believe that the 
environment a priority. However, this bill is proof that it is really 
not the case.
<P>
	When I talk about the environment, I always feel a twinge of 
sorrow because, in spite of what some may claim, the current 
situation is not pretty. There are problems with the ozone layer in 
the north, and the smog is everywhere in the south. Our water is 
highly polluted. We can no longer drink the water of our lakes and, 
in some places, we cannot even swim or fish any more. 
Clear-cutting is also a widespread phenomenon.
<P>
	Recently, the Minister of Human Resources Development said I 
was a frustrated young person. He was right, because it is not 
always easy for an environmentalist to speak in this House.
<P>
	Indeed, I am somewhat frustrated because the previous 
generations were a bit careless and now we have to pay the price. 
With bills like this one, it is hard to say: ``Yes, we know what is 
going on and this is where we are headed''. I feel this bill is a step 
backward. It is disappointing.
<P>
	Hubert Reeves said: ``The universe gives rise to complexity. 
Complexity gives rise to efficiency, but does efficiency make 
sense?'' Looking at all the pollution created worldwide, I think that 
efficiency does not necessarily make sense.
<P>
	Unfortunately, a lot remains to be done in the environmental 
sector. I sometimes have the impression  that we have been 
mistaken in a number of areas, but the time has now come to take 
concrete action, and I think it is still taking too long. There is a 
tendency to stick one's head in the sand, to try to show that things 
are just fine.
<P>
	I cannot overlook the fact that last week I heard a very influential 
minister in the government saying that things were going well in 
Canada. It is unbelievable, when we know that the unemployment 
rate is over 10 per cent, that young people are fed up. Even when 
they graduate with a university degree, there are almost no jobs. 
Canada has the highest rate of suicide in the world. The debt is over 
$600 billion, but things are going well. It is too bad, but it is an 
indication of where we are headed.
<P>
	I see that some members of this House are reacting, and I am 
glad, because they should. You will tell me that you find me rather 
pessimistic, but what I want to be is realistic. The bottom line is 
that I was recently reading in a Quebec publication that 50 species 
disappear every day worldwide. The bottom line is that we are 
destroying the habitats of these species every day, by destroying 
our soil, our waterways and our air. The bottom line is that it is the 
air we breathe that we are talking about today.
<P>
	When all is said and done, what must be understood is that this 
will probably have repercussions 20 years from now. The food 
chain being what it is, when something happens to the smallest 
components, the effect continues on up the chain. When I speak of 
the smallest components, I am speaking of species that many 
people have still never heard of today. Unfortunately, ecologists are 
still misunderstood.
<P>
	When Galileo said the earth was round, people laughed at him 
for years. Many ecologists today are raising the alarm and there are 
still too many people on this planet laughing at them, and at the rate 
things are going, I am very worried. When we see that countries 
like those in Asia are modernizing and that soon everyone will have 
his own car, as we do here, I think we should be worried. But let us 
limit ourselves to the smaller picture.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	I said earlier that the fringe elements and ecologists are 
misunderstood. Which reminds me a little of the plan for 
sovereignty. When all is said and done, it is about taking a different 
route, a new route, which is something that scares people or for 
which they are not yet ready. It takes several years before people 
can support this kind of thing. But the environment is an issue that 
has to be settled now. It takes concrete action.
<P>
	There are still fringe elements, as I said before. The other day I 
heard someone in my riding saying we should not eat meat more 
than once a day. This is the kind of thing even I have trouble with. 
But we must listen to the environmentalists. I think there is hope. I 
know I seem rather pessimistic, but I am not that pessimistic. I 
would say I am a realist and a reasonable person. I am an optimist, 
but I do not want to bury my head in the sand. I  want to face the 
facts. I want to see the kind of problems we have, but I also realize 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5263"> 5263 </A></B>
<P>
that good work is being done today, which gives me hope for the 
future.
<P>
	I will first give an example from my riding, and I will then look 
at all this globally. Not long ago this year, we stopped the practice 
of log drives, which were polluting our rivers to a tremendous 
extent. The Péribonka river which flows along the north side of my 
riding may be developed for tourism in a dozen years or so. We 
would even be able to swim in the river. In my riding we also have 
a ZIP committee, Zone d'intervention prioritaire, which is 
supposed to raise public awareness of environmental problems. A 
river flows near my town, and I hope that someday we will be able 
to swim or fish in the river. I know I am talking about just one river 
in my riding, but it is not the only one. I have travelled across 
Canada, and there is pollution everywhere.
<P>
	I have further cause for hope. The Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean 
region is a laboratory for sustainable development. You can see 
progress has been made. There are people who opposed plans to 
develop the Chamouchouane, a river in my riding, which we 
decided to keep in its natural state-one of the few rivers in Quebec 
where that is the case.
<P>
	We even have town councillors involved in politics, and I am 
thinking of one in particular, Gérald Scullion, of the Town of Alma. 
He is probably the first ``green'' councillor in Quebec to be 
involved in the ``negawatts'' project of Métabetchouan. A village 
decided to set up the ``negawatts'' project. It decided to raise public 
awareness, and all energy savings would be reinvested. This project 
is headed by Mr. Paradis from Lac-Saint-Jean. At the regional 
level, I think we should pay tribute to these attempts to build a 
better world.
<P>
	Of course there is all the recycling as well. Whether we like it or 
not, we are increasingly seeing blue boxes next to the garbage cans. 
There is also the electric car, which is quietly making its way. In 
fact, not long ago a research centre was set up in the riding of the 
hon. member for Laurentides. These projects give me cause for 
hope. And there are of course movements like Greenpeace.
<P>
	Slowly but surely, we can come up for air. Except that when you 
do come up for air and go to Parliament and see what is going 
on-They try to act like environmentalists, although direct action, 
which was one of my slogans when I entered politics, is what 
makes lobbying a powerful force.
<P>
	The government says it is going to be more environmentally 
conscious by replacing MMT with ethanol. In fact, when I did my 
research for this speech, I found there were no specific studies that 
said that ethanol was safer for the environment. Well, perhaps in 
the combustion process, ethanol leaves fewer residues in the air, 
but look at all the consequences. When you grow corn, which is 
used to manufacture ethanol, you have the  whole ethanol 
production process. That is the problem. That is where we see that 
in the end, we lose out.
<P>
	Actually, all this is pretty useless since we have no studies on the 
subject, and this bill is taking us down an uncertain path. We can no 
longer afford to play around with the environment. There is too 
much at stake, and this worries me. When I an ordinary bill like this 
one, it is just one of many things people can do. Much remains to 
be done.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	In concluding, I will say that what saddens me is these short term 
policies. There is no long term view. Everything is short term. 
People build big stacks so the smoke will go to the village next 
door. It is really too bad, but that is how some people still think.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to say the following: We do not 
inherit the earth from our parents, we borrow it from our children.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted 
that the member for Lac-Saint-Jean has a catch in his throat when 
he talks about the environment.
<P>
	It is wonderful to know that we have an ally on the other side of 
the House. However, I am a little troubled in understanding why he 
is against Bill C-29. And perhaps the people in his riding would 
like to know why this member is going against the direction of the 
former leader of his party, the new premier of Quebec.
<P>
	This talk about politics, I am wondering where the politics is 
really coming from, if we are really concerned about the 
environment.
<P>
	I would like to quote a former minister of the environment on 
April 21, 1989. Maybe this was such a long time ago that the 
members of the Bloc have forgotten these things. The minister said 
he was aiming for the toughest regulations that technology can 
provide.
<P>
	The regulations he was referring to were the tough new standards 
for emission control technology on new model cars, which is the 
OBD-II system that we are talking about. We will not have 
effective operation of those OBD-II systems on our cars unless 
MMT is taken out of gasoline.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member opposite if, indeed, his throat 
catches when he talks about the environment and his love and his 
concern. How can he be so against what the previous member for 
his riding was advocating?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would point 
out that the province of Quebec, of which Lucien Bouchard is the 
premier, is against this bill. I am not referring to when the 
Conservatives were in power, I am talking about the present.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5264"> 5264 </A></B>
<P>
	I think my colleague across the way has not properly understood 
where my disagreement lies. Perhaps I digressed. Concretely, in 
short, imports of a product are banned without any certainty that 
it is harmful for the environment.
<P>
	In reality, we are well aware that interprovincial trade will not 
occur. The provinces are entitled to produce manganese, no 
problem with that. Yet we know that they will not. We know that 
the Ontario lobby has said that, if the government were to ban 
manganese, that would make it possible to add ethanol to gas, and 
ethanol is produced in Ontario. As I have just said, there are not 
even any studies available to demonstrate that ethanol is 
environmentally any cleaner.
<P>
	As my colleague has just pointed out, I am asking for a six 
month hoist to find out where we are at with this. I get the 
impression that a bill is being introduced just for the pleasure of 
introducing a bill, in order to show they are looking after the 
environment by passing some wonderful bill.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to remind the House of a few facts. The hon. parliamentary 
secretary to the Minister of the Environment, who sits on the 
environment committee with me, is fully aware of the work we did 
in committee. However, when there is a need for the Minister of the 
Environment to do something, nothing happens.
<P>
	We spent a year and a few months reviewing the CEPA with no 
results. Nothing came out of the department. We are supposed to 
review a bill on endangered species. Despite the urgency, nothing is 
moving at Environment Canada.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment even told me the other day he 
thought we did not ask him enough questions. The environment 
committee does not even have a legislative agenda. Instead of 
steamrolling bills like C-29 in order to satisfy Ontario, the ethanol 
plant announced by the former Minister of the Environment, which 
is currently under construction, as well as Ontario farmers-as we 
know, 75 per cent of Canadian corn comes from Ontario-we 
should perhaps think about this and, as we requested and as I will 
never stop saying, wait long enough for concrete studies to be 
carried out before we make a real decision.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will speak 
along the same lines as my colleague. I would like to take this 
opportunity to talk about a letter I have here that was sent by the 
Minister for International Trade to the Minister of the 
Environment, asking him to wait. Once again, we see a lack of 
consistency even within the government.
<P>
	As far as I am concerned, all I said today sums up the matter 
well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to the remarks made by the opposition critic, who said 
that this bill was of interest to Ontario manufacturers, who were 
pushing for it.
<P>
	It think there is something else at stake here: the health of 
Canadians, Ontarians, Quebecers, everyone. I do not think that 
health issues know boundaries and stop at the Quebec or Ontario 
border.
<P>
	I would simply like to ask my hon. colleague who raised the 
issue of the environment a moment ago a short question. How can 
he justify something like this going on for so long? The facts speak 
for themselves. Even manufacturers outside of Ontario, those for 
whom I worked many years ago, are concerned not only about what 
will happen to their product but also about the health of the public.
<P>
	There are many people asking this House to pass this bill. How 
can the hon. member turn his back on people and their health?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> This is quite 
unbelievable, Mr. Speaker. The hon. member opposite is giving us 
this rhetoric about his bill preserving life on this planet, when there 
are no studies backing his claims.
<P>
	Here is a member's statement under Standing Order 31, 
announcing the opening of a $153 million ethanol plant in 
Chatham, Ontario. The debate today is not about the environment, 
it is about patronage and lobbying.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to reply to the statement which was just made by 
the hon. member for Ontario. He stated that it really comes down to 
a health issue. Nothing could be further from the truth. If it is a 
health issue, why has Health Canada not recommended that MMT 
be banned? It does not support all of the so-called studies that the 
Liberal members are bringing up today. It simply does not support 
those studies. If Health Canada cannot find reasons to proceed with 
the banning, then I would say that hon. members opposite are 
simply puffing hot air on the issue. It certainly is not a health issue.
<P>
	Quite frankly, I find it appalling that they would try to use scare 
tactics, as they have so many times on other issues, to scare 
Canadians into believing that what the government is doing is 
really in their best interests. I find that quite despicable.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	As said by a number of individuals who spoke this afternoon, 
Bill C-29 goes back a long way. The thrust of this bill will be to 
impose a ban on trans-border transportation of MMT.
<P>
	It is somewhat ironic that the government would not impose an 
outright ban if it truly believes that this is in the best interests of the 
health of Canadians. It is not only harmful to the health but it is 
going to follow the onboard diagnostic systems in new automo--
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5265"> 5265 </A></B>
<P>
biles and all sorts of other issues that it believes are attributable to 
the burning of MMT in gasoline. If the government truly believes 
that why would it not just outright ban it, ban the use of MMT in 
Canada instead of simply banning the transportation of it?
<P>
	As said by one of my hon. colleagues, I think the House and 
individual members are reaching a point of exhaustion with this 
legislation. As an hon. Liberal member noted earlier, it dates back 
to May 1995 when the previous environment minister brought 
forward Bill C-94, before Parliament subsequently prorogued in 
January of this year, and that died on the Order Paper.
<P>
	I, along with a number of others, had hoped that when Bill C-94 
died on the Order Paper the new environment minister, following a 
cabinet shuffle, would not have seen fit to bring this bill back 
unamended, despite all the debate that had taken place in the House 
on Bill C-94, all the points that had been brought forward by a wide 
ranging number of speakers both in opposition and in government, 
as well as witnesses and, admittedly, the lobbying efforts on both 
sides of this argument. Despite all that information being brought 
forward, the new Minister of the Environment saw fit to bring in 
Bill C-29 which in reality is the old Bill C-94 virtually unchanged.
<P>
	It brings into question what exactly is the role to be debated in 
this House of Commons. Regardless of political stripes, if 
members bring forward points in debate in the House and they 
simply fall on deaf ears, what is the point to debate in the House at 
all when we see a minister bring back a piece of legislation 
unchanged despite some serious reservations being expressed by a 
lot of people?
<P>
	I believe quite strongly that this government with Bill C-29 has 
fallen prey to the lobbying efforts of the very powerful Canadian 
automobile industry. I know we have been accused on this side of 
the House of being in the pockets of the oil industry, which is on the 
other side of the argument.
<P>
	While we can defend what we have been saying, it is very 
difficult for the government to defend the real thrust of why it is 
bringing in this legislation if it is not to appease the automobile 
industry. It is bringing in a piece of legislation that will see the 
banning of a product used by the oil industry.
<P>
	The Reform position on this is and always has been that we 
would support an independent comprehensive third party study. 
When we see that this issue goes back to 1984, some 12 years ago, 
surely to goodness the two sides could have been brought together 
and forced by government legislation rather than imposing a ban 
and taking one side of the argument with what we believe is not 
substantive evidence against the use of MMT.
<P>
	Rather than taking one side of the argument surely the 
government could have brought legislation forward to have an 
independent study done to substantiate who is right in this 
argument. We believe quite simply that the whole issue of the 
banning of the transportation of MMT is one built on fallacy. It is 
built on scare tactics. When we look at the evidence that is 
provided by the two sides in the argument, it certainly supports 
what both opposition parties have been calling for, an independent 
study. That is why I find myself speaking in support of the hoist 
motion of the Bloc Quebecois to see this bill put off for six months. 
That is what we are debating here. It is not specifically Bill C-29 
but the amendment by the Bloc Quebecois to see the bill delayed 
for six months in yet again the hope that a study could be done in 
the intervening time to bring forward evidence on one side or the 
other.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	If the evidence, clearly supported, is what the government has 
been saying on this issue, I know all members of the House would 
support what the government has been endeavouring to do. 
Currently there is no studies or evidence before us to allow us to 
make that decision.
<P>
	I find it quite ironic that when I questioned the previous Liberal 
speaker during questions and comments she said that her 
constituent had brought forward information which she listened to 
and he said there was overwhelming evidence that MMT was 
harmful to vehicle emission systems, and therefore she was going 
to support the bill.
<P>
	I find it interesting that an MP would rise and say that one person 
had brought forward one side of an argument and therefore that is 
why she was going to vote a certain way on a piece of legislation. I 
would hope that all MPs of all parties would be much more 
comprehensive in studying an issue and looking at both sides of it 
before they cast their vote. At least that is how I approach this 
issue.
<P>
	I want to bring to the attention of the House something that is of 
importance to me as the member representing Prince 
George-Peace River. I want to take this whole argument about 
Bill C-29 and the banning of the transportation of MMT to the level 
of my riding of Prince George-Peace River which I am pleased to 
represent in this House.
<P>
	There is a refinery currently operating in the city of Prince 
George. This refinery produces some 10,000 barrels per day of 
gasoline. It is therefore the smallest fully integrated Canadian 
refinery. It is owned by Husky Oil.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> I hear all sorts of 
heckling. Is the issue here really that we are supposed to try to 
represent the interests of our constituents or not? Is that the issue?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5266"> 5266 </A></B>
<P>
	It has been said that the hon. members across the way are 
supporting the interests of a certain side of this argument. I want 
to repeat, because of the heckling coming from the other side of 
the House, that I am not supporting the continuation of the use 
of MMT, although it would be very appropriate for me to do so 
in support of the refinery that exists in Prince George.
<P>
	Quite the contrary, what I am saying is that we need further 
study. We need a comprehensive study. After 12 years I do not 
think it is too much for Canadians to expect that the government 
would conduct such a study instead of going with one side of the 
argument, as I have already stated.
<P>
	This refinery, although it is quite small, employs some 80 
people.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Eighty people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Yes, it is a very small 
number. The hon. member says: ``Oh, 80 people''. What is 80 
people? They are potentially out of work. It does not really matter 
to him, no doubt. It matters to me. It matters to those 80 people 
who are concerned about their jobs. The whole point is that it is so 
needless to bring in something like this without proper study.
<P>
	Those people would support the banning of MMT if it could be 
conclusively shown that it was either harmful to the health of 
Canadians or that it was creating some sort of substantive problems 
for the automobile manufacturers that could not be overcome in 
some other way. Other members earlier said that they did not want 
to see the Canadian government browbeaten with the threat of legal 
action by Ethyl Corporation.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	What about the threats that came from the automobile industry 
over the last year and half suggesting that if the government did not 
put this in maybe the price of cars would go up by some $3,000? If 
that is not a threat I do not know what is. It is inappropriate to listen 
to one side of the argument. None of us want to see the price of cars 
go up. I keep returning to the fact that the conclusive evidence is 
not there so how can the government arrive at a decision to simply 
ban this product on the basis of available information?
<P>
	We could go on and on debating this. I spoke for some 20 
minutes in June 1995 on this issue, as did a lot of other members. I 
find it incredible that a year and a half later we are still debating the 
same issue. The government has refused to listen to any of the 
arguments put forward by members in debate. It is simply bringing 
back the bill to appease the automobile industry. It will force it 
through and it will get its backbench members to vote along party 
lines to force this through. I find it disgusting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was pleased 
to hear the comments of my hon. colleague for Prince 
George-Peace River. However, I thought I was probably at a 
meeting of the flat earth society when I heard what he had to say.
<P>
	I realize and understand that the hon. member has the interests of 
a refinery in his riding in mind. I do not blame the refinery nor do I 
think it is fair to trade off the interests of eight people who happen 
to work at that refinery. After all, they have health concerns and 
concerns about the environment just like everyone else.
<P>
	I should point out to the hon. member that I know a little bit 
about the automotive industry. I know that there are several Toyota 
dealerships in his riding, each having 20, 30 and even 40 
employees whose livelihood and jobs are at stake simply because 
the new vehicles that are coming in, not made in Ontario, not made 
in Quebec which is, of course, the pretext by which the member of 
the Reform Party likes to side with the Bloc Quebecois. Obviously, 
Reform members find themselves in a very interesting position. It 
must be an election year and they are desperate to find any issue, 
even at the expense of someone's health.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member would like to resolve this question. 
According to the B.C. motor vehicle emission control warranty 
regulations by this time next year, for the 1998 models, it will 
probably be that the emissions, which is what we are speaking 
about here, will not meet the standards set by his own province. 
How is he going to resolve this dilemma for his own constituents 
and for the sake of the car dealers there who are creating jobs and 
who are trying to make ends meet? He knows this is an important 
issue that will have to be met, particularly from the health and 
environmental standpoint.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the intervention by the hon. member for Ontario.
<P>
	With his extensive background of working for Toyota he would 
be an unbiased source to make the points for the automobile 
industry. I appreciate his enlightening me on how many Toyota 
dealerships there are in my riding. It certainly is of importance as 
well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McTeague:</B> That is a small number too. More than eight.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> If the hon. member is 
not too busy heckling, I wonder if he would listen to another point? 
With a nuclear power plant in his riding, would he be so concerned 
about the environmental issues with nuclear power that perhaps we 
should just pass a quick piece of legislation this afternoon to shut 
down the power plant, just on the evidence we have before us 
today, which admittedly is not very substantive?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5267"> 5267 </A></B>
<P>
	I know, for example, that the industry and refineries in the 
province of British Columbia are working extensively with the 
province to move toward stricter environmental standards. The 
hon. member mentioned them. From what I can understand, in 
speaking with members of the industry not only from my riding 
but from the province of British Columbia, they have a good 
working relationship with the Government of British Columbia. 
They are working toward adhering to those new guidelines and 
regulations when they come down the pipe.
<P>
	I do not think the comment made by the hon. member is 
appropriate in the sense of again trying to throw out the scare tactic 
that somehow the industry is resisting, all the way down the line, 
making the necessary changes to make Canada, environmentally, a 
safer place in which to live.
<P>
	As the member pointed out, the people who work in the oil and 
gas industries, be it exploration, production or refining, all breathe 
the same air and drink the same water as the rest of Canadians do. 
Therefore, it is certainly paramount to them to ensure that we have 
an environmentally sustainable country and a province of British 
Columbia in which to live.
<P>
	I believe that using scare tactics and trying to paint one side of 
the argument as the bad boys in this dispute is not going to do 
anyone any good. That is why the common sense approach, the 
approach that is supported by the majority of Canadians where they 
can have all of the evidence in front them, would be to support the 
position of the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party of Canada on 
this; which we have been demanding for a year and a half to have a 
comprehensive study done of this issue and have those results 
made known to the public.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
opposite has talked about public support. First, the overwhelming 
majority of Canadians support the ban on MMT. Perhaps the 
member should be aware of that point.
<P>
	Second, the member also has been talking about an independent 
voice. I believe the member might be considering the public 
interest. I do not know how many times I have to go over this in the 
House, but I will try yet again.
<P>
	When we talk for the public interest, I would suggest that the 
Allergy Asthma Information Association spoke in the public 
interest. I would suggest that the Canadian Institute of Child Health 
spoke in the public interest. I would suggest that the Environmental 
Defence Fund, the Sierra Club of Canada and the Learning 
Disabilities Association of Canada have spoken in the public 
interest. I would suggest that all of these associations and 
organizations spoke in the public interest.
<P>
	I would like to know why this member is speaking against the 
public interest and against the Canadian people on this issue. 
<P>
<B>	Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> I would think, Mr. 
Speaker, I have been on my feet enough today that we would not 
have any problem recalling my riding at this point.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for her question and comments about 
my presentation. On the issue of Canadians and whether they 
support the banning of MMT, I would like to know who conducted 
that study, how comprehensive it was, how much information was 
made available to the Canadians who were actually polled, how 
many were polled, where they were polled and what background 
they were given. We can all play with statistics. We have done that 
all day long in this place. Anyone can conduct a poll and get the 
results they want. If they ask the right question they will get the 
answer they want. That addresses the issue of the poll to which the 
hon. member referred.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	She also mentioned the need for an independent voice. As I said 
earlier, and I am getting tired of saying it, that is what we have been 
calling for. When we consider that this issue has been around for as 
long as it has, surely to goodness some government at some time 
could have undertaken a comprehensive study of this issue so that 
we as parliamentarians would have had enough evidence in front of 
us to make a decision one way or the other without there being a big 
question mark.
<P>
	As to her statement about being on the wrong side of Canadians, 
when she read off a list of people who made presentations and who 
have made their views known, certainly those people and those 
organizations are representing a certain point of view. They are 
speaking in support of what they feel is in the best interests of the 
health of Canadians.
<P>
	What I cannot understand is despite the representations which 
were made before the committee, the fact is Health Canada did not 
support the recommendation that MMT is harmful.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
not talking about public interest right now, we are talking about 
commercial interests. On one side of the House, some members 
have automakers in their riding, while on the other side, some 
members have refineries in their riding. Since there are no 
automakers or refineries in my riding, I feel I can be relatively 
objective regarding this issue.
<P>
	What we are asking is simple: if the automobile industry has 
real, independent studies, and I am not talking about lobbying, then 
let us see these studies so we can be convinced that this is indeed 
the right thing to do. We have asked time and again for such studies 
to be tabled.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5268"> 5268 </A></B>
<P>
	We also asked Ethyl Corporation to do the same. It did so. It 
did its homework. It asked independent firms to conduct studies 
which have shown that MMT is not harmful to the environment 
or to one's health.
<P>
	We want automakers to do the same. Let them do their 
homework and let us wait six months, as we are asking, to take a 
look at these studies in an objective manner, with no bias towards 
refineries or automakers. This is what we ask.
<P>
	It seems very complicated for the government, and when I see 
Liberal members rise, I find it strange that they all represent 
Ontario, where ethanol is produced.
<P>
	I would like to hear the Reform Party member elaborate on this.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the hon. member for her comments and her question, but I honestly 
do not know how I could possibly elaborate any further on what has 
been said over the past year and a half on this issue.
<P>
	I would, however, question her statement about the objectivity of 
a member who happens to have a small oil refinery in their riding. 
The reason I say that is I have been very careful not to come down 
on the side of the oil industry or Ethyl Corp. to say that MMT is not 
harmful and that we should proceed full bore and forever use MMT 
in gasoline. I have not said that. The Reform Party has not said that. 
In its defence, the Bloc as well has not said that.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	What we have said repeatedly is that we need this independent 
study to see which side of the argument holds the most water.
<P>
	Without using any more time of the House-time is of the 
essence-we have only debated this for some year and a half, I am 
sure all of us are hoping to be finished with this.
<P>
	My only hope is that the government members will break with 
party discipline and on this issue at least will vote with common 
sense and support the motion to hoist this for six months to allow a 
study so that we can really have the evidence placed before 
parliamentarians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
today to speak in this House to Bill C-29 banning the use of MMT. 
First of all, I would like to say that I feel like I am trapped in a bad 
movie. Admittedly, back home in the Gaspé, the air is pure, we do 
not really have any problems with the environment as such, and 
given that I come from that area of the country, the fisheries are 
more up my line.
<P>
	When I listen in the House today to all the efforts of the Liberal 
Party to justify its bill C-29, I want to get up and ask them what is 
going on.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will tell me if I have misunderstood. The Bloc 
Quebecois amendment proposes a six month delay because no 
study has been done. We would like to know why manganese is 
being banned, but we would also like to know what will replace it. 
When I say it is like being trapped in a bad movie, as the member 
for Laurentides said a few minutes ago, it is more like a trade war 
we are engaged in here.
<P>
	I hear people who seem to be caving in to the automobile lobby 
and I hear people who seem to be caving in to the ethanol lobby. I 
wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the 
Environment has a popcorn solution to the ban on MMT. As you 
know, popcorn is another way of using corn. As my colleague on 
the backbench mentioned, it creates energy. When corn pops, it 
causes movement. But where are they headed with this bill? They 
have lost me.
<P>
	Have they a viable alternative in mind? I do not think so. In the 
case of ethanol production, what are the other negative impacts that 
have not been studied? I am told that if we launch blindly into large 
scale production of corn on the same acreage, the soil will be 
impoverished.
<P>
	I tell myself that maybe there is enough land in Ontario, in 
Canada, to rotate crops. Farmers always like to limit their risks. Is 
there a risk of ethanol pollution? I am told that perhaps not from 
ethanol as such, but if insecticides are used on corn crops, then 
there is a risk of pollution. I know that farmers will be tempted to 
use insecticides.
<P>
	As you can see, there is no clear solution to these questions, and I 
am only looking at something that would give the government an 
opportunity to find an alternate solution. That is why I like the 
popcorn image. They are looking for an easy solution, but they are 
not just going to pop this problem away with a poof.
<P>
	The other questions we might have about MMT concern the 
studies on the real impact on people's health.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	Yes, I too am aware of that, but no one has yet confronted us with 
any direct cause and effect relationship. You will reply: yes, but as 
soon as there is any danger perhaps it will be wise to be a little 
more careful. There are no other solutions. Will any attempts to 
save money, maybe with impact on people's health, be done away 
with completely because the next solution has not been worked out 
properly? I think that the proposal by the hon. member for 
Laurentides is a very good solution, namely to take another six 
months, at least.
<P>
	I wondered whether we were not in a league by ourselves, since 
the hon. member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, who spoke just 
now, was  telling us that MMT was banned virtually everywhere. I 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5269"> 5269 </A></B>
<P>
am told that it has just been reintroduced in some states in the 
U.S.A. That opens the door. I am trying to see whether the 
Americans have made a mistake. We are 25 or 30 million 
Canadians, while they are 250 million, 250 million Americans who 
may be wrong. I think the solution to give ourselves another six 
months is reasonable.
<P>
	While my colleague for Laurentides was speaking just now, with 
her numerous questions, for which I congratulate her-someone 
has to stir up the government, and she does an excellent job of it-I 
heard some of the Liberals saying: Yes, and if ever that study is 
done, it will never come out until after the elections. Once again, 
we understand the spin the government is trying to put on the 
debate on Bill C-29-it is pure vote-chasing. On the one hand, if 
they do want a study, it will be released only afterward, so why are 
they talking about it now? Because of the automotive lobby, the 
ethanol producers' lobby, wanting to get its share of the pie-a 
trade war pure and simple.
<P>
	I was just thinking that we have been here three years now, and 
how can it be that the government has nothing better to offer on the 
environment? A good question, and I would like to hear the Liberal 
members, the Minister of the Environment, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of the Environment give us the answer. 
What is the story on PCBs in the Magdalen Islands?
<P>
	Those islands are just across from us in the Gaspé. From what I 
hear, there was a PCB problem relating to the wreck of the barge 
<I>Irving Whale. </I>PCBs escaped on the ocean floor. Tests were done 
and, perhaps as in the popcorn solution-poof-the Minister of the 
Environment sees no more trace of PCBs on the ocean floor.
<P>
	This is something tangible. The danger relating to contact with 
PCBs has been proven. As for MMT, there is not yet any scientific 
proof.
<P>
	You will understand my surprise, will understand that I am 
wondering how much the speeches of the government side are 
based in fact, and you will understand that there is good reason to 
listen open-mouthed.
<P>
	The hon. member for Lachine has also asked whether Canada is 
really entitled to legislate on this. I think the answer is yes, we are.
<P>
	It is not because we have the right to pass legislation that we 
have the right to ruin people's lives, because we have no alternative 
solution to offer. If we really want to act intelligently in this area, I 
believe that we must stack the decks in our favour as far as 
possible. That would mean adopting the member for Laurentides' 
amendment, a six month hoist, and to do the necessary work during 
that time.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.30 p.m., the House 
will now proceed to the consideration of Private Members' 
Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PATENTACT">PATENT ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP)</B> moved that Bill 
C-311, an act to amend the Patent Act, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, first of all I would like to extend my 
appreciation to my colleague in our NDP caucus, the member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway, for seconding my bill.
<P>
	Bill C-311 is a very important bill with respect to prescription 
drugs in this country. The bill will limit the life of patents for 
medicines to 17 years and allow for compulsory licences to be 
granted for the manufacture and sale of medicines after the original 
patentee has had the medicine approved for marketing for four 
years.
<P>
	The royalty rate is to take into account the amount of medical 
research carried out in Canada by the applicant and the patentee. 
There is provision for refusal or deferral of a licence if a patentee 
has been unusually delayed in commercializing a medicine.
<P>
	What is compulsory licensing? Compulsory licensing is 
allowing generic drug companies to produce a copy of a brand 
name drug. Generic drug companies pay a royalty of 4 per cent to 
the brand name company. Compulsory licensing can only occur 
after the patent set by the federal government has run out.
<P>
	Before Bill C-91, passed in the previous Parliament, the length 
of drug patent was seven to ten years which was set by Bill C-22. 
Bill C-311, my bill, would shorten the length of a patent to four 
years. Bill C-311 does not set a royalty rate to the brand name drug 
companies but states that factors such as the amount of research 
money spent in Canada be rewarded under the royalty system. A 
name brand drug company that does original research and 
development in Canada would receive a higher royalty. This would 
increase job opportunities in the industry by encouraging drug 
companies to do their research in Canada.
<P>
	Every opinion poll that has been conducted in this country in the 
last 10 years in terms of important concerns for Canadians has 
listed health care. We have seen the cutbacks to health care. We 
have seen a great deal of problems with respect to the federal 
government's offloading to the provinces. This is a major concern 
for poor families, for middle class families and for working 
families.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5270"> 5270 </A></B>
<P>
	Rather than address the concerns of these families, the Liberal 
government in Ottawa has turned a blind eye to the anxieties of 
these people. In fact, the Liberals have taken a simplistic approach 
by cutting back billions of dollars from health care and transfer 
payments and offloading to the provinces. There are better ways 
to address rising costs to health care. Prescription drug costs, for 
example, are the fastest growing component of costs to health care 
in Canada. Bill C-311 offers a better way to curtail some of the 
rising costs.
<P>
	Since the introduction of Bill C-22 in 1988, the average 
prescription bill has gone from $12.48 in 1987 to about $24 in 
1993. This average prescription drug bill represents a 93 per cent 
increase as a result of providing these manufacturers with a 20 year 
monopoly to charge whatever they want for these prescription 
drugs without competition.
<P>
	If we look at the increase of the licensed drugs alone during that 
period the average prescription has gone from $16.92 in 1987 to 
$43.42 in 1993. This represents on the licensed drug alone an 
increase of 258 per cent. Prior to Bill C-22 and Bill C-91 of the last 
Parliaments, drug costs amounted to 8.9 per cent of total health 
spending in Canada. In 1993 it had risen to 15.1 per cent of total 
health spending. That is a 70 per cent increase with respect to 
health care costs in the drug component alone. Rather than address 
this particular problem the government cuts back health care 
further. My Bill C-311 deals with this issue of rising costs in the 
health care programs in this country.
<P>
	In total, Bill C-91 will cost the Canadian health care system 
between $4 billion and $7 billion according to research by 
respected U.S. health economist Stephen Schondelmeyer. The 
financial impact of Bill C-91, which my bill in effect repeals, will 
accelerate dramatically during the years 2000 to 2010.
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	The passage of Bill C-91 was supposed to increase employment 
as well in the brand name pharmaceutical industry. Since the 
passage of these bills we have seen not an increase in R and D jobs 
but in fact a decline. We have seen a 1,200 job cut in the R and D 
sector of the pharmaceutical industry in Ontario alone, and about 
800 jobs in Quebec have been cut as a result of these bills.
<P>
	This was on the promise by the pharmaceutical companies when 
they came to this Parliament and asked for protection for up to 20 
years. They promised jobs; we have fewer jobs. They promised 
stable cost in terms of pharmaceuticals; we have seen those costs 
sky-rocket.
<P>
	We have also seen some very important developments with 
respect to what the generic drug companies have done for our 
health care plans and for our country. Here are examples of some of 
the drug costs that are generic brands which are cheaper brand 
drugs, which my bill would encourage in terms of production in 
Canada. An  ulcer drug, brand name Zantac, costs about $1.10 and 
the generic price is about 42.5 cents, which is a 61.1 per cent saving 
on a generic drug. An asthma drug, Ventolin, is $12.27 for 15 
millilitres versus $4.95 for the generic price. That is a saving of 
nearly 60 per cent. On blood pressure drugs as well, brand names 
are roughly 41 per cent to 45 per cent more expensive than generic 
prices. Anybody who has children will know that with the 
antibiotic Amoxil there is about a 44 per cent to a 45 per cent 
saving when purchasing a generic drug.
<P>
	Bill C-91 and some of these bills prevent those sorts of generic 
companies manufacturing generic drugs under a licence and a 
royalty fee for up to 20 years. That is why my bill is very 
important. It basically rolls back that period from 20 years to 17 
years, but after four years generic companies can license and 
manufacture drugs in competition.
<P>
	We have had support from a number of organizations, provinces 
and individuals across this country. The minister of social services 
in Saskatchewan, Mr. Lorne Calvert, who was the associated 
minister of health when this bill was being reviewed in the House 
of Commons, represented Saskatchewan at the Senate hearings on 
Bill C-91. He brought all of his research on the prescription drug 
program in Saskatchewan and warned at that time that the bill 
would drive up Saskatchewan drug costs $6 million to $10 million 
a year.
<P>
	We have had about a three year passage of time since this 
warning was made by the provincial Government of Saskatchewan 
and this has proven to be more than accurate because we have seen 
not a $7 million to $10 million increase but something much more 
substantial.
<P>
	Mr. Calvert gave the example of generic drugs and the savings 
they provide: ``Generic drugs save the provincial government drug 
plan millions of dollars yearly. Enalapril, a commonly used 
prescribed heart drug, would have been available as a generic in 
1994 prior to the introduction of Bill C-91. The bill delayed the 
proposed entry of Enalapril until the year 2007''. As a result of a 
drug dispute this drug was available for a short time as a generic 
and in one year saved the province alone $2 million. That is on one 
drug. Yet we see members in this House are concerned about 
protecting their own position with respect to drug companies and 
patents.
<P>
	We have had thousands of letters and calls. In this House as the 
New Democratic Party we have done a number of things. I have 
tabled thousands of petitions calling for the repeal of Bill C-91 in 
support of my Bill C-311. I have had hundreds of people write 
letters to me. We have had motions raised and debated in this 
House. We have had questions raised with the government with 
respect to Bill C-91. They seem to fall on deaf ears.
<P>
	I have some letters I want to share with my colleagues in the 
House of Commons today. One says: ``You have my heartiest 
agreement on your attempt to rescind the  legislation on Bill C-91. 
It is my profound belief that this perpetrates a distinct hardship on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5271"> 5271 </A></B>
<P>
those who pioneered our country, suffered through world wars and 
a traumatic depression and now in their latter years are held ransom 
by the greedy drug corporations. I can personally attest to the 
horrendous gouging because my mother in her last two years of life 
was paying monthly bills in the hundreds of dollars for prescription 
drugs''.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	This is an example of many that I have received. I have another 
one here which I think is really important for members to pay 
attention and listen to: ``My wife and I are senior citizens on fixed 
income and it costs me approximately $100 per month for 
prescribed medication. The only thing we have to cut back on to 
pay for our drugs and our prescription drugs is food and clothing''.
<P>
	Bill C-91 and Bill C-22 have resulted in sky-rocketing 
prescription drug costs and many people in the country have to 
make a choice between a life sustaining prescription drug or a life 
enhancing prescription drug and purchasing food. What kind of a 
government is this that would not pay attention to these problems 
in our communities, particularly to those pioneers, those seniors 
who have built our country? I think we have to get to the bottom of 
this.
<P>
	Perhaps we have some information which will provide the House 
with a bit of insight in terms of why the government is not taking 
any action. In contrast to the letter from Mr. Nord who wrote 
saying that he is making a choice between prescription drugs which 
are necessary and food which is absolutely necessary, the Minister 
of Health of the Liberal government says that it is more important 
to protect patents and the big multinational pharmaceutical 
corporations.
<P>
	I quote from an article on ``the surprise the minister gave to the 
brand name drug manufacturers who are pushing for maintaining a 
20 year control over the sale of pharmaceutical drugs that they have 
developed''. The minister said this at a pharmaceutical convention: 
``I have not come here tonight to talk about Bill C-91 because no 
one wants to hear about that. This government believes that 
intellectual property rights are important and they ought to be 
protected and enhanced at every opportunity in this country''.
<P>
	The article goes on: ``One industry spokesman said the 
minister's comments were a `victory' for the pharmaceutical 
research companies''.
<P>
	This is a problem with this government. It does not seem to have 
its priorities straight. It would rather embrace and protect the 
multinational oil companies, protect and embrace the multinational 
pharmaceuticals than look after people like Mr. Nord who has to 
make very crucial decisions on a daily basis about whether he  can 
continue to live because of his medical condition. What kind of 
empathy is that?
<P>
	I hear the Liberals all the time in the House and it makes me 
want to puke. We close our eyes and listen to all the wonderful 
things they say. Then when we open our eyes and see what they 
have done, they have always done the opposite. They get up and 
talk about the great things they are doing for social programs. 
When we look again they are slashing health care and encouraging 
pharmaceuticals to gouge Canadians for prescription drugs. It 
makes people absolutely sick. The Minister of Health is a nauseous 
part of this entire Parliament as far as I am concerned.
<P>
	Members are probably saying the member for 
Regina-Lumsden is on a bit of a crusade here and does not have 
much support. I have support from the Consumers' Association of 
Canada, seniors organizations, the National Health Coalition, a 
number of organizations from across the country. The CLC is 
another sponsor and supporter along with many organizations and 
individuals from the province of Saskatchewan and other parts of 
the country.
<P>
	I want to share with members today an experience I had meeting 
with an Argentinian parliamentarian, Ernesto Algaba, a national 
congressman who came to see me because he heard about the work 
I had been doing in the past three years with respect to Bill C-91 
and the pharmaceutical patent protection.
<P>
	He told me: ``In Argentina we are very concerned. We are being 
pressured by the American Pharmaceutical Association to institute 
a drug patent law like that in Canada, the United States and 
Mexico. The American Pharmaceutical Association came to us, 
promised us jobs, promised us low cost, stable price prescription 
drugs. We are kind of worried about this because we said no 
initially. Then the U.S. ambassador came to our Parliament and met 
with some of the parliamentarians and threatened us on behalf of 
the American Pharmaceutical Association saying either we pass 
this legislation or they are going to pull out some of their economic 
supports and maybe they will pull their embassy out of our 
country''. He wanted to check and see what was going on.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	Mr. Algaba said that they went to Chile. He told me: ``Do you 
know what they found in Chile?'' The Chilean government was 
given the same garbage that the government was given about Bill 
C-91. ``Pass the legislation, Mr. and Mrs. Chilean 
Parliamentarians. You will have jobs galore in R and D and you 
will have stable prescription drug prices''.
<P>
	Do you know what happened? The Chileans passed legislation. 
Their jobs are gone and their drugs are almost more expensive than 
they are in Canada. That is what we hear from Argentina and other 
countries. The  government has to pay attention to some of the very 
serious charges by other parliamentarians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5272"> 5272 </A></B>
<P>
	There is also some confusion about profits with respect to the 
pharmaceuticals. I have some information here.
<P>
	From 1987, when Bill C-22 was passed, to 1992-it looks pretty 
darn good for the pharmaceuticals-the revenue of Miles Canada 
Inc. grew 52 per cent. The revenues of Merck Frosst MSD AGVET 
grew by 111 per cent. The revenues of Burroughs Wellcome Inc. 
grew 172 per cent. The revenues of Merck Frosst Canada Inc. 
increased 185 per cent and Abbott Laboratories had a 1,120 per 
cent increase in revenues as a result of these drug patents and the 
jacking up prices and gouging consumers.
<P>
	I want to save my last few comments to talk about what the 
Liberal Party did in opposition. The NDP was the only party that 
spoke and voted unanimously in opposition to Bill C-91 when it 
was passed. The Liberals joined with the New Democrats in 1992 
and voted against Bill C-91. They said: ``If we are elected, Bill 
C-91 will be repealed''.
<P>
	We even have some reference in a famous red book of broken 
promises-this is just one more-which is found on page 81. It 
speaks of a national forum on health which the Liberal Party would 
undertake to institute. It says: ``The forum must be part of a 
thorough study of the health of Canadians and of our health care 
system. It will be mandated to consider questions such as the goals, 
results and evaluation of our system as well as the costs of care, 
including prescription drugs''. That is what the red book says. That 
is what will be done on the national forum on health.
<P>
	I have here a speech from the Prime Minister. They are opening 
remarks by the Prime Minister to the national forum on health, his 
Liberal baby in the red book. There is not one reference, inference, 
suggestion or idea about the words drugs, prescription drugs, 
pharmaceuticals or anything of that nature. There is not one 
reference in the speech with respect to some of the action they were 
going to take.
<P>
	I wonder why. I think he who pays the piper calls the tune. It 
seems to me when a former Liberal cabinet minister, Judy Erola, is 
the chief lobbyist for the international pharmaceutical corporations 
lobbying the government, it is going to be pretty easy to get their 
attention.
<P>
	What about some of the contributions? Bristol-Myers Squibb 
gave the Liberals $4,800. Eli Lilly Canada Inc. gave the Liberals 
$5,200. Burroughs Wellcome Inc., to which I made reference in 
terms of its huge increases in revenues, gave $8,700 to the Liberal 
Party and Merck Frosst, to which I also made reference, gave a 
paltry $11,000.
<P>
	These guys are getting billions of dollars in revenue. I think the 
Liberals are missing an opportunity. They  should be gouging them 
a little more. Get a few more bucks from your buddies in the 
pharmaceuticals. That is the only thing that is going to happen.
<P>
	The last straw is when the Liberal members of Parliament sent 
out letters to their friends in the pharmaceuticals. I note that a 
member from Winnipeg sent a letter out trying to collect some 
money from pharmaceutical companies. Of course, the 
pharmaceuticals are more than happy to comply, although it looks 
almost like a bribe. Who knows? We have seen these sorts of 
articles appear in newspapers, particularly in the <I>Hill Times.</I>
<P>
	I am going to wrap up my comments but I want to underline the 
importance of this bill as I have stated in my remarks today. I want 
to ask members here who believe that this is an important bill-we 
should address the concerns of Canadians with respect to 
prescription drugs and their skyrocketing costs-that this bill be 
designated a votable item.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
terms of the request of the hon. member for Regina-Lumsden to 
make his motion votable. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There is not unanimous 
consent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the motion is not votable, could I 
have the unanimous consent of the House to refer the bill to 
committee?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
terms of the request of the hon. member. Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There is not unanimous 
consent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting to listen to the political 
posturing of the hon. member for Regina-Lumsden. He knows 
very well that Bill C-91 is up for review in 1997. Unfortunately, he 
is trying to show how conscientiousness and how concerned he is 
about this matter.
<P>
	I speak against the bill presented by the hon. member for 
Regina-Lumsden. I would like to explain why the bill is not 
appropriate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5273"> 5273 </A></B>
<P>
	First, it ignores the important role that intellectual property 
protection plays in the Canadian economy by reducing the patent 
term for pharmaceuticals and by reintroducing compulsory 
licensing.
<P>
	The bill would shorten the patent term for drug patents to 17 
years from the date the patent application is filed. It reintroduces 
the compulsory licensing regime that was eliminated when the 
Patent Act was amended by Bill C-91 in 1993.
<P>
	The House will recall that before the Patent Act was amended, 
patented medicines did not enjoy full patent protection. Instead 
they were eligible for a period of marketing exclusivity for seven to 
ten years. This bill would not even allow innovative drug 
companies that protection. The holder of the patent under this bill 
would have only four years before the generic companies could 
copy the formula under a compulsory licence. The bill would allow 
the patentee to receive a royalty and the compulsory licence could 
be refused or delayed if a patentee has been unusually delayed in 
commercializing the medicine.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member for Regina-Lumsden believes that 
these provisions would be sufficient to encourage companies to 
continue research in Canada. Perhaps he thinks that Canada would 
continue to attract R and D investment under these terms. Perhaps 
he thinks that these measures would be suitable in today's 
knowledge based economy. I assure the hon. member that these 
measures would not be sufficient. Why would a company invest in 
a country where it is not assured adequate property protection, 
including patent protection?
<P>
	The hon. member should know very well that he comes from a 
province where the government quite often will attract businesses 
and will change the agreements for those businesses halfway 
through the agreement period. That is why that province is not 
attracting this type of R and D. In particular, the province of 
Saskatchewan does not attract this R and D because the 
government changes rules on companies that come into that 
province.
<P>
	Since patent protection was first enhanced in 1987 through Bill 
C-22 the ratio of R and D to sales by pharmaceutical patentees has 
continuously increased. Last year the innovative companies spent 
$624 million on R and D. That represents 11.8 per cent of their 
sales revenue, nearly doubling the ratio of 6.1 per cent achieved in 
1988.
<P>
	The brand name pharmaceutical companies are among Canada's 
leading investors in research and development. Last July, when the 
publication <I>Research Money</I> listed Canada's top corporate R and D 
performers, 17 integrated brand name companies were among the 
top 100. This investment in research and development means 
highly qualified jobs for Canadians. It means jobs in the brand 
name companies, jobs in the universities and hospitals that support 
their research, and jobs in the many small and medium sized 
businesses that have flourished in the past few years as Canadians 
respond to the challenge of designing new products for the health 
care industry.
<P>
	The growth of small and medium sized biotechnology 
companies has been particularly impressive. In fact, when we look 
at the <I>Research Money</I> list of the top 100 R and D performers, 
seven of the companies are Canadian research based 
biopharmaceutical firms. The growth and success of these young 
companies has been built on a solid foundation of world class 
intellectual property protection in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	During this period of increased R and D, the prices of patented 
drugs have been kept under control. According to the Patent 
Medicine Prices Review Board, an independent body which 
regulates the price of patented medicines, the prices of patented 
medicines actually fell by 1.75 per cent in 1995. They dropped at a 
time when the consumer price index rose by 2.14 per cent. This is 
the second year in a row they have dropped.
<P>
	Furthermore, an international comparison of the top 200 selling 
patented drug products produced by the Patent Medicine Prices 
Review Board showed that for the first time Canadian prices on 
average were below the median international prices in 1994.
<P>
	If this bill was passed, Canada would become one of the only 
countries in the industrialized world where pharmaceutical 
intellectual property would not be effectively protected. Canada 
would become the only developed country in the world with 
compulsory licensing regimes for drugs. In addition to the 
detrimental effect on jobs and growth, we could expect a strong 
reaction from our trading partners.
<P>
	This brings me to my second reason for opposing Bill C-311. 
The measures proposed in the hon. member's bill contravene 
Canada's international obligations under the World Trade 
Organization and the North American free trade agreement. The 
patent term of 17 years from date of filing for drug patents would 
violate Canada's international obligations under the WTO. These 
drugs require a minimum patent term of 20 years from the date of 
filing a patent application.
<P>
	There is another aspect of this bill that runs counter to our 
international trade obligations. Both the WTO and NAFTA require 
that patent rights be enjoyable without discrimination as to the field 
of technology. A compulsory licensing regime for pharmaceuticals 
would constitute discriminatory treatment toward pharmaceutical 
patentees. We could expect action under both the WTO and 
NAFTA as a result.
<P>
	The government has signed these international treaties because 
we believe they will promote economic growth. Canada must 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5274"> 5274 </A></B>
<P>
compete with other countries not only for  global market shares but 
also for investment and technology.
<P>
	International trade agreements that provide for strong 
intellectual property protection create the necessary climate for 
investment and technology transfer. Canada, as a trading nation, is 
not prepared to ignore its international obligations. The challenge 
with Canada's drug patent policy is to ensure that it conforms with 
our international trade obligations and supports the development of 
our pharmaceutical industry while making patented drugs available 
at prices that are not excessive.
<P>
	With respect to some of the comments that were made by the 
hon. member, it is very interesting that he referred to the growing 
revenues of these companies. He never referred to what their 
profits are. Revenues are not necessarily profits. It is also 
interesting that he wants millions of dollars to be spent by 
companies on R and D. Then he wants the fruits of this R and D, 
which is in the hundreds of millions of dollars, to go to other 
companies that have put no money into R and D.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> There's a 4 per cent royalty.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bodnar:</B> That is what he wants, and that is what he has 
proposed to this House.
<P>
	Now is the time to look for a balance in this legislation with a 
review of Bill C-91. It should not be dealt with in the theatrics that 
have been proposed by the hon. member in this House with this 
bill. He is trying to show how conscientious he is when he knows 
that a full review is coming before the industry committee on Bill 
C-91. I wish he would attend some of those meetings.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to have this opportunity to speak to the bill introduced by 
the hon. member for the NDP, a bill that basically, and very briefly, 
will reduce the protection granted the drug manufacturing sector. 
There are patents that protect the industry for a period of 20 years 
but in fact have an effective duration of about ten years.
<P>
	We should realize that it takes about ten years from the time a 
molecule is discovered that will be used to manufacture a drug to 
the actual marketing of the drug, so that unlike other products, 
where the actual marketing takes place very quickly after the 
development of a product, the actual protection of the patent 
extends well beyond the 20 years allowed by law, because the 
initial date applies from the time the new molecule was patented.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	Of course when we are talking about the pharmaceutical 
industry, we are talking about one of the major sectors of the 
economy, especially in Quebec and Ontario, and in other provinces 
as well. But when we are talking about the innovators, the 
companies that do  research and discover drugs in Canada, they are 
mainly concentrated in Quebec and Ontario.
<P>
	In fact, more than half are located in Quebec, in the Montreal 
area, and quite a few in the Toronto area as well. This is the reason 
why both the Montreal Chamber of Commerce and the Toronto 
Board of Trade are recommending not only that we maintain a 
legislative framework to support and protect pioneering industries, 
but that we upgrade it.
<P>
	As we know, this debate has taken place twice since 1987. The 
first time, in 1987, the law was changed to extend patent 
protection. If I recall, it was extended to seven years. The member 
is suggesting that we revert to a system of compulsory licences. In 
1993, the Conservative government returned to the attack, 
increasing patent protection for drugs to 20 years.
<P>
	Of course, there were very active lobbyists on both sides. These 
people are always part of the picture. Behind the humanitarian 
reasons often quoted to give less protection and allow for drugs to 
be copied earlier, on the grounds that they would be cheaper, there 
are the industries which make a lot of money copying these drugs.
<P>
	It should be emphasized that since this bill came into effect, we 
have seen an increase in research activity in the pharmaceutical 
industry, and an increase in job creation both in the area of patented 
drugs and pioneering industries and in the area of generic drugs, or 
copied drugs. Both sides have been expanding.
<P>
	This bill was aimed at striking a balance. It is true that there is 
always a risk when granting a patent. One should be very careful 
and monitor the situation closely. There is a risk of creating a 
monopoly, pushing prices upwards. The government created the 
Patented Medicine Prices Review Board to keep track of the 
situation. There are standards, guidelines that ensure that, when the 
drugs developed reach the market, their price will not be 
unreasonably higher than the costs involved.
<P>
	So the review board tables reports. What do these reports say? I 
heard the member sponsoring this bill talk about sky-rocketing 
costs and give us some examples. In fact, since 1987, the cost of 
patented drugs has increased only by 2.1 per cent a year. According 
to the report of the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, the 
increase has been lower than inflation. It is always appropriate to 
monitor the situation, but in fact the legislation and the regulations 
have been well enforced and are very efficient.
<P>
	Sky-rocketing costs might be due to other factors. If health costs 
are increasing in Canada, it is also because the population is aging. 
There are other similar phenomena that have to be considered. I 
would like to remind you that, in 1993, when health costs were 
being examined throughout Canada, 3 per cent of expenses in the 
health system were related to patented drugs, that is,  drugs coming 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5275"> 5275 </A></B>
<P>
from the innovative industry. We must be careful, therefore, not to 
fall into the trap and stick to the facts.
<P>
	I would like to remind the hon. member that the current act 
comes up for review in 1997. We are talking about spring 1997. Of 
course, people are wondering if election deadlines will change the 
situation. We will see. However, the current act must be reviewed 
in 1997.
<P>
	At that time, each of the industries and groups concerned will 
have an opportunity to be heard and explain why they want 
changes, why they want more or less patent protection and how. 
They will have an opportunity to present their cases.
<P>
	It would be premature for Parliament to draw conclusions from a 
very partial analysis of the situation-which, according to the 
arguments I heard, is not always connected to the actual 
figures-and pass this bill reducing patent protection to 17 years, 
as the hon. member proposes.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	We know that in reality this would be reduced by three years. It 
is a lot. It is important to note that putting a drug on the market is 
very expensive and time-consuming. Many research initiatives 
never pan out. In all areas involving research and development, 
many research efforts never lead to real-life applications. 
Considerable amounts of money are invested in R and D.
<P>
	If we limit the protection they enjoy and their ability to market 
their products and recoup their investments, how will this translate 
into reality? There will be a drop in research activities. The focus 
will shift to generic products, duplicating and selling various drugs.
<P>
	This brings us to the social aspect. All of us in this House expect 
help if we take ill. We expect to have access to drugs or care, 
palliative or otherwise. Now, for these drugs to be available, 
someone has to do research in their applications. Unless our legal, 
fiscal and economic framework does not create incentives, these 
drugs will just not be produced and we will find ourselves with 
another problem on our hands: not having access to the drugs we 
want.
<P>
	Caution must be exercised in saying that drug patent protection 
should be reduced on compassionate grounds. This has a serious 
and major perverse effect. Therein lies the social dimension.
<P>
	Should the act be amended, the economic factor would also 
affect the balance that currently exists whereby, in Quebec and in 
Ontario in particular, a lot of people are involved in research and 
development.
<P>
	Let me give you a few figures. In Quebec, there are over 6,000 
jobs in the research sector for this industry. This is a large number. 
These jobs are in areas where knowledge and technology are 
important, and where major infrastructures and investments are 
required, in  excess of $600 million for the companies located in 
Quebec.
<P>
	So, we are talking about 6,000 jobs and, in 1994, the most recent 
data I have indicate that research activities totalled more than $240 
million. This is quite a sum of money. The government itself could 
not do as much in the present context. Who is going to do the 
research if, through this bill, we reduce the incentives these 
companies have? Many of them are concentrated in the Montreal 
area. Some of them are also located in the Laval area, in Metro 
Toronto and just outside Toronto.
<P>
	We find many generic drug companies in Ontario and Manitoba, 
and a few in Quebec. There has been a slight shift since 1993.
<P>
	We now have a situation that makes development, research and 
job creation possible. The hon. member talked about jobs. Jobs 
have been created in both generic and new drug companies. It has 
been possible to achieve a good balance under the present 
legislation. Should we be doing more? We will have to take a look 
at that. Do we need to monitor more closely price control? We will 
also have to consider this issue.
<P>
	Right now, the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board argues 
that the situation is under control and that everything is going 
relatively well. Under these circumstances, it would be ill-advised 
to jeopardize an industrial structure that is so important to our 
future. We need think only about the existing relationship between 
the scientific community, the universities, and the companies that 
have developed in the last few years a very important rapport, 
which will give our country an edge in this area.
<P>
	Lastly, I want to remind the House of our international 
obligations. Canada has some obligations under NAFTA, the World 
Trade Organization, what was formerly known as the GATT. If we 
pass this bill, we will be violating these international agreements, 
which require us to provide the same protection we were giving in 
1993. We have to be very careful before adopting such a bill and 
make sure that what we are doing will be good for employment and 
medical research and will promote economic growth in Quebec as 
well as in Ontario and in the rest of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	In this regard, this is not a votable bill, but had it been a votable 
bill, we would have had to vote against it. I invite the member to 
come and express his views next spring when a broader and more 
public debate takes place. We will get the facts straight and review 
the situation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is a very interesting bill that has been presented to us, Bill 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5276"> 5276 </A></B>
<P>
C-311. I want to commend the purpose and the intent that prompted 
this private member's bill.
<P>
	There is no question at all that we all would like to reduce the 
cost of medicare in Canada and in the provinces and in the 
individual lives of people. We would like to do that but we have to 
recognize within this context that we are entering into an extremely 
controversial area. In fact, the practice of medicine itself is rather 
controversial.
<P>
	The whole concept seems to be evolving around the fact that 
there is a single variable that will change the cost of medicare and 
that is the matter of the cost of pharmaceutical drugs. Admittedly it 
is one factor and it is a variable. To suggest that it is one of the 
major points has as much to do with the cost of the drug itself as it 
does with the practice of medicine in the first instance. There was a 
time when the prescribing of drugs was not as rampant as it is 
today.
<P>
	With all due respect to the intent and purpose of the bill, I think I 
will have to take exception to this bill on several grounds. The first 
of these has to do with our position in the overall world. We do not 
live any longer as an island called Canada on the globe. We must 
compete on an international, global basis.
<P>
	We need to recognize that there are a number of countries that 
have accepted the 20 year patent protection. There is a list of not 
less than 50 countries that have accepted this as a way of doing 
business. If we are going to compete in that world we need to 
recognize that it is the field on which we are playing.
<P>
	Let me give a sample of some of these countries: Germany, 
Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, 
Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. 
There are a number of these countries which have used 20 year 
patent protection. I could name more countries.
<P>
	We need to recognize that there is a major competitive issue at 
stake here. I want to suggest that this bill take recognition of the 
fact that essentially the production of pharmaceutical drugs in the 
first instance is basically a knowledge based industry. Knowledge 
does not find itself limited by political boundaries. Knowledge can 
leave as easily as it comes.
<P>
	The one thing we want, which leads me to the second point as to 
why we want to protect this particular patent, the intellectual 
property, is the business of attracting the skill, the ability, the 
knowledge and the know how of doing the research necessary in 
order for us to be competitive in the international field.
<P>
	I would like to refer to what happened in 1987. With the 1987 
amendments to the Patent Act the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' 
Association of Canada made a public commitment that its 
members would increase their annual R and D expenditures as a  
percentage of sales to 8 per cent by 1991 and 10 per cent by 1996.
<P>
	I just received the annual report of what actually has been the 
experience. As a result, the ratio of R and D expenditures to sales 
revenues for the patented pharmaceutical industry was 11.8 per 
cent in 1995, up from 11.3 per cent in 1994. They have lived up to 
their particular suggestion.
<P>
	I would like to give the House some numbers that I think 
illustrate this rather well. In 1988 the amount of money spent on R 
and D expenditures by the pharmaceutical companies was $165.7 
million. Then it rises all the way to 1995 when that number went to 
$623.9 million. Somebody will immediately suggest that it 
includes certain government grants. Indeed it does. In fact in 1995 
the government grants to the pharmaceutical industry doing 
research were $7.6 million out of $623.9 million, a small amount.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	We then also have to ask in what areas these companies have 
done their research. Have they done their research in basic 
research, which is the curiosity driven research, how we find a new 
idea, a new way of treating various ailments and applied research. 
The distribution goes this way: 22.2 per cent of the R and D 
expenditures were for basic research which is the basis on which 
new discoveries are built. If we do not have that, we do not have 
advances in knowledge and we do not move back the walls of 
ignorance. There was 61.9 per cent given to applied research.
<P>
	What else would one expect? Here we have manufacturing 
agencies that recognize the need for new knowledge to be 
developed and at the same time how that knowledge can be 
commercialized. Logically they would put more money into that 
area. In total, that was $623.9 million in 1995 alone. Look how 
many jobs that created.
<P>
	When the hon. member presented his bill he said that jobs were 
lost, some 1,200 in Ontario and some 800 in Quebec; $623.9 
million was spent, whether it was the research people who lost their 
jobs or whomever, I do not know, but $623.9 million created other 
jobs. I wish the member had indicated that perhaps not only were 
some jobs lost but there were a lot of other jobs created.
<P>
	The net position on $623.9 million has to have created some 
jobs. Therefore, I will not accept that we had a net loss in this 
particular area. When we put $623.9 million into the economy, 
nobody can tell me there is a reduction in the number of jobs in 
Canada.
<P>
	I would like to move now to a couple of provisions in the bill 
itself. Bill C-311 is suggesting that we replace the Patented 
Medicine Prices Review Board with a patented medicine review 
board, taking out the word prices. The member is probably 
suggesting that the marketplace will maintain that the prices be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5277"> 5277 </A></B>
<P>
kept in some sort of a  competitive position. Essentially if the 
playing field were level, I would agree.
<P>
	However, knowledge and the advancement of knowledge 
sometimes require special protection which is exactly what the 
patent law does. It provides protection until that knowledge has 
grown to the point where it can play its competitive role in the 
world and where the marketplace has indeed determined the prices.
<P>
	The important thing to remember here is that the Patented 
Medicine Prices Review Board has in fact been able to control the 
prices during the time when the pharmaceutical companies did 
have a monopoly in the distribution of those drugs. There is 
evidence and there is an annual report. If it has not been the case, 
then the time has come to review what that board is doing. If it is 
not doing its job, then the House of Commons needs to take issue 
with that board. It does not become a matter of standing up and 
saying that this ought not to be the case. Therefore, we have to be 
careful as to just exactly what it is that this bill does.
<P>
	In conclusion, I need to remind all members that the provisions 
of Bill C-91 are coming up for a major review. At that time we need 
to look not only at this particular aspect but at the whole business 
of medicine and how pharmaceuticals fit into the medical patterns 
as such in Canada. We have a big job before us. It is a challenging 
and wonderful job. I wish that we and medicine would do the right 
thing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to participate in this debate on 
behalf of the Minister of Health.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to correct a couple of misperceptions and 
misinterpretations that have been brought forward by my hon. 
colleague who presented the legislation for our consideration 
today. If we want to be fair and sincere about the issue at hand, and 
I believe all members in the House do, then we cannot begin by 
misrepresenting what the minister has said outside this Chamber.
<P>
	The Minister of Health has said repeatedly that he is committed 
to a parliamentary review as is mandated by Bill C-91 and 
identified by my colleague a moment ago. It is unfair to suggest 
otherwise. Not only is he committed to that, he is not engaging in 
the kind of rhetoric that my colleagues opposite enjoy by trying to 
predict what the parliamentary review will produce or by trying to 
influence it. It is important to understand that the minister is going 
to abide by the regulations and by the legislation as presented by 
Parliament. We would all do well to honour the same thing.
<P>
	My colleague from Regina-Lumsden presented the legislation 
for two basic reasons. I would like to focus attention on the issue of 
addressing drug costs. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Industry has already addressed the licensing component. I would 
like to focus for a few moments on drug costs and health 
expenditures.
<P>
	Make no mistake. The government is concerned about both the 
level and rate of increase in expenditures for pharmaceuticals in 
this country. Expenditures for drugs make up 12.7 per cent of 
Canada's total health expenditure. It is the third largest component 
of health expenditures behind only hospitals and physicians.
<P>
	Not only are drugs the third largest component in Canada's 
health expenditures but these are increasing faster than any other 
component in health spending. In 1994 drug expenditures grew by 
3.8 per cent. Even factoring in the population growth, the rate of 
growth is 2.1 per cent. Other speakers have already pointed out that 
in the late 1980s and early 1990s the situation was worse than it is 
currently, with increases in drug spending of well over 10 per cent 
per annum, year after year.
<P>
	If we are really serious about addressing drug costs, then we 
must look much deeper than these facts and figures. We must 
consider the extent to which patented drugs contribute to the 
overall drug costs.
<P>
	The federal government currently regulates patented drug prices 
through the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is the biggest joke.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> There may be people who share a different opinion, 
but in our view the regulations under the PMPRB are strict. The 
prices of existing patented drugs cannot increase by more than the 
consumer price index. Introductory prices for new drugs are 
limited to the range of prices for other drugs which treat the same 
disease, unless the new drug represents a breakthrough or a 
substantial improvement. In that case, its price cannot exceed the 
median of prices charged for those drugs in other industrialized 
countries.
<P>
	The evidence, notwithstanding the objections opposite, indicates 
that the PMPRB is doing its job in controlling patented drug prices. 
I ask members to consider some of the facts.
<P>
	The member for Regina-Lumsden will note that in 1995 
patented drug prices actually decreased by 1.75 per cent. That was 
the second year in a row that prices actually declined. By 
comparison, in that year the consumer price index actually rose by 
2.14 per cent. My colleague may not be impressed with that but the 
fact is that there was a decrease.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	Price increases for patented drugs have consistently been below 
the consumer price index ever since the PMPRB was created in 
1987. Before that the member will know that drug prices were 
increasing at rates well above the consumer price index. As I said 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5278"> 5278 </A></B>
<P>
earlier, I want to address the element of this bill that takes issue 
with health expenditures and drug costs.
<P>
	In 1994 for the first time, patented drug prices in Canada were on 
average below the median international price. In 1994 the prices of 
new breakthrough drugs in Canada were on average 11 per cent 
lower than the median international price.
<P>
	The reason I highlight these facts is to show first, that even in the 
absence of compulsory licensing, patented drug prices have 
remained under control and second, to show that influencing 
patented drug prices will not necessarily lead to reduced 
expenditures on drugs. The reason for this is not that difficult to 
see.
<P>
	Overall drug prices and overall drug expenditures are influenced 
by additional factors such as the price of non-patented drugs, 
pharmacy dispensing fees, and the rate of utilization. All of these 
are factors which provincial governments are finding much to their 
dismay are contributing to a very large extent to the overall health 
costs. No matter how low prices are, the more drugs people take, 
the more drug expenditures will increase.
<P>
	Federal, provincial and territorial ministers of health have 
recognized that action on drug costs can and must occur on many 
fronts. In April 1996 they directed deputy ministers of health to 
review and to report back on six pharmaceutical issues: price; 
utilization; marketing; consumer education; research and 
development; and waste.
<P>
	Current estimates of wastage would astonish even the members 
opposite. They are well over 10 per cent of the overall costs. I am 
confident the work by the deputy ministers will lead to 
collaborative initiatives that will have a real impact on drug costs, 
the effective use of medicines and the health of Canadians. 
Working together with provinces and territories to discover and 
address the root causes of increasing drug costs is the way to 
achieve results.
<P>
	We need to encourage pharmaceutical investment and research 
and development in Canada. It is in these kinds of jobs and these 
kinds of job creation opportunities that we can bring Canada's 
economy into the 21st century and make substantial contributions 
to the health and well-being of Canadians.
<P>
	The factors that have helped Canada to attract this investment in 
R and D, and I refer to our excellent university structure, a 
competitive tax regime, and a supply of eminent scientists, would 
not be able to overcome the negative impacts of this bill. I refer 
back to Bill C-91 because what the member's bill does is it 
pre-empts what is required by Bill C-91 and that is a parliamentary 
review four years after royal assent, i.e., in 1997.
<P>
	As I said in my opening remarks, it is one thing to propose an 
item of legislation and it is another one to pre-empt a process that is 
already in place and to try to  predict and influence its outcome 
when it is going to be open for all members of this House.
<P>
<B>(1830 )</B>
<P>
	Only when that review is completed and only when we have 
struck the appropriate balance between industrial objectives and 
health issues in Canada can we look at the patent policy to examine 
how it should be adjusted.
<P>
	As I said earlier, this bill would pre-empt the process of that 
parliamentary review and presumes that change is needed without 
giving stakeholders a chance to participate and without allowing 
the evidence to be considered.
<P>
	My minister has already indicated an openness and a willingness 
to ensure that the process works and works properly. In fact, he has 
already asked the national forum to speed up its work and to 
produce the work on its consultations for the benefit not only of 
that review but for the benefit of other reviews on health.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Now that 
we have heard the debate on this bill I was wondering if we could 
have unanimous consent to refer the bill to committee.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
request of the hon. member. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There is not unanimous 
consent.
<P>
	The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired and the order is dropped from the Order 
Paper.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EMPLOYMENTINSURANCE">EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, a while ago I asked the former minister of human 
resources development how he expected public trust and 
confidence in government to be restored when his government 
pulled an about face on unemployment insurance. We all remember 
the red book promise about public trust and confidence in 
government.
<P>
	How did he see the serious hypocrisy of his actions, I asked. 
While in opposition he and his Liberal colleagues opposed 
Conservative cuts to UI which were not nearly as deep as those they 
recently pushed through the House.
<P>
	In today's economic climate support programs like UI are 
necessary to help workers adjust to changing  technological and 
global economic circumstances; however, income support alone 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5279"> 5279 </A></B>
<P>
has not and will not create the long term economic growth and jobs 
that today's economy demands.
<P>
	Clearly our aim should be to move the debate forward and 
develop a bold new approach to unemployment and unemployment 
insurance reform. It is no longer enough to focus solely on the 
unemployed, who have clearly been made a scapegoat by 
successive Liberal and Conservative governments. Instead I 
believe it is time to focus on what is required from society as a 
whole, from those who are looking for work, those who are able to 
supply it, and the governments which facilitate relationships 
between the two and which help to shape the way we do business in 
Canada.
<P>
	A creative and modern approach would include a scheme which 
would of course provide the unemployed with adequate resources 
for living for themselves and their families but which would also 
enable unemployed Canadians to get back to work and, when 
possible, to get the kind of jobs that match their needs.
<P>
	Real UI reform involves helping Canadians to find the kind of 
work they need and to help in creating the kind of workforce which 
can win a place in the global economy. This certainly means that 
overlap and duplication must be dealt with. It means establishing 
partnerships between federal, provincial and municipal 
governments and the private sector.
<P>
	The issue of dependency and abuse must also be dealt with, but 
separately from issues surrounding benefit levels and conditions so 
that eligibility benefit levels, training, job creation schemes and 
other active measures can be discussed in a more rational way.
<P>
	Unfortunately this has not been the case in Canada when UI 
reform has been discussed by the government. With the present 
policies, these crucial objectives are farther from being met than 
ever before.
<P>
	It is clear that the kind of reform carried out by successive 
Liberal and Conservative governments amounts to little more than 
thinking up new wheezes with which to bash the unemployed. 
Liberals on the government side opposed those measures when 
they were in opposition but now support them. The approach of the 
current government to unemployment and UI is more a restatement 
of the problem than a strategy to improve active support and 
develop truly effective measures to deal with unemployment and 
the transition of the unemployed into the labour market.
<P>
	The primary solution being offered is that the unemployed 
should receive less in benefits for a shorter period of time and the 
benefits should be harder to get; a strategy that has been tried and 
shown to have failed over the last decade and a half.
<P>
	Further, perhaps one of the most troubling measures with the 
government's UI reform constitutes the theft of $1.9 billion 
belonging to employers and employees. Even with the 
reinvestment into so-called active programs, the government 
admits to stealing more than $1.1 billion, money which plainly 
does not belong to the government. The government expects that 
two years from now there will be a $10 billion surplus in the UI 
fund. Instead of using these surplus funds to establish more 
aggressive and more constructive active support measures that 
would help the unemployed get back to work, measures that have 
been proven highly successful in other countries, the Minister of 
Finance will use this money so that he can meet his deficit 
reduction targets. This is theft, plain and simple, and we cannot 
afford to continue in this way.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	Canadians understand the need for a UI program that is fair, 
which provides basic financial support and which encourages and 
makes available the tools they need in order to re-enter the labour 
market.
<P>
	Canadians support aggressive active support measures that help 
people get back on their feet. The unemployed want a system that 
focuses on moving UI recipients into the workforce and which will 
support them in their efforts to achieve a greater degree of 
independence. This is a modern and progressive agenda which this 
legislation falls sadly short of. There are active measures but we 
know that they are simply not adequate for the needs of Canadians.
<P>
	I want to remind the minister that Canadians are watching as this 
government continues to listen to and give unfair and undeserved 
tax breaks to banks and big corporations while cutting funding for 
unemployment insurance, health care, education and other services 
needed by people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, contrary to what the hon. member 
seems to imply in his question, this government does not assume 
that public trust and confidence in government can be gained only 
by ever increasing spending. Governments everywhere of all 
political persuasions must address the real limits imposed by debt 
and deficit.
<P>
	The previous unemployment insurance program was no 
exception. In the first half of the 1990s UI premiums rose by more 
than one-third and neither employers nor workers could afford any 
more. At the same time, there was widespread recognition of the 
need for structural reform of the previous program.
<P>
	In response to these realities this government has implemented, 
after consulting with over 100,000 Canadians and hundreds of 
stakeholder groups throughout the country, a new modern system 
of employment insurance.
<P>
	The new EI system represents a dramatic shift from a passive 
role to the active role of assisting the unemployed  in becoming 
re-employed as soon as possible. These changes are about getting 
people back to work and providing a fair and balanced approach to 
the needs of unemployed Canadians. For employers, more simple 
EI requirements and less red tape will save time and money. The 
goal is to encourage and help workers to accept available work and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5280"> 5280 </A></B>
<P>
for employers to accept a larger responsibility for providing that 
work.
<P>
	Last May the minister issued a proposal to the provinces and 
territories offering them responsibility for active employment 
measures and labour market services funded from the EI account. 
The proposal is flexible enough to result in programs tailored to the 
different needs and priorities of each province. Negotiations are 
still going on.
<P>
	In short, by consulting widely, by protecting the most vulnerable 
and by providing affordable programs that best serve the needs of 
all Canadians this government is giving an example of how we can 
act most effectively to restore public confidence in government.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANWHEATBOARD">CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on Friday last week the minister of agriculture was in 
Regina to make an announcement concerning the future of the 
Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Prior to the announcement I heard a rumour that the minister was 
considering the possibility of putting the question of barley 
marketing to a plebiscite. Indeed, the minister did say that he was 
considering a barley plebiscite to be put to producers next year.
<P>
	My question, which the minister's parliamentary secretary could 
not answer at the time, can be answered today.
<P>
	Of course, the minister did not call it a plebiscite. Instead he 
opted for the more friendly term poll, but the bottom line is the 
same. This kind of action is typical of the minister who has spent 
most of his time in cabinet finding ways to avoid making decisions. 
And when he does, he makes decisions that try to please everyone.
<P>
	In this case it appears the idea of a plebiscite is aimed at 
appeasing barley producers, particularly Alberta producers who 
want an open market for their product.
<P>
	Unfortunately if the Liberal government goes ahead with the 
plebiscite, the net result will be continued uncertainty over the 
future of the Canadian Wheat Board. If the results of the plebiscite 
support the open market over single desk selling, then the long 
term future of the Canadian Wheat Board itself remains in doubt.
<P>
	The minister, knowing the vast majority of western Canadian 
farmers support a strong, even enhanced Canadian Wheat Board, 
has purposely chosen to support the corporate interests of the grain 
trade over the collective interests of the prairie farmer by doing so. 
Obviously the plebiscite continues the slow but  determined 
process to ultimately do away with the board, as was started by the 
Tories in the last Parliament who removed oats from the 
jurisdiction of the board. Remember, they did that without a 
mandate from the people.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	In Canada, the government is continuing the dismantling of the 
board by commissioning the marketing panel, which travelled the 
country earlier this year, and now on the plebiscite issue as well as 
internationally with a debate among officials at the World Trade 
Organization level.
<P>
	Forgotten in the debate seems to be the fact that the minister of 
agriculture is not taking responsibility for farmers' interests. He is 
asking farmers who do not have sufficient technical or financial 
support to take on the major players in this debate, the grain 
companies and the Alberta government.
<P>
	If the agriculture minister were truly representing farm interests 
and if he continues to insist on holding a plebiscite, he would 
consider enhancing, rather than disturbing, the board's jurisdiction.
<P>
	There is strong evidence to support expanding the powers of the 
board. A good question would include the possibility of adding 
oats, rye and canola to the jurisdiction of the board. It should be 
done.
<P>
	Perhaps the most troublesome element of the entire process so 
far is that the minister is proceeding with major legislative changes 
to the wheat board and is proposing to schedule a delicate 
plebiscite without consulting the producer elected representatives 
of the Canadian Wheat Board advisory committee.
<P>
	This committee was elected by farmers to represent the interests 
of farmers across the prairies and to, in that capacity, advise the 
minister of agriculture on matters pertaining to the Canadian 
Wheat Board.
<P>
	Each member of this committee has studied the operations of the 
board, has reviewed the recommendations of the Western Grain 
Marketing Panel and has evaluated how each will impact on their 
own regions of the country. Their input into this process should be 
invaluable, yet they have been ignored.
<P>
	Worse, it is proposed that they be replaced by an appointed 
interim board if the government goes ahead with the announced 
changes to the way in which the board should be governed. The 
minister has really missed the boat on this one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would assure 
my hon. colleague that I was not here on Friday and therefore did 
not respond to a question.
<P>
	On Friday, October 4 and again on Monday, October 7 the 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food outlined the federal 
government's policy response to the intensely  emotional debate 
among 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5281"> 5281 </A></B>
<P>
farmers in western Canada about the western grain marketing 
system.
<P>
	Our policy position builds on the proven strengths of the current 
system for marketing western wheat and barley while at the same 
time modernizing the governance structure of the Canadian Wheat 
Board, enhancing accountability, introducing new operating 
facilities to accelerate cash flow to farmers and empowering 
farmers with a great amount of decision making.
<P>
	Included in the package is a vote this winter among farmers on a 
clear cut question about the marketing preferences with respect to 
barley. This is fully consistent with the establishment of policy 
positions of many of the western farm organizations.
<P>
	Overall, the government's plans on the thorny and diverse issues 
related to grain marketing have been developed following the most 
extensive consultations in the history of the western grains 
industry.
<P>
	Throughout, the Western Grain Marketing Panel has been very 
much involved. Otherwise, the Canadian Wheat Board producer 
advisory committee has let its views be known very loudly and 
clearly, as have well over 12,000 other farmers who have 
participated in these consultations.
<P>
	It is still very early in the going, but we are pleased to note that 
many of the major farm organizations have reacted favourably to 
our policy package, including the Prairie Pools Inc., Keystone 
Agricultural Producers of Manitoba and Wild Rose organization 
from Alberta.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board itself has responded very 
constructively. There have been encouraging editorials in the 
Winnipeg <I>Free Press</I>, the Regina <I>Leader-Post</I>, the Saskatoon <I>Star 
Phoenix</I> and the Calgary <I>Herald</I>. All that appears to me to be a very 
good start.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATION">IMMIGRATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on May 27, I 
asked a question to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration on 
the growing number of refugee claimants in Quebec. Of the 26,000 
claims made in Canada in 1995, more than 12,000 were transferred 
to the Montreal IRB. For the first time, more refugee claimants 
landed in Montreal than in Toronto.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	I also asked the minister if her government was willing to share 
the cost of social benefits provided to refugee claimants.
<P>
	Finally and fortunately, the minister and her counterpart in 
Quebec met on September 6 and agreed on a number of measures to 
respond to Quebec's concerns. As a result, health care costs for 
refugee claimants in Quebec will be covered by the interim  federal 
health program, as is the case in the other Canadian provinces. As 
of November 1, 1996, the Government of Quebec will gradually 
withdraw from health care funding. However, health insurance will 
continue to be covered by Quebec until cards have expired.
<P>
	At the same time, the Quebec government reaffirmed its 
intention to maintain a range of services that will permit these 
people to wait for a ruling on their claim in safety and in dignity. 
They will thus remain eligible for social and legal assistance, 
temporary accommodation and help in finding accommodation. 
Quebec will also continue to take responsibility for unaccompanied 
minor children. It will assume the costs of primary and secondary 
education, as well as of francization services on a part time basis. 
In the year 1994-95, $125 million were spent on these services.
<P>
	In addition, the minister responsible for relations with citizens 
and for immigration, André Boisclair, called on the federal 
government, and rightly so, to process refugee claims submitted in 
Quebec more efficiently and more rapidly.
<P>
	On a number of occasions, I have criticized how long it takes for 
claims to be heard by the IRB, particularly where appeals are 
concerned. It is not acceptable to have to wait one year for a 
hearing, and sometimes years for a final decision.
<P>
	IRB commissioners must issue their decisions rapidly so that 
refugees who have been accepted can have immediate access to all 
the programs and all the protective measures.
<P>
	I am glad to see savings and arrangements between Ottawa and 
Quebec. However, the international obligations of Canada, as a 
signatory to the Geneva convention on refugees, must never be 
forgotten. We must constantly reaffirm our deep attachment to the 
humanitarian principle of protecting those who are persecuted and 
in distress. For my part, I am very proud of the tradition of 
open-mindedness and solidarity expressed by Quebecers.

	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must admit that 
I am not exactly clear what the member for Bourassa is implying 
with his question. Does he want us to stop refugees from coming to 
Montreal? Does he want us to say we will close the doors to 
legitimate refugees? Does he want us to somehow intervene and 
ensure greater refusal rates in Montreal? I hope not. That certainly 
is not something we are prepared to do and certainly is not 
something that the Canadian people want.
<P>
	The hon. member has implied that Montreal gets an inordinate 
number of refugees. It is true that a large number of refugees do 
arrive in that city. This should not come as as surprise to anyone. 
Montreal is a major  international port of entry and is very close to 
other large gateways such as New York.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	I would also be surprised if refugees did not come to Montreal. 
We should not forget, however, that other international ports such 
as Toronto and Vancouver also attract a very large number of 
refugees. In a lot of cases it is a question of geography. We should 
not forget most refugees do not have the luxury of picking or 
choosing their destinations. People fleeing persecution will go 
wherever they can.
<P>
	We have an international obligation to consider refugee claims 
on our territory and we are living up to those responsibilities. We 
are good global citizens and we take our obligations and 
responsibilities seriously.
<P>
	The hon. member suggested in the House that we should work 
more closely with the Government of Quebec on these issues. We 
agree and that is what we are doing. Our refugee policies are 
formulated in consultations with many different interested parties. 
These include the provinces.
<P>
	The question of international immigration is one which affects 
all of us and one we need to address as partners. Indeed it was with 
this in mind that the minister met with her counterpart from 
Quebec, André Boisclair, on September 6. At that meeting it was 
confirmed that, as of this coming November 1, the Government of 
Canada will be assuming responsibility under the interim health 
program for the medical costs incurred by refugee claimants who 
are living in Quebec and awaiting a decision by the Immigration 
and Refugee Board.
<P>
	As in other provinces, it is the responsibility of the Government 
of Quebec and not the federal government to decide which services 
are available to refugee claimants.
<P>
	At that meeting Minister Boisclair was also assured that 
measures to speed up the processing of refugee claims before the 
IRB, such as the appointment of members, have already been put in 
place or are being put in place. Since this minister assumed office, 
more than 60 per cent of new IRB members have been assigned to 
the Montreal regional office.
<P>
	At present, both governments are working together in a sprit of 
co-operation. Our respective teams are in close contact with a view 
to promoting a greater exchange of information and better 
understanding of the policies that affect refugee claimants.
<P>
	Contrary to the hon. member's position, the minister is also 
pleased with Minister Boisclair's strong support of the proposed 
Canada-U.S. agreement on refugees.
<P>
	Canada has a fair and just refugee system. It is one of the best in 
the world. It is not perfect, no system is. We are continuously 
working to improve it to weed out the few bad apples who abuse 
the system. But we should never forget that the majority of those 
who come to  Canada for protection need that protection. Are we 
going to close the doors on these people? Of course not.
<P>

House is deemed to have been adopted. The House stands 
adjourned until 2 p.m. tomorrow, pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
