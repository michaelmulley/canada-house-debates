taking Action to Make a Difference!” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International Women's Day is an occasion to reflect on the

actions of women's organizations to fight violence and poverty 
in Canada, two priority issues for Status of Women Canada.

play in reaching this goal, and we will all benefit from these 
efforts.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, for 
years now the government has been engaging in a dangerous game. 
It has been referring to Indian bands as first nations, Nisga'a 
now have a form of citizenship, they talk about self-government 
as though it was self-evident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the government has been enacting legislation that 
abdicates federal authority and responsibility to band 
governments without corresponding guarantees of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the Liberals are considering another misguided policy 
proposal.  This week in Great Falls, Montana, Canadian and 
American Indians began to push for an Indian only border crossing 
between Alberta and Montana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises concerns about the sovereignty of Canada and its 
ability to police its own border with all that that implies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is past time for the government to uphold the sovereignty and 
authority of Canada.  Canadian Indians are citizens of this 
country with all of the privileges and responsibilities of 
citizenship.  They are citizens of no other nation.  It is time 
to move ahead with one law for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
nothing bothers Canadians more than to be interrupted on the 
telephone by someone trying to sell a good or a service that they 
do not want.  Many consider this an invasion of their personal 
privacy or, at the very least, an annoyance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are currently laws in five U.S. states to prevent 
telemarketers from phoning people who do not want to be bothered. 
I have introduced a private member's bill that would make this 
law in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill would force telemarketers to consult a list to ensure 
people who do not want to be bothered are not contacted by 
establishing a do not call list that will be controlled by the 
CRTC.  For individuals or companies who ignore the list, 
substantial fines under the Telecommunications Act would be 
imposed.

help make that happen.

Speaker, all members of the House and all Canadians will surely 
welcome the news that Canada Post and the Canadian Union of 
Postal Workers have negotiated a new collective agreement that 
will help to ensure labour co-operation until the year 2003 and 
beyond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The union announced today that the tentative agreement reached 
with Canada Post in December has received overwhelming support 
from its members in the ratification vote held during the past 
month.  This is a clear sign that labour relations at Canada Post 
are improving.  Canada Post has now successfully negotiated new 
collective agreements with each of its four unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new collective agreement provides an avenue for building on 
this new spirit of mutual trust.  Both parties have agreed to 
work together to develop new work rules to serve customers better 
and face the competition posed by new technologies and 
multinational corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my fellow members, I congratulate the union and the 
management of Canada Post for this significant accomplishment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what kind of 
surprising information can be found in the Minister of Human 
Resources Development's list?  According to it, my riding 
supposedly received $6.4 million from the transitional jobs fund, 
with the potential creation of 1,031 jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the local employment centre in my riding, the 
amount was in fact $2.3 million and the jobs created, 300.  It 
seems to me that the minister's 10,000 pages and lists are more 
about quantity than quality of data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does she insist on the amounts announced and the potential 
jobs, instead of giving the figures for what was really 
achieved?  The program is over.

for which the venue was Gatineau Park and Dow's Lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Congratulations to Marie-Odile Raymond from Aylmer, who placed 
second in the women's 48 kilometre freestyle and third in the 
800 metre sprint race, which will become a full Olympic medal 
sport for the first time in the 2002 Winter Games at Salt Lake 
City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other athletes from the Hull—Aylmer region went all out: 
Christian Picard, Sébastien Lacourse, Éric Rouleau, Richard 
Weber, and I could go on and on, because there were 2,500 
participants in these cross-country events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate all these athletes on their magnificent 
performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And these congratulations would not be complete without 
mentioning the exceptional contribution made by president Louise 
Poirier, general manager Henrico Valente, and the approximately 
600 volunteers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has given so much information that the level of 
documents transferred to members of all parties and to the press 
at the beginning of this week was the most open attempt to give 
information to everybody ever done in parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, angry taxpayers have another question for the Prime 
Minister, and it is one they would like an answer to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public knows that the Minister of Finance controls the flow 
of tax dollars to government departments.  They also know now 
that during the very period the finance minister was slashing 
payments to health care, he was increasing funds to HRDC programs 
that were being grossly mismanaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the Prime Minister not do anything to stop the finance 
minister from obviously misallocating hard earned taxpayer money? 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the economic policies of the government have done a lot 
of good things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had 11.5% unemployment and it is down to 6.8%.  We had a 
deficit of $42 billion and now, for the first time in 50 years, 
we have four surpluses in a row.  When we started we had an 11% 
interest rate in Canada and now it is at 6%.  I could go on and 
on and on explaining our economic policies.

Prime Minister should be more concerned about the finance 
minister who has seen more chicken than the colonel on his 
leadership tour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year the finance minister rubberstamps the billions of 
dollars that Minister of Human Resources Development has 
mismanaged.  It is kind of interesting that the self-described 
good money manager has completely gone silent on his involvement 
in this very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister confirm the worst kept secret in Ottawa, 
that the finance minister is ashamed of his role in the billion 
dollar boondoggle? 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, let us understand what this issue is all about. 
Absolutely the country requires sound financial management and we 
have provided it, but that is not the difference of opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difference of opinion is that the Reform Party does not 
believe that there is role for government in working with Kinsmen 
clubs, Richelieu clubs, Optimists clubs, Lions clubs and Rotary 
clubs.  We believe there is a responsibility of the federal 
government to work with communities across the country, and we 
will continue to do so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, you 
will notice that he was running away from the issue again.  The 
usually talkative finance minister for some reason has avoided 
his usual prebudget interviews this year.  I wonder why.  I 
wonder if he is feeling okay.  I hope so, but I guess it is a 
very good thing that a guilty conscience is not fatal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Prime Minister.  Is not the real reason 
the finance minister has gone silent this year that he is very 
concerned he would be recognized as the sugar daddy behind these 
boondoggles? 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member ought to know that the time to lay out 
the government's budgetary plans will be next Monday in the House 
when the budget is presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I announced a week ago that the budget would be next Monday.  I 
can understand that not all members of the Reform Party would 
know that because, after all, the announcement was made in the 
House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, I think that one of the ways of finding 
out what is going on in the department is to ask the minister. 
We see that grant disbursement dates sometimes preceded approval 
dates by as much as two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this no longer appears on the so-called transparent lists, I

report that chronicles poor management of millions of dollars, 
this time by CIDA.  Among other things the report revealed little 
tracking, validation or monitoring of up to $850 million.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation,

sneaking it in.  The audit was done in September, I reviewed it 
in December and it was released in December on time.  If I had 
released it after December they would have said I was late with 
the report.  I did it exactly when it was finished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that, 80% of the recommendations which the audit 
made have already been implemented or are in the process of being

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994, and every year since then, spending on boondoggle 
grants and contributions has increased every single year.  Over

transfers to the provinces in 1999-2000 were higher than they

and says “I have nothing to be ashamed of”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems pretty clear to me that every single year the finance

Speaker, this week the minister sacrificed an awful lot of trees 
to show something that we already knew all too well, that she 
shovelled millions of dollars of public money out the door.  It 
is very telling what she did not show:  when the cheques were 
written, why the money was given, where it was spent, and what 
Canadians got out of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it because she does not know this key information, or is she 
afraid to make it public? 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think we have the opportunity today to 
review some of the facts that have been made clear over the last 
three weeks for those who may not have been here or who have not 
had the opportunity to look at them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we know that a billion dollars is not missing, and these 
lists show that very clearly.  Second, we know that grants and 
contributions are to be found in the ridings of all members of 
the House.  Third, we are starting to see again that the Reform 
Party continues to use partial data and incomplete research to 
make accusations that are unfounded, particularly in areas like 
the targeted wage subsidy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, partial data is the whole point.  This minister has 
refused to provide the most important information about her 
billion dollar boondoggle.  When she spent the money.  Why the 
money was given out.  Where it was spent.  And what Canadians got 
out of it.  All she has told us is that she spent the money and 
that is what we already know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this minister afraid to give the real data out because she 
knows she cannot stand to defend it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the real data is out and they do not like 
it.  They do not want Canadians to know that there are projects 
funded in every one of their ridings.  They do not want Canadians 
to know that they do not know anything about it and that they 
really do not care that Canadians are being helped in an 
appropriate way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Reformers do not like is the fact that Canadians appreciate 
that the Government of Canada is there to help Canadians with 
disabilities, young people and communities which cannot, without 
assistance, provide opportunities for their members.  That is 
what they do not like.

these jobs were created not in the riding of Rosemont, but in 
Saint-Maurice.

since 1993 the finance minister has raised taxes on the average

soaked in sweat tax dollars, were used to fund wasteful grants

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

approximately $5,000.  Those hard earned, soaked in sweat tax 
dollars were used to fund wasteful grants and contributions at 
HRDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the Minister of Human Resources Development is 
simple.  How much more money will you take from the pockets of 
Canadian families in order to fund wasteful contributions and 
grants? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I remind members to please address their 
questions through the Chair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

wasteful contributions.  In his own riding he received around $30 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he call it wasteful to help support the British Columbia 
Interior Independent Living Resource Centre?  Would he call it

Association?  Would he call it wasteful that we supported the Day

</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the hon. member would like to visit these projects and

<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
once again it is sad to see a minister of the crown who does not 
understand that $1 billion that is mismanaged in any riding is 
still mismanaged.  The government should be accountable for that 
mismanagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask the minister again, $3.2 billion of hard earned 
taxpayers' money went to the minister's department for grants and 
contributions.  We now know it has been mismanaged.  How much 
more has the minister asked the Minister of Finance to contribute 
to boondoggle grants and contributions?  How much?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is six or seven years that we have been sitting in 
the House watching members of that party.  Their definition of 
wasteful spending is money in the first mandate that went for 
health care. 
Their definition of wasteful spending is money that went for 
research and development, money that went for education. Their 
definition of wasteful spending is money that goes to help the 
fabric of Canadian society.  It is no wonder they want to change 
their name.

there is another department that bungled nearly a billion dollars 
of taxpayers' money. According to its own audit, CIDA had “no 
specific targets defined, little data collected, little evidence 
of analysis of progress reports”.  It bungled almost a billion 
dollars in the same way the human resources department did.

about 30 or more audits all into one.  Quite frankly we audit to 
improve the programs.  That is how program evaluation and quality 
control is done. We monitor projects on an ongoing basis.  Our 
revised monitoring process will be in place by April.  No 
payments will be made to projects without supporting invoices. 
Most important, the auditor general audited $1 billion worth of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
suggest to the Prime Minister that the best way to show respect 
for Canadian taxpayers is that when he does come to work, he 
address their priority concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the top priority for Canadians is health care. What 
Canadians want from the government is a stable, long term 
commitment to rebuild the health care partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister make that commitment today or will he go 
on making excuses while we slide steadily and surely toward the 
Americanized two tier, privatized health care system that 
Canadians do not want? 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we showed last year that our priority coincides precisely with 
the number one priority of Canadians by devoting the budget to 
health care, by increasing by $11.5 billion the transfers to the 
provinces after they promised to use the additional money only 
for that purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than money will be required to fix what is wrong with 
health care.  The status quo is not acceptable.  Changes have to 
be made.  I have put proposals on the table and invited 
provincial ministers to join me in working toward renewing 
medicare. That is our number one priority.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, no 
wonder Canadians are worried if the best the government can do 
when it says health care is its priority is to contribute 15% of 
health care spending from what was a partnership of 50:50. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is content to let that partnership fall apart 
and to remain a junior partner in health care, why does it not 
just admit it?

I am afraid the hon. member has been taking at face value some of 
the numbers used by Ralph Klein and Mike Harris.  They are wrong. 
The value of the annual transfers from the Government of Canada 
to the provinces is more like 26 cents on every health dollar, 
and 45 cents is spent by the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start from the right numbers and let us also acknowledge 
that more than money is required.  We will have to make changes 
in the way services are delivered.  I have offered to work with

<P><A NAME="LINK155"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I move that 
the second report of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade, tabled on Thursday, December 16, 1999, 
be concurred in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today to speak to the second report of 
the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade, tabled on Thursday, December 16, 1999. This report is 
entitled “Exporting in the Canadian Interest: Reviewing the 
Export Development Act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I will deal with the form and then I will talk about the 
content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may not know this, but the way the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade approved this report was 
rather odd, even though the report is of a paramount importance. 
It is therefore totally unacceptable for the Standing Committee 
on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, or rather the 
Liberal majority on the committee, to have approved this report 
in such a hurry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Believe it or not, the whole approval process took fifteen 
minutes. The Liberal majority approved this report of close to 
one hundred pages—and I stress this—in less than fifteen minutes. 
Moreover, in view of the fact that some Liberal members on the 
committee had hardly ever taken part in this review, it was 
obvious that nothing was going to stop the government from 
having the report approved on the sly, just before the Christmas 
recess, unless Liberal backbenchers are able to read faster than 
the best speed readers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More importantly, the Export Development Corporation does for 
$34.7 billion worth of business. In 1998, its profits amounted 
to $135 million. It is unconscionable to take only fifteen 
minutes to approve a report dealing with such huge amounts of 
public money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just by pure chance, that particular day when we were determined 
to maintain the pace of the committee meetings, was the very day 
that this House debated Bill C-20, a bill which is attempting to 
stifle the democratic rights of Quebecers to decide on their own 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cavalier and disdainful attitude of the Liberal majority in 
adopting this report at the committee on foreign affairs and 
international trade will remain in my memory as one of the 
blackest and most tragic episodes in my parliamentary 
experience.  Heaven only knows that, in my six years on that 
committee, we have never had to rush the adoption of a report 
through in such an unacceptable way.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, nevertheless the Bloc Quebecois considers that the 
spirit of the Export Development Act generally responds fairly 
well to the objectives behind it when it was passed.  There is, 
however, still some room for improvement in the way the Export 
Development Corporation operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We identified three flaws in the committee report, and I would 
like to address them now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, as many of those who spoke before the foreign 
affairs and international trade committee pointed out so 
clearly, there seems to be a flagrant lack of transparency in 
the way the corporation operates, and there are serious 
shortcomings as far as access to information is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, it was impossible for a Bloc Quebecois member on 
this committee to obtain a breakdown of the corporation's 
financial activities in Quebec.  It is therefore not surprising 
that it is difficult for the House to know if EDC is respecting 
the spirit and the letter of the law.  That is why we also 
wanted the Export Development Corporation to be subject to the 
Access to Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc Quebecois members are not the only ones worried about this 
lack of transparency.  On October 20, 1998, then Minister for 
International Trade, Sergio Marchi, engaged Gowling, Strathy 
and Henderson to review the Export Development Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1999, project leader Guy David tabled his report, which 
contained 39 recommendations, one of which had to do with the 
issue of accountability and transparency. 
What is now known as the Gowlings report recommends, and I 
quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>EDC should be required to post, on a regular basis, specific 
information regarding transactions it has supported.  Such 
information might include, for example, the name of the 
borrower, country, name of exporter, amount and type of 
financial support, term and a brief description of the goods, 
services or project involved.  Transactions should be posted 
within 60 days of signing. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our second reservation is much the same and has to do with the 
Export Development Corporation's respect for human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Export Development Corporation offers financing 
services, its particular focus is credit insurance. 
The risks assumed by the corporation may include factors of a 
political nature. However, in its evaluation of political risks 
in each country, the Export Development Corporation does not 
take into account the human rights situation in the countries 
where the businesses it is helping are operating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the opinion of the Bloc Quebecois, before granting any money, 
before providing financial support to any business, the EDC 
should at least make sure the business adheres to the code of 
conduct set out by the OECD with regard to human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find it unacceptable that the Export Development Act could be 
used to circumvent the values treasured by all Quebecers and 
Canadians. It is disturbing to think that the Export Development 
Corporation might help businesses operating in developing 
countries where they contribute to propagate values conflicting 
with ours.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, a disturbing situation has just confirmed our 
apprehensions. No later than last week, KPMG published the 
results of a poll conducted with 1,000 chief executive officers 
of Canadian corporations. The results are more than worrisome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifty-eight per cent of the corporations and government 
organizations that responded to the poll have no senior manager 
responsible for ethics. Only 38% of respondents said they 
provided ethics training to their managers and, one time in 
three, less than one hour a year is devoted to such training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of all the public discussions that have taken place in 
recent years on child labour in developing and emerging 
countries, 16% of exporting businesses have yet to adopt a 
policy on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps even more telling and sad is the fact that the response 
rate to the survey was extremely low in the private sector, at 
under 8%. Businesses do not care much about ethics, to say the 
least. But Canadian businesses are not the only ones to blame. 
The example is set a the top. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, civil war has been raging in Sudan for several 
years. A number of non-governmental organizations have condemned 
the fact that slavery is practised openly. Serious violations of 
fundamental rights are a common occurrence. 
Over one million civilians have been killed and 4.5 million 
people have been displaced within the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talisman Energy, an oil company based in Calgary, does business 
in Sudan. A few months ago, the Canadian Minister of Foreign 
Affairs promised to impose sanctions on Talisman if it was 
demonstrated that the company's presence in Sudan was 
contributing to the continuation of the civil war in that 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the American government urged the Canadian government to 
prohibit Canadian businesses from investing in that African 
country, which serves as a haven for terrorist organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet last week the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced that he 
no longer had any plans to exercise any sanctions against 
Talisman, despite the fact that his special envoy, John Harker, 
has demonstrated that oil is a key factor in the terrible civil 
war that is being waged in Sudan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, international observers do not see any hope for a 
ceasefire as long as oil exploration continues.  This is 
compounded by the fact that the royalties being paid to the 
Sudanese government are being used in the war effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Bernard Descôteaux rightly asked in an editorial in <I>Le Devoir</I> 
last week, “Is there no limit to our complicity in a morally 
reprehensible situation?  Clearly, today the Canadian government 
is accepting this complicity”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Export Development Corporation is in strange position. 
When the government directing it is interested only in the smell 
of money and of trade, how could we expect the EDC to be 
inspired by noble ethical and moral values? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the third problematical element in this second report 
by the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade addresses the EDC's environmental responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Gowlings report made one recommendation on this which we 
felt to be very reasonable: “Canada should encourage the early 
development of an international consensus on environmental 
guidelines and procedures for export credit agencies. In the 
meantime, EDC should adopt a substantively and methodologically 
clear and transparent environmental framework”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will dispense with the reading of another recommendation of 
424 words, in which anyone could get irretrievably lost in a 
maze of pompous, complicated and inapplicable language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A Perron:</B> What about clarity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien:</B> My colleague asked “What about clarity?” 
If the Liberal majority were to ask the question in a 
referendum, there would be clarity problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, the Bloc Quebecois would have preferred that the 
Export Development Corporation draw more on the very simple and 
probably more effective operational framework of the World Bank 
or the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, since 
they require, for each sensitive project in a sensitive area, an 
impact study, public hearings and most importantly process 
transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois would not support the EDC's using public 
funds for projects that would damage the environment or violate 
human rights and to do so with impunity and in absolute secrecy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make myself clear, we consider the role played by the 
Export Development Corporation both positive and vital, but we 
feel it must conduct itself as a crown corporation of a country 
that cannot blindly encourage and support exports and 
investments abroad without considering the effects of its 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would point out that the export sector is of vital 
importance to the economy of Quebec, which is one of the world's 
most open economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week, the Quebec minister of state for the economy and 
finance, Bernard Landry, wisely pointed out that over the past 
decade Quebec's international exports increased by 130% to 
$78 billion annually.  We must not forget either that Quebec 
exports 55% of its gross domestic product and that the increase 
in these exports has meant over 142,000 new jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec supports free trade.  Its people understood long before 
the Liberal government the importance of establishing a trade 
economy.  We too are democrats and we want to assure you that 
trade and business are conducted according to the ethical values 
and ideals of the vast majority of Canadians and Quebecers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, 
I would like to thank my colleague from Laval East. I believe 
that her speech reflected her long experience on the Standing 
Committee of Foreign Affairs and International Trade as well as 
her determination to remain well informed of any infringement of 
human rights wherever Canada is active.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a double question. Considering the huge budget of the EDC 
and fact that that agency has a lot of assets it can use without 
informing the public, does the hon. member not find it extremely 
strange that the committee—whose past work she is aware of, 
having been part of it—hastily adopted without review a report of 
such crucial importance, in view of the fact that Canada is 
being censured in several parts of the world? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the member for 
Mercier for her question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my speech, I did point out that EDC's budget for all 
activities was $34.7 billion—not $34 billion.  The budget for its 
activities was $34.7 billion.  These are commitments of public 
funds.  Even if the EDC provides benefits, the fact remains that 
these are very substantial commitments of public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Mercier said, it is unthinkable that the 
committee rushed through consideration of this report in such a 
cavalier fashion.  In addition, as the member indicated, it is 
also unacceptable that there is no information or transparency 
mechanism, given the size of EDC's budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our recommendations was that EDC be subject to the Access 
to Information Act. 
Obviously, the Liberal majority did not go for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mercier is absolutely right about how this report 
was adopted.  I personally have been on the Standing Committee 
on Foreign Affairs and International Trade for over six years 
now, ever since I was elected to the House of Commons.  On a few 
occasions, we had to speed up consideration for certain reports. 
The member for Toronto Centre—Rosedale, who chairs the 
committee, and who is here and listening today, knows it only 
too well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each time, Bloc Quebecois members agreed to work closely with 
other members of the committee and in good faith, so as to 
improve the report.  Whenever we had dissenting opinions, we 
expressed them in good faith and in the spirit of improving the 
report and Canada's policy.  This time, unfortunately, is the 
first time I have seen such incomprehensible haste at report 
stage. 
<P><A NAME="LINK157"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like first to congratulate my hon. colleague from Laval East for 
her eloquent speech on a subject matter of tremendous importance 
to a lot of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are few people on this earth more attached to human rights 
than Quebecers. Respect for human rights is one of the core 
values of the Quebec people. The Bloc Quebecois, which is truly 
reflective of this, has, through the hon. member for Laval East, 
made the defense of human rights a major thrust of all the 
positions it has taken in this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from Laval East is an ardent defender of human 
rights. I would like to know what she would have done if she had 
been the one deciding what to put in the Export Development Act, 
as far as the human rights are concerned.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would she have put in, and what would she like to see in 
the Human Rights Act that would bring satisfaction not only to 
her personally, but also to all Quebecers, for whom the respect 
of human rights is a core value? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would first like to thank my 
colleague from Charlesbourg for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that one of the values considered important by the 
people of Quebec is respect for human rights, which is a major 
consideration in most of its decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, since the Bloc Quebecois has been in the House of 
Commons, the issue of human rights has been a constant concern, 
not only of the member for Laval East, because she is the human 
rights critic, but of all the Bloc Quebecois members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the hon. member has asked me what I would have done, had I 
drafted this report, to put some teeth in it on the subject of 
the respect of human rights, I would refer quite simply to the 
Gowlings report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its recommendation is very simple, it provides “As a matter of 
practice, EDC should consult with DFAIT in advance to ensure 
that EDC's planned country activities abroad do not conflict 
with Canada's foreign policy on human rights. DFAIT should 
establish a process to formulate human rights guidelines and 
disseminate information on a timely basis, which all businesses 
dealing with the EDC should follow”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recommendations of the Gowlings report are clear and 
precise, as you can see.  There is no 254 word recommendation as 
is found in the committee's report, on the environment, for 
example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Gowlings report also provides “EDC should implement a policy 
whereby, when applying for EDC financial or insurance services, 
Canadian exporters are asked to indicate on a voluntary basis 
whether they have adopted their own codes of conduct that ensure 
respect for human rights, ethical business conduct and fair 
labour standards in their international activities”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Gowlings report is clear and precise.  It is much clearer 
than the “clarity act”, and it seems that the government and the 
EDC should stick just to that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the members of the House for allowing us to go to the 
applications for emergency debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I seek leave under Standing Order 52 to propose an emergency 
debate to address the devastating financial and mental stress 
affecting farming communities across the prairies due to the 
income crisis that continues to affect the agricultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An emergency debate, in my opinion, is required now in order to 
urge the government to provide tangible solutions to address the 
long term viability of the agricultural industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in the House we recognize that there are a number of 
instances now happening.  We have had farmers in the Saskatchewan 
legislature protesting for a number of days.  We have hunger 
strikes.  Some farmers will find it difficult this spring to put 
crops in on their lands.  The price of diesel gas right now is 
also a dramatic problem for agriculture in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate would give the minister of agriculture the 
opportunity to inform the House of the status of the negotiations 
on the five year safety net agreement with the provinces and the

pointed out, the hon. member for Brandon—Souris has the floor

not.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>MUNICIPAL GRANTS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK169">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-10, an 
act to amend the Municipal Grants Act, be read the third time 
and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The hon. member for 
Chambly has 25 minutes to complete his speech. 
<P><A NAME="LINK170"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, you are a man of 
your words. Indeed, last Friday, when 1.30 p.m. came around, you 
told me I still had 25 minutes and 54 seconds. 
I will not argue about the 54 seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, I was in the process of telling my Liberal friends 
opposite that the infamous discretionary powers have always 
caused the downfall of ministers. Most of those ministers who 
were caught red-handed, as I said, fell prey to some 
discretionary power. Never anything else. I had also shown how, 
when it comes to justice, the current government often applies a 
double standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had then talked about the current scandals at HRDC. 
I was not, however, aware of the one my colleague, the hon. 
member for Rosemont, announced today when he questioned the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister was unable to give an answer, once again and as 
usual.  She could not tell the hon. member for Rosemont that his 
name, his good faith, his position as an MP, had been made use 
of to divert funds that would normally have been allocated to 
his riding.  The people of Rosemont were penalized, and theirs 
is not a wealthy riding.  There are many unemployed people, many 
young people, many single parents, in fact poverty may well be 
somewhat more visible there than elsewhere.  Funding for that 
riding got diverted to the riding of Saint-Maurice.  That is 
purely and simply criminal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice that the government House leader is seated on this side 
of the House.  Probably so as to distance himself from what the 
people in his party are doing; I am pretty sure of that. 
It is sad.  He probably realizes it, and that is why he is 
sitting on this side right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us, Bill C-10, is well intentioned, as always.  I 
think everybody here wants to do the right thing.  The bill 
stems from good intentions.  We are always prepared to help 
others, our fellow citizens and, in this case, the 
municipalities.  What bothers me, however, is the discretionary 
power the minister is taking upon himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now there is another member crossing over, I think because 
members opposite are realizing they are in the wrong party. 
They are probably doing a wrong to the municipalities too.  If 
this keeps up, sides will need to be changed, Mr. Speaker.  I 
wonder if they are going to have a quorum over there, and if we 
will be able to keep sitting today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a sad event. 
I personally was opposed to that and said that we must restrict 
this discretionary power that the minister is giving himself. 
For example, when the time comes to pay his taxes, the minister 
thinks “Here is a mayor in a small municipality where there is a 
federal property. He is not a supporter of our party, the great 
Liberal Party of Canada. Perhaps he is a sympathizer of the mean 
Quebec sovereignists”. Or it could be somewhere else in Canada. 
Perhaps the mayor of a given town is a friend of the Reform 
Party or of another party.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In such a case, the minister may be less inclined to meet his 
obligations and pay what he owes in lieu of taxes to the 
municipality. An opposition party must fight tooth and nail 
against this kind of initiative, because this always leads to 
injustice, and prejudice. Sometimes, when we realize that it is 
the case, it is very late to correct the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill comes at a time when we are debating the clarity act. 
Our friends opposite claim to be the protectors of clarity, the 
champions of clarity in Canada. For them, nothing is ever clear, 
except what they do themselves. This time, experience obviously 
did not serve them well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take the definition of “federal property” at subsection (3) for 
instance. Even the Jesuits, who are famous for knowing 
everything, would have a hard time understanding this 
legislation. Incidentally, I must say that I have great respect 
for the Jesuits. The reverend who is protesting on the other 
side is a Jesuit, and I have a great deal of respect for him. I 
may not necessarily share his views, but he is a Jesuit and I 
respect him greatly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take a close look at the definition of “federal property”. It 
might be necessary to call in the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs, who understands everything even though he is not a 
Jesuit, because he is Jesus Himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsection (3) reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3) For the purposes of the definition “federal property” in 
subsection (1), federal property does not include

</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately for those who are not familiar with how this 
works, schedule II is not included. One must go to the library 
to get it, and even a member of parliament cannot get it for 
free. The government has decided to save money. For some time 
now, we have had to pay to get the schedules of an act or the 
model law, the original act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever on the lookout for savings, the Minister of Finance has now 
arranged it so that parliamentarians who want to do their jobs 
and research must now pay for the bills they have to debate, 
unless they get lucky and the act is revamped.  Then the bills 
would appear on our desks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those wondering about schedule II will have to make a trip to 
the library.  Maybe they will have it and maybe they will no 
longer have it.  I cannot say.  I continue with my quote: 
<UL><UL>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not all municipalities in Canada are able to call on a legal 
department to explain the difference between a taxable and a 
non-taxable federal property.  Do those obsessed with clarity 
know whether or not the port of Montreal is a taxable federal 
property?  I could not find out from the authorities who 
presented this to the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, when services are brought into our municipalities, 
when pipes, cables, gas lines and so forth are put in, generally 
both sides of the street are asked to pay half. But when it is 
the federal government across the street, it does not pay its 
share. 
So any owner across the street from the federal government is 
stuck, and has to foot the whole bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that government buildings or structures are rarely small 
24 by 40 bungalows or one and a half story houses on a 60 by 100 
lot.  They are huge.  National parks, for example, are immensely 
huge.  Imagine the cost for the people of Quebec City or 
Montreal who have to pay when pipes are laid, streets are paved 
and sidewalks are laid in front of a federal building.  They 
cannot say at the moment whether the Plains of Abraham in Quebec 
City, the port of Montreal or the airports in Sept-Îles, Goose 
Bay, Newfoundland or elsewhere are also included, and whether 
the government will pay taxes for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is beautiful Fort Chambly built in my riding under French 
rule.  For my friends opposite, who insist on clarity, I will be 
clear. 
In 1601, Champlain had been up what was called at the time 
Rivière aux Iroquois and is now called Rivière Richelieu, the 
Richelieu River, and had slept at Chambly.  He had a 
premonition.  He must surely have known that one fine day there 
would be a member of parliament for Chambly who would defend the 
people of Chambly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> And the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> And the people of Quebec, naturally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Champlain had gone as far as Lake Champlain, one of the great 
lakes, which is now in the United States, unfortunately.  The 
irony of it is the fact that Hudson, who had started from the 
other end, nearly met Champlain in the same period.  They missed 
each other by 60 kilometres.  Some were discovering from the 
south, Champlain was doing his discovering from north to south, 
and they almost met on Lake Champlain.  I know that not many of 
those opposite are aware of this, but for us in the Bloc 
Quebecois, this is a fact of history everyone knows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do these people not know the history of Quebec, they 
also do not know the problems of the municipalities, which are 
having to cope with all sorts of economic imperatives and are 
sweating blood trying to make ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has laid hands on the employment 
insurance fund, and has managed without any scruples to get 
billions of dollars away from poor folk.  I am thinking of the 
fishers in the maritimes and Quebec, the people of my native 
Gaspé.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are in dire straits because of the decision by those in 
charge of Human Resources Development Canada, under the 
leadership of this heartless government, to make use of the 
employment insurance fund for its own purposes.  They decided to 
use all the billions of dollars the fund generates to carry out 
partisan politics and to do my colleague, the honourable member 
for Rosemont, out of a considerable sum, in favour of the Prime 
Minister of Canada who represents the riding of Saint-Maurice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know. Madam Speaker, that my statements may be disturbing to 
you, but you also realize they are the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel:</B> They want to put a tax on shrimp. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> My colleague from Matapédia—Matane tells me 
that the only thing left to tax is shrimp and I am pretty sure 
they are going to do that too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At some point in one's life, however, there has to be a minimum 
of scruples.  It is all very well to attack widows, orphans and 
the poor. Unemployment has never been attacked.  The unemployed 
have been attacked instead.  The poor people have been attacked 
instead.  That is the history of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now it is gloating over billions of dollars. In a few days, on 
Monday, February 28, the Minister of Finance will bring down his 
budget. He will be wearing his new shoes and a flower on his 
lapel, and he will tell us that things are going great, when in 
fact he got his surpluses by literally robbing taxpayers, by 
taxing them indirectly under the cover of employment insurance 
contributions and other things. The minister did not have the 
courage to tax directly, as the previous government did, and I 
recognize that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it came to taxes, the previous government knew where to 
collect them and it called them taxes. This government dips into 
the employment insurance fund. It takes out as much as it 
possibly can, to the tune of $24 billion or $25 billion 
annually. It reduces transfers to the provinces. Things are not 
going well in hospitals, both in Quebec and elsewhere, because 
of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> The GST and employment insurance brought in 
$50 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> The hon. member for Chicoutimi tells me that 
the government took $50 billion through all sorts of schemes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have reasons to be concerned about Bill C-10, considering the 
exorbitant discretionary powers that the minister wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party knows that municipalities have needs, and the Liberal 
Party knows that too. The Liberals are putting the pressure on 
us. They are asking for the unanimous consent of the House to 
pass this bill by 1.30 p.m. on Friday. They want this bill to be 
deemed to have been passed without any debate, because 
municipalities have been asking for this legislation. They are 
holding the municipalities by the throat. They introduced this 
bill in mid-October. They fooled around a bit with it in 
committee. Then, at the last minute, they say “Hurry, the 
municipalities want this bill. You must adopt it without any 
discussion”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were member of a municipal government, I would worry 
because there is absolutely no guarantee that everybody will get 
their due when discretionary powers are used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can no longer 
trust Liberal ministers anymore because, they act just like the 
highwaymen of the last century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois made suggestions and proposed amendments. If 
I remember well, we introduced more than 50 amendments. They 
were all rejected by the liberals because they had just defined 
the discretionary power they wanted to be able to help 
themselves to other people's money. That is what we wanted to 
avoid, but they rejected all our suggestions, and I understand 
why.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the Bloc is disappointed and I assume that my 
colleagues from the Conservative Party are also. We demand more 
transparency in the management of the public's business, but the 
more we ask, the less we get. Everyday during question period we 
hear real horror stories like the shifting of funds from 
Rosemont to Saint-Maurice. If I were the former minister 
responsible I would not laugh like the hon. member opposite is 
doing right now. It is no laughing matter; it is rather sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that when we asked this individual, during Oral 
Question Period, to explain what was going on, he answered that 
42% of workers who contribute to EI are entitled to EI benefits. 
He was the link between the officials of his department and 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He never monitored anything, and went down the wrong way on a 
one way street, as they say. In the meantime, he got it in the 
teeth because his officials were doing things behind his back. 
Maybe, as he was here trying to defend his department and good 
management, the Prime Minister was plotting behind his back. If 
I were him, I would not be bragging today. The same thing is 
going to happen to the minister in charge now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want more transparency, they want to limit 
discretionary powers as much as possible, they want them to be 
monitored and checked. But it is not in the bill. 
The bill says “The Minister may”, “If the Minister is of the 
opinion that”, “in the opinion of the Minister”. When a minister 
is made to think, it gets very expensive for those who never 
asked him to think in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is dangerous. When a minister thinks, he often spends money 
too. And who gets to foot the bill? The unemployed workers once 
again, because there is only one continuous source of money, 
namely the EI fund. Therefore, it is the working poor—who do not 
have the time to watch the debates, who watch the news once in a 
while, and see the scandals that are happening, the poor people 
who are working hard to eke out a living and pay their taxes—who 
will foot the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, the Prime Minister and the minister are rolling 
in it like piglets in the trough, because it is somebody else's 
money. It is sad but true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are therefore going to support this bill so as not to 
penalize the municipalities.  They are entitled to the respect 
of the opposition and of all parties.  We on this side of the 
House, the combined opposition parties, are almost alone in 
respecting organizations or people.  Members opposite have no 
respect for anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We respect the municipalities and will support the bill before 
us, but not with any enthusiasm.  We will support it because the 
government members have the municipalities by the throat and are 
threatening not to give them one red cent until the opposition 
agrees to pass the bill.  So we are giving our approval, but 
reluctantly, not because it is a good bill that would be to the 
credit of the government opposite.  It is a bad bill that the 
municipalities are forced to go along with and that the 
opposition parties are forced to support so as not to penalize 
the municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order. 
Unless I am mistaken, at 5.30 p.m. we must proceed to other 
business.  You have the power to declare the clock as showing 
one minute later than it actually is and I therefore ask you to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I think the hon. member is

see that the clock now shows 5.30 p.m.

my private member's Bill C-229, an act to amend the Canada Post 
Corporation Act regarding a letter that cannot be transmitted by 
post.  Bill C-229 was first introduced in the House during the 
first session of the 36th Parliament by my colleague from 
Burlington, Ontario.  At that time it was known as Bill C-409. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current bill, Bill C-229, addresses an extremely important 
issue, the delivery of scratch and win cards.  In responding to 
this issue I have heard from many Canadians and many members of 
the House who have supported my efforts in the subject matter of 
the bill.  I would also like to note that the bill was reviewed 
by members of every party in the House and was deemed significant 
enough to Canadians to be deemed votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-229 ensures that Canada Post Corporation does not deliver 
contests, lotteries or prizes that require individuals to pay out 
before they collect a prize.  The bill is about Canada Post's 
obligation to deliver responsible and ethical mail.  It is 
important to stress that Bill C-229 would not prohibit Canada 
Post from delivering invitations to participate in contests or 
games, but only those that cost the participants to enter before 
they collect a prize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-229 also requires that Canada Post not deliver mail that 
displays any logo which mimics the federal government logo. These 
logos are designed to deceive the recipient into believing that 
the mail is legitimate, that it is being sent to them by the 
Government of Canada.  My legislation would provide for a 
company, if found guilty of an offence, to receive an initial 
fine of $5,000.  For subsequent offences it would receive fines 
up to $20,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Telemarketing and mail scams have become so rampant within 
Canada and our society that an organization such as PhoneBusters 
now exists to address these scams.  The statistics of 
PhoneBusters suggest that between 1996 and 1999 Canadians over 
the age of 60 had lost a total of $23 million.  This represents 
81% of the total moneys lost by Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>PhoneBusters also report that the third most common method used 
to cheat Canadians out of their money is the use of 1-900 
numbers.  The cards indicate an all winners hotline at 
1-900—whatever, for prize claim instructions.  Callers are 
baited into staying on the line and following through a number of 
instructions while in the meantime the cost of the call goes up 
and up.  As a matter of fact, in the case I have referenced in my 
own riding the 1-900 number costs $19.99 per minute.  This 
information is written in very little print on the flip side of 
the game card.  Many do not realize that the 1-900 number is not 
a toll-free number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion it is unacceptable that government corporations 
deliver these cards.  Scam Block, a local education group that 
visits with seniors, wrote to me in support of the bill.  It 
stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seniors often remark at our presentations that opportunities to 
win can't be fraudulent if they are delivered by Canada Post. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seniors truly believe that our government would never allow a 
crown corporation like Canada Post to put income above the needs 
and the best interest of its citizens.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stress to members of the House that the majority of Canadians 
affected by this issue are senior citizens.  For seniors, being 
able to shop by phone and mail is a necessity.  Unethical 
telemarketing practices affect the confidence of seniors who rely 
on using mail and phone to do their business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a responsibility to consumers.  The government has taken 
some action on this matter, but it does not go far enough. Merely 
to advise consumers on how to respond to cards does not prevent 
the financial loss that many Canadians have incurred. The 
legislation requires the government to proactively respond to 
this important consumer issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This summer I had the occasion to talk to CBC reporters across 
Canada as they followed this piece of legislation.  One of the 
announcers talked about having to hire a lawyer to protect his 
father, a senior citizen, who through telemarketing fraud and 
mail scams had lost all his income and savings on which he relied 
to live.  It is an important issue for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this type of situation that the legislation would prevent. 
Scratch and win game cards are deceptive.  As legislators we must 
take the responsibility and act in the best interest of 
Canadians.  That is why I fully support the amendment that will 
be put by the hon. member for Kelowna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on all members of the House to support this matter as a 
non-partisan issue that impacts on all Canadians.  The proposed 
amendments will protect Canadian consumers from losing their 
money daily to those sophisticated criminals by ensuring that 
Bill C-229 is proclaimed into law.  I am confident that the bill 
will help reduce the victimization of residents across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully support the bill.  I hope all members of the House 
support the legislation which will protect consumers and which is 
good for Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
a privilege to participate in the debate on Bill C-229 moved by 
the hon. member for Kitchener Centre.  The intent of the bill is 
noteworthy.  She should be commended for presenting the 
legislation to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I believe there is a better venue for moving the bill 
along a bit faster than would be the case if it went through the 
route of a private member's bill.  Therefore, I move, seconded by 
the hon. member for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar: 
<A NAME="LINK179">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all of the words after the 
word “That” and substituting the following therefor: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-229, an act to amend the Canada Post Corporation Act 
(letter that cannot be transmitted by post), be not now read a 
second time but that the order be discharged, the bill withdrawn 
and the subject matter thereof referred to the Standing Committee 
on Industry, and the committee address the issue no later than 
May 1, 2000. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The amendment is in 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will address the 
content of the bill and the amendment in particular.  The reason 
for the amendment is that I think there is a very strong ability 
on the part of the industry committee to deal with the bill in 
the context of the Competition Act that is law in Canada today. 
Therefore I will divide my analysis of the bill and the amendment 
pertaining thereto by distinguishing between mail and 
telemarketing. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1740"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overriding concern, and I commend the hon. member for her 
work in this regard, is the preoccupation and the desire to 
protect consumers.  I only wish that other members of the 
governing party would support and protect the taxpayers of Canada 
and would be as judicious in protecting the way taxpayer money is 
spent as the hon. member now wants the consumer to be protected 
from certain unscrupulous marketers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize the fact this kind of thinking is very much in line 
in its outlook with both compassionate and humanitarian thinking. 
It is also very justice oriented in the sense that it brings to 
justice people who would take unfair advantage of unsuspecting 
people.   In particular I draw attention to the provisions of the 
Competition Act which deal directly with the subject matter of 
the bill.  I refer to subsection 52(1) of the Competition Act 
which is pertinent to this subject.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No person shall, for the purpose of promoting, directly or 
indirectly, the supply or use of a product or for the purpose 
promoting, directly or indirectly, any business interest, by any 
means whatever, knowingly or recklessly make a representation to 
the public that is false or misleading in a material respect. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is being addressed here is very clear.  It is significant 
that we use the existing legislation to its maximum extent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes beyond that.  The hon. member made a point about 
telemarketing.  The example she gave about seniors being the 
group that is very often targeted and very susceptible to being 
abused by reckless or sometimes unscrupulous marketers is very 
true.  In this connection I will read into the record the 
provisions of the Competition Act dealing specifically with 
telemarketing.  The pertinent subsection is 52.1(1) which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this section, “telemarketing” means the practice of using 
interactive telephone communications for the purpose of 
promoting, directly or indirectly, the supply or use of a product 
or for the purpose of promoting, directly or indirectly, any 
business interest. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the business interests is to get some kind of a benefit 
or a prize of some kind by using the telephone.  First of all 
they send a card or something saying that they must phone in 
order to collect their prize or to get the product.  Then they 
use the persuasiveness of the voice and the persuasiveness of 
their personality reflected in the voice to get them to part with 
their money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill presented by the hon. member has a fine of $5,000 
rising to a maximum of $20,000.  The Competition Act is far more 
punishing than the bill.  I suggest there is a good reason it 
should be referred to the industry committee and the bill be 
withdrawn in its present form.  Subsection 52.1(9) states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any person who contravenes subsection (2) or (3) is guilty of an 
offence and liable 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) on conviction on indictment, to a fine in the discretion of 
the court or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, 
or to both; or 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding $200,000 or to 
the imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or to both. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who take unfair advantage of older unsuspecting people 
should be punished rather severely.  As a consequence of their 
illegal action I think they should be dealt with very severely, 
and I think the Competition Act does that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I think the bill is moving in the right direction, the 
amendment will do what the hon. member wants done more 
effectively, more efficiently and more readily.  Therefore I 
encourage all parties of the House to get together and support 
the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House should recognize that it began with the Liberal member 
acting as a private member supported by me and by a member of the 
NDP.  We have a really good triumvirate going here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise for the second time within half an hour, this time on Bill 
C-229. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great difficulty understanding the attitude of my Reform 
colleague.  This bill originates with a member from across the 
floor who is most certainly close to the elderly and other more 
vulnerable members of society.  The hon. member obviously wants 
to defend these people with her bill. CThis is something to be 
proud of, and I congratulate her for her initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people in our society may be rather easily misled. 
If they are approached with false representations, fake brands, 
fake images or other devious means, this is a reprehensible act. 
It may not be legally wrong under the Competition Act, but it 
is morally wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we need to support Bill C-229.  Its objective is to 
assist and protect those members of our society most in need of 
protection.  I have great difficulty, and always will have great 
difficulty, understanding the attitude of my friends in the 
Reform Party.  This is not the first time either.  The same 
thing has happened a number of times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last parliament, the member for Portneuf introduced 
an amendment to the Bankruptcy Act, so that when assets were 
being distributed in a bankruptcy, employees would have 
precedence over the banks, and the wealthy. 
To my great surprise, Reform Party members voted unanimously 
against that proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember another instance. We wanted to limit the penalty 
imposed for getting out of a mortgage to three months interest. 
Nowadays, things go so fast that the mortgage lender who is paid 
back before the end of the term of a mortgage hardly suffers any 
prejudice, since capital funds are so mobile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yours truly had proposed that the penalty that can be imposed by 
a financial institution be limited to three months interest. 
Again, contrary to all expectations—I did not understand then and 
I still do not understand now, three or four years later—the 
Reform Party voted against that proposal. 
It is as though the western Canadians, whom they represent, were 
all very rich and happy to pay penalties when they pay back a 
loan for farm machinery, or the mortgage on a silo, a house or a 
barn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this far right attitude that makes these people difficult 
to understand. We have a duty to protect the most disadvantaged, 
those who are most likely to be affected by illegal marketing, 
ploys and schemes. Again, I find it hard to understand the 
Reform Party's attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers seem to think “It is a free for all. If someone 
succeeds in fooling an elderly person, so be it. These are the 
rules of the game, the rules of commercial competition”. But 
what about ethics? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that they are forgetting something important, commercial 
ethics.  It is a question of what is right.  It is not my 
intention to say that the Reform Party members lack moral 
standards, although they seem shy about expressing them here. 
Yet this is the perfect place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must congratulate the member who introduced this bill on her 
initiative.  I hope that she will be able to introduce others in 
future for our consideration.  If they are like this one, it 
augurs well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are parliamentarians on both sides of the House who 
respect their fellow citizens and are concerned about their 
well-being and who introduce bills that reflect this. 
It is not easy to get a private member's bill this far. 
Sometimes, it takes the signatures of 100 other parliamentarians 
for a bill to be debatable and votable here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often political life throws us into various committees.  They 
are not the best place to make friends and it takes a lot of 
courage and nerve to go through the hoops anyway and approach 
people with whom one has sometimes had run-ins or “coltaillés” as 
we say in French.  The member for Matapédia—Matane will know what 
I mean by “coltaillé” as will the member for 
Stormont—Dundas—Charlottenburgh, who is also a francophone and 
knows our colourful expressions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes courage to approach members individually for their 
signature and sometimes to get them to set aside their petty 
grudges. 
But when members succeed at this, that shows respect for 
democracy and for their fellow human beings.  When one makes it 
through the procedure that the member embarked on and a bill 
gets this far, it is no longer the time to tear it apart and 
toss it into the wastebasket.  It is the time to debate it.  It 
is the time to recognize its merit.  It is the time to take the 
necessary action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not go on, but I congratulate the member.  She can count 
on my personal support and that of the Bloc Quebecois members, 
because her bill shows respect for the individual. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support my colleague from Kelowna in 
moving that the bill be withdrawn but that the subject matter be 
sent to the industry committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good procedure, as he has outlined it, as it will 
allow the committee to give this idea a very thorough perusal and 
bring it back under the auspices of the Competition Act.  This 
procedure would, if anything, enhance the bill brought forward by 
the member for Kitchener Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend and congratulate the hon. member for the obvious hard 
work she has done in bringing forward Bill C-229, an act to amend 
the Canada Post Corporation Act to prevent the delivery of 
certain mail that perpetrates telemarketing fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that another member introduced similar legislation about 
a year and a half ago which would ensure that the Canada Post 
Corporation would not deliver contest lotteries or prizes which 
would require individuals to pay before they collect the prize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would ensure that our beloved crown corporation is not 
used inadvertently as a tool to mislead consumers.  Specifically, 
it would prevent Canada Post from delivering mail which displays 
a logo that mimics in any way a federal government logo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that approximately 70% of telemarketing scam victims in 
1999 were over the age of 60.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer to the personal experience of an elderly 
person who was taken in by this kind of scam artistry and fraud 
artistry.  It was not a pretty sight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The person received mail indicating that she would be getting a 
prize if she made a phone call.  I want to make the point that 
often senior citizens are lonely and talking on the phone is 
therapeutic.  If we would call them more often it would be good 
for them.  When they make these kinds of calls and the clock is 
ticking, and they do not know it is a scam, it is a particularly 
cruel type of fraud that is perpetrated on our senior citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of this person, I do not know exactly, but she lost 
hundreds, perhaps thousands of dollars.  She was ashamed to tell 
her children and family members about what had happened.  These 
scams victimize people, most often the elderly, and for that they 
are particularly heinous crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to see a bill that will make it unlawful for the post 
office to be used as a delivery mechanism for scam mail.  The 
post office, like many other crown corporations, including the 
CBC, has a special place of trust in our minds and hearts.  It is 
particularly cruel when it is used for these sorts of devious 
ends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know from our labour critic and other people in our party that 
the people working for the post office, the mail workers and the 
letter carriers, are also concerned about this because they are 
the people who process this mail and they can see the ends to 
which it is being put.  We have been told that the people who 
work for the post office would like to see something which would 
make it unnecessary for them to have to deal with this sort of 
mail.  Many of them know people on their mail routes personally 
and are particularly concerned when they are victimized in this 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Association of Retired Persons has stated that its 
members are fully in support of the bill put forward by my hon. 
friend from Kitchener Centre.  The association wrote:  “With so 
many thousands of Canadians falling prey to unscrupulous persons 
who use the mail to facilitate illegal activities, it is vital 
that legislation be passed which will prevent them from doing so 
and will punish them if they persist”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The organization known as PhoneBusters was mentioned earlier 
today.  Representatives of PhoneBusters are also in support of 
what they call crucial legislation which can be used successfully 
in the ongoing battle against telemarketing fraud.  They indicate 
that Canadian consumers have been losing money daily to these 
sophisticated criminals.  They also indicate that they are 
confident this bill would help reduce the victimization of 
residents across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the bill as it was put forward for many reasons which 
relate to its content.  It is very important to many Canadians, 
especially senior citizens.  I want to reiterate my support for 
the motion of my colleague from Kelowna to refer the bill to 
committee where it will get the kind of airing which it deserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I congratulate the member for Kitchener Centre for having 
introduced this legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to Bill C-229, which was put forward by my 
hon. friend, the member for Kitchener Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first offer my congratulations to her for taking up the 
torch on this important issue and for trying to find a solution 
to this problem so that consumers can be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the few minutes I have I would like to quickly review the 
problem with mail scam cards and why legislation is needed to ban 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I would like to talk about how this bill would help 
address this problem and how I think this bill could be 
strengthened to provide even more consumer protection against 
mail fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I will talk about a private member's bill which I will 
be introducing shortly that is meant to supplement and strengthen 
this bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should mention that a lot of information I received on this 
file came from an organization called Phonebusters. It was 
started in 1993 by the Ontario Provincial Police, the RCMP, 
Canada Post, Industry Canada and a number of other partners. 
Phonebusters is a national deceptive telemarketing call centre 
that collects complaints from throughout Canada on telemarketing 
deception and fraud and passes the information onto local police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it began collecting data on mail fraud in 1995, it has had 
2,031 complaints about scratch and win game cards sent through 
the mail. The game cards, or scam cards as I like to call them, 
invite the recipient to scratch off a box to see if he or she has 
won a prize which the card claims can be anything from a colour 
print up to $5,000 in cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deceptive thing about these cards is that every one is a 
winner. There are no losing cards but in order to collect a prize 
a person must call a 1-900 number.  Of course, those who call the 
number get a phone bill in the range of $20 to $30 and in one 
instance for $158. The consumer either receives no prize at all 
or an item of very small value.  A value of $3 is typical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Especially troubling to me is that 60% of the victims of the 
mail scams are senior citizens.  From 1996 to 1999 seniors lost 
$20 million from the scam cards.  That was out of a total of $29 
million lost by all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Existing legislation offers only limited protection at best. 
Under the misleading advertising provisions of the Competition 
Act persons who perpetrate this kind of fraud are seldom 
prosecuted and rarely if ever jailed.  Even then the sentences 
are light and average two to six months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example in a prosecution involving Cave Promotions Ltd. last 
October, the company received a fine and prohibition order but 
none of the people who ran the company were punished, fined or 
sent to jail.  There was nothing to prevent the perpetrators from 
closing down the company, finding a new partner and opening for 
business the very next day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By comparison, the United States has an unlawful mail matter law 
that prevents scam cards from being delivered by the U.S. postal 
service.  Telemarketing fraud is treated as a serious crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-229 is an important step in helping to protect Canadian 
consumers from becoming victims of these types of mail fraud. The 
bill introduces changes to the Canada Post Corporation Act to 
prohibit the post office from delivering a game card or similar 
item that is not in an envelope where the recipient is invited to 
participate in a game of chance but must first pay a sum of money 
or incur telephone charges in order to collect a prize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an appropriate measure to take in order to reduce mail 
fraud. Canada Post has a monopoly on mail delivery and as a crown 
corporation occupies a unique position of trust in the minds of 
Canadian consumers.  Bill C-229 is an honourable piece of 
legislation and my friend the member for Kitchener Centre 
deserves our praise for advancing this cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I prepared for the debate on this bill, and as I consulted 
with Canada Post, I learned that Canada Post accounts for only 
20% of the ad mail which is frequently called junk mail.  If Bill 
C-229 passes we will prevent scam cards from being delivered in 
the mail, but that potentially still leaves 80% of the problem 
unresolved. One could argue that if we shut down the post office 
as a delivery system for the perpetrators of these scams, they 
will simply switch to other private delivery firms and we will 
not have slowed down these mail scams one bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have before us is good legislation that is well 
intentioned but nevertheless it has a sizeable loophole.  Upon 
discovering this loophole I undertook to meet with the member for 
Kitchener Centre to discuss different options on how to close 
this loophole so that all Canadian consumers would be protected 
from scratch and win game card mail scams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My goal was essentially to build on her efforts and to extend 
the prohibition of the delivery of these game cards to include 
all organizations, not just Canada Post. We looked at the 
possibility of amending Bill C-229 but learned that in order to 
make this an all inclusive bill would require passing amendments 
to either the criminal code or the Competition Act which would be 
outside the scope of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After further consultation, I decided that the best way to 
accomplish this would be to draft another private member's bill 
that would use changes to the Competition Act to establish 
legislative protection for consumers against all forms of mail 
scam cards regardless of who delivers them. 
That bill has now been drafted and it is my intention to 
introduce it in the House very shortly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I briefed my caucus colleagues this morning on the bill. I am 
happy to say that they are in full support of my efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also consulted with the member for Kitchener Centre on 
this bill and she is supportive and wants us to continue to work 
together to achieve our common goals in putting an end to this 
type of mail fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill uses a similar approach to that of Bill C-229 which is 
before us today.  As I stated, my bill would amend the 
Competition Act so that no person can deliver or have someone 
deliver on their behalf a game of chance that conveys the 
impression that the recipient has won a prize, but the awarding 
of that prize is contingent upon the prior payment of money or 
the incurring of telephone charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill would make any company liable for an offence of this 
sort committed by one of its employees.  It would also hold 
liable the officers and directors of any company found guilty of 
such an offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any person who commits an offence under this legislation would 
be liable for a fine of up to $200,000 or imprisonment of up to 
one year on summary conviction.  For conviction on indictment, 
imprisonment could be up to five years and a fine to be set by 
the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with these consequences, I am confident that the measures 
outlined in my bill together with the bill before us today will 
help put an end to the type of mail fraud we have seen with the 
scratch and win game cards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to thank again my friend from Kitchener 
Centre for the work she has done to advance this issue.  I also 
want to thank her for working with me and for providing 
information and advice on both her legislation and mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to working with members from all parties to put 
an end to these fraudulent practices.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, about a year ago an elderly woman in her seventies came 
into my office accompanied by two other women of about the same 
age.  I will call her Mabel, if you will, Mr. Speaker.  She is 
about five feet high, I would say in her late seventies and she 
is a widow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She came in carrying two plastic bags full of envelopes.  Her 
friends were carrying plastic bags full of envelopes as well. 
They spilled all this down on the desk in my office which created 
a huge heap of really beautiful flashy envelopes.  They were all 
contest envelopes.  There were all kinds of contests involved: 
scratch and win contests; contests whereby if one purchases a 
book one has a chance at a million dollar lottery or cruises 
around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem was, as the two other ladies explained, that Mabel 
had been participating in these contests for some years.  In fact 
she was spending about $4,000 a month participating in these 
various fundraising efforts, all for various kinds of prizes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said to her that it was a lot of money for someone on her own 
and I asked her why she was doing this.  She said, “Since my 
husband died I am trying to do things for my grandchildren 
because we never had a lot of money and there is always just a 
chance, just a very bare chance, that I might win and I will have 
such a wonderful thing to give to my grandchildren”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem was that her two other friends who lived, shall we 
say, in a very modest high rise, were of course scandalized, but 
they could never persuade Mabel that these were actual scams and 
that she was being taken advantage of.  They had hoped by coming 
to me, because I have the title of member of parliament, that I 
could somehow persuade Mabel not to continue doing this. I did 
try my best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to tell the House that Mabel did say that she would no 
longer do this and she listened to me.  About six months later 
the same friends came in and explained that Mabel was still doing 
it and they were really in despair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the meanest kind of activity that I can imagine where 
people deliberately take advantage of people who are vulnerable 
and perhaps no longer have the ability to make the kinds of 
decisions that the rest of us would make, and they are also 
essentially poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-229 introduced by the member for Kitchener Centre 
addresses directly I think a cruel problem that everyone in 
society who knows of senior citizens who are vulnerable would 
want to see fixed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the government passed an excellent bill amending the 
Competition Act that was targeted on telemarketing and raised 
very appropriately the fines and penalties for people who carry 
out fraudulent or false fundraising and take advantage of people 
like this. But the competition bill had a big flaw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I sorted through the pile of envelopes soliciting money 
from Mabel asking her to participate in these contests for these 
great prizes, half of them came from the United States.  There is 
nothing in the Competition Act that enables us to stop this type 
of thing flowing across the border and taking advantage of senior 
citizens like Mabel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know all the implications of this legislation and how 
it would be enforced with Canada Post or indeed whether it is 
possible to enact legislation that prevents Canada Post from 
passing on this type of literature, this type of mail 
solicitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, Mr. Speaker, if it is at all possible, then I think the 
industry committee should consider this issue very thoroughly and 
make a recommendation so that we can solve this problem once and 
for all and stop these people in the United States and elsewhere 
in Canada from taking advantage of some of the most vulnerable 
people in Canadian society.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like an answer to a question I asked in the House last 
Thursday.  I suggested that the Prime Minister, who is the 
captain of his own ship, was the one who should set the standards 
for the HRDC grants.  This goes right back to the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also suggested that the minister had announced grants before 
they were approved and before the applications even existed.  I 
did not get an answer from the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.  In fact, her response had nothing to do with what I 
had asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So that there is no confusion or illusion on what I am asking, I 
will be very specific in my question today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 13, 1997, $6,000 was awarded to the auberge inn in the 
Prime Minister's riding of Shawinigan.  This money was first 
announced under the targeted wage subsidy program.  However, for 
some strange reason, it was moved to the transitional jobs fund 
program.  The hotel project owner, Mr. Pierre Thibault, claimed 
that he needed the money immediately and could not wait for wage 
subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned in my question on February 10, the $6,000 grant 
was announced without any departmental paperwork.  In fact, it 
was advertised in the Prime Minister's householder flyer of April 
1997, the month that the federal election was called.  There was 
no paperwork yet this grant was approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 16, 1999 the Reform Party revealed memos that the 
Prime Minister's office had no choice but to approve the grant 
because the Prime Minister had already “personally promised” 
the money to Mr. Thibault.  The Prime Minister had made a promise 
of an HRDC grant to a man who bought the hotel that the Prime 
Minister had previously owned.  The Prime Minister made the grant 
announcement at a media conference even though no paperwork had 
been done.  The project did not even meet the regional Quebec 
transitional jobs fund guidelines, which ban funding for 
restaurant and bar positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggested in question period on February 10 that it was 
painfully obvious that the mess we are in today, the HRDC billion 
dollar boondoggle and the lack of paperwork and approvals of four 
projects worth billions of taxpayer dollars, was started by the 
captain of the ship, the Prime Minister, when grants were given 
to his riding of Shawinigan.  He set the standard for this.  He 
clearly pushed through grant moneys to help someone with whom he 
had business dealings, Mr. Thibault, and to help create so-called 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to again ask this question.  If it is the captain of the 
ship who sets the standards for his crew, it is painfully obvious 
that the mess we are in today started in Shawinigan.  Is that why 
the Prime Minister is so desperate to keep his first mate, the 
minister responsible for Human Resources Development, afloat?  Is 
the Prime Minister attempting to prop up the HRDC minister?

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the buck stops at the Prime Minister's own doorstep. 
The Prime Minister has set the standard for the the whole 
bureaucracy and everything that has happened.  How can he expect 
anything different from the rest of his cabinet?  It is his 
example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this what is going on?  Is this why the Prime Minister is so 
desperate to protect his first mate and not do anything proactive 
to give back some confidence back to the Canadian taxpayers? 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with 
the member opposite on one point and disagree with him on all the 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is right.  The Prime Minister does set the standards in this 
government.  That is why there are more internal audits done now 
on the Hill than ever before in the history of the country.  Why? 
It is in order that we improve government performance across all 
departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The programs that were audited in the internal audit of HRDC are 
important to Canadians because it helps thousands each year.  Yet 
the member opposite and all the members of his party seem more 
interested in discrediting these programs than in seeking to 
improve them.  That is because they do not believe in these kinds 
of programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is taking responsibility for this situation and 
we are fixing the problem.  Let us remember that it was an 
internal audit, part of the department's own checks and balances. 
It never said that money was missing and it never said that money 
was wasted.  It can account for this money.  The member will see 
this if he takes the time to review the lists released by the 
minister on February 21. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is simply both pessimistic and cynical to assume, as do the 
Reformers, that Canadian employers, educational institutions and 
non-profit groups try to take advantage of government largesse. I 
have more faith in the people of Canada than he does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These programs work.  While the Reformers are keen to focus on 
the internal audit of administration, they conveniently ignore 
separate evaluations of results.  These results demonstrate that 
the programs help Canadians.  For example, a 1998 evaluation by 
Ekos Research Associates Inc. indicates: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The level of job creation fostered by the program is largely 
consistent with targets provided by sponsors in their contracts 
with HRDC. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's remedial plan incorporates advice from the 
auditor general, Deloitte & Touche and the Standards Advisory 
Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>HRDC is correcting its files and fixing everything it can find 
that is wrong.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
prior to the Christmas break, I had the opportunity to ask the 
minister of agriculture about putting cash in the hands of needy 
farmers.  Obviously, he did not say too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be very clear that the situation in which many farmers 
find themselves is really not their fault.  The current crisis is 
precipitated by two things:  one, the weather, which is really 
out of the control of farmers; and two, the low commodity prices, 
which is also out of their control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one in the country can accuse the Canadian farmer of being 
inefficient.  Canadian farmers are the leaders in the world on 
efficiency and their plight is not due to the lack of efficiency 
or diversification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Dauphin—Swan River many farmers are on the 
brink of going broke.  A portion of them were hit with an 
overabundance of moisture this past spring.  Many are struggling 
because of the poor prices they have received over the last 
couple of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, as a country, as a farming community, cannot compete with 
the Europeans and Americans who support their farmers with very 
large subsidies.  Farm subsidies today are staggering for 
European farmers who receive 56 cents out of every dollar. 
American farmers receive 39 cents out of every dollar.  Canadian 
farmers, often accused of asking for subsidies, really receive 
very small subsidies.  Today they receive 9 cents on the dollar.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, Canadian farmers do not want a subsidy.  They just want 
fair prices for their product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The American president does not think twice about helping his 
farmers in the United States.  It is unfortunate that Canada will 
not stand for its farmers.  They are our sole source of food, 
which is essential to this country.  What is more important than 
to ensure a secure supply of food? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian farmers do not want a subsidy, as I have indicated. 
They only want a fair price for what they produce.  They also 
want to control what they produce.  The Canadian Wheat Board must 
change with the times and become more flexible.  Today Canadian 
farmers are receiving 1932 wheat prices.  How can we expect 
anyone farming in 1999-2000 to survive at 1932 cash receipts for 
their product?  At $2.57 a bushel, farmers cannot even think of 
recovering the input costs for their crop, let alone try to make 
a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past year many farmers have knocked on the doors of my 
constituency offices looking for solutions and asking what the 
federal government is going to do to help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two solutions:  long term and short term.  A short 
term solution is needed today.  Many of our farmers in Manitoba 
will be leaving the farms if there is no short term assistance. 
In Manitoba there are over 24,000 farm families and many of them 
will be at risk.  What is lacking is cash.  That is what farmers 
need in the short term.  They need help.  The Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food must find a vehicle to put cash into 
the hands of farmers before this spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not get hung up on the long term solutions.  We all know 
they are important, but farmers need help right now.  They are 
crying out for help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I advocated to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food to put 
in place a crop acreage reduction program.  This vehicle is 
already in place.  It is called the PFRA.  In fact, in the 1980s 
the PFRA, through a crop reduction program, took two million 
acres out of production and put $200 million into the hands of 
needy farmers.  There is no reason this cannot be done again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This farm disaster has had a large impact, not only on farmers, 
but also on small town Canada.  As a country, do we want to 
decimate our rural culture?  We are a country which is proud of 
its cultures, both urban and rural. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
abundantly clear that the federal government recognizes the 
importance of the agricultural sector and the significant 
hardships faced by farmers.  This is one of the reasons for our 
long history of support programs and continuing efforts to help 
farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Dauphin—Swan River knows well, the 
federal government contributes $600 million annually for support 
programs such as crop insurance, NISA and companion programs. 
However, the severe economic problems led to numerous 
improvements to existing programs and the establishment of AIDA, 
with a federal commitment of nearly $1.1 billion for the 1998 and 
1999 crop years.  These measures are helping farmers cope with 
the current difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast to the hon. member's comments, AIDA has been of 
benefit to thousands of farmers in the prairies and many others 
across the country.  AIDA has already paid out nearly $500 
million for the 1998 crop year alone, with roughly half of that 
amount going to the prairies.  Further, we expect that the 
balance of federal-provincial AIDA funding will be spent once 
1999 applications are processed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the next two crop years, we recently announced 
an additional injection of $1 billion, increasing the federal 
government's contribution to $2.2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members may rest assured that the federal government will 
continue to work closely with provincial governments, and we are 
working closely with provincial governments to ensure that 
sufficient disaster assistance is provided in the most timely 
manner possible.
