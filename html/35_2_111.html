	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of the House, the government should consider strengthening 
penalties in those sections of the Criminal Code which deal with impaired driving 
offences in order to: (a) enhance deterrence; and (b) bring the penalties into line with 
the seriousness of the offence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to lead off the debate on this 
very important Motion No. 78.
<P>
	I was also pleased to take part in the kick off for the red ribbon 
campaign by the Mothers Against Drunk Drivers which occurred 
on Parliament Hill over the weekend. This campaign involves tying 
red ribbons around the antennas of vehicles through the holiday 
season to tell people that they should not drink and drive and to 
publicize the epidemic in this country of drinking and driving.
<P>
	Last year MADD Canada distributed over three million red 
ribbons to tell people about the hazards and the consequences of 
drinking and driving. This year they expect and hope to have a red 
ribbon on every single antenna of every single car in Canada. I 
absolutely support that and I will do whatever I can to promote it.
<P>
	September 19 was the last time I spoke in the House on the 
important issue of impaired driving. That was the third and final 
hour of debate on my Bill C-201. The bill would have established 
minimum sentencing and stronger deterrents against impaired 
driving in particular to deal with people who choose to drink and 
drive and as a result kill. Unfortunately, Bill C-201 was narrowly 
defeated in this House by 31 votes, with the help of the Bloc 
members almost all of whom voted against it, and with the help of 
many of the Liberal members who voted against this bill.
<P>
	I did receive support from some of the Liberal backbenchers, 
from numerous NGOs, including MADD Canada, and tens of 
thousands of Canadians across the country. Despite the defeat of 
Bill C-201, this support has only strengthened my resolve to push 
forward to ensure that some day the federal government will take 
the lead in developing measures to combat impaired driving in this 
country.
<P>
	Once again I remind members of the Liberal Party opposite that 
this issue transcends all political lines. It is an issue that is so 
important in the minds of Canadians yet Liberal government 
members refuse to grasp that. They play party politics with the 
lives of Canadians.
<P>
	I would like to thank the Liberal members who did support Bill 
C-201. On behalf of hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions of 
Canadians who are keenly interested in this issue, I know that their 
appreciation has been shown as well.
<P>
	For those Liberal and Bloc members who opposed it, I sincerely 
hope on behalf of all of Canada's impaired driving victims that they 
see the value of Motion No. M-78. I hope that they see this as an 
opportunity to get into real and positive debate on the issue of 
impaired driving. I hope the comprehensive approach to impaired 
driving that Motion No. M-78 offers will give the Liberals some 
comfort zone that it will not go against their policy or philosophy 
of being soft on crime.
<P>
	We all have our own ideas of how to combat impaired driving. 
Motion No. M-78 gives the government, particularly the Minister 
of Justice, as well as the Bloc members the opportunity to discuss 
Motion No. M-78 in the justice committee setting. They could 
bring forward their ideas and witnesses would appear. It would 
bring this terrible, senseless and 100 per cent preventable crime to 
the forum that it deserves, the justice department of the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	Almost every province has taken action on this issue. Almost 
every province has taken steps to deal with the crime of impaired 
driving in a way that reflects the severity and epidemic state of this 
crime, but the Liberal government has refused to follow their lead. 
It is the very government that should be setting an example in being 
proactive on the issues which concern the Canadian people, but the 
Liberal government has refused to deal with impaired driving to 
treat the issue with the respect and seriousness it deserves.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6930"> 6930 </A></B>
<P>
	Ontario has recently followed the lead of many other provinces 
and introduced a 90-day roadside licence suspension. Other 
provinces have lowered the blood alcohol content for temporary 
suspensions and have established higher mandatory minimum 
licence suspensions for those convicted of impaired driving. Some 
provinces have set lower BAC limits for young drivers. Some will 
impound the vehicles of individuals who are caught while driving 
under suspension. These are positive steps, just a few of the efforts 
that have been put forward by some of the provinces.
<P>
	What does the federal Liberal government which should be the 
leader in this country do? It refuses to deal with the issue. What 
efforts have come from the Liberal government? None. Just 
opposition. What proposals have come from the Liberal 
government? None, even though it voted against Bill C-201.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	If the government had been seriously concerned about the issue 
of impaired driving, it could have brought forward its own 
proposals. I do not care whether it wants to take some sort of 
recognition for dealing with impaired driving and leave my bill on 
the sidelines. The issue is that the government has an obligation to 
the Canadian people to deal with this issue which is of great 
concern and it has refused.
<P>
	The pleas of victims of impaired drivers and their families have 
been met with opposition and silence from the Liberal government. 
In 1995, 1,650 Canadians were killed by impaired drivers. I 
understand that after my presentation the member for Halifax is 
going to stand up and tell us that is not important.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I would ask that 
the hon. member not anticipate my remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Halifax did in fact 
vote against Bill C-201. Therefore I assumed and probably 
correctly but we will wait to hear what she has to say, that she is 
going to oppose M-78 as well because the Liberal government 
members opposed Bill C-201. The member for Halifax in her duty 
does everything the Liberal government members tell her to do.
<P>
	The justice minister took no pains to move quickly to follow a 
personal agenda when he brought in gun control measures. He said 
that he wanted to fight crime because 196 people are murdered 
each year by firearms in the hands of criminals. We support the 
fighting of crime. And if that bill were effective, we need effective 
controls to keep guns out of the hands of criminals because gun 
deaths are no less a crime. However, considering that 196 people 
are killed each year in Canada at the hands of criminals who have 
firearms and considering that 1,650 people were killed last year by 
impaired drivers, I ask the question: What reasonable justice 
minister would fail to recognize the severity of the crime of 
impaired driving and the consequences? What reasonable thinking 
justice minister would fail to recognize that? The justice minister 
of the Liberal Government of Canada is the person who fails to 
recognize it.
<P>
	The Liberals are on the wrong track. They refuse to act on 
impaired driving. They prefer to follow their own agenda with 
useless and ineffective gun control legislation. They refuse to deal 
with a crime that killed over 1,600 people in this country last year.
<P>
	The Liberal government talks about promoting safety in our 
society. I say that the Liberal government is incapable of promoting 
community safety and it has shown it by refusing to move on the 
issue of impaired driving. It is the justice minister who is 
compromising community public safety by pursuing his personal 
agendas rather than dealing with the serious crime of impaired 
driving.
<P>
	I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice 
whether his government will take the time to deal with Motion 
M-78. He stated in his presentation on Bill C-201 that the justice 
committee was too busy to deal with Bill C-201. Motion M-78 
gives the Liberals an opportunity to deal with impaired driving in a 
far more comprehensive manner than Bill C-201 offered so let us 
give it that opportunity. Will the justice committee once again be 
too busy to deal with this serious crime?
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	Why is the government not doing everything possible? It is 
beyond me. Why is the government not doing everything possible 
to deal with impaired driving, which is at an epidemic stage? Why 
does the Liberal government continue to look on impaired driving 
as some sort of social ill? It is a crime to drink and drive in this 
country. It is a crime to make that choice, to get behind the wheel of 
your car when you are impaired. Certainly it is a crime when you 
kill or injure someone.
<P>
	Yet the Minister of Justice refuses to recognize that. He prefers 
to treat it as some sort of social ill, and that must stop.
<P>
	Why does the Minister of Justice have no initiatives whatsoever 
to deal with impaired driving in Canada? It is the number one cause 
of criminal death and injury in this country. Yet the Minister of 
Justice and the government members have refused to deal with it. 
Why? What do they have to say to the families of victims of 
impaired drivers?
<P>
	I support Mothers Against Drunk Drivers and the organization's 
recommendations that the blood alcohol content be lowered to .05 
and the two hour sampling time be extended or eliminated. I 
support that. I believe those caught driving while impaired should 
face higher fines, longer jail terms and licence suspensions.
<P>
	The Liberal members in opposition to my last bill said 
deterrence is not a factor here, that we cannot deter someone by 
threatening to impose a stiff sentence or a  stiff fine. I would say 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6931"> 6931 </A></B>
<P>
that of all the crimes in this country that are preventable by 
deterrence it is impaired driving.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you could go outside now and ask the first 100 
people you meet on the street why they prefer to take a taxi when 
they have been drinking, and the number one answer will be 
because they do not want to get caught. That is the number one 
answer.
<P>
	Why do they say that? They know there is a fine involved and a 
licence suspension. They do not want to get caught. It is not the fact 
that they do not think they can drive home all right, but they do not 
want to get caught. That is deterrence. If we stiffen up the fines, the 
licence suspensions and the jail terms in case of death or injury I 
know we are going to see a marked improvement in the statistics 
concerning impaired driving.
<P>
	As well, I support a two and a seven year minimum sentence 
respectively for those convicted of impaired driving causing bodily 
harm and impaired driving causing death. I believe we have to have 
sentences that reflect the severity of the crime.
<P>
	I believe that sentencing ranges are commensurate with the 
gravity of the crime and mirror the sentence available for those 
convicted of criminal negligence causing death. I believe we have 
to get tough with people who drink and drive.
<P>
	I am aware that changing the Criminal Code is not the silver 
bullet to end all impaired driving but it is important that this 
Liberal government show some leadership on this issue. It is 
important that it take an important step, but it is not the only step 
that needs to be taken. It has to examine the whole range in the 
Criminal Code that deals with impaired driving. It also has to look 
at rehabilitation for impaired drivers while they are in prison.
<P>
	Evidence suggests that the majority of impaired drivers have a 
problem with alcohol and have faced similar charges in the past. 
Statistics show that up to 70 per cent of the people who cause death 
and injury through impaired driving do have alcohol problems. 
Accordingly, and the Liberals are going to hate this one, the 
government should consider using its order in council powers to 
amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act to ensure that 
those serving time for impaired offence absolutely must 
successfully complete a rehabilitation program as a condition of 
parole.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	Some Liberals will stand up and say this is a human rights 
violation, that we cannot force anyone to get better, that we cannot 
force anyone to turn their life around. Tell that to the victims of 
impaired driving. Tell that to the families of the victims of 
impaired driving.
<P>
	The federal government should encourage the provinces to 
introduce random breathe tests. This would give the police the 
opportunity to make random stops and request the breath test 
without having to prove reasonable and justifiable cause. Members 
know that lawyers have a field day with the reasonable and 
justifiable cause section of the Criminal Code. However, areas that 
have introduced random breath testing have found a dramatic 
decrease in the incidence of impaired driving. That is because the 
chance of getting caught has been made even greater.
<P>
	At present some provincial forces do use random breath tests to 
deter and catch impaired drivers. As I said, research indicates that 
random breath testing has an effect on the number of impaired 
drivers.
<P>
	We must look at a whole range of measures in order to deal with 
the very serious issue of impaired driving. Motion No. 78 allows us 
to look at those measures. It allows government members, Bloc 
members, Reform members, NDP members and Conservative 
members to come together in the justice committee to seriously 
deal with the issue of impaired driving.
<P>
	The Liberal government must get away from its belief that 
impaired driving is some sort of social ill. It has to start looking at 
it as a serious crime. I look forward to the debate which will follow 
on this motion and I will listen with interest to the suggestions and 
recommendations that come from colleagues in this House.
<P>
	However, it is important to point something out which probably 
reflects the feeling of Liberal government members. The 
philosophy of some Liberals has been stated in a letter by the 
member for Simcoe North. He believes that this is some sort of 
political game. He believes that Reformers, I included, have 
grabbed this issue for some sort of political gamesmanship. I am 
saddened to see that comment in a letter.
<P>
	The member for Simcoe North also says that the federal 
government cannot dictate to the provinces how they should deal 
with impaired drivers. I know that some areas that deal with 
impaired driving are within provincial jurisdiction. But the fact is 
this Liberal government has to take some leadership on this issue. 
It is duty bound to take leadership. It should encourage the 
provinces to deal more effectively with impaired drivers.
<P>
	The member for Simcoe North also said in his letter: ``The issue 
is whether Motion No. 78 will be effective and appropriate 
measures to deal with the problem. I can't support them because of 
serious reservations which I have explained and substantiated''. 
Whatever they were.
<P>
	``One reservation is that these measures are based on the false 
premise that longer sentences lead to reduced repeat offences. The 
evidence simply doesn't support this view''.
<P>
	Longer sentences and mandatory rehabilitation will reduce this 
crime and I urge the members to deal with this.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6932"> 6932 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rex Crawford (Kent, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great 
pleasure to speak in complete support of Motion No. 78, that the 
government should consider strengthening penalties in those 
sections of the Criminal Code that deal with impaired driving 
offences. I am honoured to speak on this motion immediately after 
the mover, the hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley 
who gave an excellent speech. I have always been of the firm 
conviction that if it makes sense I will support it. This motion 
makes a lot of sense.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	I feel it is important to state that this issue goes beyond our party 
lines. The fact that this motion was introduced by the hon. member 
for Prince George-Bulkley Valley of the Reform Party, 
supposedly my opponent, has nothing whatsoever to do with the 
fact that strengthening penalties for those who commit an impaired 
driving offence is a good idea.
<P>
	I previously supported the hon. member's bill, Bill C-201, which 
called for amending the minimum sentence of seven years for 
impaired driving causing death. Although, unfortunately, that bill 
was narrowly defeated, I believe this motion will accomplish the 
same principle.
<P>
	Drunk driving is a very serious offence. It is high time that our 
courts have a tool to discipline and deter an offence which often 
ends in death. People, especially young people, are dying every day 
due to impaired driving and we have to try to stop it.
<P>
	Recently the Ontario government attempted to crack down on 
drunk driving offences by imposing an automatic 90 day licence 
suspension for drivers who blow over the legal alcohol limit or who 
refuse a breathalyser test. This is a step in the right direction, but it 
certainly does not go far enough. These drivers can easily appeal on 
the grounds of mistaken identity or the inability to give a breath 
sample for medical reasons. Besides that, a 90 day suspension is an 
administrative tool for the government and does not act as a real 
deterrent. We need to impose a sentence which will make an 
impaired driver think twice about getting behind the wheel after 
drinking alcohol.
<P>
	I come from a rural part of southwestern Ontario and I am sad to 
say that I often see the reality of impaired driving close to home. 
Where there is an absence of public transportation or taxi cabs, 
young and old alike will often get into their vehicles after a night 
out and attempt to drive the dark, back country roads. I am sad to 
say that I have often witnessed horrific accidents due to drunk 
driving right on the corner of my property. That is not to say this is 
exclusively a rural problem. Nevertheless, without any alternative 
form of transportation we have to send a clear message to people in 
rural Canada that driving drunk is dangerous, if not deadly.
<P>
	It is my belief that the sections of the Criminal Code dealing 
with impaired driving do not act as a sufficient deterrent. Currently 
there is a 14 year maximum sentence available for impaired driving 
causing death. How often is it imposed? It is similar to our old gun 
laws, some of the toughest in the world, but never enforced by a 
lenient justice system. Indeed, most sentences are for one or two 
years, even with a previous conviction. It is a joke.
<P>
	The hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley once told 
me of a sad story in his riding where three family members were 
killed by a drunk driver with previous convictions who was 
sentenced only to three and a half years. People are justifiably 
outraged by these kinds of sentences. They do not at all reflect the 
views and the concerns of average Canadians.
<P>
	In the United States the transportation research board has 
suggested a tough crackdown on repeat drunk drivers, which would 
include impounding vehicles and police stakeouts of people 
convicted of driving under the influence. The board's committee 
said that current policies in Canada have been effective in 
discouraging most people from drinking and driving. However, 
there remains a group of persistent drunk drivers who do not appear 
to be deterred by the threat of social disapproval or legal 
punishment.
<P>
	According to the report, repeat offenders are four times more 
likely than other drivers to take part in a fatal traffic accident. 
Twelve per cent of drivers involved in alcohol related crashes had 
at least one prior conviction. An interesting study in the <I>New 
England Journal of Medicine</I> in August 1994 entitled ``The risk of 
dying in alcohol related automobile crashes among habitual 
drivers'' came up with some revealing conclusions.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	The scientists linked about 3,000 drivers to their driver history 
files. The study showed that aggressive intervention in the cases of 
people arrested for driving while impaired may decrease the 
likelihood of a future fatal alcohol related crash.
<P>
	In the United States, motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause 
of death among people between the ages of one to 34. Almost 50 
per cent of all traffic fatalities are related to alcohol. Furthermore, 
40 per cent of the people in the U.S. will be involved in an alcohol 
related crash at some time during their lives.
<P>
	Similar figures are available for Canada. In 1994 87,838 people 
were charged with impaired driving. More astonishing is that in 
1994, 1,414 people were killed as a result of impaired driving, 
which is three times higher than our murder rate.
<P>
	The government has fervently committed itself to imposing gun 
control to help reduce crimes committed using a gun. 
Unfortunately it is a lot easier to get a driver's licence than to get a 
gun licence and according to these statistics a car is even more of a 
lethal weapon.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6933"> 6933 </A></B>
<P>
	It seems that the attorney general of Ontario, Mr. Charles 
Harnick agrees with me. He says: ``Drinking and driving is the 
number one cause of criminal death and injury in our society, and 
alcohol is the greatest single factor contributing to automobile 
accidents in Ontario''. But this problem goes beyond the borders 
of Ontario. It is a national issue. Transport Canada found that there 
were 113,731 injuries as a result of impaired driving accidents. 
To make it more clear, that means there are 3.8 deaths and 311 
injuries per day, due to drunk driving.
<P>
	Last week the government introduced some tough legislation to 
crack down on smoking. The principal incentive was the cost to the 
health system. Everybody knows that smoking inevitably leads to 
ill health. But if everyone knew that just one fatal drunk driving 
accident costs the Canadian taxpayer $390,000, I think more 
people would be up in arms about the high cost of getting behind 
the wheel after drinking. If this is not a very serious national issue, 
I do not know what is.
<P>
	Motion No. 78 is worthy of the support of members of all sides 
of the House. We are here to represent our constituents as well as 
the betterment of all Canadians. I truly believe that toughening the 
Criminal Code to crack down on impaired drivers would benefit 
every Canadian.
<P>
	I remind my colleagues that partisan politics have no place in 
Private Members' Business. This is a votable motion and I will 
certainly be voting in its favour.
<P>
	My brother-in-law was in a Scandinavian country, I cannot recall 
which country it was, but the law there stated that if you are picked 
up with the smell of alcohol on your breath, it is an automatic 
one-year suspension of your licence. If you are charged the second 
time you lose your licence for life. I think our laws, in comparison, 
are very lenient.
<P>
	As I mentioned previously, within one mile in my area, more 
than five people have been killed because of impaired driving. I 
live on a dead end road where there is very little traffic. However, it 
is sad to meet the families of these people who were killed in these 
accidents. It never leaves them.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity to be able to speak on this bill.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to speak on Motion No. 78, a votable motion dealing 
with impaired driving.
<P>
	Today Reformers are wearing red ribbons in support of project 
red ribbon which is carried on by Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
It is a strong reminder to everybody that we should do our best to 
stop tragic deaths, in particular, those dealing with drunk driving.
<P>
	This motion calls on the government to deal with all areas of the 
Criminal Code with regard to drunk driving. It take steps to deter 
drunk driving and it also provides for sentencing which reflects the 
circumstances.
<P>
	Critics during discussions on drunk driving often say we want to 
implement stiff sentences. I really cannot think of any greater stiff 
sentence than personally losing somebody because an individual 
has been drunk behind the wheel. I remember only too well the 
years in our family we had with Sheena who was the best buddy of 
my son Jason in the early years. Sheena was his cousin and my 
niece.
<P>
	Sheena was a very bright young lady, with all the best prospects 
in life, doing well until she was 13 years old. In 1983 a drunk driver 
took her life. I can remember those days as if they were yesterday. 
The call we got at home, the disillusionment, the reasons why. 
Then came the questions: What could have prevented it? Why did it 
happen to such a nice young girl? It has been 13 years and I still 
cannot forget two things. Why did the individual who killed her get 
a very minor suspended sentence and end up out on the street right 
away doing goodness knows what, and the lives that were 
destroyed.
<P>
	I talked to Sheena's mom, Winnie, this morning and I know that 
she does not forget. I know she has forgiven. I know it has stuck 
with us for many years. Sheena will never be forgotten. I somehow 
guess that the person who was behind the wheel that day has maybe 
forgotten about it because nothing much happened to him. That is 
very sad. This motion addresses the hurt and pain of families 
resulting from this action.
<P>
	Then I think of the reality that Ken and Eileen Roffel of Langley, 
B.C. have been dealing with. I just talked to Ken a few moments 
ago. Ken is going around the country looking for 300,000 plus 
signatures to deal with zero tolerance of drunk driving. Last March 
his son Mark was killed by a drunk driver. This drunk driver had 
five previous convictions for alcohol related charges.
<P>
	Mark was 23 years old. He was killed at 8.30 p.m. last March. 
Very few people in the country know that at 3.30 p.m. the same day 
the drunk driver who killed this young man had had another drunk 
driving accident.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	This type of thing has to stop. We have to look beyond partisan 
politics in a House that is filled with partisan politics. We have to 
try to understand the heart and the pain of people like the Roffels 
and my family. We have to rise above the occasion of Reform, 
Liberals or separatists and deal with the issue of drunk driving in a 
fair, reasonable and responsible manner.
<P>
	The drunk driver who killed Mark had no licence, no insurance 
and stole a truck. He had five previous convictions. What more can 
I say? How many more people must die on the roads before a 
responsible government does something?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6934"> 6934 </A></B>
<P>
	Mark's dad, Ken, is working hard to get a focus on zero 
tolerance. He is travelling across the country to raise awareness, 
as many other parents before him have done, as MADD is doing 
today and as the Reform Party members are doing. My colleague, 
who is sitting here today, has raised this on several occasions in 
the House, mostly to deaf ears of a majority government that is 
far too partisan for the good of all Canadians. We are very likely 
to hear that in one of the speeches to come from the Liberals.
<P>
	What happened the last time this came before the House? The 
separatists, who the Liberals claim are the official loyal opposition 
in this House, voted against it. That is nothing new. Shameful, I 
suppose. One wonders where things are going in this country when 
one party cannot deal responsibly with social issues of the day and 
its only concern is with separation from a country that needs all of 
its parts.
<P>
	What does voting for this motion really mean? Does it mean that 
if my colleague gets this passed in a vote that the Liberals should 
be ashamed and we should have an election because of it? No, that 
is not it at all. It means that this would go to a committee and it 
would be discussed. Witnesses would come before the committee 
from across the country, giving their perspective, their feelings and 
their good suggestions on how laws that are fitting against drunk 
drivers should be developed. It means an open debate on an issue 
that is far overdue. It just means we should bring it forward to the 
people of Canada.
<P>
	I praise my colleague and those who have the courage of their 
convictions on the Liberal side to deal with this issue of drunk 
driving. I can assure the House that my family will not forget 
Sheena nor the issues around her. Ken and Eileen will not forget 
Mark. And all those parents, families and friends of victims will 
not forget those who have been injured or killed by drunk drivers.
<P>
	I only ask that the Liberal government members take the 
responsibility that is afforded them as a majority government and 
deal with the issue on a non-partisan basis.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Halifax, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there can be no 
dispute about the potential for serious harm that impaired driving 
poses. Many of us, tragically, as was pointed out by members on 
the other side, know intimately the suffering that impaired drivers 
can and do cause. Our first reaction because of this as legislators, 
and a very understandable one, is to consider changing the 
penalties in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	We should, however, clearly understand what the criminal law 
does now about impaired driving. We need to do this in order to 
ensure that we are proceeding wisely and not simply setting out 
upon a course, however well motivated, that will turn into a 
journey that does not lead us toward meaningful change. Only after 
such an understanding is reached can we then wisely consider 
whether there are appropriate changes that ought to be made to the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	Driving is a legal behaviour, given the appropriate provincial or 
territorial licence. Drinking alcohol is also a legal adult behaviour. 
Clearly one may engage in either behaviour separately and not 
offend against the Criminal Code. What the criminal law does 
prohibit is driving when one's ability to do so is impaired by 
alcohol. The code also prohibits driving with a concentration of 
alcohol in the blood that is greater than 80 milligrams of alcohol in 
100 millilitres of blood. This is regardless of whether the person 
shows actual signs of impairment or not.
<P>
	I understand that scientists have indicated that the significance 
of alcohol as a discreet factor influencing driving behaviour 
becomes demonstrable only above the level of 80 milligrams of 
alcohol. Therefore the present over 80 limit is one that can 
withstand scrutiny by the courts. It respects fundamental principles 
of criminal law relating to culpability being a limit that rests 
securely upon a foundation of blame worthiness which is 
demonstrable by study results that are statistically significant.
<P>
	I want to turn to the penalties associated with the criminal 
offences that are committed by persons who consume alcohol and 
then operate a vehicle. Where the crown prosecutor can bring 
evidence proving that the drinking driver's pattern of driving was 
so bad as to constitute criminal negligence there is a maximum 
penalty of life imprisonment where the driver caused a death. 
Clearly this is the most serious maximum penalty available. If the 
criminally negligent driver caused bodily harm, the maximum 
penalty is 10 years imprisonment. Where driving behaviour is 
involved the proof which the crown prosecutor must offer in court 
for the offence of criminal negligence is a proof of very high 
divergence from normal driving behaviour.
<P>
	The Code also has an offence of dangerous driving causing 
death. The level of behaviour required for this offence is less 
divergence from normal behaviour than the behaviour 
contemplated for the criminal negligence offence. The maximum 
penalty for dangerous driving causing death is 14 years 
imprisonment. For the offence of dangerous driving causing bodily 
harm the maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment, the same as 
for criminal negligence causing bodily harm.
<P>
	In 1985 Parliament amended the code to introduce the offence of 
impaired driving causing death. The level of proof of divergent 
driving behaviour or an impaired ability to operate a vehicle which 
the crown prosecutor must offer in court is far lower than would be 
the case in criminal negligence cases. This offence carries a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6935"> 6935 </A></B>
<P>
maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment, the same  penalty as 
the offence of dangerous driving causing death.
<P>
	Parliament also introduced the offence of impaired driving 
causing bodily harm in 1985. This offence carries a maximum 
penalty of 10 years imprisonment, the same as the offence of 
criminal negligence causing bodily harm and dangerous driving 
causing bodily harm.
<P>
	For impaired driving and driving while over 80 where no death 
or bodily harm is involved there are various minimum penalties 
available. For a first offence the minimum penalty is a fine of $300. 
For a second offence the minimum penalty is 14 days 
imprisonment. For a subsequent offence the minimum penalty is 90 
days imprisonment.
<P>
	Impaired driving and driving while over 80 can be prosecuted by 
summary conviction or by indictment. Where prosecuted by 
summary conviction procedure, the maximum penalty is six 
months imprisonment. Where prosecuted by indictment, the 
maximum penalty is five years imprisonment. The crown 
prosecutor's choice to select procedure by indictment over 
summary conviction procedure would be influenced by such 
matters as the circumstances of the offence and by the prior record 
of the drinking driver.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	In addition to the minimum and maximum penalties there is a 
prohibition from driving anywhere in Canada which a judge is 
required to impose under the Criminal Code. The maximum 
prohibition from driving anywhere in Canada is three years. For a 
first offence the minimum period is three months. For a second 
offence the minimum period is six months. For a subsequent 
offence the minimum period is one year.
<P>
	This prohibition period is a criminal law penalty and is separate 
from any provincial or territorial driver's licence suspension that 
might follow upon a Criminal Code conviction for impaired 
driving or for driving while over 80.
<P>
	I should note that we have before the House some proposed 
amendments-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Fascinating.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am going to stop briefly. The hon. 
member from British Columbia says it is fascinating. I know it is 
fascinating. The point is the hon. member understands what I am 
getting at. However, there are a number of other hon. members who 
do not. With the best of intentions, they do not understand how the 
law is formed, how the law is practised or how the law is 
administered. I do know that the hon. member does understand 
that. Therefore I appreciate his response that these things, while 
somewhat dry, are indeed fascinating.
<P>
	This prohibition, as I mentioned, is a criminal law penalty and is 
separate from any provincial or territorial driver's licence 
suspension which might be extremely severe as well, depending on 
the province, and rightly so.
<P>
	I should note that we have before the House-
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Gutter politics.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member keeps talking about 
gutter politics. I do not understand why my discussion of criminal 
law provisions should be called gutter politics.
<P>
	Apparently there have been some differences on the amendments 
contained in Bill C-17. These amendments are aimed at ensuring 
that periods where the convicted drinking driver is imprisoned will 
not be deducted from the period of the prohibition from driving. 
The approach of various provinces and territories has been 
different in this matter and the amendments will clarify the 
approach to be taken.
<P>
	The penalties in the drinking and driving provisions of the 
Criminal Code represent a measured approach to the drinking and 
driving crimes. They are serious penalties. We should be very 
careful not to confuse challenges in investigating drinking and 
driving crimes or the heavy onus on the crown in proving drinking 
and driving crimes beyond a reasonable doubt in order to obtain a 
conviction with the sufficiency of the penalties we presently have 
for these crimes.
<P>
	We should remember that provinces may also use their 
legislative powers in areas relating to driver licensing and 
suspension and in the area of highway safety to address the 
problem of drinking and driving. For example, some provinces 
have chosen to use a lower blood alcohol concentration limit with 
regard to the suspension of licences than the criminal law might be 
able to justify using when creating a criminal offence. Also, some 
provinces have chosen to use administrative roadside suspensions 
of driving privileges for drinking drivers which take effect 
immediately. Such suspensions are not criminal law penalties. 
Under fundamental principles of criminal law, criminal penalties 
can follow only upon a conviction for a crime and cannot proceed a 
conviction.
<P>
	This should remind us that the criminal justice system and the 
criminal law, including penalties, are parts of a combined effort to 
address the problem of impaired driving and driving while over 80. 
The concerted effort of governments, educators and community 
groups against drinking and driving can be traced to the 
implementation of the 1985 amendments to the Criminal Code. In 
my view the Criminal Code penalties are already serious penalties, 
containing deterrent value. To increase the criminal penalties 
would not at this time mean that people would be more deterred 
from drinking and driving than they are currently with criminal law 
penalties.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6936"> 6936 </A></B>
<P>
	Thankfully, over the years there have been increasing efforts 
by provincial governments in the area of provincial highway safety 
legislation and licensing which have contributed toward a solution 
to drinking and driving crimes. Similarly, education, which really 
is the true answer, and example in the home contribute to the 
solution. The alcoholic beverage and hospitality industries have 
also taken a role in reducing drinking and driving problems.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	In my view the present Criminal Code penalty along with the 
amendments that relate to prohibition in Bill C-17 do provide-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member, 
but her time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate and extend my appreciation to the hon. member for 
Prince George-Bulkley Valley for bringing this motion forward 
and for his determination to have this area explored in view of our 
desire and thousands of Canadians' concerns about the possible 
reform of our impaired driving laws at the federal level.
<P>
	The hon. member for Halifax has quite rightly pointed out the 
maximum penalties for drinking and driving, but that is not the 
issue. The issue is the courts are not issuing penalties anywhere 
near the maximums. The concern is that there should be minimum 
penalties which the courts must deal with.
<P>
	This House passes legislation in order to tell the courts what to 
do, which is exactly what this motion is designed to do. At least it 
brings forward the opportunity for reasoned debate on this very 
important issue.
<P>
	There are over 110,000 members in the Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving organization. This organization was born out of the 
anguish and pain caused by impaired or drunk driving. This 
organization was formed as a result of the inaction of the federal 
government. If the government were addressing this issue, this 
organization would not have any need or basis to lobby, to raise 
funds and to do what it can to bring this matter to the attention of 
politicians who seem oblivious to the need to do something in this 
area.
<P>
	Last Thursday night I arrived home in Cameras, Alberta. The 
very next evening a drunk driver ran into a car which was being 
driven by a father. The mother was in the front passenger seat and 
their four children were in the back. Both the mother and father 
were killed while the children were left alive. The oldest is fourteen 
and the youngest is five. It happened in the area of Armenia which 
is in my constituency as a result of the boundary change. The 
family was from the small city of Cameras which has a population 
of approximately 12,000 to 13,000.
<P>
	That catastrophe will touch thousands of people in that area. And 
what is being done about it? Nothing is being done about it at the 
federal level. Some of the statistics on the subject have been 
introduced into this debate by my colleagues. From 1983 to 1991, 
17,630 people died in Canada in alcohol related crashes and 1.1 
million people were injured. In 1992, 14,014 were killed. In 1987, 
5.2 million days of employment activity were lost.
<P>
	Justice Peter Cory of the Supreme Court of Canada stated in 
1995: ``Every year drunk driving leaves a terrible trail of death, 
injury, heartbreak and destruction. In terms of the deaths and 
serious injuries resulting in hospitalization, drunk driving is clearly 
the crime which causes the most significant social loss to the 
country''. I hope this is not lost on hon. members.
<P>
	The justice minister stood in this House and justified Bill C-68 at 
least in part with the horrific statistic that every six days a woman 
is shot to death in this country. I would just point out that every six 
hours someone is killed in this country by an impaired driver. 
Certainly the House and the Government of Canada should be 
looking at this issue. It should not simply brush it aside because as 
the member for Halifax has stated the maximum penalties are what 
they are; the maximum penalties are not worth the powder to blow 
them up unless they are utilized. What is the purpose of having a 
maximum penalty if the courts never consider the maximum 
penalty or anything near the maximum penalty?
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	I understand my time has expired. I have appreciated the time to 
speak and perhaps I will be able to continue later.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Crowfoot will have 
five minutes when the debate resumes again, if he so wishes.
<P>
	The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired. The order is dropped to the bottom of 
the order of precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a comment on the private 
members' motion, just so that I understand it correctly. The motion 
is printed on page 21 of today's Order Paper in the name of the hon. 
member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley and thereafter it states 
that pursuant to Standing Order 86(3) it is jointly seconded by a 
number of members.
<P>
	As I read the motion before us, it asks that we vote on the 
following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of the House, the government should consider strengthening 
penalties in those sections of the Criminal Code which deal with impaired driving 
offences in order to: (a) enhance deterrence; and (b) bring the penalties into line with 
the seriousness of the offence.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6937"> 6937 </A></B>
<P>
	As I understand it, that is all we are being asked to vote on. 
Am I correct in my submission? Just so that I can understand 
precisely what the debate is, it is just this motion and nothing else. 
Is that correct?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. minister will appreciate that 
being a votable matter the motion will come up for debate again for 
two further hours. Private Members' Business expired about three 
minutes ago and I would urge the minister to raise this point the 
next time the matter comes up in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am seeking clarification on the 
substance of the motion before the House and whether this is the 
totality of the motion before the House. Perhaps the Chair or the 
Clerk could inform the House that the totality of the motion is as I 
have read it. If there are additional sentences to be added, I would 
like to know that as well. However, as I understand it, the motion 
before the House is what I have read and nothing else.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> With great respect, I think the minister's 
question is one of debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> It is not a question of debate.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Private Members' Business has now 
expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wonder if it might be helpful to the 
House if the hon. member in whose name the motion stands might 
very briefly clarify the point of order raised by the minister. In fact, 
it possibly may even enhance his own motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent for the 
member to clarify?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, for clarification to the Minister of 
Health, the motion as it is written is in its entirety and that the 
government should consider. Let me just add if the motion is 
passed by the House, the hope is that the government knowing its 
responsibility will indeed send the motion to the justice committee 
for the recognition this serious issue deserves. That is the intent of 
the motion.

	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to address myself to this resolution. I spoke on it in 
June when the House first dealt with it but since then the Senate has 
had some time dealing with it and now it is back here for us to deal 
with one more time as provided for in the Constitution.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6939"> 6939 </A></B>
<P>
	Perhaps I may mention something of my own personal 
educational background to show how I come at this particular 
issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Are you with us or against us, Roger?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> I am always with the member for Fraser Valley 
East when he is advocating sensible things. I believe on this one he 
is advocating something very sensible.
<P>
	I was raised in the Salvation Army, so I completed my high 
school education in a so-called church school, a Salvation Army 
school. I spent a number of years teaching. Half my teaching career 
was in a Salvation Army school and in two communities, one in 
northern Newfoundland called St. Anthony, the other on the 
northeast coast in a community called Springdale. I spent about the 
same amount of time teaching in the so-called amalgamated or 
integrated schools, those schools in which a number of the 
religious denominations including the Salvation Army had come 
together for educational purposes.
<P>
	I spent three years as a clergyman with the Salvation Army. I 
spent a couple of years as president of the provincial 
Newfoundland Teacher's Association. I mention that in the context 
that we had a number of dealings in those days with changes to 
legislation including the 1969 Schools Act, for example, which 
legislated during the period of my presidency of the teacher's 
association.
<P>
	Both in terms of my own education and in terms of my own 
career path I have had fairly close involvement with the subject that 
we are dealing with here today.
<P>
	I, like just about every other Newfoundlander, have a particular 
perspective on it. We are not clones. We have different 
perspectives. We had a referendum on the issue a couple of years 
ago. It triggered some pretty strong views on either side of the 
issue. I will come to that in a moment.
<P>
	Let us refresh ourselves on what is the background of this 
particular resolution, and why it is before us now. First, it is before 
us now for the same reason that it was before us last June. It was 
because the Parliament of Canada has a role in responding to 
requests from particular provinces having to do with changes to the 
Constitution that affect only that province or those provinces 
making the request. This particular amendment falls in that 
category.
<P>
	As many will be aware, a whole lot of activity, planning and 
involvement has preceded the arrival of the resolution, the 
proposed amendment, on the floor of this Chamber last June and 
again today.
<P>
	The genesis of this proposed change is that for many years the 
Newfoundland education system has been seeking better ways, not 
only more efficient ways in dollar terms, but more effective ways 
to pursue its educational objectives while at the same time ensuring 
the very values that have been part of the system and that have 
made the system such a success over the years because, despite the 
financial constraints, the so-called church system of education in 
Newfoundland has served us very well for many years.
<P>
	Were there time I would take members back and tell them how 
we got into this rather unique system in the first place. It had to do 
with the way that Newfoundland was settled. It had to do with the 
early laws that prevented settlement. Settlement was illegal in 
Newfoundland until 1824. If there was no legal settlement there 
was no, at least in technical terms, need for a government. It was all 
done by fiat from Westminster. What education there was was 
provided by the churches in the absence of a state controlled 
system, because there was no state, except in the context of being a 
colony of Great Britain and a reluctant colony at that particular 
time; reluctant in the context that we were not supposed to be there.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	The churches became involved and performed a very pivotal, 
crucial role in the early days of education in Newfoundland, such 
that when government decided in the late 1800s that it was time to 
formalize the education institution in Newfoundland it was an easy 
step to look to those who had been providing the service over the 
years, the churches, and ask them to carry on. That is exactly what 
was done.
<P>
	As a result of the first education act in the late 1800s a 
partnership was developed. Put in simplest terms, the taxpayer 
would pay the bill, the state would pay the bill, and churches would 
run the schools. We did not have five, six or seven church schools 
in the sense that there are in the province of Ontario or in certain 
other jurisdictions in Manitoba and so on. We had, operating side 
by side, seven state funded school systems. Each got its money 
from the state and its leadership from the church. That system 
evolved over the years and served us very well.
<P>
	As I said a moment ago, I am a product of that system both in 
having graduated from it and in having worked in it as a teacher 
and a school administrator. Were there time I could talk for hours 
on the many advantages and the many good things of the system. It 
is a very good system. We need to preserve the best of it while at 
the same time do our best to get rid of that which impedes progress 
in the system.
<P>
	I want the House to understand the two things I have said. We 
have to find ways to reform the system. That was the resolve of the 
Newfoundland people when this exercise had its beginnings. We 
have to find ways to help the system progress, but not at the 
expense of the values which are implicit in the system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6940"> 6940 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe the Newfoundland government found a way to do that. 
Having tentatively found that way, it did not just arbitrarily bull 
through with it and force it down people's throats. It looked to 
the people of Newfoundland in a referendum in September of last 
year and asked the people of Newfoundland what they thought of 
the proposed changes, what they thought of the proposal to seek 
a constitutional amendment to enable the changes to go forward. 
Fifty-five per cent of the people who participated in the 
referendum gave the government and the legislature of 
Newfoundland and Labrador the green light or the authority to 
proceed with the proposed amendment to the Constitution.
<P>
	That was in September of last year. That was one vote of the 
people directly involved. It was one vote which said: ``Let us get on 
with it. Let us do it''.
<P>
	Of course there was at that time a vote of the Newfoundland 
House of Assembly which said the same thing. It was a vote of the 
elected representatives of the people of Newfoundland and 
Labrador.
<P>
	There was a more recent vote which was held last May in the 
Newfoundland House of Assembly. That vote was unanimous. All 
members of all parties in that House, Liberal, Conservative and 
New Democratic, voted unanimously to call on this House to 
expedite the proposed amendment to the Constitution. The leader 
of the opposition, a Conservative, Mr. Loyola Sullivan, in 
Newfoundland, voted in that particular amendment. He, like all 
other members of the House, called on this Parliament to expedite 
the proposed change to the Constitution.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	Then of course in June here in this Chamber we, the 
representatives of the people of Canada, including the seven 
members from Newfoundland and Labrador, also participated in a 
vote. By a majority, the House has given its approbation to the 
proposed amendment.
<P>
	Even before we take a vote on the resolution now before the 
House, there have already been four votes on this issue: the 
referendum in Newfoundland, the two votes in the Newfoundland 
House of Assembly and a vote in this Chamber in June.
<P>
	Of course, my critics will remind me that there was a fifth vote 
as well on this issue. There was a fifth vote last Thursday in the 
Senate, although not quite on this resolution. But in fairness, I 
believe I should deal with it briefly.
<P>
	There was a fifth vote on this subject and some people, well 
meaning, in the other place had more of an eye on politics than on 
the issues at hand. If we look at the breakdown of the vote, there 
were four Liberal Senators who voted for the Senate amendment. 
But with that exception, there was a straight split along Liberal and 
Tory lines in the Senate in which all the Tories wanted to do 
something different from what the Newfoundland people were 
asked in the referendum and what the Newfoundland House has 
asked in its two motions and that we had asked in the June vote 
here. All the Tories voted to oppose the will of the Newfoundland 
people in the referendum and oppose the will of the Newfoundland 
House of Assembly in its two votes.
<P>
	All the Liberals, save four, voted to uphold what this Chamber 
had already done and what had been done in the referendum and in 
the Newfoundland House.
<P>
	It can be argued that in the other place it was largely a vote along 
partisan lines. I would submit, having been around this business for 
a while, that politics probably fueled as much of the argument over 
there as did any concern for other issues.
<P>
	However, not to be unduly unkind at the beginning of this new 
week, let us recognize that part of the argument which was put over 
in the other place had to do with the concern of minority rights. The 
Senate spent a fair amount of time on this and, indeed, its 
amendment stated ``where numbers warrant''.
<P>
	It is interesting that the Senate had chosen those very words, but 
it was no accident. First it comes straight from the minority 
language context. Those are also the very words that the 
Newfoundland House of Assembly had initially considered. This 
was part of the original proposal that the Newfoundland 
government was going to bring to us.
<P>
	I am told, having followed this one very closely, that it was 
decided by the Newfoundland government that the phrase ``where 
numbers warrant'', while pretty innocuous and helpful on the 
surface, was rejected as a viable option primarily because of the 
potential legal interpretation of the phrase.
<P>
	The intention here is not to give special treatment to anybody, 
not to people who have uni-denominational schools or any other 
kind of school. The intention of this amendment is to treat all 
denominational schools in exactly the same way. Consequently the 
right to a unidenominational school was made ``subject to 
provincial legislation that is uniformly applicable to all schools, 
specifying conditions for the establishment of continued operation 
of schools''. That is a quote directly from the resolution now before 
the House.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	The clause I have just read authorizes the Government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador to set the standard for establishing 
and maintaining the school. However, it requires that the same 
standard be applied to all schools, whether interdenominational or 
unidenominational. In effect, the government is prevented by this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6941"> 6941 </A></B>
<P>
clause from setting a higher or different standard for 
unidenominational schools than would apply to other publicly 
funded schools.
<P>
	That last sentence is at the very crux of the issue that was dealt 
with in the Senate. I have mentioned I have a few suspicions but if 
we put aside the partisan hanky-panky that might have gone on 
over there in the name of this resolution, in the name of minority 
rights, and recognize that there were people in the Senate and 
people at large in Newfoundland and across Canada who say when 
they heard about this proposed amendment to term 17: ``What does 
this have to do with minority rights? Is there an implication for 
minority rights in other parts of the country?''
<P>
	To them I say that the amendment to the resolution in the Senate, 
the ``where numbers warrant amendment,'' would have played into 
the hands of their concern. It would have set a different standard. It 
would have obliged the Government of Newfoundland and 
Labrador to apply a different standard, a lower standard to 
unidenominational schools than to the multidenominational 
schools. That is exactly what the Government of Newfoundland 
and Labrador wanted to avoid. It is why the Government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador elected not to put ``where numbers 
warrant'' in its request for a change.
<P>
	Let me reiterate the sentence I read a moment ago. In effect, the 
Government of Newfoundland and Labrador is prevented from 
setting a higher or a different standard for unidenominational 
schools than would apply to other publics funded schools. 
Prohibiting the government from setting a different standard is 
only there as long as we stick with the wording before us. The 
introduction of the words ``where numbers warrant'' is a licence to 
a government at some future time to apply different standards to 
unidenominational schools than to multidenominational schools.
<P>
	I said earlier that this debate as it unfolded in Newfoundland 
caused a fair amount of confrontation, division and some rancour. 
Some of that rancour is the inevitable result of the dramatic change 
being proposed. There are always those who are most comfortable 
with the status quo. To a degree I am one of those people because I 
have never felt that you should change for the sake of changing. 
But if change offers the prospect of something better then it is 
worth considering abandoning the status quo.
<P>
	However, whenever the status quo is tampered with, some 
rancour, some suspicion is triggered. Therefore, it is no surprise 
that something as integral to the Newfoundland way of life as the 
school system would trigger that kind of apprehension, indeed that 
kind of rancour. Unfortunately the rancour was cranked up 
somewhat by a bit of misinformation. No matter what the debate, 
someone has a vested interest. There is always somebody who 
says: ``I do not really trust the judgment of people on this, so I have 
to do some fear mongering on it''.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	We had a fair amount of rhetoric in Newfoundland about godless 
schools and that kind of thing. I invite critics to look at this
<P>
proposal and they will find that it does two things only. It puts the 
governance of the school system in Newfoundland where it already 
is in every other jurisdiction in Canada. Into the hands of the 
government.
<P>
	Second, and most important, it continues and enshrines even 
further the role of the churches in so far as religious education is 
concerned in Newfoundland. The role of the churches will continue 
and will be constitutionally protected by this amendment.
<P>
	I think I told the House this before but if not let us get it on the 
record. In the referendum in September last year I voted no, not 
because I opposed the changes being proposed and not because I 
had concerns about minority rights, although I had some questions 
there at the time and I will come to these in a moment. I voted no 
for a couple of reasons. First, I felt that a proper opportunity had 
not been given to resolve the issues of difference between the 
government and the church leaders outside the constitutional 
context. I felt that the government appeared to be rushing to 
judgment on this one and more time was needed to seek an 
accommodation outside the constitutional context in which we are 
now operating.
<P>
	The result of the referendum and the resolution in the 
Newfoundland House of Assembly triggered a whole set of 
initiatives for both sides to try to get together one last time. After 
the referendum and after the first vote in the Newfoundland House 
of Assembly it was that exercise and the result of that exercise 
which turned out to be an abysmal failure.
<P>
	It was a failure of that latter exercise which told me that 
whatever my concerns were earlier, it was clear that no amount of 
knocking heads together was going to solve the issue. The only 
route left was the route that the government of Newfoundland had 
chosen to go, the route we are participating in and the route we are 
now on today.
<P>
	I initially had some concerns about the minority rights situation 
until I realized that this is a minority rights situation only in the 
semantic context. The right we are dealing with here is the same 
right for every living, breathing Newfoundlander and Labradorian. 
Absolutely the same one.
<P>
	Second, the accommodation that has been made in this proposal 
will see to it that those rights continue to be protected. In matters 
relating to the religious content of the curriculum in Newfoundland 
the churches will have full say.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Do you know, Mr. Speaker, what the criticism was in those days 
in Newfoundland, if you had been following  the local media in 
Newfoundland? I do not mean in the last week but in the last few 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6942"> 6942 </A></B>
<P>
months. It is from those who want to get on with educational 
reform. The criticism was that the government in its latest 
negotiations was giving more say to the churches than they had 
before. I do not subscribe to that but I am saying that is a criticism 
that is much in print. It has been said many times by proponents of 
the reform in the past few months.
<P>
	As a Newfoundlander, as an educator, as a person who got part of 
his schooling and spent part of his teaching years in a 
unidenominational school in Newfoundland I can say that I am 
extremely comfortable with the route we are on here.
<P>
	I want to mention one more thing before I sit down. It has to do 
with the role of the Senate. I have seen some effort in recent days 
for people to bring on board other agenda items here, to talk about 
this appointed Senate and that kind of thing. I have my views on the 
Senate. I think the sooner we can find a way to elect it the better. 
But that aside, the Senate has a role in this. I have never felt its 
members were outside their bounds in dealing with this issue.
<P>
	The Senate has served the overall process very well with their 
hearings, with their proposed amendment. The whole process held 
it up to the light of day just a little bit more. I hope one of the things 
it has done is to convince the people of Canada, those who have 
been watching or following, of something of which I am 
convinced. This is not a minority rights issue. It is not an issue that 
affects anybody outside of Newfoundland and Labrador.
<P>
	Those who get on that tack and begin advocating this as a human 
rights issue should be careful of the precedent they are setting. 
What they are saying in effect is, notwithstanding what section 43 
says in the Constitution, we can never have an issue that affects 
only one jurisdiction, in this case one province. It can never have 
dealt with and processed here because we have to be always 
cognizant, always held under the threat of how it might be 
perceived in some other jurisdiction.
<P>
	Newfoundland and Labrador has the full right to seek a 
constitutional change. The Parliament of Canada has the full 
responsibility to respond to that request, to scrutinize it. Lord 
knows we have scrutinized it, here last June, all this fall in the 
Senate and back here again. It has been well scrutinized. That is the 
process.
<P>
	At the end of the day the request came only from the jurisdiction 
concerned. However, it came with the strength of a referendum and 
with the strength of two resolutions in the House of Assembly of 
Newfoundland and Labrador. It has certainly kept up its part of 
bargain as provided for in section 43. I think we have too. We dealt 
with it for the first time last June, in the Senate subsequently, the 
Senate hearings, the Senate amendment, and now here.
<P>
	I believe the time has come to get on with the vote. I hope we can 
do it expeditiously because we are dealing with the education of
<P>
some young people whose education has been in limbo somewhat 
because of the way this process has been dragged out.
<P>
	I felt from the beginning it would take some time. Nobody can 
argue that it has been rushed through. We have had a good run at it. 
There can be nobody left in the country, certainly in Newfoundland 
and Labrador, whose rights are involved here, who does not know 
about this initiative and who has not taken sides on this initiative. I 
can say that I still get mail from people in Newfoundland who tell 
me they feel it is a minority rights issue. I get mail from people 
who are concerned that the role of the church is being minimized 
here. I respect those views. Some are from my constituents and 
some from other across the province. I respect those views very 
much.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	At the end of the day I have to make a judgment. I believe I have 
made the right judgment on this one, that the overall process will 
be best served if we get on with the amendment to the Constitution.
<P>
	I am satisfied that the values which have served the 
Newfoundland education system so well are being adequately 
protected here. If they were not, I would not be making the speech I 
am making today because, as I said before, I have been intimately a 
part of that system and I am proud of what it has been able to do in 
terms of education in Newfoundland and Labrador. I would not 
want to see it watered down or interfered with.
<P>
	I believe this amendment, far from interfering with it, allows it 
to proceed in an effective manner. It is for those reasons that I take 
great pleasure in supporting the resolution before the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today in support of resolution 17. I do so as the 
intergovernmental affairs critic for my party.
<P>
	I enjoyed hearing from the member for Burin-St. George's. I 
have always had a great deal of respect and admiration for him. I 
must say that after listening to his presentation that has grown 
when I heard him talking about the status quo and that it is not 
always the best way to go and he certainly supports referendums, 
something this party feels very strongly about.
<P>
	I think I even heard his support for an elected Senate. Indeed, the 
comments that came from the other side I wholeheartedly endorse. 
We may want him to come over to our side.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak in support of this. I regret that we are 
debating this again. I do regret that those in the other place, the 
unelected, have ignored the true democratic judgment of the people 
of Newfoundland and Labrador. It seems as though the common 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6943"> 6943 </A></B>
<P>
sense of the  common people has been ignored. That is something 
the Reform Party very much believes in.
<P>
	Before I get into our position on that, I think it would be 
appropriate to review the process that has brought us to this point. 
This is not some knee-jerk reaction that is taking place. It actually 
goes back to 1992 when there was a royal commission that looked 
at the problem of education in Newfoundland and Labrador. The 
recommendation was that it needed to be changed and the change 
was the subject of three years of negotiations in that province. 
Unfortunately, the negotiations with the government and the 
churches failed to bring about an agreement on the changes, but 
basically everyone agreed there had to be changes made.
<P>
	The resolution we are talking about today and which we talked 
about in June was voted on a passed in the Newfoundland House of 
Assembly in a free vote of a clear majority. Then the referendum 
was held. I should mention that the referendum was not required by 
the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, but it is to its 
credit that a referendum was held on a major change such as this to 
the Constitution. We applaud the fact that the referendum was held.
<P>
	The referendum passed by a clear majority of 55 per cent, which 
clearly indicated agreement to the changes proposed by the 
government to term 17.
<P>
	After the referendum passed in October 1995 the Newfoundland 
House of Assembly adopted the resolution and all parties supported 
it.
<P>
	There was a provincial election in Newfoundland and Labrador 
in February 1996, and of course reform was an issue in the election 
because the referendum had been held and of the 52 seats 
contested, 36 of those seeking election supported the referendum. 
Once again in a provincial election there was overwhelming 
support for reform. Then, of course, back in June of this year we in 
this House overwhelmingly endorsed the change by 170 to 46 on 
what was a free vote.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	That is the background leading up to what I would certainly 
argue has been a very fair and open democratic process where the 
will of the people has been heard and accepted.
<P>
	Certainly in coming to this place we have a role to play. In my 
view, we had three things we had to address. The first was the 
consideration of the democratic consent. The second consideration 
was that it conform to the national standards of the rights and 
freedoms of our citizens. The third was the consideration of the 
minority rights in other provinces, that they were not going to be 
impacted.
<P>
	Dealing first with the consideration of the democratic consent, I 
think I have just outlined the process that was followed, starting 
with the royal commission in 1992  which brought us to the point 
where we are at today, clearly indicating that the democratic 
consent was solicited and indeed achieved.
<P>
	The second point is on national standards of rights and freedoms. 
In my interpretation in review of this bill, the rights and freedoms 
of the churches and citizens of Newfoundland and Labrador are not 
impacted in any way. Their rights and freedoms are actually more 
enhanced than they were under the bill because of the new changes.
<P>
	On the third point, considering the impact of minority rights in 
other provinces, term 17 refers only to the people of the one 
province and in fact does on impact on any of the other provinces.
<P>
	As I mentioned, minority rights have been actually enhanced 
because prior to this resolution 5 per cent of the people in the 
province of Newfoundland and Labrador had no rights under term 
17. When we talk about minority rights, this bill actually enhances 
the rights of all the citizens. That is really what this bill is about, 
equality. There is no longer going to be special status based on 
religion. Everyone will be treated equally. I find it difficult that 
anyone could argue against that concept.
<P>
	The province of Newfoundland and Labrador is the only 
province that has exclusive denominational schools. Therefore 
Newfoundland will join all the other provinces by being free in that 
area.
<P>
	This bill is not about minority rights. It is about bettering and 
improving the quality of education in that province. It is about 
streamlining the system and putting more money into the 
classrooms and taking it out of the bureaucracy. It is projected to be 
a savings of some $25 million, which is significant. In a province 
that needs to improve its education and do a better job, that is 
absolutely a move in the right direction.
<P>
	There has been some comment about the fact that the question 
was perhaps not as clear as it might have been. I have read the 
question and I do not know how it could be made any clearer. In 
attempting to make it as some might describe as too clear, one 
could be accused of oversimplifying it. It is important that the 
question be understood and in my view it was a very clear question.
<P>
	We do a disservice to the common sense of the common people 
when we suggest they could not understand what was in the text. 
People do understand and to a far greater degree than some 
members of this House and certainly many members from the other 
place.
<P>
	We understand as Reformers that this is a sensitive and 
controversial issue. My leader made it clear on the first vote that it 
would be a free vote by my party and we continue to feel that way. 
However, the majority of the Reform caucus supports the 
government on this term 17 amendment. We believe it is a move in 
the right direction and a move away from the status quo. It is

respecting the  democratic wishes as expressed by referendum of 
the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. We will be supporting 
it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last June this House held a two day debate on the 
amendment to term 17 proposed by the Government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador and referred to the Parliament of 
Canada for sanction according to the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	The amendment to term 17 was approved by a significant 
majority of this House in a free vote and submitted to the Senate for 
adoption. The Senate has now returned the proposed term 17 
amendment to us, modified by a Senate amendment providing two 
measures to which I will refer later. The Senate amendment was 
adopted by a significant majority of senators in a free vote.
<P>
	Last summer when I spoke on this issue I was one of 36 Liberal 
members who voted against the adoption of the proposed 
amendment to term 17. The reasons I gave then are, in my 
considered view, still valid today. These are my reasons.
<P>
	There is a broad consensus for the need for reform of the 
educational system in Newfoundland and Labrador and, to my 
knowledge, no parliamentarian opposes this worthy objective.
<P>
	However, many parliamentarians have strong reservations that, 
worthy as the objective may be, the amendment should not 
interfere with the rights of certain minority groups and certain 
groups now protected by the Constitution under the terms of union 
of Newfoundland with Canada.
<P>
	Those of us who hold these reservations believe that the 
Government of Newfoundland and Labrador had two alternative 
options available to reach the objective it seeks while protecting 
the existing rights of defined educational groups under the 
Constitution.
<P>
	First, it could have persevered with a framework agreement that 
it was negotiating with the various stakeholders and which was 
close to a consensus last spring, according to the words on April 24, 
1996 of no less than Newfoundland's minister of education, Mr. 
Grimes.
<P>
	The second option, if it preferred, as it eventually chose to do, to 
move on the constitutional front would have been to propose an 
amendment to term 17 which would have at the same time made 
clear and watertight the protection of existing rights under the 
projected reform.
<P>
	However, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador chose 
to go forward with an amendment which would give complete 
power to itself to modify the  present educational system regardless 
of the protected rights of religious groups under the Constitution.
<P>
	Those who believe that the House should simply accede to the 
amendment proposed by the Government of Newfoundland hold 
that the decision of the Government of Newfoundland was a 
democratic choice, sanctioned by a majority vote in a public 
referendum.
<P>
	Many of my colleagues who support the amendment proposed 
by Newfoundland feel that it is presumptuous and arrogant of us in 
this House to interfere with a democratic decision of a legitimate 
government seeking its own reforms.
<P>
	I respectfully submit that this argument is not justified. If the 
modern fathers of confederation presiding over the terms of union 
of Newfoundland with Canada had viewed educational reform as 
strictly a matter for the provincial Government of Newfoundland to 
decide, they would not have enshrined clear and unequivocal 
protections for certain religious groups related to education in the 
terms of union.
<P>
	Having done this, those who crafted the terms of union 
obviously agreed and decided that term 17 went beyond the power 
and authority of the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, 
and that is why we in this House have become involved. Being 
involved, according to the clear designs of the authors of the terms 
of union and of term 17, we have the duty as members of 
Parliament, indeed an onerous duty, to examine any changes with 
special care. If in doing so our conclusion is that the amendment 
proposed by the Government of Newfoundland eliminates the 
constitutional protections that the authors of the terms of union 
deliberately intended to enshrine, then it behoves us to either reject 
the proposed amendment or modify it so as to continue the 
protections intended for certain educational groups by the 
Constitution.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	In a recent free vote the Senate adopted an amendment that 
provides for two modifications to Newfoundland's proposed 
amendment to term 17. It would affirm both the spirit and intended 
protection of the original term 17. The first part of this amendment 
is the insertion of the words ``where numbers warrant'' and the 
present paragraph (b) which starts with the words ``subject to 
provincial legislation''.
<P>
	This is an important change. If the authority for changing the 
protection of certain educational groups under the Constitution is 
left to the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, why should 
the same not be done in the cases of the provinces of Ontario, 
Manitoba, Quebec or any other province where certain educational 
rights are now protected by the Canadian Constitution?
<P>
	Today we have a certain type of government in Newfoundland. 
Colleagues here may feel very  comfortable leaving this authority 
with the present Government of Newfoundland. But what 
government will it be tomorrow? What will be the design of the 
future government 25 years hence? This is why the fathers of the 
Constitution, when dealing with matters as sensitive as education, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6945"> 6945 </A></B>
<P>
educational rights, protection of minority rights, protection of 
religious groups, made it so that these rights were deliberately 
enshrined in the Constitution to make it much more difficult for 
any provincial government to change at will the educational 
system. Maybe a government more daring than others, more 
autocratic than others could eliminate these very protections, these 
minority rights like religious rights for certain educational groups 
just by its own will with perhaps a tiny majority in the House.
<P>
	The second amendment intends to substitute the words ``to 
direct'' with the words ``to determine and direct''. This puts a far 
greater onus on the Government of Newfoundland to determine 
before directing any changes involving substantial reform that they 
are warranted.
<P>
	I suggest that in both cases these amendments make eminent 
sense. They do not detract from the thrust of the term 17 
amendment. In other words, the worthy objective or reform the 
Government of Newfoundland and Labrador is seeking is 
continuing in a reasonable manner the protection of the educational 
groups enshrined under the terms of union.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am particularly interested in the question of constitutional 
protection. As a matter of fact, this same question of the 
constitutional provisions on education is undergoing a thorough 
and ongoing scrutiny at this very moment in Quebec.
<P>
	The recent general assembly on education recommended that all 
religious education in Quebec, which is essentially linked to the 
protection of minority rights in Quebec, be abolished. A consensus 
is gradually developing in Quebec around dividing school boards 
by language. What will the present government of Quebec decide 
eventually, since we all know that it is opposed to any interference 
by the Canadian Parliament in its affairs?
<P>
	It is not mere coincidence that the Bloc Quebecois voted 
unanimously in favour of the amendment proposed by 
Newfoundland. The Bloc's argument is that, since the Government 
of Newfoundland has made a democratic choice, it is not the 
business of us here in the Canadian Parliament to interfere. The 
Bloc is already paving the way for the possibility of the Quebec 
government's referring to us some proposal for an amendment to 
the protection of education in Quebec, at which time it would suit 
both the Bloc and the PQ government if we were to accept it 
without a murmur.
<P>
	Certainly, if ever there were an amendment to the constitutional 
provisions on education, and if this included sufficient protection 
for minorities, I would be the first to accept it. But if it did not, I 
consider that it is the duty of all parliamentarians to oppose it 
vigorously.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some of my colleagues have stated that the amendment to term 
17 has nothing to do with minority rights. Many colleagues have 
expressed the fact that it is going beyond our duty to interfere with 
the rights of the people of Newfoundland, the Government of 
Newfoundland, to decide its own thrust, its own objective of 
reform. I do not think this is what we are doing. I certainly do not 
think this is what I have in mind.
<P>
	I really believe that this question is essentially linked to minority 
rights. I truly believe that if we were to accept, to rubber stamp any 
constitutional change proposed by any provincial government 
without expressing our opinion, without expressing dissent if this is 
what we feel should be the case, then what is the point of 
constitutional enshrinement in the first place?
<P>
	After all, the Constitution today, whether we like it or not, 
provides that the Parliament of Canada, this House and the Senate, 
should examine any constitutional change. The reason for it is 
patently obvious.
<P>
	I suggest that this question is far bigger than that of the authority 
of any provincial legislature to decide by itself. This is why we are 
involved. This is why I continue to believe that in assenting 
unchanged to the amendment to term 17 as proposed by the 
Government of Newfoundland and Labrador we would be doing a 
disservice to all those who believe that constitutional enshrinement 
in Quebec, in Ontario, in Manitoba and elsewhere are really the 
finest guarantees we have for minority rights.
<P>
	These minority rights express themselves in different ways. 
Sometimes, as happens in Quebec, they are tied up through the 
Constitution through religious enshrinement. There has been an 
evolution in mores, an evolution in our societal realities which 
makes it so today that religion is not the key issue any more in our 
schools. But the fact of religious enshrinement in Quebec is tied up 
closely to minority rights in Quebec. Were we to accept this 
amendment today without any argument, by rubber stamping it, no 
doubt that our friends of the Bloc will rejoice once again when they 
prepare their own proposition for us one day to put before this 
House, hoping that again we would rubber stamp it.
<P>
	I continue to hold that we should look at the amendment to term 
17 very carefully, that we should back the amendments made in the 
Senate and that we should move in that direction which is a fair 
compromise to the Government in Newfoundland and Labrador 
and all those who hold, as we all do, for educational reform in  that 
province. We should keep the thrust of the amendment to term 17 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6946"> 6946 </A></B>
<P>
while keeping the protection of religious groups enshrined in the 
terms of the union.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to once again talk on term 17.
<P>
	I would like go back to my colleague for Burin-St. George's 
who spoke in the House earlier today. He made the assertion that 
any difference of opinion on term 17 was driven by partisan 
interest. I want to assure my friend that he is someone I continue to 
hold in high respect and regard. He has been a tremendous 
supporter of mine over the last nine years. However, I believe that 
the member is really not accurate when he states that our motives 
for being involved and having a point of view on this issue are not 
grounded in the best of intentions.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Back in June when this resolution was debated, certain members 
of the House opposed the constitutional amendment that was 
before the House. We were very sensitive to the fact but we 
recognized that the educational system in Newfoundland needed 
reform and modernization. No attempt was made to interfere with 
the management of the educational system.
<P>
	Having said that, a constitutional amendment cannot be put to 
the House without some examination, without some discussion and 
debate. If we feel that there are some genuine concerns, as the 
member for Lincoln has so eloquently expressed, then it is our duty 
and responsibility to stand in the House and flag these concerns and 
put them forward to the House. Ultimately precedents that are set 
in this Chamber on constitutional amendments will have a 
profound effect for other provinces in the country.
<P>
	As the member for Lincoln has just said, he has deep concerns 
about the fact that the reasons for the Bloc supporting this en masse 
last June were that they were setting the terrain under a referendum 
condition where if they were looking for constitutional amendment 
that the amendment in Newfoundland would be a terrific precedent. 
How can we rubber stamp something in Newfoundland and have a 
difference in Quebec?
<P>
	There is something else that is really important of which 
members of the House and the people of Canada should be aware 
and that is what has happened in the Senate over the last four 
months. Without exception most bills that the House of Commons 
has put to the Senate have been supported in a timely fashion, in a 
constructive way. We could count on our hands the number of bills 
which have come back to the House for amendment over the last 
three years.
<P>
	There has to be some concern, some heads up, when we have an 
amendment to term 17 that is supported by a majority of the 
Senators. When the speeches that were given on this issue in the 
Senate are analysed, it is  interesting to read some of the remarks 
that some of the Senators who have great constitutional experience 
and credibility have tabled in the other chamber.
<P>
	I would like to refer specifically to Senator Kirby who gave a 
speech in the other chamber on November 7. It is important when 
members read Senator Kirby's remarks that they realize the 
experience and background of this Senator. This Senator was the 
most senior public servant constitutional adviser for the then 
minister of justice who campaigned coast to coast, and even in 
Westminster, for the repatriation of the Constitution.
<P>
	This is the Senator, who was the most senior adviser, who spent 
literally thousands and thousands of hours along with expert 
lawyers from the Department of Justice and other expert lawyers 
across Canada to make sure that the Constitution was crafted in a 
way that would ultimately be accepted by this chamber. Having 
Senator Kirby weigh in on this issue so profoundly is something 
this Chamber cannot ignore. His experience, respect and sensitivity 
were brought to bear on this issue such that the entire membership 
of the other Chamber gave him extended time so that his remarks 
could be fully recorded.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I am sorry to interrupt the 
hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood, but it being 1.15 p.m., 
pursuant to order made earlier this day, the House will now proceed 
to the taking of the deferred recorded division on Motion No. 10

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I declare the motion 
carried.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Mr. Speaker, you did not take the vote with 
respect to the NDP caucus and with respect to ways and means 
Motion No. 12, New Democratic Party members in this House vote 
no on the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The hon. member for 
Regina-Lumsden will know that was the effect of the consent that 
was given in the application of the vote, because I believe his party 
voted no on Motion No. 10 as well.
<P>
	The House will now proceed to the taking of the deferred 
recorded division on the subamendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Unless I 
am mistaken, you asked for the approval of the House, but the 
government whip did not say which way the government was going 
to vote.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Just to clarify the position 
for the House, the chief government whip asked that the vote taken 
on Motion No. 10, which was the first vote, be applied to the 
second vote. I sought the consent of the House to make that 
application. Two names were added by the Reform whip and 
subject to that, I thought there was House agreement that it be done 
and I declared the motion carried. That is why there was not an 
indication as to how the government would be voting. It was clear 
from the proposal which the chief government whip put to the 
House.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Mr.

minutes before question period after which I will resume my

<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	Before the taking of the votes I said that we had a responsibility 
to look at the work of Senator Kirby who took part in the debate on 
the proposed amendment to term 17 in the other House. We on this 
side of the House should show some respect for the remarks that he 
made in the other House on term 17.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier our Liberal government put almost total 
trust in him when we were developing the campaign to repatriate 
the Constitution. It would be abnormal for us to dismiss his 
remarks just because subsequent to his career as a public servant 
advising the government we put him in the Senate. To think that 
just because a person has been appointed to the Senate he loses his 
ability to judge and be fair does not make sense in my view.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, the Senate with unanimous consent gave 
Senator Kirby extended time to develop his argument. I am sure 
many members after they read his speech and go through his 
remarks will realize that his motivation for proposing this 
amendment to term 17 is not for partisan reasons. There is no 
mischief here. He has had great loyalty to the Liberal Party and the 
government for over 20 years.
<P>
	Some of the other senators who supported the amendment are 
highly respected constitutional lawyers.

	<B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to share with other members of this House the grave concerns of 
my constituents on the state of health care in Ontario.
<P>
	Kristine Etten wrote about the lack of prenatal care for Ontario 
women. She stated: ``Women are being turned away by 
obstetricians-.When the time comes for them to deliver there will 
be no pediatrician available if there are any complications with the 
baby. If this had been the case seven months ago, I have to wonder 
if my daughter would be with me today''.
<P>
	I was also moved by a letter from Mrs. Maria Pankratz, 89 years 
old, who wrote last month about the extra burden being placed on 
seniors for medication costs. She stated: ``I just don't know what to 
do. I have willingly fended for myself all my life till I no longer 
could. I've been very thankful for what my country has done for 
me. But now I'm scared and sick. What now?''
<P>
	Cuts to health care are not trivial. They hurt those who are most 
in need of help. They hurt seniors and children who are the 
innocent victims of Ontario's attack on health care.
<P>
	I appeal to the province of Ontario to come to its senses. Do not 
follow in the footsteps of Alberta and cut, cut, cut only to back 
pedal and return money to a wounded health care system after 
people have been hurt and jobs have been lost.
<P>
	There are some things we must support and demand. One of 
those things is proper health care.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
great pleasure to congratulate Bilkis Vissandjée on winning the 
Thérèse F. Casgrain Fellowship. She will be doing in depth 
research on female genital mutilation and its effects on immigrant 
women in Quebec.
<P>
	In 1994, I brought the problem of female genital mutilation to 
the attention of this House and I note with pleasure that my efforts 
have brought some measure of results. This practice was again 
criticized at the Beijing conference, because it threatens the 
physical and psychological well-being of women.
<P>
	Ms. Vissandjée's research points strongly to the importance of 
striking a balance between the needs of women and those of men in 
the area of research. We can only hope that this research will 
provide some help to girls and women.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TEENPREGNANCIES">TEEN PREGNANCIES</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in Canada every year we have an epidemic that few are 
willing to talk about and that is the epidemic of teen pregnancies.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	The statistics are staggering, with teen pregnancies doubling in 
the last 10 years alone. One-fifth of girls under the age of 20 
become pregnant and 58 per cent give birth. One-third of these girls 
drop out of high school and the children of these mothers often 
have higher educational and social problems. The costs to our 
social system is over $7 billion a year.
<P>
	The future is often quite bleak for the mothers and children who 
often live a life of poverty, and yet this is an avoidable tragedy. To 
stem the tide schools need effective sex education programs, and 
sexual active teens need safe, effective measures of birth control.
<P>
	Prevention is the best medicine. I implore the Minister of Health 
to work with his provincial counterparts to develop intelligent, safe 
strategies to address this terrible tragedy among us.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Beauce, Ind.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the matter of 
copyright reform, I would encourage the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage to ensure that broadcasters will obtain justly and 
permanently the time-shifting and ephemeral recording rights they 
are after.
<P>
	It is essential these rights be included in Bill C-32 to avoid 
unduly complicating the operations of small regional radio stations 
on a small budget. This is often the only way to provide good 
service to their evening and weekend listeners.
<P>
	Furthermore, time-shifting rights do not deprive artists of their 
royalties, and broadcasters are prepared to accept measures to 
protect against the abuse of these rights. I hope that common sense 
will prevail throughout the legislative process of Bill C-32.

	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the longest 
journey begins with one step. I congratulate Health Canada for 
taking a step in the fight against myalgic encephalomyelitis and 
fibromyalgia.
<P>
	Health Canada has recognized a revised chronic fatigue 
syndrome case definition for research purposes. This is thanks to 
the 10,000 people in Ontario and the 5,000 from other provinces 
who have signed petitions presented to the House in May.
<P>
	It is also thanks to the efforts of the ME/FM<I> </I>Action Network. 
Health Canada can now take the step to boost further awareness by 
formally announcing the recognition of ME/FM. Parliament should 
move forward by setting up a health subcommittee to study and 
hear witnesses on ME/FM.
<P>
	These diseases affect over 100,000 Canadians. Many times 
healthy, vital people are reduced to an inability of coping. We can 
no longer afford to be robbed of so many productive citizens by a 
disease for which we do not know the cause and we do not know the 
cure.
<P>
	Let us remedy this situation. We must act now to raise 
awareness, continue research and find a cure.

	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians regard our health care system as a fundamental part of 
our national identity. In all regions of Canada, whenever they are 
consulted, the people of Canada express very clearly that they 
expect governments at all levels to preserve and protect our 
national system of health care.
<P>
	Canadians insist that we maintain a single tier system equally 
accessible to all Canadians based on need and not on one's ability 
to pay. This government agrees with this fundamental principle of 
fairness. Provincial premiers who think they can ignore the 
national health care act and the wishes of the Canadian people had 
better think again.
<P>
	It is pathetic to see irresponsible right wing premiers slashing 
health services only to restore funding later because they admit 
they got carried away.
<P>
	Canadians treasure our health care system but they are worried 
about its future. This Liberal government can and will ensure that 
the system is improved and maintained for the good health of all 
Canadians; one national system accessible to all Canadians on the 
basis of need and not on their ability to pay.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HEALTHCARE">HEALTH CARE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadians have been telling us time and time again that 
maintaining our health care system is by far their first priority. In a 
recent survey close to 80 per cent of Canadians said that they 
preferred to maintain a good health care system even if it means 
fewer tax cuts.
<P>
	Also, medicare provides competitive advantages to companies 
operating in Canada. These advantages include lower employee 
benefit costs-I would like the Reform to please listen to the 
House-a mobile workforce that can respond to where the jobs are, 
the elimination of health care as a major source of 
labour-management disputes and work stoppages and a health work 
force.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our health system is the envy of the entire world. It must be 
maintained at all cost. This member and this government will not 
make cuts in the style of Mike Harris and then cut taxes for the well 
to do. I would willingly give back the $600 that Mr. Harris would 
have me save in order to insure the health of my parents, children 
and grandchildren.

week, Justice René Dussault, co-chair of the Royal Commission on 
Aboriginal Peoples, recognized that the situation of aboriginal 
people was significantly better in Quebec than in the rest of 
Canada. Their economic situation, as well as the protection of their 
language and agreements like the James Bay agreement reflect the 
development of aboriginal nations in Quebec.
<P>
	Since 1983, the Quebec government has developed a clear policy 
that shows respect for aboriginal people by adopting 15 basic 
principles to guide the government in negotiating with them. These 
principles include the recognition of Quebec's aboriginal peoples 
as distinct nations.
<P>
	This recognition is a necessary first step to any serious 
negotiation, especially respectful negotiations, with the aboriginal 
peoples of Canada. Quebec granted them this recognition 10 years 
ago. What is the federal government waiting for to follow suit?

located in my riding of Rosedale.
<P>
	For over 80 years Women's College Hospital has been dedicated 
to the advancing concerns of women's health in an atmosphere 
unlike any other hospital. It has enabled us to craft some innovative 
responses to women's health concerns that have received global

<P>
	It is becoming increasingly apparent that the health of women in 
all countries, particularly in the developing world, is of extreme 
importance since women are largely responsible for the education, 
health and safety of children and the overall management of the 
family.
<P>
	For this reason, Women's College Hospital has been very active 
in the worldwide promotion of women's health. In fact, the World 
Health Organization is currently considering an application 
submitted by the hospital for it to become one of the World Health 
Organization's collaborating centres.

September I wrote the Liberal government asking for an 
investigation into gas prices. After two months of investigation, the 
Competition Bureau has yet to report its findings.
<P>
	Now, in addition to high gas prices, we are seeing skyrocketing 
propane prices across western and northern Canada. Propane has 
increased by more than 130 per cent in Manitoba alone. This means 
an added major expense for farmers trying to dry their wet crops, 
homeowners paying higher costs to heat their homes and business 
people who use propane.
<P>
	Meanwhile the Liberals in Ottawa continue to ignore the effects 
of energy price hikes. They continue to spin myths about 
consumers having a choice in buying their fuel from a handful of 
multinational oil companies that all raise prices at the same time, 
gouging Canadians equally.
<P>
	Propane is the fuel of choice for many who are trying to be 
environmentally friendly but it is now being priced out of reach 
unjustifiably.
<P>
	I am now calling on the Liberal government to take action to 
defend consumers, farmers and business people from propane price 
gouging by the big oil companies.

<P>
	Several constituents from my riding, namely Helen Heeney, Jay

In the face of such a scourge, all resources must be mobilized to 
ensure prevention, treatment, care and research continue.
<P>
	Each new victory is the result of concerted efforts both 
nationally and internationally. This government hardly contributes 
to these efforts, as the departure of our most brilliant researchers 
and the lack of funding for long term research jeopardize the 
future.
<P>
	That is why I urge the federal government to maintain, better yet 
to increase, funding for the National AIDS Strategy and 
particularly for AIDS research. We must carry on and press ahead.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my office has been flooded with calls because the price of 
propane has more than doubled since August. Desperate seniors 
have contacted me to ask how  they will afford to pay for heat with 
their fixed incomes. Some northern farmers are still struggling to 
dry whatever damp grain they manage to harvest. Those who 
depend on propane are now spending $100 per week to heat their 
homes, with further increases predicted.
<P>
	People believe these hikes represent the gouging of a captive 
market by the big gas companies. Propane is a byproduct of natural 
gas production, yet we have not seen a similar doubling of natural 
gas prices.
<P>
	Producers say there is a shortage because of a fire in one plant in 
Mexico. Is this credible? With no adequate explanation or 
justification from the industry, consumers view these increases as 
extortion. Reform believes in the operation of a free market but it is 
free only when there is no price fixing and when anti-combines

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> We want Gauthier.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe: </B>They are getting excited on the other side, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	In the Canadian affair, the Minister of Finance said, in reply to a 
question from the official opposition, that the fuel tax rebate will 
apply to all airlines. The minister added that, in return, companies 
will have to give up, and I quote, ``substantial'' tax write-offs.
<P>
	Exactly how substantial are these tax write-offs, and for how 
long does the minister expect this measure to be in effect?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
there is a precedent in this case, that being the offer made to 
airlines in the early 1990s.
<P>
	We are holding discussions, which include the Minister of 
Transport, in order to work out the details and decide if the offer 
will be the same one or a different one. As soon as all the details 
have been worked out, and the minister is in a position to make an 
announcement, he will do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in other words, when the minister used the term 
``substantial'', he had no specific figure in mind. In other words, he 
made a statement without knowing what the consequences would 
be. This is interesting, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I put the following question to the minister. Perhaps he has an 
idea on this one: How many tens of millions of dollars will 
taxpayers have to fork over in order to make up for the financial 
shortfall arising from this fuel tax rebate?
<P>
	I imagine that, in announcing a tax rebate, the Minister of 
Finance has some idea of the cost. I hope he does.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the member across the way knows very well that there is a time and 
a place for announcing details. As I have just said, what I did 
Friday was to give a general indication of the offer that will be 
made to all airlines; this indication is based on a precedent. When 
the Minister of Transport and I are ready, the Minister of Transport 
will make the details public.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when a finance minister talks about a tax rebate, he should 
normally anticipate certain results. I do not think these are details. 
They may be details for the Minister of Finance, but they are a 
source of worry for Canadians.
<P>
	This same minister admitted that Canadian's main problem was 
its poor management, thereby agreeing with the opposition. He 
confirmed the Prime Minister's statement of two weeks ago that 
there was no question of coming to the financial assistance of 
Canadian.
<P>

with the recent decision to help Canadian get back on its financial 
feet again?

	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the position of the government was clear all along. We 
believe that the restructuring proposal of a private company which 
requires not only the agreement of management but of its unions 
should be put in place before there is any government response.
<P>
	It was, in large measure, put in place by Wednesday of last week. 
We then responded to the proposal put forward by the management 
of Canadian and four of the unions. Two unions were outside the 
proposal. One has since joined. We are now waiting-five unions, 
one company management and three governments-for the 
response of the final union.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	To provide some background, just before the Prime Minister left 
for Asia, he stated that there was no question of bailing out 
Canadian International. A few hours after the PM's departure, his 
Minister of Transport met behind closed doors with the directors of 
Canadian International and employee representatives. The outcome 
of this was a promise of assistance via a fuel tax reduction, a 
promise on which we do not yet have details on either the exact 
mechanisms or the financial impact on the taxpayer.
<P>
	Is the Minister of Transport aware that, by decreasing the fuel 
tax for all airlines, he is not helping Canadian International in the 
least, because its competitors will be able to take advantage of the 
cut to reduce fares, so, in the long run Canadian will end up in just

as much of a  hole as before, and the big losers in all this will be the 
Canadian taxpayers?

	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bloc members should co-ordinate their questioning a little 
better. On the one hand, they say that we are trying to favour 
Canadian Airlines and, on the other hand, their official critic on 
transport is saying that it would in fact be even-handed.
<P>
	The hon. member is more or less correct. It is even-handed. It 
will apply to all airlines and is not specific to Canadian Airlines.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Bloc is concerned with the future of air travel in 
Canada, not the protection of one company.

	How could the Minister of Transport have shown such a lack of 
basic prudence and judgment as to announce government 
assistance to Canadian International, without even knowing the 
costs and the mechanisms for the measure he was proposing?

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the earlier questions from the Bloc asked for very specific 
information. Now we have another question which is much more 
general.
<P>
	Yes, there will be a loss to the treasury and to various airlines 
from the reduction in tax. But there would be a much greater loss to 
the federal treasury if the second carrier in Canada, the one which 
provides competition and is one of the fundamental components of 
our competitive air transport policy, was allowed to go down for 
want of a relatively small amount of tax.
<P>

not be collecting those taxes in any event.

<P>
	Justice Krever's inquiry has now led him right to the doorstep of

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

it was the commission's lawyer, in December of 1985, who made

<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Justice Krever thinks this information, particularly the 
information about why the legislative regulations were not 
proceeded with, may hold the key to why our blood supply killed 
thousands of Canadians, yet the government refuses to release all 
of the pertinent documents. We are talking about the national 
interest, the public interest in health. Is the security of our blood 
supply not part of the national interest? Is finding out why 
Canadians died not in the national interest?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

claim of the hon. member. In fact, the former minister of health, 
who could shed some light on the situation, stated publicly that she 
would be very happy to testify before the Krever commission.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the commission's counsel made a decision not to 
call any previous ministers. I would advise the hon. member that if 
he is quite serious about getting to the bottom of the matter, he 
might advise the commission to rethink its decision not to call any 
ministers to testify before the inquiry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the commission wants documents that pertain to why draft 
legislation and draft regulations that might have prevented this 
tragedy were not proceeded with. Those are the documents the 
commission wants.
<P>
	In August 1984 when the current Prime Minister was Deputy 
Prime Minister, Health Canada scientists were sounding alarms 
about the dangers of AIDS and legislation was drafted that might 
have protected the blood supply. The warning and the legislation 
was ignored by both Liberal and Tory governments and tainted 
blood victims, their families and all Canadians deserve to know 
why.

giving Krever all the information he needs to get to the bottom of 
the tainted blood supply?

he check whether it is true Mr. Chamberland got around it by the 
skin of his teeth and only because he testified under the protection 
of the Canada Evidence Act?
<P>
	Does the minister himself not find it odd that, as its senior 
official in Quebec, CSIS is appointing Mr. Chamberland, a 
specialist in undercover work, who, as the Keable commission 
confirmed, never apparently hesitated to use illegal means to 
achieve his ends?

all these matters were gone into thoroughly by the McDonald royal

the form of CSIS. I think that the action in question has been 
proven appropriate and in the public interest over time. I think this 
speaks for itself.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government has been very adamant that the changes to 
the tax regime for Canadian Airlines will help them in the current 
situation. It is conditional on the employees accepting the 
restructuring plan.
<P>
	Earlier in question period the Minister of Transport stated that he 
is waiting on the response from the sixth union, the CAW. We have 
heard that response and it is very clear that Mr. Hargrove is equally 
adamant that his members are not going to be allowed to vote.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	All weekend I have been receiving faxes from Canadian Airline 
employees, some pleading for help, some stating: ``Regretfully to 
Hargrove we did not authorize you to have the final say. We only 
authorized you to negotiate on our behalf''.
<P>
	Is the Minister of Transport prepared to take some action or is he 
actually prepared to allow Canadian's restructuring plan to 
collapse?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in no way do we want the Canadian restructuring program 
to collapse. It is extremely important to that company.
<P>
	I must be very candid with the House and the hon. member. It is 
a matter of great regret that one of the six unions is refusing to take 
part in the restructuring proposal of three governments, the 
company and the five unions.
<P>
	However, if I can respond directly to the hon. member's 
question, it is a matter of my experience over the last week that the 
Canadian autoworkers and Mr. Hargrove did not always take 
exactly the same position from day to day. I think now that he 
realizes that the management of the company is attempting to 
restructure debt repayment, Mr. Hargrove will realize the critical 
importance of joining in a collective effort to save this airline.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have met with many labour groups in the past to discuss 
problems with strike lockout settlement mechanisms. They have 
pointed out it is very rarely used because the threat of using it 
generally causes settlement.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Labour. Given that the labour 
code does not permit the government to ensure the democratic 
rights of Canadian's employees, if the government is not ready to 
act yet, will it at least amend section 108(1) of the labour code so 
that it would be in a position to take action when it decides it may 
be necessary?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of  Commons, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I told the House last week that section 108(1) does not 
apply in this case. This is the restructuring of a company. I invite 
the leadership of the union, the president of the Canadian auto-

<P>
workers, to negotiate with the Minister of Transport and come to a 
settlement like the other unions who accept this package so that 
Canadian Airlines International can continue to operate.
<P>
	I do not think it is proper for the government to amend the labour 
code at this time. As a matter of fact, we are in the process of 
amending the labour code. It is before a committee of the House. It 
took us three years to get it there, negotiating and creating a 
consensus with union and management, something the Reform 
Party does not believe in.

directed to the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	On November 22, when asked why people in the Magdalen 
Islands had been waiting since 1994 for the federal government to 
buy a new ferry, the minister refused to reply, claiming he was not 
aware of the case. However, over two years ago, his department set 
aside $30 million to replace the ferry, and the minister is now 
sitting on this money instead of responding to the needs of the 
people in the Magdalen Islands.
<P>
	Now that he has had two more weeks to read a file that has been 
on his desk for two years, could the minister tell us why he does not 
go ahead and buy the new ferry as requested by all groups in the 
Magdalen Islands?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the member will recall his earlier question, he related it 
to a letter that had been sent the day before of which I did not have 
a copy at that time.
<P>
	With respect to the issue of the ferry to the Madeleine Islands, 
the situation is quite clear. He is correct, there was money put aside 
for the purchase of a new ferry. I might add there is also an existing 
ferry which will serve well for the immediate future. In due course 
we will replace that ferry with another one.
<P>
	The important fact to remember is that there are many changes 
taking place in Atlantic Canada with respect to ferry services. A 
good number of vessels are coming free or being released from 
certain routes which previously were taken up. The situation is 
flexible. We hope to obtain a ship within the price limit that he has 
suggested to this House.

new government program to deal with the problem of child 
poverty.
<P>
	The Reform Party agrees that something must be done to address 
this issue. Will the Minister of Human Resources Development 
consider giving low income Canadians tax relief as an approach to 
child poverty rather than create another big government program?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very glad to see that the 
opposition will be working with us to improve the lot of children in 
Canada. This is a very important issue and I thank the member very 
much.
<P>
	We were very successful last week at the ministerial council with 
the provinces. We identified child poverty as something we really 
wanted to work on. We are looking into an integrated child benefit. 
That was a prominent issue on all of our agendas. We were quite 
pleased to see that the provinces welcomed that initiative. They 
could see that we could work in a complementary fashion with 
them.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, bigger and better government programs may be 
well-intentioned but have left a very poor track record. We will 
thank the minister when he actually accomplishes something. 
However, statistics tell another story of the past.
<P>
	One in five Canadian children live in poverty. That is 1.4 million 
children in all. The most recent increase is among children who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6960"> 6960 </A></B>
<P>
live in families with working parents. Families have suffered a 
$3,000 national pay cut since 1993 due to tax increases. Rising 
taxes are exactly why the working poor have less money for their 
children.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Human Resources Development not see 
that it makes more sense to cut taxes to the working poor? That 
would leave more money in each pay cheque rather than giving 
them a government cheque through another big government 
program?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

do not pay taxes which is the reason we are looking for a more 
sophisticated system.

question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	On Thursday, the minister said, and I quote: ``We have a lot of 
compassion for the Singer employees, and because these workers 
deserve more than pretty speeches, we will examine the substance 
of the case''. However, we learned this morning that the minister's 
compassion does not extend beyond rhetoric. He refuses to follow 
up on the request made by retired Singer employees and leaves 
them no choice but to go to court.
<P>
	Will the minister tell this House the true reasons for his 
department's refusal to give fair treatment to retired people?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the compassion we feel for 
retired Singer employees is very real. The issues they raised are 
extremely complex. These are legal issues which are complex and 
also very important.
<P>
	As the minister, I have a duty to make sure the plan is 
administered in accordance with the law. It is for reasons of justice 
that we could not reach an out of court settlement, as Singer 
employees may have wished, given the very complex legal issues 
involved.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	We could not do this, because depending on the agreement 
reached, as many as 70,000 other retired people could have been 
affected, based on the information I have. This is why we have to 
go to court.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I think 
the truth just came out. The minister alluded to the financial 
implications that a favourable settlement could have, given that it 
could affect 2,000 other groups. He referred to 70,000 people, but 
in fact there are 2,000 other groups that could also seek fair 
treatment from the federal government.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that the government is trying to avoid its 
responsibilities, and showing contempt for Singer's retired 
employees who, on average, are 80 years old?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the way to ensure fairness is 
precisely to go before the courts. There are complex legal issues 
involved. It will be up to the courts to decide what constitutes fair 
treatment. It is because of the complexity of the case that we 
decided to go that route.
<P>
	Had we reached an agreement based on humanitarian grounds, 
we might have been forced to reopen 2,000 other cases affecting an 
additional 70,000 people. It is precisely to make sure we respect the 
law that we decided to go before the courts, instead of reaching any 
kind of agreement.

matter how the government tries to spin it, the government's record 
with respect to the poor is absolutely appalling: 10 per cent 
unemployment, record high levels of personal debt, record 
bankruptcies in this country, and record high taxes that amount to a 
$3,000 national pay cut since the government came to power. This 
has transformed many middle class families into the working poor. 
The working poor do not have the option of registering their assets 
offshore to lower their taxes.
<P>
	Why is our millionaire finance minister so opposed to lowering 
taxes for the working poor?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
should be made very clear lest the Reform Party members are 
trying to convey another impression, that their budget would deal a 
devastating blow to the working poor.
<P>
	The Reform Party would cut welfare. Reform members have 
said themselves that they would cut welfare substantially. They 
have said that they would cut equalization payments. Does that 
mean that the working poor in Atlantic Canada, Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba are not entitled to a fair shake? They would cut health 
care upon which the working poor are so dependent.
<P>
	What we have essentially said is that we will provide directed 
programs to help the working poor. As the Minister of Human 
Resources Development has said, in the last budget we doubled the 
working income supplement from $500 to $1,000. That is money in 
their hands which is what the working poor require.

cement in particular. Bear in mind that more than 2,000 jobs 
depend directly on this industry in Thetford and Asbestos, in 
Quebec.
<P>
	In light of the fact that France's reaction is guided by emotional 
rather than rational, scientific reasons, what is the minister waiting

the exemptions sought or $20 million in compensation for lost 
exports?
<P>

in a consultation with the people of that community with respect to 
this matter. I assured them that the federal government will be 
doing everything it possibly can to preserve the jobs and those 
communities that depend upon the asbestos industry.
<P>
	The representations we have made to the French government are 
not stopping. Yes, they have made a political decision that they 
want to ban the product, but they also have a review mechanism. 
Every year they have to look at the question of substitute products. 
It is our hope and expectation that they will look at the safe uses of 
asbestos products, particularly in cement piping, as something that 
will be acceptable. We will continue to press that case.

	Meanwhile, we will continue to press that this does not spread 
into other parts of the European Community or other parts of the

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
heritage minister and her department are ramming  Bill C-32 which 
amends Canadian copyright law through committee. However 
today in Geneva, Canadian government officials are participating 
in discussions on intellectual property rights, copyright. These 
international treaties will render Bill C-32 obsolete before they are 
even debated in this Chamber.
<P>
	Does the heritage minister have any idea about what is going on? 
Why are we wasting our time in committee?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canada is participating in the international copyright 
negotiations that are going on in Geneva under the auspices of the 
World Intellectual Property Organization. This is normal. I am sure 
the hon. member would not expect that we would do other than 
participate in these discussions.
<P>
	I am sure he is also aware that in the case of many of these 
agreements, Canada does not necessarily sign on. For that matter, if 
agreements were entered into at an international level that required 
obligations on the part of Canada which were inconsistent with the 
provisions of our copyright law and to which we wished to 
subscribe, then of course we would present the appropriate 
legislation to Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is no 
surprise that the heritage minister did not stand, even though Bill 
C-32 was brought to this House under the heritage minister.
<P>
	I ask again. Considering that the legislation which is presently 
before committee was brought forward by the heritage minister and 
that Canadian officials are presently in Geneva negotiating on 
copyright legislation that very well may end up making Bill C-32 
redundant, can she possibly explain to the House what is going on 
and who is in charge?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can only speak on behalf 
of the members of Parliament who have participated in the process 
over the last number of months. I believe they have heard 60 
representations which represent thousands of Canadians. It is a 
very significant piece of legislation and will complement existing 
copyright laws which date back a number of years.
<P>
	I only hope that the work the members of the committee have put 
into the copyright process will be respected. I certainly have no 
reason to suspect that the work of the members is irrelevant. In fact 
members on all sides have made very significant contributions. We 
expect to entertain approximately 60 or 70 amendments precisely 
because of the work by members of the standing committee.

	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport and concerns 
Canadian Airlines.
<P>
	As the minister knows, it has been federal Liberal and 
Conservative deregulation policies that have led to massive 
overcapacity and empty seats and destructive competition in the 
airline industry.
<P>
<B>(1500)</B>
<P>
	Will the minister ensure the level of federal funds needed to keep 
Canadian Airlines flying, bearing in mind that the B.C. government 
alone has committed over $12 million? Most important, will the 
government show leadership and put in place policies necessary to 
stabilize the airline industry and to ensure the continued long term 
survival of Canadian Airlines?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am always amazed by the New Democratic Party's 
enthusiasm for moving forward into the past.
<P>
	We have a deregulated system now which has created dramatic 
opportunity, first for Canadian consumers for whom the whole air 
transport system is set up. They have more choice, cheaper fares 
and they are using these fares in occupying these seats more 
frequently.
<P>
	Deregulation has increased, in addition, the jobs available to 
Canadians as flight attendants, ticket agents, machinists and pilots. 
The whole industry has benefited by increased employment.
<P>
	Again, the hon. member and his party would prefer to cut out 
those jobs and go back to the old system of regulation where fares 
would be, I point out, approximately $1,700 across this country 
instead of an average of $700. That is their policy, Raise fares, 
reduce competition, reduce jobs and in turn have people travel on 
foreign airlines instead of Canadian.

	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
sales for Canada savings bonds have been released and I notice that 
they are looking very good. I wonder if the Minister of Finance 
could tell us what these figures mean to Canada savings bonds.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would be delighted to. As the hon. member knows, this is the first 
year of the new government retail debt agency, Canada Investment 
and Savings. In this, the first year, I am delighted to say that 1996 
Canada savings bonds sales have totalled $5.7 billion, an increase 
of 24 per cent over last year.
<P>
	After redemptions the sales were 38 per cent higher than last 
year. This reflects partially certainly the innovative 10 year 
guaranteed minimum pricing structure that is so well suited to 
Canadians.
<P>
	For those who might not have had a chance to buy Canada 
savings bonds and who would like to, the government will be 
introducing a new retirement savings product to be launched in 
February in time for the RRSP season.
<P>
	I would like to thank all participating employers for their efforts 
and all Canadians who bought Canada savings bonds.

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, today I am reintroducing an amended 
version of my firearms law sunset act which I first introduced in 
this House on September 28, 1995. My bill is the total opposite of 
Bill C-68 and the regulations tabled by the Minister of Justice last 
week.
<P>
	Bill C-68 and any subsequent decrees issued by the minister are 
based on his opinion and the false hope that they will somehow 
improve public safety.
<P>
	The reason I say my bill is the opposite of Bill C-68 is that my 
firearms law sunset act is based on the premise that any gun control 
laws passed by the government should be automatically repealed 
after five years unless they can pass a public safety test 
administered by the auditor general.
<P>
	The constitutionality of Bill C-68 is being challenged in court by 
four provinces and two territories. They are also opting out of the 
unreasonable burden of administering this federal boondoggle. My 
bill will be supported by people and politicians in these provinces.
<P>
	Bill C-68 will guarantee that gun controls are both costly and 
ineffective, whereas my bill will guarantee that every gun control 
law has to be both successful and cost effective in saving lives and 
reducing the criminal use of firearms. People arguing against my 
bill would have to argue that they support gun control even if it 
does not work and no matter how much it costs.

reduction represents a major drop in their income. Furthermore, 
some of these people are already receiving social assistance.

	The first petition is from concerned citizens who believe there is 
profound inadequacy in the sentencing practices concerning 
individuals convicted of impaired driving charges.
<P>
	They therefore pray and request that Parliament proceed 
immediately with amendments to the Criminal Code that will 
ensure that the sentence given to anyone convicted of driving while 
impaired or causing injury or death while impaired reflects both the 
severity of the crime and zero tolerance by Canada toward this 
crime.

system and how it continues to show leniency toward criminals. 
They believe that the current justice system has failed to address 
society's concerns. Current methods of punishment, they believe, 
are not acting as proper deterrents and are not producing the 
desired effects of lower crime rates and safer communities.
<P>
	The petitioners humbly pray and call on Parliament to amend the 
appropriate laws to include corporal punishment as an alternate 
method of punishment for those adults who are repeat offenders 
and choose not to be governed by more conventional methods.

greater Montreal region and in Quebec generally.
<P>
	Your petitioners call upon Parliament to initiate proceedings to 
abolish the Senate, in spite of the fact that a motion to that effect 
has already been rejected by this House. Your petitioners argue as 
follows: they consider that the Senate consists of non-elected 
individuals who are not accountable for their actions; that the 
Senate's operating budget is $43 million annually; that the Senate 
refuses to account for these votes to committees of the House of

have a number of petitions, one of which has 1,809 signatures. 
Apparently it is a result of the Liberals not going with a national 
victims' bill of rights.
<P>
	It states that the charter of rights and freedoms protects all 
Canadians, including those convicted of crimes. Victims of crimes 
require a specific right in the justice system as it is they, as 
members of society, for whom our laws are designed to protect. 
Our justice system must give victims specific rights as it does with 
the criminal to make our justice system fair for all.

<P>
	The petitioners state that in June 1996 the Prime Minister of 
Canada announced he would work toward diverting the Sable 
Island gas pipeline to Quebec City, that it is unacceptable for the 
Prime Minister to decide the destination of Nova Scotia natural gas 
without consulting Nova Scotians, that Nova Scotians assert their

attention to the increasing frequency of spousal abuse and violence.
<P>
	In the hopes of averting future violence, the petitioners ask that

and Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners note that in Canada corporate contributions to 
public revenue are already the lowest among all major G-7 
economies. It notes that the individual share of federal revenue has 
risen steadily while the corporation share has declined. It is very 
critical of the Liberal GST scheme announced in April this year 
that would add another $6 billion of corporate tax responsibilities 
to individuals.
<P>
	Therefore, the petitioners call on Parliament to not proceed with 
the Liberal GST scheme or any other plan to further reduce the 
remaining corporate taxes at the expense of middle class working 
individuals and families.

	<B>Mr. Rex Crawford (Kent, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am honoured 
once again to present, pursuant to Standing Order 36, a petition 
from not only my constituents but the constituents of other 
members. The petitioners are from Wallaceburg, Chatham, 
Paincourt, Ridgetown, Tilbury, Charing Cross, Blenheim, North 
Buxton and Port Alma.
<P>
	The petitioners state that there are profound inadequacies in the 
sentencing practices concerning individuals convicted of impaired 
driving charges. Canada must embrace a philosophy of zero 
tolerance toward individuals who drive while impaired by alcohol  
or drugs. Victims of the crime of impaired driving must be given 
the highest priority as reflected by their statements prior to 
sentencing of anyone convicted of impaired driving. In the case of 
impaired driving causing death or injury, sentencing must reflect 
the severity of the crime.
<P>
	The petitioners pray and request that Parliament proceed 
immediately with amendments to the Criminal Code that will 
ensure the sentence given to anyone convicted of driving while 
impaired or causing injury or death while impaired reflects both the 
severity of the crime and zero tolerance toward this crime.

	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
privilege, pursuant to Standing Order 36, to present a petition on 
behalf of a number of constituents, particularly a woman called 
Penny Tardi from Kamloops, who points out the increased costs of 
propane in western Canada, 30, 40, 80 and 100 per cent increases in 
some communities, all of which have taken place over the last few 
days.
<P>
	The petition also points out that to heat a typical mobile home in 
Kamloops using propane costs about $75 a week as a result of these 
increased costs. It is a serious situation.
<P>
	The petitioners call on the Government of Canada to take action, 
whether it is in the form of an energy price review commission or 
asking the combines investigation bureau to investigate, but to do 
something to bring some sense to the marketplace with regard to 
propane.

	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have another 
petition which has to do with tax revenues. The petition is signed 
by constituents of Kamloops.
<P>
	The petitioners point out that tax revenues from the corporate 
sector now account for less than 7 per cent of all national revenues, 
with the balance being paid by individuals. A few years ago it was 
on a 50:50 basis. Now it is on a 90 plus basis for individual 
Canadians.
<P>
	The petitioners point out that this is wrong, unfair, unjust and 
needs to be reformed. They ask the Parliament of Canada to 
undertake a fair tax reform process so that consumers will not 
continue to suffer even more financial insecurity due to unfair costs 
at this critical time.

	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask that all 
questions be allowed to stand.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to draw your attention to the fact that on September 26, I 
put three questions on family trusts on the Order Paper and I have 
yet to receive a reply, although the Standing Orders provide for a 
maximum of 45 days. I am counting on your support to ensure that 
the parliamentary secretary concerned takes care of this case, 
because it a matter that is very much in the public's interest.
<P>
	For instance, I asked how many family trusts have been 
recognized by the Liberal government since 1972; how much this 
represents in terms of assets and how much revenue the Canadian 
tax system had to forego as a result of the introduction of this tax 
shelter. That was one of the three questions.
<P>
	I think that is of interest to all parliamentarians and all taxpayers 
in Canada and Quebec. I hope to receive a reply, especially 
considering the additional tax burden on all taxpayers, especially 
the neediest in our society. I think it is time to shed some light on 
the past and potential contributions of those who are in a better 
position to make them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a 
point of order. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that on 
September 17, I had three questions entered on the Order 
Paper-Questions Q-802, Q-812 and Q-822-and I have yet to 
receive a reply, in spite of the fact that the 45 days provided for in 
the Standing Orders have now expired.
<P>
	I shall reread them briefly, if I may, just to refresh the 
government's memory. Question Q-802 reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Q-802-With regard to the total budget for the Department of Natural Resources, 
and for each year since the 1987 fiscal year: (<I>a</I>) how much (in actual figures) and 
what proportion (in percentages) of its research and development budgets have been 
invested in Quebec, (<I>b</I>) how much and what percentage have been invested in 
Ontario (including the Ontario side of the national capital region and excluding the 
Quebec side of the national capital region), (<I>c</I>) what economic spin-off effects have 
there been from the Candu reactors in Quebec, (<I>d</I>) what economic spin-off effects 
have there been in Ontario, and (<I>e</I>) what financial commitment has the department 
made to the neutrino detection project in Ontario, the Triumph project in British 
Columbia and to Chalk River, Ontario?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The other two questions were complementary to this one. When 
can we expect a reply in your opinion?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Kraft Sloan:</B> Mr. Speaker, the House leader and the

<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, just before question period I tried to make the point that 
the speech in the other Chamber of Senator Kirby's was something 
I thought all of us in this House should take a look at.
<P>
	For those who have not had the benefit of reading his remarks I 
would like to take a couple of minutes and read an excerpt of his 
speech:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Honourable Senators, in 1867 this institution, the Canadian Senate, was set up 
specifically to safeguard minority and provincial rights. The issue in this debate is 
about minority rights. It is about the removal of a vested constitutional minority 
right. Section 93 of our 1867 Constitution, which is the equivalent of Term 17 for 
Newfoundland, was put in our Constitution specifically to protect minorities. There 
is no doubt about that fact.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In 1867, the Roman Catholic minority in Ontario was looking at a Protestant 
majority. Section 93 was put into the Constitution so that Ontario Catholics would be 
empowered to set up their own separate school system. Ontario Roman Catholics 
could have got that same power from a provincial statute. But statutes are subject to 
change by the provincial legislature. So, instead, section 93 was put into the 
Constitution. It was put there specifically to take the power to change the system 
away from the hands of the legislature. The exact same can be said of Section 22 of 
the Manitoba Act, Section 17 of the Saskatchewan and Alberta Acts, and 
Newfoundland's current Term 17.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To get around these facts, proponents of the proposed Amendment to Term 17 
have made the argument that minority rights are not being effected in this case. They 
argue that a strong constitutional guarantee continues to exist for religious minorities 
to operate their own schools under the proposed Amendment to Term 17. They point 
to the language of the proposed amendment that says schools established, 
maintained and operated with public funds shall be denominational schools.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6970"> 6970 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But the right to have a publicly funded denominational school under the proposed 
Term 17 comes under the words ``subject to provincial legislation that is uniformly 
applicable to all schools  specifying conditions for the establishment or continued 
operations of schools''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What does this mean? It means that the grant of a constitutional right to establish a 
denominational school in the new proposed Term 17 is subject to the laws 
established solely by the provincial legislature.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In other words, it would be possible for the Newfoundland government to pass 
legislation making it practically impossible to have a denominational school and 
there would be no recourse to the courts for the minorities currently protected by 
Term 17. The rights granted them in 1949 would be extinguished. In essence, the 
constitutional guarantee given to them at the time of the union with Canada would 
cease to exist.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The courts could only say to the aggrieved minority that yes, they do have the 
right to establish their own schools but it is subject to provincial legislation. The only 
inquiry after that is whether or not the provincial legislation in question is 
``uniformly applicable to all schools''. In the case that it is, courts could not help the 
aggrieved minority.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Are constitutional rights of any permanence or do minorities only possess them at 
the pleasure of the current provincial legislature? Let me set out my views on these 
questions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I believe that a basic purpose of a constitution is to establish and protect rights, not 
diminish them. That is an axiom that any first year law student learns. I know this 
because even though I am not a lawyer myself, I frequently lectured law school 
students on the Constitution.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While it is true that no rights exist in isolation from other rights, we look to the 
courts to balance them, not to provincial legislatures or indeed even to the Parliament 
of Canada acting alone. I can only conclude that the intention of the Newfoundland 
legislature in keeping the power under the proposed Amendment to term 17 to 
unilaterally change the education system in Newfoundland is at some point in the 
future the legislature may decide to exercise it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I want to be careful to say that I do not want to imply any ill will on the part of the 
Newfoundland legislature. I am only emphasizing the assumption that lies behind all 
exercises in constitution making. Simply stated, we have constitutions so that no 
party to a constitution can ever act unilaterally or arbitrarily.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For us to vote in favour of the proposed Amendment to Term 17 then, simply 
because the legislature of Newfoundland wants it, would be a gross abrogation of 
our duties as senators. We have an important part to play in this process and I am not 
willing to rubber-stamp this proposal simply because the Newfoundland legislature 
wants it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore, I reject the proponents third argument, that the Parliament of Canada, 
and we as Senators, have only a rubber-stamp role to play with respect to the rights 
of minorities in Newfoundland.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	Senator Kirby goes on. I believe that his argument has been 
made in my judgment in such a way that we in this House have a 
responsibility to really look at this closely. In light of that and in 
light of the vote in the Senate I would like to table and move an 
amendment. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended in the schedule entitled ``An amendment to the 
Constitution of Canada''</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) by adding the words ``where numbers warrant'' immediately before the word 
``any'' in subparagraph (b)(i) and;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) by adding the words ``determine and'' immediately following the words 
``observances and to'' in paragraph (c)</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's amendment has 
already been ruled receivable in the past and is certainly receivable 
in this debate as well. The debate will proceed on the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
conclusion, I appeal to this House that we consider this amendment 
because if we pass term 17 as it is currently on the floor of the 
House, we may eventually have a legislature in the province of 
Newfoundland that we do not feel as comfortable with as the 
current government. We might then one day be faced with a 
situation that could not work in the favour of minorities in that 
province and not be as reasonable. At the same time I would argue 
that we would also be setting a precedent that could be used in 
other provinces across Canada. As we know, these rights, as many 
have said, are part of what brought this country together, those 
rights that were enshrined in the Constitution.
<P>
	I would appeal to members to consider that in our vote later on 
today.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a few comments to make on the speech by my 
colleague from Broadview-Greenwood.
<P>
	It is both a duty and a pleasure for me to support the proposals by 
the member for Broadview-Greenwood, modifying the federal 
government motion to change term 17 of the agreement which 
brought about Newfoundland and Labrador's joining with Canada 
in 1949.
<P>
	At that time, the Constitution had been modified to enable 
Newfoundland and Labrador to join Canada under certain 
conditions. Term 17 gave Newfoundland the right to have 
denominational schools.
<P>
	Canada is made up of minorities, religious minorities, linguistic 
minorities, racial minorities. The Constitution protects the rights 
acquired by those minorities, and those acquired rights must not be 
changed without the minorities affected consenting to the 
constitutional changes, I repeat, they must not be changed without 
minority consent.
<P>
	In the early 20th century in Ontario, we had an example of 
regulation 17 preventing French-language education. Such a thing 
should never be allowed to happen again. Acquired rights are 
acquired rights, and the federal government has a duty to defend 
the rights and freedoms of individuals and communities when those 
rights and freedoms come under attack by the provinces.
<P>
	It is true that a referendum was held in Newfoundland; 50 per 
cent of the voters turned out. Just over 50 per  cent of the number 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6971"> 6971 </A></B>
<P>
that voted were in favour, which represents just barely over 25 per 
cent of the population who voted to change minority rights.
<P>
	Referendums are a dangerous thing. They make it possible for 
majorities to crush minorities. We saw that when the province of 
Quebec wanted to separate, or at least certain Quebec politicians 
wanted to separate Quebec from Canada, and a referendum was 
held.
<P>
	The members of the Reform Party would like to see a 
referendum held to abolish bilingualism and break the country 
apart. They have not yet, fortunately, succeeded in getting that 
referendum.
<P>
	The minority denominations in Newfoundland are not in favour 
of the federal government motion, but they would be, if it were 
modified as proposed by the Senate on November 27, 1996.
<P>
	My colleague has read the Senate proposals, and I am in 
agreement with them. I appreciate the fact that the federal 
government saw fit to allow a free vote on the first, second and 
third readings of this bill the first time around.
<P>
	Now that the bill has come back to us from the Senate, I trust that 
the government will do the same again, and I feel obliged to say 
that I will, once again, vote against this proposal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I support 
the member's view. We hope the executive of the government will 
decide once again to make sure this is a free vote when it comes 
forward.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I had a strange feeling when I saw this bill coming back to 
the House of Commons. The first time, I wondered what was 
happening. We had debated all these points, we had already put 
them on the table and had voted on this bill.
<P>
	It is the outcome of a referendum in a province, where there was 
a majority. I am told that some 50 per cent of the people voted. No 
one prevented the others from voting. They chose not to do so. 
Voting is not mandatory in Canada. So, the rule of democracy is to 
respect the outcome.
<P>
	I therefore wondered and I am still wondering why this bill is 
back before us after a vote was taken, a decision was made, in this 
House of elected representatives and after it was sent to the Senate, 
whose members are not elected. The people there are appointed for 
all sorts of reasons, often because of their political allegiances or 
for other reasons. Often it is because they contributed to society in 
one way or another. Still, as members of an unelected House of 
Parliament, they will never have to answer for their actions either 
tomorrow, next week, next year, in five years or in ten years from 
now.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	The people in the other House did not have to consult their 
fellow citizens to see whether or not they favoured this motion. We 
have before us a bill passed by the House of Commons based on a 
referendum held in a province on specific issues, clear issues, 
which showed a desire for change in that province.
<P>
	And now we are monopolizing the House's time in order to 
resolve matters that were already resolved by those elected. I 
would take the liberty of proposing to the Liberal majority, which 
only a few weeks ago voted against the abolition of the Senate, to 
reconsider.
<P>
	Is there anything to be gained by bringing this bill back here? 
Especially since the other House has a tendency at the moment, 
with the election coming, to put more pressure on the government. 
The fact is that there is a strong Conservative representation in the 
Senate. Those who did not manage to get members elected in this 
House are using this as a tool. They are also making use of another 
tool: the people who were appointed there for various reasons, 
including their political opinion and their contribution to the 
political parties. These people are being used as a political tool, as 
if they represented the people, which is not the case.
<P>
	Are there people in the other House who can claim to really 
represent the constituents of the riding they were appointed for? 
Can any senator today say that he was elected? There was one in 
Alberta, who unfortunately is not with us any longer, but the 
senators do not represent anyone.
<P>
	The fact that they bring back amendments like these makes us 
wonder how this came to be. How can the senators come back to us 
with these amendments? What business, authority or right do they 
have to do such a thing?
<P>
	It is important to see the implications. This House is back, 
debating and considering again the same issue and amendments, 
because the fact is that the amendment presented a moment ago by 
the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood is oddly similar to 
the one presented the first time the issue was debated in this House.
<P>
	Basically, this is what could be called a remake. The same bad 
arguments that did not convince us the first time around are being 
put forward again. After going to the Senate, they are coming back 
to us, forcing the government to put these things back on the table, 
even though a decision had already been made.
<P>
	I think there are several indications that the Senate does not 
represent what the people want. Consider this. As elected 
representatives, we can expect to go before the voters in the next 
year. All members from Ontario should think about this. As they 
travel to various parts of Ontario during the upcoming election 
campaign, they will be able to tell the people, with their hands tied  
behind their backs: ``It is a shame the Pearson airport legislation 
died. It is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6972"> 6972 </A></B>
<P>
not our fault; the Senate killed it''. Really? Is this normal? Is this 
democratic? Is this acceptable?
<P>
	Now, about Newfoundland. Even if only 50 per cent of the 
people participated in the referendum, the majority of them voted 
in favour of what was being proposed. In my mind, those who 
claim that this referendum was not representative enough are very 
dangerous people. But this should not come as a surprise from 
people who said the same thing about a referendum in which 93 per 
cent of the population participated.
<P>
	I say that a referendum is an interesting weapon in a democracy. 
It puts important issues directly to the people, whose capacity to 
understand must not be underestimated. They are very capable of 
following the debates. Their common sense is something that must 
be respected.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	As regards this debate, I am tempted to say that the sooner we 
will be done, the better it will be. I cannot prevent MPs from 
expressing their views on this issue, but I want to make them aware 
of the fact that we are having a discussion that has already taken 
place in Newfoundland. This debate has certainly taken place 
before, because the issue had been discussed for several years 
among political parties. It was the subject of a referendum and 
referred to the House of Commons. It resulted in an amendment to 
the Canadian Constitution, an amendment that was supported by 
both the party in office and the official opposition. This is quite 
something.
<P>
	This kind of thing does not happen every day in this House of 
elected representatives. Indeed, it is not every day that the official 
opposition agrees with the government on a bill of this nature.
<P>
	In spite of this approval by the two parties representing the 
largest number of ridings in Canada, the two most prominent 
parties in this Parliament, the two parties whose role is the most 
official, the most necessary and the most significant, we find 
ourselves having to start the debate all over again because the 
Senate told us: ``No, even if you are the elected ones, even if you 
represent the public, even if you are going to call an election next 
year, we cannot accept that, we have to take other considerations 
into account, and we are therefore proposing additional 
amendments''.
<P>
	This is a golden opportunity to show that we will not let them 
walk all over us. We cannot let the Senate, which costs us $43 
million per year, have such power because, after all, it plays no 
effective and efficient role in our democracy. The Senate is just a 
group of lobbyists who are paid, and better paid, by the state, 
instead of by the private sector. In the early years of Confederation, 
the Senate may have made a contribution because, at the time, 
elected representatives may not have had the same  training as they 
do today, and they may not have had access to the same research 
services either. The government did not have the same resources.
<P>
	Today, when the Senate opposes a bill, we can tell that it is 
because of effective lobby groups that undermine the influence of 
voters. People should realize that to politicians, and I think this is 
an important point, it should be the electorate that has the most 
influence on elected representatives.
<P>
	In the present case, the House of Commons is debating a motion 
which has come back from the Senate, because a bunch of 
non-elected individuals insisted there should be a decision to send 
it back to the House of Commons.
<P>
	The Senate seems to be getting too big for its boots as far as this 
bill is concerned. Consider this. When the bill arrives in the Senate, 
there is already a general consensus to pass the bill. The 
government and the official opposition agreed on this bill. They 
submitted it to the Senate to fine-tune certain aspects. But now we 
get it back with amendments that call into question the very intent 
of the constitutional amendment.
<P>
	I think we have to send a clear message. We must have a clear 
vote on this matter. We must reject the Senate's amendments. We 
have previously discussed items that were tabled again, for 
instance the amendment of the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood. That debate has already taken place in 
the House.
<P>
	I realize that to educate the public, we have to repeat certain 
arguments. That is understandable, but we must not forget that in 
this case it is pretty useless, because we have given a democratic 
body consisting of non-elected members a responsibility it should 
no longer have.
<P>
	We should learn a lesson from this bill, the same one we learned 
from the Pearson airport legislation and a number of other 
decisions by the Senate in recent years.
<P>
	Just imagine, the previous Prime Minister had to appoint 10 
additional senators to be able to do in the Senate what the House of 
Commons had already done. That took some doing! We had to 
appoint additional senators to do that. Today, the Liberal 
government has managed to rebuild its majority in the Senate, but 
since they do not have a strong majority, we get situations like the 
one we have today.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	The solution is not necessarily to stack the Senate, but rather to 
do away with it. Stacking it with a Liberal majority is not the 
solution. Instead, it is to make sure that the Senate no longer has the 
possibility of overthrowing the decisions of elected members.
<P>
	I believe that we, as members of the House of Commons, ought 
to promptly vote against these amendments, in order to ensure that 
the version accepted by Newfoundland in a referendum is the one 
respected by the House of Commons. We must, therefore, act as  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6973"> 6973 </A></B>
<P>
soon as possible, as soon as the various parties involved have done 
what they have to do.
<P>
	In the current system, it is true that parliamentarians have the 
responsibility to continue the debate, because the Senate is entitled 
to make this type of amendment, but this is a situation which ought 
to be remedied in the future.
<P>
	It is my most heartfelt wish that, in the months to come, for the 
next election campaign, each party represented in this House will 
include in its platform a position which will make it possible, 
during the next mandate, to settle this matter of the Senate, to 
prevent a body made up of unelected members, a democratic organ 
made up of unelected members, from having the power it has at the 
present time. It is an anachronism, a remnant of another time, and 
something that does not in the least represent what a modern state 
will require in the years to come.
<P>
	We must, therefore, resume consideration of this bill. We must 
ensure that the Senate's amendments are not accepted, in order to 
respect the wishes expressed by the people of Newfoundland.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to what was said by the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup. I thought for a minute the hon. 
member was going to give us some advice on how to deal with 
minorities, since we are members from Ontario.
<P>
	I do not know whether the hon. member of the Bloc Quebecois is 
up on Canadian history, especially the history of the Province of 
Ontario. There we also saw the abolition of the rights of 
francophones to be educated in their own language. I wonder 
whether he realizes that in 1912, Regulation 17-an ironic 
twist-was introduced by a Conservative government and 
supported by a Liberal opposition, a regulation that suspended, 
denied and suppressed the minority rights of francophones as far as 
education was concerned. It is rather ironic that history is repeating 
itself.
<P>
	I also listened to the hon. member's comments on referendums. 
He thought there should not be another referendum. I would like to 
put the question to this member, because I think it is rather ironic 
and even a little hypocritical to say first of all, they are not in 
favour of a referendum, and then that they respect the first 
referendum that was held in Newfoundland. Could he explain why, 
because I think their position is certainly not a very wise one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope I understood the question 
correctly, because I never said we should not respect referendums. 
Quite the contrary. In 1980, in Quebec, we had a referendum. We 
obtained 40 per cent of the vote. We came back and worked very 
hard and tried to persuade people. We got as far as 49.4 per cent last 
fall, and we are going to suggest having another one,  and that will 
be decided in the next election. Every time, the people decided. We 
never imposed decisions. We always made sure the decisions were 
made by the grass roots.
<P>
	As for the issue of minority rights in Ontario, yes, I learned my 
history of Canada from the examples I was shown. When I was 
young, I heard a lot about Manitoba. I was told about certain 
decisions, as a result of which the Province of Manitoba, which 
should have been a bilingual province, never agreed to become one, 
thus altering the balance across Canada. But at the time, as far as I 
know, there were no referendums, not in Ontario either, although I 
would have liked to see the Ontario majority vote to remove the 
rights of the francophone minority.
<P>
	We in Quebec use referendums. We never talked about rights in 
this way.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McTeague:</B> What about signs?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I challenge any minority in Canada to 
come and see whether it wants to trade places with the English 
minority in Quebec. We are prepared to sign reciprocity 
agreements at any time with the rest of Canada.
<P>
	No minority in Canada is treated as well as the anglophone 
minority in Quebec. Whether we are talking about education, 
health services or the courts, these services are provided in the 
second language, while in the rest of Canada, people have to fight 
to have schools where numbers warrant. Last year in Ontario they 
had to fight to have washrooms installed in a French school.
<P>
	I think there is ample proof of a double standard. We are 
prepared to prove to the rest of the world that we have nothing to 
learn from the rest of Canada about the way to treat our minorities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am amazed the member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup can 
tell us with a straight face that he is for respecting the results of a 
referendum.
<P>
	I well remember, as do other Canadians, the night of the first 
Quebec referendum in 1980 when René Lévesque simply uttered 
``à la prochaine fois''. In other words, he said that they did not 
accept the results that night, that they were going to have another 
referendum and another referendum. We have a term for it now in 
English: neverendum.
<P>
	The people of Canada are fed up with the kind of approach where 
the separatists of Quebec, of whom the member is one, simply 
refuse to accept the democratic will which has been expressed 
twice now by the people of Quebec. They will continue to come 
back again and again with whatever question they need to form in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6974"> 6974 </A></B>
<P>
order  to get the answer they want. I wonder if the member can 
address himself to that.
<P>
	Also, the member made the point that the Senate should just 
simply pass this amended term 17 which the House passed recently. 
I was not supportive of it. To believe that is fundamentally to 
misunderstand the role of the Senate. We can debate here whether 
we should even have a Senate, whether it should be appointed or 
elected. I have very clear views on that. However, if anyone takes 
the trouble to understand the role of the Senate, it is precisely to 
review legislation and to refer legislation back that it feels is 
deficient, particularly vis-à-vis minority rights. Can the member 
understand that point of view?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to do a little review of 
history with the member across the way.
<P>
	I would like to remind him that a few things happened between 
1980 and 1996. There was the decision, in 1984, to send the federal 
Liberals packing. Quebec decided overwhelmingly to send 
Conservative MPs to Ottawa, one reason being that someone, 
somewhere, in 1982, signed the Constitution Act without the 
agreement of Quebec. Since that time, it has not been ratified by 
any Quebec government, whether led by Robert Bourassa or Daniel 
Johnson, and obviously not by any sovereignists.
<P>
	Why was there a referendum in 1995? Because the sovereignists 
won the election in 1994. There was no coup d'état, nothing was 
imposed on anyone. We went to the people. We won the election by 
saying: ``If you elect us, there will be a referendum on 
sovereignty''.
<P>
	The public gave the government this mandate. We held a 
referendum and obtained 49.4 per cent of the vote, with 93 per cent 
of the population voting. We say it again: we are going to give 
Quebecers an opportunity, in the next provincial election, to elect a 
party whose goal is sovereignty.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Two attempts is enough.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> There is no doubt that Quebecers on the other side 
are in a rather difficult situation. The federal government has 
nothing to offer, no opportunities.
<P>
	All that the present Prime Minister of Canada has managed to 
do, in a flagrant absence of leadership, is to pass a meaningless 
resolution on distinct society. He was unable to win over-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Your time has almost 
expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> I will conclude, Mr. Speaker. I think I should have as 
much time as the member who preceded me. I will therefore wrap 
up in one minute. I will be quick.
<P>
	The people of Quebec are a people that decide things 
democratically. We can bide our time. We do not give up easily. We 
will not be prevented from reaching our goal.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	As for the role of the Senate, I am told that I do not understand it. 
In fact, I understand it perfectly, as do Quebecers who all agree it 
should be abolished.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what I would like to raise this afternoon is the key issue which, as 
you know, is not the Senate. We must not let ourselves get 
sidetracked by what the elected representatives or the appointed 
representatives have done. The key issue, the only one, is: What 
will happen if this amendment initiated by the government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador is adopted? What will happen to 
minority rights there? What is the possible impact on minority 
rights elsewhere?
<P>
	Let us take the time to discuss this. Let us drop the questions of 
Senate, House of Commons, this power struggle, let us look instead 
seriously and carefully at what we are in the process of doing at this 
time. Are you, as a group, ready to suppress the rights of 
Newfoundland and Labrador minorities?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Before voting on the Newfoundland schools question, I urge 
members to consider the following carefully, extremely carefully. I 
know we have busy agendas and sometimes we tend to listen to 
people who would have us do certain things without having the 
time to reflect but let us reflect on this one. It has come back to us 
for a second look, for more study.
<P>
	What is the effect of the current term 17? What is the effect of 
what is now in the Constitution? The current term 17 of the terms 
of union extends to various religious minorities in Newfoundland 
and Labrador the constitutional rights to establish and operate 
schools that reflect their particular religious beliefs and practices 
and the right to receive a fair share of public funds for the operation 
of those schools. That is what the current constitutional 
arrangements do.
<P>
	This right is now immune from any legislative enactment which 
might prejudicially affect it. For Newfoundland, term 17 is the 
equivalent of section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867, a section 
that provides a constitutional underpinning for denominational 
school systems in a number of other provinces. That is what we are 
talking about. Let us forget about the games and the power and who 
is going to decide what. Are we prepared to remove those rights? 
That is what we have got to answer.
<P>
	If the proposed term 17 passes without amendment, what effect 
will that have on minority rights in Newfoundland? If the proposed 
term 17 passes without amendment, the constitutional right to 
establish and  continue to operate minority religious schools in 
Newfoundland and Labrador will become, and this is so important 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6975"> 6975 </A></B>
<P>
to remember, wholly subordinate to provincial legislation, wholly, 
totally, completely, unequivocally subordinate to provincial 
legislation. There is no example in the Constitution of Canada, 
none whatsoever, where a guaranteed constitutional right would be 
subject to provincial law. There is not one single example because 
when it passes through that door it is no longer a constitutional 
right.
<P>
	A constitutional right subject to a provincial legislature is no 
constitutional right at all and could never be subject to the ruling of 
a court of law. That is what we are doing if we pass this amendment 
without the other amendments that have been proposed by my 
colleagues; ``where numbers warrant''; and the right to not only 
direct but to determine and direct.
<P>
	If the proposed term 17 is amended in accordance with what was 
proposed in the Senate, what will be the effect of those particular 
amendments? This is so terribly important to understand as well.
<P>
	The first amendment proposed in the Senate is to replace the 
clause ``subject to provincial legislation'' because if it is subject to 
provincial legislation it is no longer a constitutionally acquired 
protected right. The term ``subject to provincial legislation'' would 
be changed to ``where numbers warrant''. Surely this is fair. This 
term will not provide for the continued existence of separate 
denominational school boards. However, it will provide for schools 
for the separate denominations where numbers warrant.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	The minorities that have been affected have accepted less than 
they now have. Surely the federal government and the Government 
of Newfoundland and Labrador are prepared to look at this with 
some common sense and sensitivity. Surely they are prepared to 
reach out and seize the opportunity.
<P>
	The amendment will ensure that parents may choose schools of 
their own denomination where numbers warrant. It still gives the 
provincial legislature a whole lot of power. The amendment would 
preserve the constitutional right of minority religious groups in 
Newfoundland and Labrador to establish and continue to operate 
religious minority schools subject to having adequate numbers of 
students.
<P>
	The expression ``where numbers warrant'' is well known in 
Canadian constitutional law. It is the language in the education 
section of the charter of rights and it has already been ruled on by 
the courts. Such an amendment can and should be supported. The 
Senate amendment merely asks the government to be true to the 
commitment it made during the referendum, that is, the 
Government of Newfoundland and Labrador.
<P>
	The second amendment proposed by the Senate provides the 
guarantee that when minority religious schools are established, the
<P>
denomination for whom the school exists will have the 
constitutional authority not only to direct but also to determine and 
direct all those matters that affect the denominational integrity of 
that school.
<P>
	This amendment should also be supported because ``merely to 
direct'' could be interpreted to mean only having the power to carry 
out policies determined by someone else. Surely we do not want to 
take it all away from these groups.
<P>
	The current constitutional protection for Newfoundland and 
Labrador schools cannot now be changed unless both levels of 
government, the Government of Canada and the Government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador, in partnership decide to do so. That is 
what the deal is now.
<P>
	If the proposal of the Government of Newfoundland and 
Labrador passes, the constitutional right that I have just described 
becomes subject to the decision of the provincial legislature. It 
could be changed unilaterally by this or some other provincial 
government. Therefore it is no longer a constitutional right.
<P>
	That is what we are in the process of doing here. We are in the 
process of removing constitutional rights and placing them at the 
whim and fancy of those who draft provincial legislation and 
subject to provincial legislation. Is that what members want to do? 
Well I do not and I will not. This is a question of the rights of 
minorities. The amendments proposed by the Senate have the 
support of the minorities but that was a challenge initiative.
<P>
	The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador came forward 
with an amendment that was not acceptable to the minorities 
affected. But the minorities affected have stepped back and said: 
``Let us put in the term where numbers warrant. Let us put in 
another clause so that we are more involved and can participate 
more fully. We will buy in''.
<P>
	It has changed considerably. Whereas the Government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador was proceeding without the support of 
minorities, now it has the support of those minorities. It also has 
my support and I hope the support of my colleagues.
<P>
	This is a question of the rights of minorities. Let us not fool 
ourselves. It is nothing more or nothing less. I oppose the changing 
of the constitutional rights of minorities without their consent. I 
would hope my colleagues would also oppose those changes 
without the consent of those minorities.
<P>
	Surely we are not going to impose the will of majorities on 
minorities unless what the minority is doing is dysfunctional for 
the whole, and that is not the case. That is why I propose passing 
the original amendment with the additional amendments proposed 
in the Senate  which are now proposed by my colleagues in the 
House and which are accepted by the affected minorities.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>

<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	I want to share with the House some information of which my 
colleagues may not be aware. Prior to the referendum of September 
1995 the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador distributed a 
householder across the province. I have that householder here. It is 
called ``The Education Referendum: A Decision on the Future of 
Education in Newfoundland and Labrador''. The householder 
discussed the main changes proposed in the amendment which was 
being initiated by the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
Page 2 of the householder reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The new Term will not provide for the continued existence of separate 
denominational school boards. However, it will provide for schools for the separate 
denomination where numbers warrant-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what this official government publication says.
<P>
	Under the question of which school students will attend under 
the new system, the householder reiterated: ``However, parents 
may choose schools of their own denomination where numbers 
warrant''. That is in the official documentation sent out by the 
Government of Newfoundland and Labrador.
<P>
	The other House suggests that the amendment include the phrase 
``where numbers warrant''. I hope, because that same amendment 
has been proposed here, we will consider it seriously. We should 
not simply slough it off because it came from the other House. That 
is not the issue. It is not whether we have been elected or appointed, 
it is not making fun of other people, it is looking at what we are 
doing. By this amendment, ``where numbers warrant'', we are 
asking the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador to be true 
to the commitment it made during the referendum. That is what we 
are trying to do. We are trying to ensure that it remains true to that 
commitment.
<P>
	People will ask why the member for St. Boniface is so concerned 
about this issue affecting the education system in Newfoundland 
and Labrador. It does not only concern the education system in 
Newfoundland and Labrador. Changing or reducing the 
constitutional rights of minorities without their consent is wrong. It 
is contrary to what we as a party have traditionally supported and 
what most parliamentarians have normally supported.
<P>
	One of the promises Canada made to Newfoundland when it 
joined Confederation in 1949 was to protect denominational 
schools. That became term 17 of the terms of union. That promise 
was used to get Newfoundlanders to join Canada. Less than 50 
years later it is being proposed that the promise be changed without 
the consent of the minorities. We have given them an opportunity, 
by presenting motions in this House, to do it honourably in order to 
respond to the needs, the  aspirations, the hopes and dreams of 
those minorities and yet be able to go on with reform that is, no 
doubt, very much needed.
<P>
	Surely as a government it is our role and our duty to protect these 
constitutionally acquired rights. Canadians are counting on the 
House of Commons to do exactly that.
<P>
	Some will argue that there was a referendum and the people 
decided. This is a major issue and 52.2 per cent of the people voted. 
There was a 54.9 per cent response in favour. In favour of what? 
Here is the question: ``Do you support revising term 17 in the 
manner proposed by the government to enable reform of the 
denominational education system?''
<P>
	I bet that we could go out and ask that question of Canadians 
today and a majority would be in favour of it. ``Do you want to 
improve education?'' Of course Newfoundlanders and 
Labradorians said yes. Why not?
<P>
	Let me read that important question again. Fifty-two per cent of 
the people said yes to this question: ``Do you support revising term 
17 in the manner proposed by the government to enable reform of 
the denominational education system?'' We are trying to use the 
results of that referendum on a fuzzy question to pretend that it was 
decisive and there is now a mandate to go forward.
<P>
	The people of Newfoundland and Labrador accept that changes 
are needed in the education system. The denominational schools 
understand and accept that changes are needed in the education 
system. A constitutional amendment is not the only way to achieve 
a modern and effective school system.
<P>
	Church representatives and the Government of Newfoundland 
and Labrador have already agreed on many points: the number of 
school boards, the funding of capital expenditures, the viability of 
schools and busing. These have been discussed and agreed on 
already without any constitutional amendment. In four days the 
government and the church officials were able to agree on points 
that had been discussed for years with the previous government.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	The framework for school board consolidation is a perfect 
indication of the possibility of a made in Newfoundland solution. 
This framework has been established for the setting up of 10 
interim school boards in the provincial construction board. These 
changes could be validly implemented by the legislature of the 
province without the necessity of an amendment.
<P>
	Let me talk to that more specifically, quoting an authority. In the 
legal opinion of Mr. Colin Irving, constitutional adviser to the 
Catholic Education Council: ``The Newfoundland legislation 
adopting the proposals just outlined would not be found by the 
courts to be in violation of term 17 of the present terms of union''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6977"> 6977 </A></B>
<P>
	We must guarantee the protection of these rights of minorities. 
All minorities note it is not easy to have. They need the protection 
of the majority for the kind of country we are going to have.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I personally believe that a referendum which takes away certain 
minority rights and allows the majority to decide is unhealthy, 
except if the minorities are involved in something that imbalances 
society and harms the majority. This, I feel, sets a dangerous 
precedent. What message are we sending by supporting such an 
action?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Why not see the implementation of provincially negotiated 
changes to the educational system and if subsequent to this the 
amendment is still deemed necessary, it could be brought forward 
at a later date.
<P>
	Why not an amendment that would be agreed on by all parties? 
We have two choices here. We could postpone this and do it if it 
was necessary, or we could take the amendments, which is what I 
prefer because it has the support of those minorities, that is, 
``where numbers warrant' and ``determine and direct'' and put 
those amendments through because they have the support of the 
minorities. We can now have an amendment that has the support of 
all parties if we stop playing games, if we stop worrying about 
power, if we stop worrying about whether it was the elected or les 
gens qui sont nommés qui vont décider.
<P>
	Some people have been using the argument that the academic 
results of students in Newfoundland and Labrador when compared 
with those of other students are among the lowest in the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is absolutely false, unhealthy, and dishonest to use such 
information. According to the Department of Education for 
Newfoundland and Labrador, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The general level of education among all age groups in 
Newfoundland and Labrador has risen dramatically since the 
mid-1970s to where the gap with the rest of Canada has all but 
closed.
<P>
	According to Chris Decker, former minister of education: ``The 
gap in higher education between our province and the rest of 
Canada is becoming a myth. Our university participation rates are 
higher than the national average. If the present trend continues, 
Newfoundland and Labrador will soon have education levels equal 
to the rest of the country''. Why is this being done?
<P>
	However, if some people are still not satisfied with the 
performance in Newfoundland schools, the government is the one 
that has complete authority on curriculum, test materials, numbers 
of teachers, funding, teacher  education and performance standards. 
Does it really think that this change is going to bring about a 
dramatic change in performance? Let's get serious.
<P>
	To blame the level of education in Newfoundland and Labrador 
on the denominational school system is absurd and is not a valid 
argument.
<P>
	I propose that we look seriously at the main amendment but only 
pass that main amendment with the other amendments that have 
been proposed so that the people of Newfoundland can still 
determine and direct what is going to happen in their schools. 
Surely such an amendment should have the support of the 
Government of Canada, the support of the Government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador. It has the support of the people 
affected.
<P>
	In a sense we would be changing the Constitution but with the 
consent of the minorities as opposed to going forward without 
those other amendments that have been introduced, we will be 
changing constitutionally acquired rights promised to 
Newfoundlanders so that they would join Canada without their 
consent. I for one do not want to be part of that, particularly when 
in an official Government of Newfoundland and Labrador 
document it states, and I have quoted it twice today, that it will be 
possible for parents to choose the types of denominational schools 
they wish for their children where numbers warrant.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am asking my colleagues to look at this question again, to set 
aside what the Senate, the House of Commons, the Government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador have said, and to look carefully at 
what we are in the process of doing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Unless we are extremely prudent, we will be taking away the 
constitutionally acquired rights that were promised to minorities 
when they joined Canada. We have an opportunity to change that. 
We have some amendments that would permit us to change it with 
the consent of minorities.
<P>
	I ask my colleagues to support that common sense approach.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened very carefully to the impassioned presentations 
of the member opposite and to his colleagues. I also listened at 
great length to one of my colleagues who is trying to sway my 
decision to vote on this bill.
<P>
	My position to vote in favour of the bill and support the 
government's position is based on my fundamental belief in the 
words of one of the architects of the American Constitution, 
Thomas Paine, who was an adviser to Thomas Jefferson. His words 
were that every  generation has the right and the responsibility to 
govern for its own times and should not bind future generations any 
more than this generation should be bound by past generations. As 
a matter of fact, that was one reasons why I was so much against 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6978"> 6978 </A></B>
<P>
the Charlottetown accord, because it bound the Constitution for all 
time because it required unanimity to change it.
<P>
	It is the genius of the American Constitution: to change, to 
reflect the times.
<P>
	I would ask my hon. friend opposite, given what I have just 
stated: the necessity of each generation to govern for its time, to 
have the right to do so, not to bind future generations or to be bound 
by past generations. The Legislative Assembly of Newfoundland 
and Labrador has passed this. There has been a referendum. We 
know it was a close one, but it was a much closer referendum that 
brought Newfoundland into Confederation in the first place. Those 
who say that it passed by a very few votes should have gotten off 
their butts and voted. Once a vote is done, it is done and you go on 
from there.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member if he would try to convince me, 
based on my principled position and respecting the position of the 
people who have already voted, how would he respond?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question and his willingness to look at the questions that have been 
raised today. I hope that is contagious and others will do likewise.
<P>
	I understand the key point. If we make a decision today we do 
not necessarily have to insist that the decision is forever. I 
understand the possibilities of that.
<P>
	However, here is what happened in 1949. Promises were made in 
order to attract people and to get them to join Canada. Less than 50 
years later we are saying: We got you in, now it does not matter 
anymore if we change the rules or the promises that were made.
<P>
	Second, and perhaps even more important, this is the wonderful 
opportunity we have been given. We passed it, it went to the other 
House and they said: ``Whoa, we are not happy about this. Here are 
some things that could be done, where numbers warrant''. That was 
in the official government documentation. The parents were told: 
``You will be able to have your kind of denominational school 
where numbers warrant''.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	My colleague from Broadview-Greenwood has introduced 
with another colleague these same amendments: where numbers 
warrant; and in order to be able to determine and direct. That is the 
beauty of the wonderful opportunity we could seize, because we 
have changed from 1949. We can change from 1949 and remove 
those rights. We can say forget it, that it is over. Some people will 
argue that we have not but let them look me straight in the face 
when they say that. Here is  an opportunity with these amendments: 
where numbers warrant and to determine and direct, where it would 
change them but would not eliminate them, would not remove 
them.
<P>
	Surely no one is going to argue that a right that is subject to 
provincial legislation is no longer a constitutional right. Or at least 
let them stand and say to remove that constitutional right. I could 
live more easily with that kind of debate but the challenge that is 
thrown to us by quoting a well known American personality is one 
that is available to us today. We can move from where we were but 
in a sensible way and still respond fairly to everyone's needs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to compliment my colleague from St. 
Boniface on his remarks.
<P>
	The member for St. Boniface brought forth a very important 
point in his speech. It is the one relating to the question that was 
done in terms of the referendum, are the people of Newfoundland 
in favour of reform? It is awful that we only had just a little over 50 
per cent.
<P>
	I think back to the moment when the current premier of 
Newfoundland was sitting in this House. We all remember the great 
job he did with the fishnet at the United Nations. He stood in front 
of the platform and had the big fishnet behind him and he spoke for 
that little fish, the little turbot, that was being squeezed out of the 
system. He stood up for Canada. I would dare say that had we had a 
referendum at that time on the popularity of the then minister of 
fisheries who is now the premier of Newfoundland, we would be 
talking about 100 per cent. He did a great thing.
<P>
	The member for St. Boniface brought this forth so well. They 
asked a question of all the people of Newfoundland in a 
referendum: Are you in favour of reforming the educational system 
in this province? It is strange that only 52 per cent said yes. It 
should have been upward of 80 to 90 per cent. This whole issue of 
percentages on the referendum has been glossed over.
<P>
	I also want to build on the point my friend from Edmonton raised 
earlier. He quoted Thomas Paine, saying that every generation has 
a right to decide. I would like to bring to the floor of this House the 
words of a leader of this country who sat in front of us just a few 
years ago, a great constitutional leader, Pierre Trudeau. When he 
was repatriating the Constitution he said that it is the duty of this 
House, of this Chamber, not just to worry about the advantaged but 
to speak out for the disadvantaged, and not just to worry about the 
advantaged regions but to speak out for the disadvantaged regions.
<P>
	We have a duty in this House to make sure that we who are the 
custodians of minority rights in this House, have a serious debate 
on this issue. We should not forget that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6979"> 6979 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect to Mr. Paine's 
statement that every generation has a right to decide, we cannot 
take that too far. I chair the committee on aging and we are looking 
at how the population is changing. One of the things that was noted 
was the potential for intergenerational conflicts, that current 
generations might want to do things dramatically differently which 
would have an impact on others. While we have to be sensitive 
to that, we cannot let it run our lives totally.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	I want to go back to the point I made, which is that with the 
amendments that have been proposed we could respond to the 
rights of those minorities in a very sensible way. That is what I 
would ask my colleagues to look at. If members look deep down in 
their hearts and souls they do not want to remove the 
constitutionally acquired rights of minorities without their consent. 
Members have an opportunity to do it with their consent. I would 
ask all members to please concentrate on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the issue before 
us today is the extinguishment of constitutional rights of minorities 
without their consent. In the case of the Newfoundland resolution 
before us, we are given to understand that denominational schools 
will be protected when all it will take to eliminate that protection is 
a provincial statute. In other words, the constitutional guarantee is 
being dropped. I do not think this is the proper way to proceed.
<P>
	Until now the province has had jurisdiction over matters of 
education subject to constitutional guarantees. Henceforth, it will 
be able to legislate without regard to any guarantee. In particular, 
the rights of a minority will be subject to the whim of the majority 
as they were in the referendum. The truth of this is in the statistics 
of the referendum. It has been established by reviewing the votes 
on a riding by riding basis that Roman Catholics rejected the 
proposed change. In effect, the majority voted to support the 
reform that would remove denominational schools from Roman 
Catholics against their will.
<P>
	The issue then is: Is this resolution prejudicial to minorities? The 
minority observations of a report from the Senate study seem 
appropriate today. On page 48 of that report the question is asked: 
Is the resolution prejudicial to minorities? The report goes on to 
state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Section 1 paragraph (b) would have the effect of placing the protection of the 
constitutionally protected right to establish and maintain uni-denominational schools 
``subject to provincial legislation''. The establishing and maintaining of 
uni-denominational schools would thus, no longer be protected by Canada's 
Constitution. The provisions contemplated in this resolution are a major departure 
from the protection enshrined in section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867; section 22 
of the Manitoba Act; section 17 of the Saskatchewan Act and the Alberta Act and in 
Newfoundland's current Term 17. In all those sections, the power of the provinces to 
legislate is subject to the denominational rights enshrined in the Constitution.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Under the proposed changes the protection for denominational rights in 
Newfoundland would be subject to a provincial law of general application and if 
accepted, create a dangerous precedent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The committee heard the testimony of numerous witnesses who requested that the 
resolution be amended so as to substitute in paragraph (b) the well known legal 
expression ``where numbers warrant'' for the present introductory words. We 
observe that substituting a ``numbers warrant'' test would mean that the courts 
would remain the ultimate guardians of the rights of the classes of persons which the 
section seeks to confer. This is consistent with how other minority protections are 
dealt with in Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A second issue of concern raised by the affected classes of persons who would 
lose their present denominational school rights relates to the matter of who will 
determine and direct the programmes in the uni-denominational schools. Paragraph 
(c) of the proposed Term 17 resolution reads as follows: `-to direct the teaching of 
aspects of-'. This would effectively abrogate a present constitutional right of the 
people of Newfoundland. It was the view of many groups that this could be 
mitigated if that section read as follows: `-to determine and to direct the teaching of 
aspects of-'.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	Without these changes it is my view that the proposed resolution 
would be prejudicial to the constitutionally protected rights of 
certain classes of citizens. Why were such rights guaranteed in the 
Constitution? That is a question that should be answered. In that 
same Senate study it was answered in a document which was tabled 
with the committee by Professor Patrick Monahan, a constitutional 
lawyer. He wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It has generally been assumed that the various constitutional guarantees for 
denominational education in different provinces are not subject to abrogation or 
amendment simply because a majority of the citizens in a particular province would 
support such a change. Indeed, to amend or abrogate these guarantees on such a 
basis would be inconsistent with the very principle that led to their entrenchment in 
the first place. Denominational guarantees were entrenched precisely so as to put 
them beyond the reach of the majority sentiment in favour of abrogating the rights of 
a minority. Therefore, I agree that a constitutional amendment to Term 17 that is not 
supported by the classes of persons protected by that guarantee could be seen as a 
precedent that would permit other provinces to seek similar changes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is interesting to note as well that there is a historical 
perspective to the debate we are having today. In the Senate report, 
Professor Robert Carney from the University of Alberta offered 
some comments. He explained to the committee the similarities he 
saw between the proposed amendment and the situation in 
Manitoba between 1870 and 1890. There was a move from two 
separate educational systems to a single public system. The 
rationale given was to save money and to improve the quality of 
schooling in Manitoba. The report goes on to state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Professor Carney noted that it is not clear if either of these results were achieved. 
Finally, the move was an expression of the will of the majority in Manitoba that affected 
minority rights. However, the Privy Council, at that point in time the highest  judicial </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6980"> 6980 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>authority in Canada, found that no rights had been taken away. Professor Carney 
found this very reminiscent of the Newfoundland debate of today.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>He stated that a compromise was arranged by Prime Minister Laurier and Premier 
Greenway of Manitoba which provided time for religious education and the hiring of 
teachers in proportion to the religious denomination of the pupils, the 
Laurier-Greenway compromise. However, between 1896 and 1916 there were a 
number of such steps towards eroding those rights, particularly the erosion of 
linguistic rights in 1916. Professor Carney felt that passing the proposed Term 17 
would result in the same type of controversy that existed in Manitoba 100 years ago.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Later I will reference the fact that we could avoid this type of 
controversy by simply accepting the amendments that have been 
proposed by the member for Broadview-Greenwood.
<P>
	I have another problem with this motion. It is a significant 
problem which concerns the referendum. The referendum was 
fundamentally flawed. The question that was asked was a fuzzy one 
as has been noted by others. We in this House and many people in 
this country were especially critical of the question in the Quebec 
referendum for the same reason. The same criticism applies to the 
question which was asked in the Newfoundland referendum.
<P>
	The question was: Do you support revising term 17 in the 
manner proposed by the government to enable reform of the 
denominational education system, yes or no? The question was 
carefully crafted to imply falsely that amendment of the 
Constitution was necessary to reform the educational system of 
Newfoundland and that was an incorrect proposition.
<P>
	The question talks about educational reform and who could be 
against that? Who thinks that education in Newfoundland or 
elsewhere in this country is not ripe for reform? The question pitted 
this desire for change and reform against a constitutional right, a 
conflict which does not exist in reality.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	The second problem with the referendum question was that in 
order to understand the government's intentions a voter had to read 
and understand term 17. The language of the term was certainly far 
from clear. I believe that a fundamental of any referendum must be 
that the question asked be very clear to the people who are 
answering it. They must know clearly the results of either a yes or a 
no response. That clearly was not the case here.
<P>
	If each of the denominational classes of persons protected by 
term 17 had voted to give up their rights no one could seriously 
object to the proposed amendment on the basis of principle, but 
that is not what happened. Roman Catholics did not vote to give up 
their rights, as I suggested before, nor did Pentacostals. The 
referendum vote was nothing more than a simple case of a majority 
taking away the rights of two minorities in  Newfoundland. Is it any 
different in principle than the English voting to take away the rights 
of the French? I would ask the House to consider that precedent.
<P>
	Promises in government literature on the referendum included 
the promise of ``where numbers warrant'', which is not provided in 
the present resolution. As was pointed out earlier, in a brochure 
which was distributed widely by the government, 
Newfoundlanders were promised that where numbers warrant 
schools for religious denominations would be provided, and yet 
there is no such guarantee in term 17 itself. That is a serious flaw 
which we must redress in this House. If there is a promise made in 
the course of a referendum debate, especially when it is a 
government promoted referendum, that promise should be kept. 
That is not the case.
<P>
	There is widespread support for the motion put forward by the 
hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood and the amendments 
which were proposed by the Senate.
<P>
	I would like to read a letter from the Federation of Independent 
School Associations in British Columbia. The Federation of 
Independent School Associations represents over 220 independent 
schools, enrolling over 50,000 students. The schools cover a wide 
range of philosophical and religious adherence. They include 
Montessori, Waldorf, special needs, Catholic, Jewish and 
Protestant groups, and yet they all work together co-operatively 
within the Federation of Independent School Associations.
<P>
	I would like to quote a few paragraphs of the letter:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Even a cursory examination of the history of the formation of Canada, as a 
country, indicates that the basis of union of the various parts to make the whole 
include strong protection for the educational rights of minorities equally with those 
of majorities. These rights were reaffirmed in the Constitution Act, 1982 which 
includes the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. One of the key purposes of these 
documents is the protection of rights, not only of individuals, but of certain classes of 
people, especially if they are in a minority position.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The referendum held on September 5, 1995 to alter Term 17 of the Terms of 
Union of Newfoundland with Canada is an attempt to remove Constitutionally 
guaranteed educational rights by majority vote without the consent of those whose 
rights are guaranteed. If such a process is admitted, then the whole structure of 
Constitutional guarantees is no longer one of guarantees but a structural statement of 
current practice which may be overridden at some future time by majority vote as the 
mood of the electorate changes. It was precisely to avoid the arbitrariness of such 
changes that various rights are protected in the Constitution Act, particularly rights 
of minorities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	The letter goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Changes to guaranteed rights should be arrived at by negotiated settlement 
following consultations with the parties involved. Decisions arrived at in any other 
way, in which rights are removed under duress, ensures that the issue will be a cause 
of severe dissension for years to come.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6981"> 6981 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We would, therefore, request that you consider only those constitutional changes 
which have been negotiated to the mutual satisfaction of the parties involved. Should 
you, nevertheless, desire to proceed, we request that you accept the amendments to the 
amending proposals to Term 17 as adopted by the Senate on November 27, 1996.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Catholic Educational Council in Newfoundland also sent a 
letter to me in which it pretty much confirms and supports the 
statement I just read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We ask you, therefore, to do everything possible to see that the amended 
resolutions of Term 17 adopted by the Senate are introduced for debate and passage 
in the House of Commons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It underlines the point that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Without the amended resolution, the constitutional right to establish and maintain 
denominational schools will be wholly subordinated to provincial legislation. There 
is no example in the Constitution of Canada where a guaranteed constitutional right 
would be subject to a provincial legislature. Indeed, a constitutional right subject to a 
provincial legislature is no constitutional right at all.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have as well a letter from the Pentecostal Education Council in 
St. John's, Newfoundland, asking that we take note of the Senate 
amendments:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Please note the amendments of the Senate ``where numbers warrant'' and to 
``determine and'', redress the imbalance the original resolution. The amended 
resolution is a compromise that satisfies our concerns while allowing the 
Newfoundland government to proceed with educational reform.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I think that statement is worth repeating. It is not everything it 
wanted but it is a compromise that satisfies its concerns:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With these amendments, the government may proceed to reduce the role of the 
churches in governance, establish consolidated interdenominational school boards 
and provide for interdenominational schools where the public wishes to have them. 
Together, churches and government can work co-operatively to maximum 
educational effectiveness and operational efficiency.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The whole issue that we have before us today is certainly a 
constitutional concern but there is also a very practical concern of 
who is ultimately responsible for educating the child. As I see it, 
the motion as it stands unamended before us today takes away from 
the parent the right to choose the type of system they want their 
child educated in and is forcing them to accept a provincial system 
of education. In other words, the rights of the parents are being 
eroded by this legislation.
<P>
	It would seem to me that in this day and age when one looks at 
the turmoil in the educational system across this country, the drive 
is for more parental control. Parents want more say in how their 
children are educated. In what more fundamental way could that be 
achieved than by selecting the denominational school, a school in 
which they know that the values tied in that school are going to 
reflect their values and their beliefs?
<P>
	When we look at this bill we have to look not only at that the 
constitutional question of minority rights and protecting minority 
right, but we also must look at the issue of who ultimately should 
be responsible for educating that child. I think the choice should be 
with the parent and I think there should be as many choices there as 
possible. I certainly support the motion of the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for South Shore-food inspection agency.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Humber-St. Barbe-Baie Verte, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House to provide comment 
to the previous member's words on the term 17 amendment and the 
subsequent passage of it in this House.
<P>
	I am pleased also to see that the hon. member is taking the 
constitutional obligations of the Government of Canada so 
seriously. The Constitution is a sacred instrument, something we 
cannot take lightly.
<P>
	We as parliamentarians have a very strong and sincere interest in 
protecting all the rights of all members of Canadian society. But we 
are talking about a Newfoundland issue here, an issue which is 
affecting Newfoundlanders. I want to make a comment and bring 
the issue back a little closer to perhaps the hon. member's home 
turf and talk a bit about other constitutional obligations.
<P>
	The Constitution Act, 1982 and its interpretation, subsequent to 
the Sparrow decision, requires that the Government of Canada 
respect the rights of aboriginal groups to fish for food, social and 
ceremonial purposes. That is a provision as interpreted by the 
courts of Canada that is sacred and entrusted within the 
Constitution.
<P>
	We are talking about a Newfoundland issue. I do not want to 
stray off the mark here to much but I think the commentary of the 
hon. member is very valid because he feels, as do I, that the 
constitutional obligations as they are described, whether within this 
Parliament or within the courts, are an obligation of all members of 
Canadian society.
<P>
	The hon. member stated very clearly that the Government of 
Canada has a constitutional obligation to maintain the right of all 
aboriginal groups throughout Canada to fish for food, social and 
ceremonial purposes. He also advocates that the Government of 
Canada has to protect that right and it has the opportunity to enter 
into various agreements to make sure that the enactment of that 
right will be maintained for time immemorial.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6982"> 6982 </A></B>
<P>
	I will leave my commentary at that and say thank you to the 
hon. member for his commentary, for saying to all the people of 
Canada from the west coast to the east coast and central Canada, 
everywhere, that he feels strongly that all aboriginal groups, 
because of the interpretation in the Sparrow decision, have a 
constitutional obligation, he has a constitutional obligation to 
maintain the rights of aboriginals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my 
friend.
<P>
	The issue he is raising is very important, that in any democratic 
society the rule of law must apply. The guarantee for the rule of law 
is embedded in the Constitution. If we take constitutional change 
lightly, as it seems to me that happened in this House when we 
debated this issue earlier, we are in for big problems.
<P>
	Our personal security must lie in a Constitution that is strong, 
changeable but not easily changed. I think what we are doing here 
is really flirting with an ease of change that could spell trouble for 
us as a nation down the way.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the 
honour to speak in this debate, which is taking place in principle 
because of certain events. The issue was raised almost ten years 
ago when the Government of Newfoundland wanted to change the 
denominational school system for reasons of efficiency. This 
debate led to a referendum in which 29 per cent of 
Newfoundlanders voted in favour of a change.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	While I accept the many debates that took place in the province 
of Newfoundland with respect to the concerns about the direction 
and the need for efficiency in its system, there is in that argument a 
sense of need as far as the fiscal element is concerned. The 
Government of Newfoundland and Labrador is certainly to be 
commended for taking this approach.
<P>
	In the few days that this House has been given, many members 
did not have the opportunity for debate because of the speed with 
which this bill was passed. We had an opportunity to have the bill 
reviewed by members of the other place and many senators took 
the time to reflect and review it.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood indicated a 
little earlier, we should not simply dismiss their views. I think of 
Senator Doody, Senator Carstairs and Senator Michael Kirby who 
took the time to really reflect on the issue and its long term 
implications. These individuals had a lot to do with creating the 
Constitution in 1981-82.
<P>
	These individuals took the time to consider the issue, because it 
is one that does not just stop with the interests of the province of 
Newfoundland. It goes well beyond  that to every other province 
because it will no doubt have an impact on minority legislation and 
the question as so eloquently described by the member for 
Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, when he talked about what this is really 
doing in terms of the definition of enshrinement.
<P>
	I believe it is important for the House to also give sober second 
thought, if I can use that term, to this proposal before us today.
<P>
	Newfoundland has a population of some 650,000 people. I 
should point out that the riding of Ontario has 235,000 constituents, 
and there is not a single member in the House who would believe 
that riding should be able to imperil or subvert or overcome a 
question of enshrined or entrenched rights. I feel compelled to say 
that certain rights are indefeasible. Certain rights cannot be traded 
off like poker chips at a game when a poor hand is dealt.
<P>
	What Newfoundland seeks and hopes to achieve with the 52 per 
cent of the favourable vote has far more implications than simply 
the concerns of Newfoundland. It has implications for the minority 
rights of every individual across the country. I want to talk about 
the historical.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In 1912, the Whitney government in Ontario, took away the 
minority educational rights of francophones. In 1890, the Manitoba 
government did away with the laws and constitutional rights 
protecting minority rights.
<P>
	I believe the architects of our Constitution of 1982 had the idea 
of possibly protecting rights, here in the House of Commons, in 
case a province, for one reason or another, had a different interest.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore the architects of the 1982 Constitution respected not 
only the House of Commons but the other House.
<P>
	I need no lesson about whether or not there is legitimacy in that 
House because it happened to come back with a few proposals. I 
will discuss that in a moment. It is fair to say that whether we agree 
or disagree with what was done by the Senate, the reality is it is 
nevertheless a part of our Constitution, a part of this House.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	We must respect that Parliament has been constructed that way 
until this Parliament decides to do otherwise. I need no lesson from 
any members on this side.
<P>
	I recall what the member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup 
said a little earlier with respect to the fact that so many members on 
this side of the House had not supported the amendment to abolish 
the Senate. I happen to be one of those few dissenting  members 
who did. However, that does not take away the indefeasibility and 
strength of the argument that has brought forth the amendment that 
we see here today. This proposed amendment, which is a carbon 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6983"> 6983 </A></B>
<P>
copy of what the Senate had proposed, is a question of describing 
where numbers warrant.
<P>
	I am a francophone Ontarian. I know a little about the dilemma 
of trying to protect certain rights and to provide services where 
those numbers are warranted. There are certainly many places in 
my province and in my community of Durham where the French 
community has been able to receive certain services in the 
language of its choice simply because the numbers warrant it.
<P>
	I believe that what the Senate has done is provided us with a 
second chance at a good compromise which should not be simply 
eliminated because of some political sense of expediency that 
exists now in 1996 but opens the door to possible constitutional 
chaos down the road.
<P>
	I do not believe that is the intention of the Government of 
Newfoundland. It is certainly not the intention of the good senators. 
It ought not to be the intention of this House to commit that kind of 
error.
<P>
	This solemn like decision has taken the opportunity to weigh 
both sides of the coin, the first side being of course recognizing the 
fiscal constraints that exist in Newfoundland and then the flip side, 
the reality of recognizing at least certain denominational 
educational rights.
<P>
	The history of this whole question I find troubling. In 1990 the 
Government of Newfoundland appointed the Williams 
commission. In 1992 that commission found that of the 
denominational educational groups in the province of 
Newfoundland almost 90 per cent of what was recommended was 
adopted and acceptable by all players. What are we trying to 
achieve in getting that extra 10 per cent that presses us to bring our 
country possibly to the brink of constitutional chaos?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Too risky.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McTeague:</B> As my hon. colleague from 
London-Middlesex has said very eloquently, it is a deal that it 
simply too risky. It is for this reason that I think we have a golden 
opportunity here to review some of the wisdom that is coming from 
that House which has had a little longer to think about this issue.
<P>
	I know, having 235,000 constituents, that one, we should not be 
making any changes to the Constitution that are binding. Second, 
we have a lot of issues that go from this House and a lot require 
expertise in many areas, but this is one that I do not believe this 
House can afford the luxury of overlooking or simply saying ``I 
voted for it that time and now that it is coming before us again I am 
going to maintain my position''. I think our ability to think these 
things out compels members of Parliament to reflect very carefully 
on the door that they are opening. This is, in my belief, the very 
thin edge of  the wedge. I am not talking from the perspective of 
Chicken Little.
<P>
	Instead, I believe that what we have to consider this amendment 
to be is something that would revoke something of a constitutional 
guarantee. The speed with which this amendment is about to go 
through must be worrisome in the context of the time it takes to 
prepare for admission for provinces like Newfoundland.
<P>
	The parties that consented in 1949 to join Confederation had 
some very compelling and valid reasons. As the member for St. 
Boniface indicated earlier, 50 years ago is not that long ago and 
although I am the ripe age of 34, I know many changes have taken 
place. Change is a good thing in and of itself but it must be 
measured against the consequences that it has on all.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	It is not good enough when we talk about the indefeasibility of 
the rights of minorities, which is a hallmark of the Liberal Party of 
Canada, to simply turn around and say ``we are going to apply 
some kind of utilitarian principle here, we are going to say that the 
happiness of the greatest number is the real reason we are here and 
if it goes well for the majority, so be it''. I think that is illiberal as a 
view.
<P>
	Although we want to help the province of Newfoundland, it must 
look to its own people, to its own denominational churches to find a 
solution. It must not be allowed to open up the Pandora's box of 
constitutionality, the kind of constitutionality that says 250,000 
people can decide by fiat or by the wave of the hand. Perhaps it is 
through a question they did not understand or by a question that 
was articulated in such a way that it left a lot of confusion at the end 
of the day with only 55 per cent participating. This leaves one with 
the impression that perhaps they did not know at the end of the day 
what they were voting on. Irrespective of that the reality is that 
number is too small to bring about the kind of disruption this 
amendment threatens to bring.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I expressed my fears earlier about minority rights. As a 
francophone from Ontario, I am very familiar with the situation of 
people who have found themselves in a position where 
governments, with the wisdom of the time, have deprived 
communities of their rights and interests. The effect of doing so is 
harmful and creates tensions within the country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For many years certain religions were guaranteed certain rights. 
For instance, the Catholic religion in the province of Ontario was 
guaranteed certain rights under section 93 of our original British 
North America Act. Up until 1984 those rights those rights were 
disrespected. Catholics were treated as second class citizens. They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6984"> 6984 </A></B>
<P>
did not have control over their entire educational system. We  
righted a wrong. Is it fair for this Parliament to wrong a right?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In my opinion, the eloquent words of Senator Michael Kirby 
deserve the attention of this House. Members of all parties here 
must give careful consideration to the force of his argument.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In essence the argument that has been made by those who have 
proposed this amendment goes something like this. Newfoundland 
needs a new school system. The minorities affected had a chance to 
be heard. In the end nobody is losing much and if we go on they 
will still have more than their fair share, certainly as far as their 
counterparts are concerned. Therefore given all this, change can 
take place.
<P>
	That kind of argument says that as long as the process is fair, the 
end justifies the means. I am not one who subscribes to 
machiavellian philosophy, but I do not believe that the end justifies 
the means. I believe that in a country as diverse as Canada where 
we have expressed time and time again the intrinsic value of 
minority rights, we must be careful to continue to nurture our 
Constitution, a living document capable of changing with changing 
times.
<P>
	We must nurture and protect that Constitution so that it protects 
those who cannot protect themselves and who are concerned that as 
minorities they may suffer the tyranny of the majority. We know 
the difficulties that are encountered by so many groups in this 
country when we look at parliaments or governments or bodies that 
say might is right. If you are not on the side of hegemony, if you are 
not on the side of power then forget it. You have no voice. You have 
no future.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	On the economic plane we are even talking today about the small 
voices that usually get drowned out. Big business, big labour and 
big government get to be heard when it comes to resolving a 
problem, but the new micro industries and young people coming 
out of our universities with new ideas are simply getting squeezed 
out. They do not have the traditional levers by which they can 
express themselves.
<P>
	The same applies to the wisdom of the Constitution. Our 
Constitution protects people. It protects them because it believes 
that at one point or another, no matter who we are as Canadians, 
whether we live in Newfoundland, Ontario, in Ajax, Pickering or 
Whitby, or whether we live in British Columbia, we are all, in one 
way or another, a minority. The Constitution is there to protect not 
only our status as minorities, it is there to protect our status as 
individuals who are deserving of rights, rights against being 
prosecuted unnecessarily by  the government, rights against having 
the rules changed midstream.
<P>
	I implore the House to consider very carefully what this motion 
really means. In my view, and I believe in the view of many people 
in the House and across the country, it is a motion which opens the 
door, is the thin edge of the wedge, which will allow other 
governments with certain missions, based on rather important 
arguments in 1996, in 1999 or a little farther down the road, to 
remove delicately, softly, quietly, certain constitutional rights, 
certain inherent rights which we have developed over the years, 
rights for which many people of this country have fought and died.
<P>
	I am pleased to say that the amendment which has been proposed 
by the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood adopts the 
wisdom not of senators or politicians but of people who have 
actually taken the time to think, to consider and weigh that which is 
Canada. These are people who have said that, yes, the interests of 
Newfoundland in getting its financial house in order are important. 
However, we cannot do that by laying waste to their rights.
<P>
	This amendment, ``where numbers warrant'', means that we are 
using a tried, tested and true method by which we are going to be 
able to protect individuals down the road. I believe, if the House 
sees fit, it will find that the wisdom of ``where numbers warrant'' 
allows it an excellent compromise to achieve the wishes of the 
people of Newfoundland and their government while at the same 
time letting the rest of the country breathe easily and know that 
their rights and the rights that we share as Canadians will not be 
suppressed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would ask this House to give due consideration to the remarks 
by the member for Broadview-Greenwood, because this is an 
amendment, a proposal that, in the end, gives us a way to protect 
ourselves properly, effectively and in keeping with our identity as 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
constitutional matters are always delicate ones. We know that 
things are written into the Constitution, into the constitution of any 
country, in order to ensure, in a way, that they remain unchanged. 
In fact, what is written into a constitution is aimed, in some cases, 
at protecting the rights of certain minorities, and in other cases, 
certain majorities.
<P>
	In the case of interest to us here, especially after the 
Newfoundland referendum, we understand that what will be done 
will affect rights a certain minority believed were protected for 
ever.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I am not taking a stand in this debate, but I would like the hon. 
member who has just spoken to clarify his view of this duality 
between permanently maintaining rights  which are perhaps a bit 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6985"> 6985 </A></B>
<P>
outmoded, on the one hand, and this constitutional guarantee which 
calls for the ongoing protection of minority rights, on the other.
<P>
	These two points of view are contradictory, and I would like the 
hon. member to explain how he resolves that contradiction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the hon. member on this good question. He addresses 
the dilemma that exists at the present time surrounding that 
question.
<P>
	As I just said, I find that our Constitution is a document that 
evolves from day to day. It is not a document that is intended as a 
bottleneck, or a straight jacket. It is a document that is intended to 
offer limited and minimal protection to the interests and the 
proposals made at the time the document was signed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The courts have played a very strong role in balancing 
competing rights and interests. We know that the history of this 
argument, of this whole episode, is one that is fraught with what 
appears to be governments hell bent on imposing their will, 
notwithstanding the fact that within the province of Newfoundland 
there is ample room if not ample evidence of an agreement.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We also acknowledge that perhaps a 52 per cent vote in favour of 
a question may not be enough for questions where people's rights 
are involved.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Fifty-two per cent voting on the rights of minorities who are 
themselves minorities without their consent is certainly a recipe for 
tyranny of the majority. The dilemma of a constitutional 
requirement of protection versus the democratic will of a certain 
number of people are two competing theories within the terms of 
our federalism. Yet at the end of the day the rule of law must 
prevail. The rights of minorities must prevail. The right to free 
speech must prevail. We know these as sacred values within our 
system.
<P>
	While the question is an excellent one, the resolution cannot be 
found by simply adopting one side and saying: ``To heck with the 
Constitution. It means nothing. What we are interested in doing 
here is achieving 1996 fiscal expediency''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
comments of the member for Ontario. He has a well deserved 
reputation for sticking up for those who cannot defend themselves 
regardless of personal cost. He certainly has earned my admiration 
for that.
<P>
	The question I have for the member is a simple one. Is the 
protection that he is seeking for religious minorities in educating 
their children any different than the protection that would be 
available to say linguistic  minorities, or is it something far beyond 
that level of protection for which he is arguing?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McTeague:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to congratulate the member. 
I did not have an opportunity to refer to his speech a little earlier. It 
took me as a bit of a surprise that he stated the position he had. It 
shows there is quite a bit of diversity in that caucus on this issue as 
well.
<P>
	Do I see this educational issue as being a precedent, a door 
opening for other minority rights?
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	As I indicated to the member from the Bloc, we must always be 
prepared to have a Constitution that is flexible. When we have 30 
million Canadians from so many backgrounds, with so many 
different interests, but then at the end of the day saying we believe 
in this great country it is going to create a bit of a problem for many 
of us if we are not prepared to acknowledge that the Constitution is 
something that must change with changing times.
<P>
	I am worried about existing rights that are acknowledged by the 
minorities, not simply from a position of vested interest, but given 
the history of this amendment. Many have written us saying: ``We 
have a problem here. The government seems prepared to 
steamroller a particular issue with the help, by and with the consent 
of the government, through the House of Commons and through the 
Senate. We think that you should stop for a moment and really 
think about what you are doing in the context of that which we 
agreed to only 50 years ago''.
<P>
	I respect the fact that in this House there are many members of 
Parliament who are a little older than 50 years so it is not really that 
long ago. No offence of course to the hon. whip of our party.
<P>
	However, in all sincerity to the hon. member's question because 
it is an excellent one, I do not believe we should be moving toward 
rectifying new rights when we have not been able to demonstrate a 
guarantee that we are going to be able to defend the rights that we 
have already proclaimed. That is exactly the point with which I 
think the House must be seized.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before resuming debate, a point of order 
from the hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gallaway:</B> Mr. Speaker, earlier today votes were taken. 
With respect to votes concerning Bill C-29, I sent a note to the table 
officers to point out that I would be absent during those votes.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the earlier two votes which were taken my name 
was applied for the subsequent three votes. I had asked the table 
officers that I not be shown as being present. I was in fact absent 
and I was marked present and having voted in favour. I request that 
I be shown as absent and therefore I would request the consent of 
the House to have the record correctly reflect that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6986"> 6986 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sure the consent of the House is 
not necessary to clarify the record in light of what the member 
has said. I will ask the table officers to make that clear in <I>Hansard</I>.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Excuse me, but it is not your turn. As a 
Liberal has just spoken, it is now the Bloc Quebecois' turn. I 
therefore give the floor to the member for Bellechasse.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
apologies to the hon. member for London-Middlesex, but I 
believe the opposition was not among the last few members to 
speak, although there was no lack of debate.
<P>
	My colleague, the hon. member for Mercier, always looks at 
things in their historical perspective. Knowing where she has come 
from, she knows where she is headed, and this gives me a point of 
departure.
<P>
	I would be much happier today if, instead of taking a position, I 
was recognizing the result of a referendum held in Newfoundland 
indicating to us that the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador 
wanted to leave Canada, like the result in 1948, and we will come 
back to this. The Province of Newfoundland-then the Dominion 
of Newfoundland-made a decision regarding union with Canada.
<P>
	In this event, it would be sufficient to recognize the result and sit 
down again, because the people of Newfoundland would have 
exercised their sacred right to self-determination, to the full 
constitutional destiny of their province.
<P>
	Today, I am not in any way questioning the results of the 
September 5, 1995 referendum. A majority voted in favour of 
amending term 17 of the Terms of Union with Canada. A little bit 
of background is still necessary. What took place? What led to the 
establishment of terms of union between Newfoundland and 
Canada?
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	For the benefit of those who were not with us at the beginning of 
this debate, a reminder that before 1949, Newfoundland was not 
part of Canada. Until 1933 it was an independent Dominion, like 
Canada, like Ireland previously, like Australia and like New 
Zealand, and as such part of the British Empire, which has now 
become the Commonwealth.
<P>
	When economic problems became apparent, the responsible 
government of Newfoundland was suspended by an act of the 
Imperial Parliament, the Parliament of Great Britain, in 1933, the 
Newfoundland Act, 1933, 24-25 George V, chapter 2, United 
Kingdom.
<P>
	As of 1933, the Imperial Parliament suspended responsible 
government in Newfoundland and appointed a commission of 
government to take charge of what to all intents and purposes again 
became a colony.
<P>
	Apparently, the commission of government operated 
satisfactorily, and the war got the economy going again, so that in 
the post-war period, the people in London and the people in 
Newfoundland wondered whether they should maintain this 
commission of government, in other words, a governor without an 
elected legislature. The governor received his instructions from 
London and carried them out.
<P>
	An initial referendum was held to put the question to the people 
of Newfoundland. Actually, a national convention was called in 
Newfoundland to determine the status the people wanted for 
Newfoundland.
<P>
	This convention suggested putting two questions to 
Newfoundland voters: Do you wish to maintain the commission of 
government-direct rule from London-or do you want to go back 
to the status that existed before 1933, in other words, the status of a 
Dominion within the empire? With of course, responsible 
government based on the institutions that existed before 1933.
<P>
	As a result of political intrigue and pressure from the Canadian 
government at the time and from the government in London as 
well, a third option was considered which had not been planned by 
the national convention of Newfoundland. The third option was 
federation with Canada.
<P>
	Despite the position taken by the national convention of 
Newfoundland, a third option was put on the ballot in 1948, by an 
imperial act of Parliament. Let us recall the results of the first 
referendum, which was held on June 3, 1948.
<P>
	There was a very respectable turnout of 88.36 per cent. In favour 
of maintaining the commission of government, in other words, an 
administration under the orders of the United Kingdom, 14.32 per 
cent; in favour of federation with Canada, 41.13 per cent; and in 
favour of the return to responsible government, in other words, to 
Dominion status as of 1933, 44.55 per cent. There was a majority 
but not an absolute majority in favour of one of the three options. 
The option which got the least votes was eliminated and as 
prescribed by law, a month later, on July 22, a second referendum 
was held. The question concerned only two points: Are you in 
favour of federation with Canada or of a return to responsible 
government?
<P>
	This time, Newfoundland voters responded as follows: 78,323 
voted in favour of federation with Canada and 71,334 voted in 
favour of responsible government, which in percentages works out 
to 52.34 per cent against 47.66 per cent. The difference is not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6987"> 6987 </A></B>
<P>
considerable, a difference  that in other circumstances would not be 
worth discussing, because the figures themselves are eloquent.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	Things become more disquieting when we look at the voting by 
riding. In the riding of Ferryland, the turnout was 104.59 per cent; 
in Labrador, it was 119.44 per cent; in Grand Falls, it was 109.79 
per cent; in St. John's West, it was 101.50 per cent; in St. John's 
East, 100.05 per cent and in Humber, it was 107.84 per cent.
<P>
	This is a turnout that the hon. member for 
Humber-Sainte-Barbe-Baie Verte can appreciate now. However, 
as my colleague and friend, the member for Louis-Hébert, would 
say, something is wrong with democracy somewhere. They went a 
little bit too far.
<P>
	Such that, if we look at voting excesses, a lot of ridings had a 
turnout of nearly 100 per cent. Something rarely seen. For example 
in the second referendum, it was 95 per cent in the riding of St. 
George's-Port-au-Port; 97.16 per cent in White Bay; 96.26 per 
cent in Grand Falls. That is not so bad. In the riding of St. 
George's- Port-au-Port, in the other referendum, the figure was 
99.39 per cent. These figures are rather unbelievable.
<P>
	Worse yet, however, was the discovery made since that time that 
London had decided, regardless of the outcome of the referendum, 
that there would be union with Canada. History speaks for itself; 
nobody gave two hoots about the people of Newfoundland.
<P>
	Finally, if only to have it appear in <I>Hansard</I>, as the result of the 
figures, ambiguous to say the least, with a turnout in seven or eight 
ridings of more than 100 per cent, the Prime Minister of Canada, 
Mackenzie King, said at the time the results were released, and I 
quote: ``I consider such results clear and beyond possibility of 
misunderstanding''. That took some nerve. Fortunately, there was 
no live television, because the people of Newfoundland would have 
been hopping. In the September 5, 1995 referendum no 
irregularities were reported. As the result of this referendum, it was 
decided that Newfoundland wanted to join Canada. The terms of 
union had to be negotiated. There are 50 of them and they appear in 
the appendix to the 1985 <I>Revised Statutes of Canada</I>.
<P>
	We are concerned here today with term 17 and it is not an easy 
matter to understand. I am simply going to read term 17, and even 
the most eminent jurists sitting in the House will not be able to give 
us an opinion regarding its meaning.
<P>
	I will begin. I hope that the translators have the English version, 
because I am going to read it in French. Term 17, regarding 
education, is worded as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>17. In lieu of section ninety-three of the Constitution Act, 1867, the following 
Term shall apply in respect of the Province of Newfoundland:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In and for the Province of Newfoundland the Legislature shall have exclusive 
authority to make laws in relation to education,  but the Legislature will not have 
authority to make laws prejudicially affecting any right or privilege with respect to 
denominational schools, common (amalgamated) schools, or denominational 
colleges, that any class or classes of persons have by law in Newfoundland at the date of 
Union, and out of public funds of the Province of Newfoundland, provided for 
education,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) all such schools shall receive their share of such funds in accordance with 
scales determined on a non-discriminatory basis from time to time by the 
Legislature for all schools then being conducted under authority of the 
Legislature; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) all such colleges shall receive their share of any grant from time to time voted 
for all colleges then being conducted under authority of the Legislature, such 
grant being distributed on a non-discriminatory basis.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	I do not know whether anyone can rise and explain the term on 
the spot. I would be prepared to take my place and ask for the 
unanimous consent of the House to allow such an explanation. It is 
obvious that, through this term, the Newfoundland legislature gave 
up to the various denominations its control over schools, its power 
to legislate with respect to matters of education.
<P>
	Today, we are hearing two theories. One claims that the repeal of 
term 17 of the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada will 
not affect minority rights, and the other claims that it will. There is 
even a third school of thought, probably the objective one, which 
tells us that it would appear that the conclusion of the referendum 
indicates that the various religious denominations, or the six main 
ones, appear to have given consent. Just now, in quoting the 
referendum figures, the hon. member for Delta attempted to 
demonstrate that the Roman Catholic Church in Newfoundland did 
not have a majority vote in favour.
<P>
	I am not, myself, in a position to give any answers. I feel that a 
thorough examination and careful attention to the speeches made in 
this House will make it possible to make a more informed decision.
<P>
	But some questions do remain. One condition for union is not 
clear. Does it affect minority rights? If so, unilateral action, without 
knowing whether the minorities agree to having their rights 
abrogated, strikes me as a disquieting precedent. If not, then all that 
we have to do is take the simple step of merely ratifying the 
consent given in Newfoundland. We need some clarification on 
this. I personally do not have enough information to form a firm 
opinion. You can understand that, when it comes to minority rights, 
we in Quebec are a little gun shy.
<P>
	If, tomorrow morning, the government of Manitoba were to hold 
a referendum to do away with section 23 of the Manitoba Act, what 
would happen? That is the section which requires the Manitoba 
legislature to pass its legislation in both official languages, the one 
which states that the language of legislation and the language of the 
courts is English and French.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6988"> 6988 </A></B>
<P>
	The 1890 Greenway laws had abrogated francophone rights in 
Manitoba. Only in 1979 did the Supreme Court, in the Forest 
decision if my memory serves me correctly, conclude that the 
1890 legislation was invalid because it was unconstitutional.
<P>
	Almost 100 years later, it was difficult to restore the rights of 
francophones who formerly made up 50 per cent of the population 
of Manitoba. According to the latest census, scarcely more than 
12,000 people in Manitoba stated they were of French Canadian 
origin.
<P>
	If a referendum were held tomorrow morning in Manitoba and 
80 or 90 per cent of the voters were in favour of repealing section 
23 of the Manitoba Act, should we adopt it with our eyes closed 
and again make English the only official language in Manitoba, 
while for 100 years, Manitoba's francophones have struggled to 
maintain their rights? That is a good question.
<P>
	If tomorrow morning, the Government of Ontario held a 
referendum to repeal section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867, 
concerning schools for Catholic minorities which, at the time, were 
also francophone minorities, would we, in the event of a positive 
outcome, agree to accept such an amendment? Personally, I do not 
think so. I think these rights should be maintained, protected and 
even expanded.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	There seems to be a complete lack of understanding between the 
people who embrace these two theories. I think it is necessary to 
clarify the interpretation of term 17 which, in any event, does not 
seem to be clear to anyone, so that we cannot really make up our 
minds. Once again, the question that was asked in the referendum 
in Newfoundland in 1995 was straightforward, but it referred to an 
extremely complex situation.
<P>
	The hon. member for Ontario said earlier that the Constitution 
should reflect the changes that take place in society. I quite agree 
with what he said. In the case of a constitutional text like the one 
we have here, the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada in 
1949, if the present Government of Newfoundland had to 
renegotiate these terms and if Canada had to renegotiate them, we 
would not end up with the same terms, certainly not term 17 in its 
present form, because it does not seem to correspond with a certain 
social reality.
<P>
	It is not up to me to find out whether it does or does not 
correspond with the social reality that exists in the province of 
Newfoundland and Labrador. It is up to the people of 
Newfoundland to decide what suits them. The only thing I have to 
check as a parliamentarian is whether minority rights, 
constitutional minority rights have been affected, yes or no.
<P>
	If not, the question is clear. The people of Newfoundland have 
decided, and I do not have to check whether they were right to 
decide in this way. If, on the  other hand, it involves constitutional 
rights, the rights enshrined to protect minorities from periodic 
changes by governments, to ensure that their rights endure, I am 
entitled to ask questions as to why the rights of a minority are to be 
changed. To my knowledge, this would be our first time in the 
history of Canada to legislate the rights of minorities and to limit 
them constitutionally. The effect of constitutional legislation 
respecting minorities has always been to extend protection.
<P>
	I hope we come to a better understanding during this debate. I do 
not think this is a partisan debate. It should not become one. It is a 
fundamental debate on the role, on the place, of minorities within 
the federation and on the interpretation to be given the Canadian 
Constitution in general.
<P>
	Let us recall that the terms of Newfoundland's union with 
Canada in 1949 were negotiated by the Government of Canada 
alone, without the provinces. The provinces were not involved in 
this negotiation.
<P>
	Which province was most interested? The Province of Quebec, 
which has a common border, the border of Labrador, which was 
defined in 1927, with the definition being cast in stone in the terms 
of Newfoundland's union with Canada in 1949 and reconfirmed in 
the Constitution of 1982. If there is one border that is not at issue, it 
is the Labrador border at the moment. The Province of Quebec was 
not consulted.
<P>
	Who protested in this House at the time? A member for the 
riding of Charlevoix, Frédéric Dorion, who, at the time, 
represented a riding along the Labrador, and consequently 
Newfoundland, border.
<P>
	Frédéric Dorion, who later became the chief justice of the 
Quebec Superior Court, said in this House it was unacceptable that 
Quebec, the neighbouring province, was not consulted on the terms 
of Newfoundland's union with Canada. I understand, because had 
we been under the effect of the present legislation, the Constitution 
of 1982, which was forced on us, this procedure would not have 
been possible. The provinces would have to be consulted.
<P>
	As we can see, the constitutional change mentioned by the 
member for Ontario is ubiquitous. Freezing the Constitution in an 
interpretation that was valid perhaps in 1949 is probably not very 
healthy. However, if the other alternative is to take away minority 
rights, I do not consider that healthy either.
<P>
	I would hope that, in the course of the debate, the information 
and especially the understanding the members of this House may 
gain from Resolution No. 12 before us, will clarify this debate and 
enable everyone to come to an understanding in their soul and in 
their conscience.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
a couple of brief comments and then a question for the member.
<P>
	In the debate a number of issues have been raised, one about 
educational reform being necessary in Newfoundland and that it 
could be achieved only through constitutional amendment. The 
quality of education has not been a question here. In fact, 
Newfoundland has done as well or better than Ontario in a recent 
national survey on science and math.
<P>
	The fact that there was a royal commission and that the 
framework agreement covered 90 per cent of the recommendations 
seems to indicate that there was a possibility that the province 
could do this.
<P>
	On the issue that Parliament alone must accede to the provincial 
will, I guess the rhetorical question is why is it in the Constitution 
in the first place, if the provinces can just say do it. It really does 
beg the question.
<P>
	There is the issue that there was a referendum. We all know the 
turnout was low and the plurality was also very low. When we are 
talking about a right that was given as part of the terms of union, it 
is clear that it is those who will be reliquishing their right who must 
have the primary say in whether that right is going to be 
relinquished.
<P>
	The last point was that minorities had their chance because there 
was a process they went through. There is no question that the 
process was procedurally fair. But I am wondering, considering the 
debate in the House and in the Senate, whether today 
Newfoundlanders would say that they really understood the 
consequences of what was being dealt with.
<P>
	My question has to do with the proposed amendment with regard 
to ``where numbers warrant''. Many members have already said 
that this was a phrase which was incorporated in the debate in this 
place, even by the justice minister in his speech on May 31, that the 
change to the Constitution would provide uni-denominational 
education ``where numbers warrant''. But that phrase was not 
specifically included in the legislation and, indeed, the amendment 
in the Senate was not passed for that. That was called for even by 
Cardinal Carter.
<P>
	I would ask the member, with regard to the issue of ``where 
numbers warrant'', would the member not concede that this would 
be a reasonable amendment to the proposal now before the House?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Mississauga 
South for his question.
<P>
	The question appears straightforward, but the answer is not. 
Either the amendment to Term 17 of the union of  Newfoundland 
with Canada, or the reverse, depending on one's point of view, 
gives constitutional protection to the right of religious 
denominations or churches in matters of education in 
Newfoundland, in which case Term 17 should not be amended, or 
the proposed amendment does not infringe the constitutional rights 
of religious groups or groups referred to in Term 17 of the terms of 
union, in which case we should simply recognize the referendum.
<P>
	There cannot, in my view, be any middle ground: either these are 
constitutional rights, in which case those affected, the minorities, 
must be consulted. It is not up to the majority to decide for the 
minority that they no longer want these rights. It must be certain 
that the minority knowingly gave up its constitutional rights. This 
is on the assumption that the constitutional amendment infringes 
minority rights.
<P>
	The other assumption, which is just as plausible, and is 
supported by a number of members in the House, says: ``Term 17 
of the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada does not 
affect the constitutional rights of certain groups in Newfoundland. 
We therefore need only recognize the referendum and blindly ratify 
it''.
<P>
	Like the hon. member for Mississauga South, I too will await the 
continuation of debate, in order to gain a greater understanding of 
the issue.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased for the second time in this House to speak on this 
amendment to term 17. I suppose in a way we might call this an 
amendment to term 17 revisited. I am pleased, as other colleagues 
of mine have said, that in effect the Senate has given us an 
opportunity to correct a mistake that I feel this House made, a very 
important and glaring mistake, last spring when it passed the 
requested amendment to term 17.
<P>
	I will first make reference to the member for Bellechasse who 
just spoke, a colleague from the Bloc, who mentioned that the 
opposition had not had a great number of opportunities to speak 
today. I am pleased that he did speak prior to my remarks. I note 
that I have heard precious little in the way of reservations from the 
official opposition. I have to ask myself why that is.
<P>
	At least the last member who spoke did raise the possibility that 
this is not the way to proceed, that there could be a matter of 
minority rights here. The vast majority of the members of the Bloc 
have simply accepted the need to pass this amendment on the 
slimmest of margins, on a fuzzy question put to the people of 
Newfoundland, in my view. I think the Bloc has its own agenda for 
supporting such a course.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6990"> 6990 </A></B>
<P>
	For the sake of historical accuracy, and a s a history teacher in a 
former life, I would like to inform the  member for Bellechasse that 
in 1867 Catholic minorities in Ontario were not strictly 
francophone. Largely they were but at that time there were many 
thousands of Irish Catholics who were in the province of Ontario; 
some of them my forebears. Just for the sake of historical accuracy 
I would like to inform the member of that point.
<P>
	The starting point of this debate from my point of view is does 
the school system of Newfoundland and Labrador need reform. I 
will not take long on that point. I had the opportunity in October to 
visit Labrador. The member of Parliament was good enough to 
invite me to visit his riding. It is clear that the school system in 
Newfoundland and Labrador is in need of reform, as several 
colleagues have said. Anyone who has informed himself or herself 
about the situation knows that is the case.
<P>
	There were long negotiations held to that end. In my view, just as 
they were about to come to fruition those negotiations were cut 
short. It is my position that the solution for the school system 
problems in Newfoundland and Labrador ought to be found or 
arrived at by the Government of Newfoundland, by school 
authorities, by the people of Newfoundland themselves with a 
made in Newfoundland and Labrador solution. Surely if all parties 
involved are parties of goodwill, and I am sure they are, this 
amendment requested of the House of Commons for the second 
time would not be necessary. I feel it is not the best solution to the 
situation that exists in Newfoundland today.
<P>
	The member for Bellechasse mentioned that some have the view 
that we must just close our eyes and pass this amendment as 
requested. I disagree with that. Many colleagues do.
<P>
	I would like to quote the Minister of Justice on May 31 when he 
said these words about that point: ``We ought to give great weight 
to the action taken by the province in question but we must not 
automatically pass a resolution at its request. We must form our 
own judgment and be satisfied that it is in the public interest to do 
so''.
<P>
	That raises the question of the public that is being referred to. 
Clearly the public in question is the Canadian public from coast to 
coast to coast. It is absolutely incorrect and shortsighted in my 
view for anyone-and we have heard that argument and we may 
again-to say that this is strictly a Newfoundland question and 
nothing else, that it is not relevant to other parts of country. That is 
absolutely incorrect or why are we speaking on this issue in this 
House today, following action taken by the other place last week.
<P>
	This is clearly a national issue. As soon as Parliament is 
involved it is automatically a national issue.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	I support the amendments made in the other place last week that 
have been introduced by my colleague, the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood today. I feel that these proposed 
amendments would facilitate the necessary educational reform in 
Newfoundland and, at the same time, maintain the existing 
minority rights which are so vital to the success of this nation. 
Either that, or we ought to go back to the negotiating table and let 
the people of Newfoundland solve this problem with a made in 
Newfoundland solution.
<P>
	In my view, the question which is very important is this. What 
are minority rights worth if they can just simply be removed, 
whatever the means, without the expressed consent of the affected 
minorities? That point has been made several times by my 
colleagues, the member of Ontario and the member for 
Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis. I was also very pleased to hear the 
comments of the Reform member for Delta earlier.
<P>
	The Reform member for Edmonton Southwest quoted Thomas 
Paine in his remarks and made a very important point which needs 
to be a little more fully addressed. His point was: ``Should it not 
fall to every generation to govern themselves and should they not 
be tied by decisions of previous generations?''
<P>
	With that logic, the relevant point is that this generation of 
minorities in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador do not 
support the proposed amendments to their rights. This generation is 
objecting. I have heard no one contest the validity of that 
statement. Therefore, it falls to this generation of Newfoundlanders 
and Labradorians and Canadians to speak on this question. The 
issue of minority rights is no less relevant for this generation than it 
was for past generations when these rights were enshrined in the 
terms of union by which Newfoundland became the 10th province 
of Canada in 1949.
<P>
	It seems that it is a day to quote great Americans so let me quote 
a great American leader, Martin Luther King Junior, when he said 
that ``injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere''. We can 
take that point and expand on it. We can say ``a threat to minority 
rights anywhere in Canada is a threat to minority rights everywhere 
in Canada''. That is exactly what is at issue for me, having 
researched this issue as carefully as I could and having tried to 
listen to all points of view on this.
<P>
	As a Canadian and as a member of Parliament that is exactly 
what we are discussing. There is no way that I can support the 
removal of minority rights anywhere in Canada without the consent 
of that minority first.
<P>
	Several colleagues have made reference to the fact that 
education was very carefully protected by section 93 in the original 
British North America Act, 1867 and was again protected in the 
Constitution Act, 1982 and in the  1949 terms of union by which 
Newfoundland became the 10th province. Anyone who does even a 
cursory reading of the political history of this country will know 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6991"> 6991 </A></B>
<P>
that there has been no more divisive issue than education, whether 
it is in your own province of Manitoba, Mr. Speaker, whether it is 
in Ontario or in Quebec. Anyone who has any knowledge of our 
political history will know that is the case.
<P>
	Indeed, my colleague from St. Boniface gave a very eloquent 
explanation about the threats to minority rights that this action 
represents. Many members feel that is not the case, it is strictly a 
Newfoundland issue. I am not reassured by those members and I 
certainly do not share that view.
<P>
	It is fairly straightforward for me. The history of this nation was 
founded on a respect for minority rights: linguistic rights, language 
rights and racial rights. It is a history of which we can be proud. 
The future of this nation will be founded on respect for minority 
rights or that future will be greatly imperilled.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	The Reform member for Delta gave a very good explanation of 
the severity of the Manitoba example where in the 1890s Prime 
Minister Laurier faced the Manitoba school crisis. I can tell him 
that I drew that very concern to the Liberal caucus privately a long 
time ago now when I stated that I did not think we needed another 
schools crisis 100 years after the Manitoba school crisis. Would it 
not be a pity if this were passed lightly, and we would look back 
and rue the day that we had launched another schools crisis, this 
time in the province of Newfoundland?
<P>
	As I said earlier, those who would draw the Senate into this are 
exhibiting very specious logic. It is simply irrelevant. Whether the 
Senate belongs as a part of our system, whether it should be elected 
or abolished, the point is this: in this case the Senate did its job.
<P>
	The appointed Senate, which is what we have in Canada, did its 
job. It said to the House of Commons: ``You have acted 
precipitously. You'd better consider that these minority rights are 
not being protected by your actions''. It was very important that the 
Senate did that. This House should do no less.
<P>
	I repeat that a threat to minority rights anywhere in Canada is a 
threat to minority rights everywhere in Canada, and that is simply 
something I cannot countenance. I support the idea of inserting the 
phrase ``where numbers warrant''. That would allow the 
educational reform which is badly needed in Newfoundland and 
Labrador to take place. It will also protect minority rights in a way 
in which they are not now protected.
<P>
	I am from Ontario although perhaps I have a little extra interest 
in this issue since my maternal grandfather was a Newfoundlander, 
but I certainly do not claim to be  a Newfoundlander. However, this 
is much more than a Newfoundland issue. It is a national issue, an 
issue of justice, an issue of minority rights.
<P>
	Many colleagues have made reference to Senator Kirby who is a 
Newfoundlander. His family is a prominent Newfoundland family. 
He has made several very good points, some of which I would like 
to quote: ``Therefore I reject the claim that the desired reform of 
the Newfoundland school system can only be achieved through a 
constitutional amendment. Indeed, the evidence suggests clearly 
that almost everything that is needed to reform the school system 
can be achieved without a constitutional amendment''. That is also 
my feeling.
<P>
	Either we shelve this issue and send it back to Newfoundland to 
solve with a made in Newfoundland solution, or now that it has 
come back to this House I will, and I hope I will be joined by a 
majority of my colleagues in this House, on careful reflection 
support the idea of inserting the words ``where numbers warrant''. 
This would allow for the needed educational reform and would still 
protect minority rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank 
the member for London-Middlesex for his speech. As he knows, 
no one should be more grateful for the opportunity to correct the 
mistake we made when we passed this bill last summer than the 
Minister of Justice.
<P>
	On May 31 in addressing this motion the justice minister said: 
``We were much affected by the fact that even after the amendment 
there will still be denominational schools in Newfoundland and 
Labrador. They will still be constitutionally entrenched as an 
entitlement of the affected denominations-The government of the 
province of Newfoundland and Labrador has also tabled draft 
legislation by which it would be provided that unidenominational 
schools may be created where numbers warrant and where the 
parents choose that for their children''.
<P>
	The justice minister seems to be suggesting that after passing the 
amendments to this motion there will still be a constitutional 
entitlement where numbers warrant. There seems to be a 
contradiction between the position of the government and the 
reality as we see it.
<P>
	Could my friend from London-Middlesex comment on that and 
on whether the government has somehow misjudged the effects of 
the bill?
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the comments and the question from my colleague from Delta.
<P>
	First, I believe that all hon. members, certainly including my 
colleague the Minister of Justice, are weighing the issue very 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6992"> 6992 </A></B>
<P>
carefully and that a free vote will be in their best judgment and 
following their conscience.  I am certainly doing that and I believe 
all other members are doing the same.
<P>
	My colleague from Delta has raised a very good point. Indeed in 
the minister's speech the words ``where numbers warrant'' as he 
has quoted are in there. I am not sure whether the justice minister 
was operating under the belief that was the intent, but it certainly 
does go along with the statement distributed by the Government of 
Newfoundland before the referendum in a householder sent to all 
the people of Newfoundland which had the exact same phrase 
``where numbers warrant''.
<P>
	My hon. colleagues from Delta and for St. Boniface, in citing the 
Newfoundland flyer, have raised very good arguments for 
supporting this amendment. I believe there should be no fear in 
supporting the inclusion of ``where numbers warrant'' in this 
motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
following on my earlier comments, I have a question for the 
member for London-Middlesex.
<P>
	Can he once again explain his point of view in this House? Why 
does he feel that the resolution before us infringes the 
constitutional rights of a class of persons in the Province of 
Newfoundland and Labrador?
<P>
	I give notice immediately of a supplementary question, but it 
will be for the member for Humber-St. Barbe-Baie Verte when 
he speaks. I will ask him why he takes the opposite view, that the 
resolution before us does not affect the constitutional rights of a 
class of persons in the Province of Newfoundland. That will 
perhaps further the debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am the 
person who is answering the questions. I will not respond for my 
colleague from Newfoundland who was just mentioned. I think all 
hon. members are searching their consciences and doing what they 
think is best for Newfoundland and, I emphasize, for all of Canada. 
All of Canada is involved in this decision because of the precedent 
nature of what is being done.
<P>
	Why do I feel that the amendment to term 17 threatens minority 
rights? For me, Mr. Speaker, it is as plain as the nose on your face. 
In 1949 the people of Newfoundland were convinced to join 
Canada, in part because of a guarantee of denominational schools 
in term 17. That minority down to this very generation has never 
willingly accepted the removal of that constitutional guarantee. To 
remove it against their will is extremely dangerous, is an injustice, 
and is something I cannot countenance. I hope it is something the 
House will not countenance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be very 
brief. I want to ask a question of the member for  
London-Middlesex. Subject to what the member for Delta has 
just said, he did not go on to make the real point that I thought 
might have been missing here and might be a linchpin in 
supporting the amendment of the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood.
<P>
	The minister's statement of May 31 that: ``denominational 
schools may be created where numbers warrant and the parents 
choose that for their children''. He then went on to state: ``In light 
of all of that we concluded that this is not an instance in which 
minority rights are being adversely affected by majority rule''.
<P>
	I believe the Minister of Justice may have been of the view that 
the province of Newfoundland was about to enact something to 
protect minority rights and therefore the Minister of Justice gave 
his tacit approval. Given that there may be this kind of confusion, 
does the hon. member not then believe that there is a possibility 
that maybe the House, including the government, will come to the 
belief that the protection of minority rights is important?
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien (London-Middlesex): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is just a 
few minutes ago that these words of the Minister of Justice have 
come to my attention. I regard them very seriously, as I know all 
my colleagues do.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	I share the views of my colleague from the riding of Ontario. It 
may well be that the Minister of Justice and the government were 
operating under an understanding which was based on the written 
statements of the Government of Newfoundland distributed to the 
people of Newfoundland in a householder which included the 
words ``where numbers warrant''. It seems logical to me that we 
might expect that is the intention of the Government of 
Newfoundland. If indeed that is the case, then the House did err last 
June in what it passed and we now have an opportunity which we 
must not let pass to correct that wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Humber-St. Barbe-Baie Verte, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is certainly a lively debate. It is very refreshing and 
interesting to have members of the same party debating an issue. It 
shows that the House of Commons is alive and vibrant and that the 
Liberal government does not take anything verbatim. It debates it 
internally and then puts motions on the floor to iron out good 
policy which is effective and in the best interests of all Canadians.
<P>
	We are talking about term 17 which concerns denominational 
education in Newfoundland schools. I want to say first and 
foremost that I do not take any particular pleasure in standing and 
saying that change is necessary. Change means that we have to take 
a second look at how we do things.
<P>
	I want to say to all Canadians that what we are doing here is in 
the best interests of all citizens. We are acting  in the best interests 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6993"> 6993 </A></B>
<P>
of citizens who want to be full partners in Canada and who want to 
participate in an education system which is first class, which 
promotes excellence and the spiritual values which they want to 
keep.
<P>
	We are debating a particular clause in the term 17 amendment 
which has been put forward: ``where numbers warrant''.
<P>
	I am a member of Parliament from Newfoundland. I would like 
to interject a bit of my own personal experience with the 
Newfoundland school system and the excellence which it 
promotes. Hon. members who have mentioned it this afternoon are 
quite right that Newfoundland has an education system and a desire 
to educate its young people which is probably above and beyond 
any other in the country.
<P>
	We appreciate the value and the importance of a strong 
educational system. We also appreciate the fact that we have to 
make the system better. We are not prepared to put any young 
Newfoundlanders or Labradorians in harm's way while we go 
about that task.
<P>
	We now find ourselves in a situation which will improve the 
educational system for our province. We are debating a particular 
section of an amendment which states ``where numbers warrant''. 
Let us talk about where numbers warrant.
<P>
	Newfoundland has approximately 750 communities throughout 
the entire province, the majority of which have a population of 
approximately 350 to 500. Newfoundland has as part of its terms of 
union with Canada a section which says that denominational 
education is extremely important and that it will be respected. It is 
a value which Newfoundlanders share.
<P>
	I return to ``where numbers warrant''. Here is a critical 
difference in what hon. members would propose versus what I 
would inform them. We are going to respect religious education in 
Newfoundland and Labrador. However, if we were to establish a 
religious school in every community of Newfoundland and 
Labrador, in all 750 communities, we would have to take into 
account about 15 established religions. There are a lot more 
religions with fewer members. I suggest they may be in the 
minority. There are no religious denominations which are in the 
minority in Newfoundland and Labrador because every educational 
institution, every elementary or high school is a religious school, a 
denominational school. There are no non-denominational schools 
in Newfoundland and Labrador right now. Everybody who goes to 
school in Newfoundland and Labrador right now goes to a religious 
school.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	That means there are people in Newfoundland and Labrador who 
profess a particular faith but because the school in their community 
is not of their faith, they are  not receiving any religious instruction 
whatsoever in their faith. They are receiving generic religious 
instruction.
<P>
	The hon. members who are presenting this amendment are 
prepared to say ``where numbers warrant''. Given the fact that we 
are entrenching religious rights in education where numbers 
warrant, if there is one person of a particular religious affiliation 
who is living in a province where religious schools, not religious 
education but religious schools are entrenched for everybody, it 
means they are proposing that a community of 350 people with 15 
different religions should have 15 different schools. I think 
everybody in Canada realizes that there cannot be 15 schools with 
15 principals and at least 15 teachers located in one community of 
350 people, a community not unlike where I lived. It would create 
an absolutely uncontrollable financial burden.
<P>
	We are talking about minority rights. It must be pointed out that 
everybody in Newfoundland and Labrador has to go to a 
denominational school whether or not they are part of that 
denomination because it is that denomination which established a 
school in their community. Whether they are Anglican or 
Pentecostal they have to go to that school, otherwise they will not 
be educated.
<P>
	No one in this debate has talked about the students who have 
slipped through the cracks, the students who do not receive 
religious instruction in the faith of their choice. Nobody in the 
House has talked about the 50 per cent of Pentecostal students in 
Newfoundland and Labrador who, because they live in a 
community where there is no Pentecostal school, do not receive 
religious instruction taught by a member of their own faith. They 
receive the generic religious instruction.
<P>
	A very pragmatic compromise has been reached which says that 
Newfoundlanders value religious education. We value religious 
instruction. A compromise has been reached that unlike today, in 
every school in Newfoundland and Labrador the students will be 
able to receive religious instruction from a teacher of the faith of 
their choice.
<P>
	That is not the way it is today. If by fate of geography a student 
happens to live in a community where there is no majority of 
students who are members of a particular faith, as a minority in that 
community no religious instruction is received in the faith of the 
student's choice. The student would have to go to the religious 
school where another faith is being taught, sit there and take it in.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	However the Newfoundland government has decided through 
consultation with the people that religious education is a value and 
a right worth preserving. That is exactly what it has done.
<P>
	We have heard from some hon. members that it is a time tested 
philosophy that where numbers warrant we  will be able to 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6994"> 6994 </A></B>
<P>
establish denominational schools. And I separate denominational 
schools from religious education. Under the current motion which 
is before this House, religious education is preserved. What we say 
we do not need is religious schools per se where we establish seven 
or eight different institutions in one community to accomplish the 
same goal, educating our young people.
<P>
	Not one member in this House has absorbed the fact that it 
comes with a significant financial burden. How does a province 
like Newfoundland deal with that financial burden? How does a 
province like Newfoundland which through the deliberations of 
hon. members in this House has to deal with the fact that cash 
transfers to the provinces are being reduced? It would probably 
cost about $300 million to establish schools in every community. It 
will be the Newfoundland government which pays that price.
<P>
	A better solution is before us. It is a solution which takes into 
consideration the rights and the opportunities of all students in 
Newfoundland and Labrador to be instructed by instructors in the 
same religious faith as they profess, unlike today.
<P>
	This issue has been held up in the other place for quite some 
time. It has been held up while a proposal has been put forward to 
make sure that French education is established in the new school 
system. However, as long as we debate this, we will not be able to 
enact the rights of French students to have instruction in the 
language of their choice because we are still hung up on and 
debating the fact that minorities are being hard done by. There are 
no minorities in Newfoundland. Everybody in Newfoundland and 
Labrador currently attends a denominational school, whether or not 
they are a member of that denomination.
<P>
	No member in this House has spoken up and asked: What about 
the people who are not members of this particular denomination? 
How will they receive religious instruction in the future? Will they 
have to sit there and not participate in religious instruction of their 
choice as is currently going on? They are not talking about how 
much it is going to cost to establish a school in every community of 
the province. They are saying that they do not think the 
Newfoundland people have really thought this out, so they are 
going to think for them. I have not seen such an insulting point of 
view expressed in a long time in responsible government.
<P>
	We have decided this issue. Look at the balance on how we 
decided this issue. We have looked at it from the point of view of 
the individual. We have looked at it from the point of view of all 
students. In the original terms of agreement when Newfoundland 
and Labrador joined Canada, we said that as a value our province 
respected religious education, not necessarily religious schools, but 
religious education. We do not really subscribe to the fact that we 
establish an institution. The denomination is  what is important. 
The religious faith is what is important.
<P>
	Under the current system every student in Newfoundland and 
Labrador will receive instruction in the denomination of their 
choice. That is sound public policy. That is respecting the rights of 
the individual. That is good government.
<P>
	Unfortunately my time is up. In deciding on this issue, members 
should bear in mind that we have had a very good discussion. Good 
ideas have come forward and we are prepared to move on to be 
proud, dignified members of the Canadian Confederation. We will 
do so respecting the rights of individuals and respecting fiscal 
responsibility.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FOODINSPECTIONAGENCY">FOOD INSPECTION AGENCY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Derek Wells (South Shore, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
questions are for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
concerning the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
<P>
	As I have explained to this House on many occasions, there are 
more seafood processors in my South Shore riding than in any 
other riding in Canada. I am advised by organizations representing 
these companies as well as the organization representing members 
from the federal constituency of South West Nova that there has 
been no consultation on Bill C-60 in my constituency, and this 
concerns me greatly.
<P>
	Whereas I understand that discussions have been held with the 
Fisheries Council of Canada, please be assured that this 
organization is only one of several industry organizations 
representing Nova Scotia seafood processors.
<P>
	Consequently, I am asking the minister to give assurances that 
the small and medium size processing companies be given an 
opportunity to provide input before the legislation becomes law.
<P>
	Seafood producers have brought three other important issues to 
my attention in recent weeks: increased distancing between 
industry and government, uncertainties associated with fee setting 
and service delivery, and privatization of services.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6995"> 6995 </A></B>
<P>
	The seafood industry in my riding perceives that the new 
agency, as proposed in legislation, will add more distance between 
the policy makers, regulators and industry itself. For the record, 
it is important to understand why industry is raising the issue now. 
Let me explain.
<P>
	The decision to move DFO inspection headquarters from Halifax 
to Moncton for the maritimes region was seen by Nova Scotia 
processors as counterproductive with respect to servicing industry. 
It is difficult to understand why a division as vital to industry as the 
inspection directorate was moved out of the province and further 
distanced from the focal point of processing activity in Atlantic 
Canada.
<P>
	Processors now fear that the new legislation which creates an 
advisory board to advise and report to the minister responsible for 
the Canadian Food Inspection Agency will result in further 
distancing between the seafood industry and government. It is 
believed that the advisory board will be a blue ribbon panel 
comprised of executives from the largest corporations from each of 
the sectors reporting to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. I 
must advise the minister that it is imperative to broaden 
representation.
<P>
	With respect to fees, the seafood industry is concerned that fee 
setting for inspection services remains the exclusive domain of 
government. It foresee that fees could be increased and new fees 
added without any procedure to control or audit this process. 
Industry is asking to incorporate into the legislation a mechanism 
which ensures fees are discussed with industry in advance of 
implementation. It would also like to see a procedure which 
provides for independent review and audit of the inspection agency 
activities.
<P>
	A suggestion which merits consideration is to look at Iceland as 
a model. I understand that many inspection services are delivered 
by the private sector but the national government observes the 
system through routine auditing and reporting. I believe Canada, 
like Iceland, has a vested interest in ensuring that business is not 
restricted or held hostage by single service providers.
<P>
	I would recommend therefore that the legislation be amended 
with provisions to give the seafood industry a reasonable level of 
assurance that partnership agreements will be considered only if 
businesses will not be disadvantaged on the basis of size or ability 
to pay.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State (Agriculture 
and Agri-Food, Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to respond to the concerns raised by some members of 
the seafood industry about the possible loss of expertise and 
advocacy for seafood at the federal level once the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency is created.
<P>
	Clearly it is very much this expertise that underscores the safety 
and trade ability of Canadian fish and fish  products. We export 
over 80 per cent of our fish products today. Our exports are worth 
about $3 billion a year and are in large part directly supported by 
the system and expertise in the fish inspection area.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Expertise, professional experience and advocacy for sea food 
must continue and will continue to be an integral part of the agency. 
Our departmental staff is trying to determine the best way to have 
access to these skills during the transition period prior to 
establishing the Food Inspection Agency and also in the longer 
term.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I expect the agency will work over the first year to develop the 
optimal organization for the future which will best serve industry 
and the public. Service to and interests of the seafood industry will 
be paramount in this process.
<P>
	I would also like to confirm the minister of agriculture's 
intention to have strong representation of the fisheries sector on the 
ministerial advisory board of the agency.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have been consulting industry groups on a permanent basis 
during this past year. We will continue to do so when the agency is 
ready to become operational.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> A motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted. The House stands adjourned until10 a.m. tomorrow.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.36 p.m.)
