<BLOCKQUOTE>-Minister of Industry-Second reading and reference to the Standing 
Committee on Industry of Bill C-43, an act to amend the Lobbyists Registration 
Act and to make related amendments to other acts.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> That Bill C-43. an act to amend the Lobbyists Registration Act and to make 
related amendments to other acts be referred forthwith to the Standing 
Committee on Industry.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the motion today is very 
simple and straightforward. The government wants to provide 
members of this House with a greater role in preparing 
legislation through House of Commons committees.
<P>
	That was a commitment we made in the red book. We honour 
the commitment to give MPs a greater role today as part of the 
process of honouring another red book commitment, that of 
restoring public trust and confidence in the government's 
decision making process.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Yesterday, the Prime Minister presented a comprehensive 
reform program, one component of which is the bill now before 
us today. The proposed amendments to the Lobbyists 
Registration Act are based on two fundamental principles, 
principles which are shared by my colleagues in this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The first is that all Canadians have a right to approach their 
government without employing lobbyists. The second belief 
that forms the basis for the legislation before us is that lobbying 
must be transparent so that  Canadians can have confidence that 
decisions are based upon merit.
<P>
	It is with these principles in mind that the Prime Minister 
announced yesterday the creation of the position of ethics 
counsellor.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the red book, we pledged that a Liberal government would 
appoint an ethics counsellor who would be available to advise 
lobbyists and their clients on how to do business with the federal 
government.
<P>
	The ethics counsellor would also have the task of drafting a 
code of ethics for lobbyists which would define behaviour 
standards in the industry.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This bill gives the ethics counsellor the powers necessary to 
investigate lobbying activities contrary to the code. The 
counsellor will be able to report publicly on breaches of the code 
and will have the power to disclose publicly the fees charged by 
lobbyists in pursuit of government contracts where it is in the 
public interest to do so. This will provide a strong incentive for 
lobbying firms to abide by the spirit of openness and 
transparency that is at the heart of the reforms before us today.
<P>
	The other reforms in the bill before us build upon the 
requirements in the Lobbyists Registration Act which came into 
effect in 1989.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to remind the House that last year, the Standing 
Committee on Consumer and Corporate Affairs and 
Government Operations studied the lobbying issue.
<P>
	In June of 1993, committee members released a report 
entitled ``A Blueprint for Transparency: Review of the 
Lobbyists Registration Act''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The committee's report concluded that the Lobbyists 
Registration Act did not reveal enough about the activities of 
lobbyists. The report made the case for the disclosure of 
additional information about lobbyists and their activities and 
those are the recommendations that have provided the basis for 
the amendments before us today.
<P>
	The legislation provides greater transparency in four ways.
<P>
	First, under the existing Lobbyists Registration Act lobbyists 
need to disclose only general subject matter. Under the new bill 
they will have to be very specific.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5504"> 5504 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, under the existing legislation lobbyists need not 
disclose to whom they will be talking. Under the new bill they 
will have t disclose what departments and governmental 
agencies they will contact.
<P>
	Third, under the existing law lobbyists need not disclose how 
they intend to lobby. Under the new bill they will.
<P>
	Fourth, under the existing law lobbyists who are employed by 
organizations such as associations and by companies need only 
provide their name and business address. Under the new law 
these in-house lobbyists would disclose the broad subject 
matter of the lobbying and detailed subject matter of their 
lobbying efforts, including the name of the legislative proposal, 
bill or resolution, policy, regulation, grant, contribution or other 
financial benefit and they would register the name of the 
departments or governmental agencies to be contacted.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government has decided to maintain the distinction 
between consultant lobbyists and in-house lobbyists who work 
either for an organization or a corporation. We believe there is a 
major difference between these two types of lobbyists, both in 
terms of the nature of their activities and their status.
<P>
	Consultant lobbyists work somewhat independently under 
contract on behalf of a client. Unless they file detailed returns on 
the nature of their client's interests, it is impossible to say that 
their activities are transparent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Organization lobbyists, on the other hand, work for 
associations that are formed by their members to pursue their 
common objectives. The objectives of the associations are 
generally well publicized and in a similar way corporate 
lobbyists clearly and legitimately pursue their own company's 
interests. Most important, all lobbyists will be required to 
disclose both more information and information that is more 
meaningful than is now the case.
<P>
	This legislation has gone a great distance to shed more light 
on the activities of all lobbyists so that Canadians can assure 
themselves the system is not being abused.
<P>
	In this regard several proposed changes have been introduced 
to improve the administration and enforcement of the provisions 
of the act. The limitation period for laying charges in summary 
proceedings will be increased from the current six month period 
to two years to strengthen the RCMP's ability to enforce the act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	At the registrar's request, lobbyists will be required to clarify 
the information contained in the returns that they have filed. 
Lobbyists will also be allowed to file their  returns 
electronically to avoid an unnecessary paper trail and to 
accelerate the disclosure process.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The first of our two principles, I would remind the House, is 
that all Canadians have a right to approach their government. 
They do not require lobbyists.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I hope that in the coming weeks, we will all benefit from the 
advice and counsel of Canadians who will be asked to present 
their views on this bill to the committee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I look forward to hearing new ideas that the committee may 
propose and we are willing to amend this bill if it means 
providing a piece of legislation that will do more to earn the 
trust and confidence of Canadians in the decision making 
process.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-43 
comes within the comprehensive plan unveiled yesterday 
morning to restore the trust of the public in their institutions.
<P>
	The bill focuses on lobbyists and thus, does not address issues 
pertaining to the code of conduct governing ministers and senior 
officials as well as parliamentarians. In that regard however, the 
Prime Minister indicated yesterday in his presentation that these 
issues will be dealt with in a subsequent bill.
<P>
	The main elements of the bill are the following: first, 
lobbyists are required to disclose the specific subject-matter of 
their activities, the name of the government departments or 
institutions they will be lobbying, the communication 
techniques that will be used and, in certain cases, information 
about the true beneficiary of the lobbying.
<P>
	Second, consultant lobbyists, that is to say those who work for 
lobbying firms, commonly referred to as professional lobbyists, 
are required to report this information for each new undertaking 
or contract, while in-house corporate and organizational 
lobbyists, those who work for large companies or interest 
groups, are required to report annually. Both tiers of lobbyists 
are required to report changes in this information within thirty 
days.
<P>
	Third, the enactment allows lobbyists to file their returns 
electronically, sets the limitation period for enforcement 
proceedings at two years and provides for a Parliamentary 
review of the act in four years. The prescription period was 
extended to two years-from six months-with respect to 
proceedings before the counsellor, but this will be discussed 
later.
<P>
	Finally, the enactment provides for the designation of an 
ethics counsellor who establishes a lobbyists' code of conduct 
and investigates alleged breaches of it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5505"> 5505 </A></B>
<P>
	The Bloc supports the establishment of an ethics counsellor 
position and is satisfied with the powers of investigation vested 
in the counsellor. Although the Bloc agrees with the 
appointment of Howard Wilson, who is now Assistant Deputy 
Registrar General, it had hoped that future ethics counsellors 
would be appointed by the House of Commons.
<P>
	The Bloc is therefore disappointed to see that the Liberals will 
make the appointment through an order of the 
Governor-in-Council. The counsellor is supposed to be a kind 
of guardian of integrity. Why would he not be accountable to 
Parliament for his actions?
<P>
	On the contrary, Bill C-43 sort of makes him accountable to 
the Prime Minister who, as we know, has partisan interests, 
unlike Parliament. The other guardian of public integrity, the 
Chief Electoral Officer, is appointed through a resolution of the 
House of Commons. The Bloc thinks that the guardian of this 
institution's integrity should be chosen on the same basis.
<P>
	Finally, in response to the argument that the leaders of the 
opposition parties were consulted before Mr. Wilson was 
appointed, yes, it is true that a letter sent by the Prime Minister 
to the Leader of the Official Opposition and to the leader of the 
Reform Party mentions Mr. Wilson's appointment, but it was not 
the main purpose of the letter.
<P>
	The Bloc agrees that Mr. Wilson's first mandate should be to 
develop a conflict-of-interest code for lobbyists. It is, however, 
disappointed that the Liberal government refuses to give 
regulatory status to the yet-to-be-developed code, which would 
have made it more legally binding. In my opinion, since the 
ethics code is neither a statutory instrument nor an act of 
Parliament, it has the substance and consistency of a prayer, 
which I think will make lobbyists, who are not in the habit of 
worrying about minor considerations, feel morally entitled to 
circumvent prayers.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Bloc would have liked the government to 
announce the end of tax deductions for lobbyists' fees, as the 
Minister of Transport suggested. This deduction means that 
taxpayers are indirectly financing the efforts of those trying to 
influence authorities.
<P>
	Nowhere does the bill say that lobbying expenses or contracts 
will be made public. For the sake of openness, the public should 
have access to this information because it is very relevant for 
assessing what lobbyists do. At the very least, the bill could 
have provided that if there is an investigation, the counsellor 
should be required to make this amount public.
<P>
	The bill has an attractive feature: disclosure of the means of 
communication used by the lobbyist. However, it is difficult for 
us to assess its significance at this stage. The regulations will 
surely make the scope of this provision clear. The bill also 
mentions electronic communication; it will favour 
communication by fax and  other modern media. Regulations on 
these matters will follow.
<P>
	To ensure greater transparency, as the Minister of Industry 
just said, the Liberal Party's position on the Lobbyists 
Registration Act, as stated on page 95 of the red book, is as 
follows: ``To increase the transparency of the government's 
relations with lobbyists. . . a Liberal government will implement 
the. . . June 1993 report of the House of Commons Standing 
Committee on Consumer and Corporate Affairs respecting the 
Lobbyists Registration Act'', known as the Holtmann report.
<P>
	Among the main commitments of the Holtmann report, it said 
in Recommendation No. 1 that the distinction between Tier I 
lobbyists, who work for lobbying companies and are called 
consultant lobbyists in the new law, and Tier II lobbyists, who 
are paid employees of a corporation, for example, the 
vice-president of public relations at Bell Canada or another big 
corporation, should be eliminated.
<P>
	In another recommendation, it said that the disclosure 
requirements should be the same for all lobbyists, in whatever 
category. Unfortunately, these recommendations were not 
followed and the dual system persists. These are major dilutions 
of the Holtmann report. How can you justify giving lobbyists for 
big corporations two months to file a return when consultant 
lobbyists must do so in 10 days? What is the rationale for such a 
distinction?
<P>
	The Holtmann report also recommended that the Lobbyists 
Registration Act and the Lobbyists Registration Regulations be 
amended to force lobbyists to provide more details on the 
purpose of their efforts. More specifically, lobbyists should say 
whether their representations concern bills, amendments to acts, 
subsidies, contributions, regulations, policies, programs, 
contracts or legislative proposals. They should also mention 
who they are trying to influence and name the department 
responsible for the service concerned, as well as the office of the 
parliamentarian or organization contacted. That 
recommendation was also significantly watered down.
<P>
	From now on, lobbyists, regardless of their category, will 
have to specify the purpose of their representations to the 
government. They will have to name which bill, proposal, 
legislation, resolution, regulations, program or subsidy is the 
object of their efforts. We notice that the government has 
listened to lobbyists representing major corporations and 
interest groups which can afford full-time lobbyists, and has 
maintained two tiers of lobbyists.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois nevertheless congratulates the 
government for having gone a little farther. However, we are 
under the impression that the Liberals are like fishermen who do 
not enjoy fishing. They go fishing but they do so reluctantly. If 
they make a good catch, it does  not necessarily make them 
happy. It is unfortunate that we do not see any real political will 
and drive to put the emphasis on the activities performed by 
lobbyists. This may be the biggest reproach that we can level at 
the Liberals, who nevertheless deserve some praise for having 
gone a little 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5506"> 5506 </A></B>
<P>
farther, as I just said. By taking small steps from Parliament to 
Parliament, we may eventually reach our goal.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak today on amendments to the 
Lobbyists Registration Act.
<P>
	The primary reason for changing the act is to ensure that 
decision making is done with transparency and under public 
scrutiny. We are trying to ensure that lobbyists are going to truly 
represent the people and not special interest groups. I applaud 
the government for making these changes to the Lobbyists 
Registration Act.
<P>
	Historically, lobbyists have wielded enormous power. Their 
numbers are not insignificant; they have grown from over 800 
two years ago to some 944 as of March of this year. They have 
often operated in a secretive fashion and not, I believe, in the 
best interests of the public. It is unfortunate their power has been 
so significant because they do not necessarily represent the 
silent majority this country has. It is something the people of 
Canada have often felt powerless to engage in.
<P>
	These individuals run their agendas through government, 
often peddling their influence to certain groups. As I said 
before, it is not necessarily in the public interest that they 
prevail. It is wise to look at some of the changes this act 
provides.
<P>
	The proposed legislation tabled today is aimed at restoring 
public confidence in the decision making process. As part of its 
commitment to ensure that members of Parliament are given a 
greater role in drafting legislation, the government intends to 
send this bill to committee before second reading as permitted 
under the standing orders. I applaud the government in doing 
this because it makes the process more open to all parties.
<P>
	The proposed amendments would strengthen the Lobbyists 
Registration Act by increasing the transparency of lobbying 
activities directed at the federal government and by increasing 
the power of the newly employed ethics counsellor to 
investigate complaints about lobbying activities. The 
amendments follow the recommendations of the Standing 
Committee on Consumer and Corporate Affairs and 
Government Operations requiring all lobbyists to reveal more 
about their projects.
<P>
	Consulting lobbyists who act on behalf of clients would be 
required to file more specific information of their undertakings. 
Right now they disclose only the general subject matter of their 
lobbying campaigns. Under this bill they would have to report 
the following: the specific subject matter of their lobbying 
efforts; the name of each department or government institution 
to be contacted;  the techniques they will use; and the true 
beneficiaries of their efforts.
<P>
	Under the current act in-house lobbyists who work for 
companies or organizations need file only business card 
information. Under this bill they will be required to file once a 
year specific information including the following: a description 
of who their employer represents and the employer's lines of 
business; the specific subject matter of their lobbying efforts; 
the name of each department or government institution to be 
contacted; the techniques to be used; and the names of the 
employees who engage in lobbying.
<P>
	All lobbyists would have to inform the registrar of lobbyists 
within 30 days of the termination or change of activity.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Lobbyists that do not adhere to these rules can be found guilty 
of a criminal offence and fined up to $25,000. It is interesting to 
note that these penalties are often missing in the lobbyists 
registration acts in the United States.
<P>
	This act is a leader in North American and in first world 
nations because it gives some teeth to the act that are missing in 
other countries. It also provides for the ability of the RCMP to 
enforce the act.
<P>
	The legislation tabled today also provides that the ethics 
counsellor would develop in consultation with the industry a 
lobbyists code of conduct and investigate complaints about 
lobbying activities that run counter to the code. It would also 
make a public report of the results of any investigation. These 
are all in keeping with the transparency I mentioned before and 
can only be applauded.
<P>
	With the legislation the government intends to ensure that 
lobbyists cannot exercise the undue influence they have in the 
past. The primary reason for revamping the Lobbyists 
Registration Act will ensure, as I said before, that decision 
making is done with transparency and under public scrutiny. It 
will try to ensure that lobbyist representations are made very 
clear and the techniques they use are made very obvious to 
everyone concerned.
<P>
	There are some amendments that we need to make. The new 
ethics counsellor is available to the Prime Minister to 
investigate cabinet ministers. We believe it should be the other 
way around. Instead the Prime Minister should be available to 
the ethics counsellor for these investigations. The reason behind 
it is that we feel the counsellor must be independent of political 
influence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5507"> 5507 </A></B>
<P>
	Another point to be made is that government funding for 
lobby groups and special interest groups must stop. That is 
something we have continued to put forth as a party in the House 
and in the public for a long time. We believe it is very unfair for 
the public to be funding a special lobby group, a special interest 
group, that in many cases does not represent the true interests of 
the silent majority most of the time. I implore the government to 
take heed of this point. We have raised it before in the House. I 
also implore all government officials, particularly those of us 
who are new at the job, to be very wary of these groups.
<P>
	One of the most difficult things I have found since being here 
is how to get to the truth of the matter, how to find out what the 
true answers are, what the people want and what the real 
problem is in definition. We are all in our offices subjected to 
large numbers of people from different groups who are giving us 
various points of view. Sometimes when we sit there listening to 
them we can be convinced that they represent the will of the 
people.
<P>
	Being a sceptical individual I find it very difficult to believe 
that many individuals truly represent the truth, truly represent 
what our constituents want or truly represent the wishes of the 
silent majority. I would ask all of us in the House to be wary of 
that and try to continually ask ourselves what the majority of 
Canadian people feel about a specific issue. It is not an easy 
thing to do. It will be a continual battle for all of us to try to 
answer during our tenure.
<P>
	I also implore members of the public to influence us where 
they can. We do not as a group want to be influenced by special 
interest groups. We need the influence of the silent majority in 
order to effectively represent the wishes of the majority of the 
people in the country. Only by the Canadian public coming to us 
to tell us what the average person on the street wants can we 
effectively and truly represent their wishes and do the best job 
we can.
<P>
	I make an open plea to members of the Canadian public, if 
they are feeling apathetic, to try to influence us, to write to us 
and to give their wishes and views on what they want us to do 
here. That is the only way we can be forceful in terms of wishes. 
We are only as good as the constituents who influence us.
<P>
	It is wise to summarize by looking at the underlying 
principles of the current legislation we want to promote such as 
openness. Records on paid lobbyists should be available 
publicly. There should be clarity to reinforce the principle of 
openness. There should be access to government by all people, 
not only lobbyist groups. The people on the street must have 
access to us freely, as the minister mentioned before. They must 
take advantage of that in a democratic society such as we have in 
the country. Not every country in the world has given the power 
to the people to do that. We are one of the few  countries to have 
it. I implore the people of Canada to come out and exercise their 
right to do so.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	We have a credo in our party. I ask all members of the House 
to please listen. We believe in the common sense of the people, 
their right to be consulted on public policy matters before major 
decisions are made, their right to govern themselves through 
truly representative and responsible institutions, and their right 
to directly initiate legislation for which substantial public 
support is demonstrated.
<P>
	I hope the government will listen carefully, use them as 
guiding principles in its legislative efforts and institute and 
support efforts to democratize the system this party has 
presented, which I know many people in the House support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I begin by saying that the member 
for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca has raised a couple of very good 
points in terms of possible amendments.
<P>
	The point he raised about government funding lobbyists is 
something we have to review. Many members find it strange that 
we fund heavily many lobbyists. In many cases the government 
funds them to constantly criticize even the good things 
governments are doing. Therefore, as the bill proceeds to 
committee, I know that part of it will be subjected to some good 
and rigorous exchanges in debate.
<P>
	I also congratulate the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Industry for taking the necessary time to bring before the House 
a comprehensive package. Often in our haste we could have 
maybe had the Lobbyists Registration Act amended and it might 
not have met the total test. By having a comprehensive package 
which includes an ethics counsellor, the Prime Minister has 
sensitized all of us who are public office holders and the entire 
machinery of government, as well as outside lobbyists. We will 
do our best to make sure the process of rebuilding trust is one 
that involves a constant, high profile, highly respected public 
servant who will keep us all alert to what tends to be the 
temptations to which the member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca 
alluded.
<P>
	Many people come into our offices at times. Sometimes it is 
difficult to judge where the real truth comes from. It is so easy in 
this game because sometimes the presentations to us as 
members of Parliament are so sophisticated and well organized 
that we end up buying in to some of the policies thrown at us. 
This will put a very vigorous discipline on us to make sure we 
get to the bottom of all information presented to us.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to highlight subclause 5(2)(i) which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5508"> 5508 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>where the individual has undertaken to communicate with a public office 
holder in an attempt to influence any matter described in subparagraphs 1(a)(i) to 
(vi), particulars to identify any communication technique that the individual has 
used or expects to use in an attempt to influence that matter;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is a central point in the legislation and I say that from 
experience in the past Parliament. Often in the past we were not 
aware of the various techniques used by lobbyists. What are 
some of those techniques?
<P>
	First, let us take the drug patent legislation as an example. 
That is a bill by which members can see the full force of a lobby 
at work. The organization of brand name manufacturers not only 
had very good lobbyists but used polling companies. It used 
advertising. It used print. It used the media. If we were not really 
sensitive to the total package or the comprehensive 
communication strategy they were using, we could be very 
susceptible to their particular lobby or their particular point of 
view.
<P>
	Often in the House of Commons we are susceptible to polls 
because we have been conditioned as politicians to look at polls 
to find out what people are thinking. In the past we have seen 
lobbyists designing polls and using polls to create a sense that 
the public was supporting the presentation they were making to 
us on a particular issue. That is where we have to keep our heads 
up.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you are a veteran of the Hill; you have been here 
for many years. You have seen these various techniques 
employed. The bill states that the technique lobbyists are using, 
whether it be print media or polling, the total package of how 
they will try to shift our attitude toward redrafting a piece of 
legislation, has to be on the table. Their operation has to be 
transparent in the way it comes at us. That is a key component of 
the legislation. It will help us make better laws for the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry made another very important point 
in his speech: Canadians do not have to pay to talk to their 
members of Parliament. Millions of people would probably be 
shocked at the very thought of having to pay to speak to their 
members of Parliament.
<P>
	The member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca alluded to the fact 
that during the last 10 years the sector of the economy that grew 
the most in this town was the lobby sector. I do not know what 
the percentage increase was, but it outstripped every other 
sector in terms of growth in this city. An impression was created 
that if we really wanted to get something done in Ottawa we had 
to go through a lobbyist. It made members of Parliament seem 
irrelevant.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	I remember being in opposition and feeling the frustration. 
When I would run into constituents flying back to Toronto or in a 
restaurant or doing something in town here, I would say: ``What 
are you doing here?'' They would say: ``Well, I'm with my 
lobbyist trying to get something done''. I would ask: ``What do 
you mean you are with your lobbyist? Why wouldn't you just 
come around? This is what we as members of Parliament are  
here for. This is what we are here to help you with. You don't 
have to pay a lobbyist''.
<P>
	If we are talking about a piece of complex policy where they 
want to get some ultra-sophisticated advice on how one might 
advance a very complex issue, fine, there are some good 
professional policy people out there who can help. But you 
never have to pay to get access to your member of Parliament.
<P>
	In dealing with this legislation in the first part of our mandate 
in a comprehensive way, we are not only going to help our 
constituents, whether they be from a social agency or a business, 
but we will also be reinvigorating the role of members of 
Parliament.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and the Minister of Industry through this 
legislation will make our role as members of Parliament much 
more meaningful than it has been in the last 10 years. In the 
previous 10 years it is a well known fact that if one had a really 
good lobbyist who could get to the eight or ten key people who 
were basically administering the government, one had a pretty 
good chance of getting one's issue on the front burner.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is saying with his comprehensive ethics 
package: ``Work with your members of Parliament. They're 
here. They're working for you''. We are not trying to put 
lobbyists out of business, but we are trying to put the role and the 
responsibility of members of Parliament back to where it once 
was.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
proposed legislation to amend the Lobbyists Registration Act 
gives us a chance to reflect on the state of our democracy. Since 
the Berlin wall came down and the Soviet empire was 
dismantled, we have seen some major attempts at 
democratization, by countries which for decades had lived under 
the yoke of a totalitarian state.
<P>
	Against this background, we are sometimes tempted to 
idealize our own political system and give it virtues that do not, 
however, stand up to close scrutiny. There are also those who, 
rather simplistically, tend to confuse democracy with universal 
suffrage. I do not deny the fact that the electoral process is 
ultimately a symbol of democracy, but, with Alexis de 
Tocqueville, I want to point out that democracy means far more.
<P>
	During the last federal election campaign, the Liberal Party 
announced it would work on enhancing the credibility of 
parliamentarians and wanted to give them a code of ethics. So 
what happened? Since the beginning of the 35th Parliament, the 
government has repeatedly done the exact opposite of what it 
pledged to do.
<P>
	A few examples. Before the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources had even started its consultations and studies on the 
reform of health and social security programs, the government 
announced in its February 22 budget, without involving 
parliamentarians or the Canadian public, a number of draconian 
cuts in unemployment insurance totalling more than $5 billion.  
Did the government receive a democratic mandate from the 
people, in this case?
<P>
<B></B>

<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Without the consent of opposition members democratically 
elected to the House of Commons, the government, by the sheer 
force of its majority, imposed the presence of non-elected 
senators on the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
Defence. Does this not show contempt for the democratic 
process? Before the Special Joint Committee responsible for 
reviewing Canada's foreign policy had even started its 
activities, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced that from 
now on, development assistance would no longer be conditional 
on a country's respect for human rights.
<P>
	Did the government receive a mandate from the people to that 
effect? Hardly, if the objections of Canadian stakeholders in the 
international development sector are any indication. I am 
thinking in particular of the tens of thousands of Canadians and 
Quebecers who spend their time and their energies so that NGOs 
from Canada and Quebec can provide humanitarian aid to the 
poorest in the world. I am also thinking of the close 
relationships forged with people in developing countries, 
relationships that are formed around the concepts of viable 
development, democratic development and respect for human 
rights.
<P>
	In its Bill C-22, dealing with the cancellation of the contract 
to privatize terminals 1 and 2 at Toronto Airport, the 
government refuses to make full disclosure of all the dirty tricks 
surrounding the signing of this privatization contract. It refuses 
to force the main players in this affair to come before the 
Standing Committee on Transport.
<P>
	In clause 10 of this bill, for example, the government gives 
itself the power to compensate friends of the federal system for 
services rendered before cancellation. Is our democracy such a 
good example? Where is this wonderful openness announced by 
the Liberals? Unfortunately, there is not much more openness in 
this bill.
<P>
	For weeks and months, the government, through strategic 
planning or lack of ideas, reduced the legislative program to 
very little. The government is taking months and months to 
develop legislation, but very often it is introduced only the day 
before consideration in the House, which was the case with this 
bill. Can we really talk about making parliamentarians more 
responsible? Do you think that the democratic process is well 
served by such shortsightedness, such meanness?
<P>
	In our parliamentary system, opposition parties are part and 
parcel of the democratic process. Should a government 
concerned about democratic principles not make a minimum of 
effort so that Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, an expression 
dear to federalists, can play its role efficiently?
<P>
	The bill amending the Lobbyists Registration Act is at the 
heart of the debate on democracy, since the activities of these 
professionals are always the very opposite of the democratic 
process. Let us keep in mind that in a democratic society the 
long-standing principle of one man, or woman, one vote is the 
cornerstone of democracy. By definition, lobbyists are 
constantly trying to influence the political power in order to 
obtain privileges or special favours for a particular individual or 
group. It is their raison d'être.
<P>
	We may tolerate this practice as a necessary evil, but we 
cannot accept the lack of transparency which too often 
accompanies it. The present bill, aimed at bringing transparency 
to the practice of lobbying in Canada, is broadly based on the 
commitments contained in the Liberal red book. Originally, the 
provisions of the bill were supposed to be much more stringent 
that any existing legislation. However, if we look at it more 
closely it falls short of the commitments made by the Liberals 
during the last election campaign and does not meet citizens' 
expectations concerning the promised reform.
<P>
	Of course, some elements of the bill are in keeping with the 
Bloc Quebecois' ideas on this issue. It appears that some 
amendments to the Lobbyists Registration Act match the 
recommendations made by the Commons committee.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	According to the bill, the Governor in Council designates the 
ethics counsellor who, among other things, has to develop a 
code of conduct. The ethics counsellor is also mandated to 
investigate alleged violations. However, the ethics counsellor is 
designated by order of the Governor in Council. Why is the 
ethics counsellor not accountable to Parliament, instead of just 
the Prime Minister?
<P>
	Also, the bill seems to have diluted other important demands 
made by the Bloc Quebecois. For example, lobbyists are only 
required to disclose the name of the government department or 
institution they will be lobbying and not the amount of money 
they will be spending on their activities, if such activities are 
subject to an investigation.
<P>
	Moreover, the code of conduct to be developed by the ethics 
counsellor will not be a statutory instrument. With this 
provision, the government significantly reduces the impact of 
the code.
<P>
	Political actions of members sitting in this House are very 
often offset by the cynicism many voters feel towards the 
politicians whom they do not trust any more. For too long now, 
they have heard politicians make promises and do the exact 
opposite. Interdependence is not something you have to take 
into account only at the international level. All elected members 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5510"> 5510 </A></B>
<P>
are affected by the statements and the actions of all politicians. 
That is why, in my view, this bill does not go far enough.
<P>
	Finally, I want to say that, since lobbying is not available to 
everyone, because there will always be honest citizens who 
refuse to resort to such influence networks and others who 
cannot afford such services, it undermines the principle of 
democracy.
<P>
	Consequently, the Bloc will co-operate in the effort to 
improve this bill which does not even come close to the people's 
expectations or the Liberal promises.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais 
(Madawaska-Victoria):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be 
able to participate in the debate on referring this bill, an Act to 
amend the Lobbyists Registration Act, to committee prior to 
second reading.
<P>
	Lobbying is a long-standing part of democracy in this 
country. It pre-dates Confederation. Ever since the birth of this 
country, individuals have tried, directly or indirectly, to 
influence government decisions in their favour.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This House knows along with the increased activity by 
lobbyists grew a concern among Canadians. So long as the 
activities by lobbyists were conducted outside public view, 
Canadians might question whether government decisions were 
indeed made for the public good or under undue influence from a 
particular group.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This concern is nothing new. In 1969, the first private 
members' bills were tabled to demand that lobbying be opened 
to public scrutiny. By the time the government announced the 
establishment of a system for the registration of lobbyists in 
1985, about 20 such private bills had been tabled but none had 
been passed by Parliament.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In 1985 the Government of Canada took up the cause of 
lobbying reform and issued a discussion paper which was 
studied by the Standing Committee on Election, Privileges and 
Procedure. The ideas presented in that standing committee 
report became the basis for the original Lobbyists Registration 
Act. It was given royal assent in September 1988 and came into 
force a year later.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This Act rests upon the fundamental principle that the 
registration of lobbyists serves to inform the public about 
lobbying and to guarantee that government decisions are made 
on the basis of the issues. In other words, the Act seeks to make 
lobbying transparent. The public has a right to know who is 
trying to influence government decisions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	By opening up the process to public scrutiny registration 
provides the opportunity for others to initiate their own efforts 
to present their views to the government.
<P>
	This government believes that every Canadian has the right to 
approach government officials without using lobbyists as an 
intermediary. No one should feel they have to hire a lobbyist to 
bring matters to the attention of their member of Parliament, the 
ministers of the crown, public servants or any other institution 
in our governmental system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would remind the House that, during the 1993 
election, the Liberal Party of Canada promised that we would 
implement the Standing Committee's recommendation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The registry will indicate who is attempting to influence what 
government department and agency on what specific subject 
matter, on whose behalf and using what technique. They will 
also be required to clarify any given information at the request 
of the registrar.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The amendments also provide for a review of the Act by 
Parliament after a period of four years.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These measures in total represent a major step in the evolution 
of lobbying in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The sub-committee members may want to make suggestions 
to enhance this legislation in order to ensure that it adequately 
guarantees the openness and transparency of lobbying activities. 
It is therefore proper that members have the opportunity to make 
their comments before the bill goes to second reading.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being eleven o'clock, pursuant to Standing 
Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to statements by 
members, pursuant to Standing Orders 31.

with the medal of bravery.
<P>
	Sergeant Stephen J. Carroll, Constable Gonzalo Couce and 
Constable Thomas A. Doherty are officers with the Halton 
Regional Police Force.
<P>
	On September 27, 1993, Sergeant Carroll and Constables 
Couce and Doherty were called into a high risk situation and 
attempted to save a woman who had been shot outside her home. 
Although Sergeant Carroll managed to carry her to safety, the 
Burlington woman did not survive. Constables Couce and 
Doherty later entered the house to find that the gunman, her 
former husband, had killed himself.
<P>
	Police officers across the nation take incredible risks to keep 
us safe. I commend all of them for their hard work and their 
dedication to public safety.
<P>
	Today the efforts of Sergeant Carroll, Constable Couce and 
Constable Doherty are being recognized with a medal. I would 
like to extend my thanks and appreciation to all 30 recipients of 
medals today and to all Canadian police officers for their

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, this week's 
family poll indicated that, although the majority of Canadians 
are happy with their own family life, they fear for the future of 
their families. They see warning signs that indicate the family is 
seriously threatened.
<P>
	I am disappointed at the apathetic attitude of the government 
toward these fears and concerns. Throughout this past week my 
colleagues and I have presented in the House the issues of 
concern to families.
<P>
	The government has not responded with a single constructive 
word. The Liberals have ignored the wishes of Canadians by 
maintaining and pursuing legislation that is harmful to the 
family. It is a betrayal of the trust of those who elected them.
<P>
	If the Ministers of Justice, Finance, and Human Resources 
Development would dare to get close to the grassroots of Canada 
they would discover how deeply troubled the families feel. But 
the Liberals are not paying attention.
<P>
	I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that my colleagues and I are 
here to defend the interest of Canadian families but we will not 
allow the family to die a slow death at the hands of the

Mr. Speaker, here is another example of how the government is

<P>
	On June 9 an agreement was signed in Halifax between the 
Government of Canada and the province of Nova Scotia. This 
agreement, called the Canada-Nova Scotia Economy 
Agreement, was developed under the authority of the Canada 
Water Act.
<P>
	Its purpose is to help integrate good water resource 
management practices with economic decision-making. By 
better understanding the value of water and its importance to 
economic prosperity, Canadians will be able to make informed 
decisions about their water use.
<P>
	The real value of the new agreement will be improved 
long-term economic growth by ensuring that water will be used 
wisely in Nova Scotia and that it will be kept available for future 
economic development.
<P>
	This agreement illustrates our ongoing commitment to 
establishing frameworks in which environmental policy and 
economic policy work together, laying a firm base for 
sustainable development.

<P>
	While education is a provincial jurisdiction, I believe that 
federal government funding of unemployment insurance and a 
portion of post-secondary education makes us partners with the 
provinces in working toward an improved educational 
environment.
<P>
	Forced passing of students with poor reading and other 
academic skills is not in the best interests of Canada. Poor 
discipline has led to a situation where many teachers fear for 
their safety.
<P>
	Different programs in different provinces are retarding our

petitioners are asking the government to create a law that will 
protect the victims rather than the offender.

	The justice minister has done a great deal to advance the cause 
of victims' rights by proposing legislation which is now before

<P>
	The Governor of Vermont rightfully pointed out that the

Quebec government. Vermont has understood that it is in its best 
interests to respect the democratic choice of Quebecers and not 
to engage in a debate about the province's future. There is no

$72,000 and 58 per cent were unprofitable. Now the Department

considering major new fees on private broadcasters known as

	It seems strange that in the same month where we honoured 
our Canadian troops for their D-Day contribution and the Black

which time and time again has proven the support for the Crow 
benefit among the people it most affects.
<P>
	In a country as large and diverse as Canada our government 
should be looking at developing a national transportation policy 
that supports and not penalizes those who depend on 
transportation for their livelihood.
<P>
	If the minister wants to stay in transport then he should be 
thinking about ways in which his department can help those who 
depend most upon it. If the minister will not review and 
renounce his position on eliminating the Crow benefit then he 
should step aside and let someone who knows western Canada 
and cares about transportation take over.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister. The latest information on 
the status of intergovernmental negotiations to eliminate 
interprovincial trade barriers points to mediocre results. Yet, on 
May 6, Canadian Press reported that an agreement was 
imminent and even that a nearly complete draft agreement 
would be given to the provincial trade ministers at their meeting 
in Winnipeg on May 9 and 10.
<P>
	My question to the Prime Minister is this: Can he tell us if the 
June 30 deadline set by his government to reach an agreement is 
still valid and if the agreement, if there is one, will really 
eliminate interprovincial trade barriers?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are quite confident that an agreement will be reached by June 
30 and that it will be substantial.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
does the Prime Minister not realize that, given the serious 
reservations expressed by several provinces and by Quebec, the 
agreement announced by the federal government may be timid 
and full of major exemptions and amount in essence to an empty 
shell?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are consulting the provinces. They have their jurisdiction, 
we have ours and we are working toward an agreement that will 
satisfy all the parties involved. We strongly favour the 
elimination of as many interprovincial trade barriers as possible 
in Canada. Some provincial governments are reluctant, 
however, and I am surprised that the hon. member from the Bloc 
Quebecois is blaming the Liberal government for being too nice 
to the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
given, one, that the forum on health has been postponed 
indefinitely; two, that the Minister of Human Resources 
Development is going it alone by trying high-handedly to 
impose a reform of social programs on the provinces; and three, 
that the so-called agreement on the elimination of 
interprovincial trade barriers may worsen interprovincial 
relations instead of improving them, does the Prime Minister 
not realize that, after three months, his government's record on 
federal-provincial relations is a dismal failure?
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very surprised by the question because in matters of trade, 
we have our federal jurisdiction. We could impose things, but 
we do not want to do so. The Constitution clearly states that it is 
a federal responsibility. While we want to respect the provinces'  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5515"> 5515 </A></B>
<P>
opinions, those who favour the status quo in Canada do not want 
anything to change.
<P>
	If the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe tells me that I must 
use federal powers, we can settle this in two minutes. However, I 
am so nice that the hon. member criticizes the federal Prime 
Minister for consulting too much. Now that is a switch!

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, newspapers are 
reporting this morning that in a report which is now before 
Cabinet, the human resources minister's panel of experts on 
social program reform has recommended that further cuts of up 
to $6 billion be made to the unemployment insurance program, 
which would result in over 500,000 claimants being disentitled.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Human Resources Development commit 
now to rejecting out of hand this despicable recommendation 
aimed once again at reducing the federal deficit at the expense of 
the unemployed and the most disadvantaged among us?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I said yesterday that such reports 
are purely hypothetical and speculative. I do not pay any 
attention to them. I would advise the hon. member not to pay any 
attention to them either.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, are we to 
understand from the minister's answer that the only way to 
reduce unemployment is to force people onto welfare?

	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the minister of Indian affairs.
<P>
	Recently the minister has been travelling across this country 
telling aboriginal communities if they want self-government to 
step up and sign on the dotted line. Our party believes there are 
many serious issues that the government is not addressing in this 
kamikaze approach to self-government.
<P>
	Will the minister stop his headlong rush into these deals and 
ensure that no more deals are signed until full consultation with 
all concerned citizens takes place and a detailed cost accounting 
of each deal is disclosed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a very broad question with no 
focus but I am prepared to answer it in this way.
<P>
	I am as concerned as the hon. member about costs and 
accountability. I am prepared to work with the Reform Party to 
that end.
<P>
	If holding our committee until 6 a.m. this morning for no 
useful purpose is any indication of the way the hon. member 
wants to go, I am not with him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary question.
<P>
	The fact that this government believes that cabinet should be 
the dispute settling mechanism in these deals indicates to me 
that it is only interested in maintaining the current paternalistic 
system that now exists.
<P>
	Will the minister remove the political and partisan 
interference from self-government agreements and establish an 
autonomous body to deal with the dispute settlements?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, again it is a matter of different 
approaches and different philosophies. We are working with the 
aboriginal people.
<P>
	I might remind the hon. member that our techniques vary in 
this way. The first question you asked in this House had 58 
words in it and eight were derogatory. Eight were derogatory 
about the very people you purport to be defending today.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would remind all hon. members that both 
questions and answers should be directed to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
further supplementary question. It was a very interesting 
response. If this minister really had any sense of responsibility, 
he would have appeared before the committee to defend his own 
legislation.
<P>
	We heard from witnesses who had real concerns with this 
deal. The minister had the arrogance to ignore these concerns. If 
the minister will not defend his legislation, will he defend the 
complete abdication of his responsibility and his apparent 
disdain for the democratic process? What does he have to say-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. I would encourage all hon. 
members when they are putting questions if they would put the 
questions. I think we are getting into a great deal of 
editorializing, if you will.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5516"> 5516 </A></B>
<P>
	That is not particularly helpful to the debate or the questions 
and answers on either side. I intervened before. I heard the hon. 
member putting a question, and so would he put the question 
now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Mr. Speaker, my question was what does he 
have to say to Canadians who have concerns about his 
self-government legislation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I inherited the Yukon 
legislation in the form it was in I took the time to go to Yukon 
and spend three days negotiating with the Yukon people. When I 
say Yukon people, I mean the Chamber of Commerce, the 
mayors, the First Nations and the legislature.
<P>
	When the CYI came to Ottawa for a week and a half, it tried to 
set up a meeting with these hon. members. They would not even 
meet with it. That is our dialogue with the people. That is this 
party's dialogue with the people.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ETHICS">ETHICS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday, 
the Prime Minister unveiled his government's action plan to 
take, as he put it, ``unprecedented action to open up the process 
of government in Ottawa''. In his statement, the Prime Minister 
said, and I quote: ``Deals like the Pearson Airport deal must 
never be allowed to happen again''.
<P>
	Since the Prime Minister claims to mean business when he 
talks about restoring integrity in the federal administration, how 
does he explain his government's refusal to give to the ethics 
counsellor the mandate to investigate the role of lobbyists in the 
Pearson Airport scandal?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as regards the Toronto Airport issue, we did what was our duty 
and what we said we would do: We cancelled the contract. What 
else can we do? The ethics counsellor has the necessary power to 
conduct any inquiry which he deems appropriate.
<P>
	This is a new Parliament and, unless I am mistaken, the 
legislation provides no compensation for those who paid 
lobbyists regarding the Pearson Airport contract. Mr. Nixon 
conducted an investigation and reported his findings within 30 
days, which was faster than anything we had seen before. A 
decision was made. The contract was cancelled, period. The 
ethics counsellor will fulfill his mandate in compliance with the 
provisions of the act, which go a lot farther than what was 
unanimously recommended by the committee last year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
ask the Prime Minister to read the bill thoroughly. 
Compensation can be made with Cabinet approval.
<P>
	Since yesterday's statement was silent on this issue, does the 
Prime Minister intend to follow up on the Minister of 
Transport's suggestion to no longer allow lobbyists fees as a tax 
deduction, a measure which the American government intends 
to take?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
tax exemptions are the responsibility of the Minister of Finance. 
He is informed of all the suggestions made by ministers and 
members when he drafts his budget. Consequently, any 
recommendation in that regard should be made to that minister.
<P>
	This is therefore a technical issue which will certainly be of 
interest to the Minister of Finance.

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	As members of this House know, on behalf of the government 
Mr. Bob Wright is currently accepting claims for compensation 
from the consortium affected by the cancellation of the Pearson 
airport development deal. Mr. Wright, a Liberal fund-raiser, 
friend and former law partner of the current Prime Minister is 
receiving $1,000 a day for this job.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister tell this House how this appointment 
fulfils the government's promise of governing with integrity?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the member is attacking a person who cannot defend himself in 
this House.
<P>
	Mr. Bob Wright is an extremely competent lawyer who was 
the head of a commission for the Ontario government and was 
kept on by the NDP government. He is an extremely honourable 
person. Yes, he helped me in 1984. Yes, he did what some people 
do for members in their ridings. When someone makes a 
contribution to get someone else elected he should not apologize 
for it. What he is being paid at the moment is less than what I 
charged when I was a lawyer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a supplemental for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport when he appeared before the 
Standing Committee on Transport on May 31 stated that Mr. 
Wright had no mandate to negotiate, but in fact he was simply 
accepting claims to be reviewed by claims analysts.
<P>
	In light of this, will the Prime Minister tell Canadian 
taxpayers why we owe Mr. Wright over $66,000 plus expenses 
for simply collecting receipts?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it must be Friday to hear such pitiful statements from the 
opposition.
<P>
	I said at the committee, where the hon. member had every 
opportunity to pursue this further, that Mr. Wright had been 
given a very specific mandate. He was not to negotiate any 
payments to any lobbyists who were involved in the Pearson 
deal. He was not to negotiate any arrangements that provided for 
lost profits. He was to negotiate on the basis of appropriate out 
of pocket expenses.
<P>
	With all due respect to the hon. member, this person has been 
chairman of the Ontario Securities Commission. A person 
operating in the legal profession in Ontario with the reputation 
and ability of Mr. Wright regularly charges fees to his personal 
clients, corporate clients and the Government of Canada at least 
twice and three times what is being charged to the Government 
of Canada as he carries out his responsibilities in this matter.

Kanesatake Band Council and the Department of Human 
Resources Development concerning the establishment of such a 
patrol force at Kanesatake?

	These Aboriginal project proposals involve establishing a 
team to operate a 24-hour suicide hot-line.

	Teams would also be trained to deal with distress and family 
violence situations. This initiative is entirely constructive, 
peaceful and humane. This is not a paramilitary force that is 
being set up, but rather a team to assist groups and individuals in 
distress.

affairs minister tell us what specific guarantees he has obtained

is trying to create a situation of fear when there should be none 
at all.

	The project is very simple. Under our department there is the 
Pathways group. This group of native people from across 
Canada make decisions on employment projects and give 
assistance.
<P>
	As I just said the purpose of this group and the project is not to 
provide any police service whatsoever. It is to help families who 
are in distress, who are in fear of suicide, who are in fear of 
family violence. It is part of the healing process that we must 
provide for native people across this country. It is exactly the 
kind of thing that can bring peace and reconciliation in that area

responsibility in democracy lies with members of Parliament to 
stand and vote representing their people.

Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of the 
Environment. In a report published last week, Statistics Canada 
announced that Canada was one of five countries with the 
highest waste production per capita in the world. Subsequently, 
the Minister of the Environment said that she considered 
introducing an environmental tax next fall if negotiations on 
waste recycling between the provinces and the private sector 
were not successful.
<P>
	In dealing with this problem, does the minister intend to 
launch a national waste tax program or would she let each 
province develop its own strategy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, in the announcement made 
following the meeting of the Council of Environment Ministers 
held in St. John, New Brunswick, three weeks ago, it was agreed 
unanimously to develop a specific strategy that would be in 
place at the next meeting.
<P>
	Obviously, waste collection is a provincial responsibility, and 
any action plan that results from our meeting in November 1994 
will have to be implemented by the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week, the Minister of the Environment stressed the 
importance of harmonizing policies in Canada. Are we to 
understand, considering the government's poor record on 
federal-provincial agreements and irrespective of the outcome 
of negotiations between the provinces and the private sector, 
that the federal government will go ahead this fall with a 
national waste recycling policy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment): </B>Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member had 
listened to my answer to his first question, I thought I made that 
clear. This is not a matter of the federal minister imposing her 
own solution. This was a unanimous decision made by all 
environment ministers at the meeting in St. John. We identified 
a problem, and we wanted a harmonized solution.
<P>
	We followed the path described by my colleague, Mr. 
Chrétien, the environment critic, who stated at the beginning of 
his mandate that the environment was not a provincial problem 
but one that went beyond provincial boundaries and was shared 
by all Canadians. What I throw in the water in Ontario 
eventually arrives in Quebec, and that is why we want a 
harmonized policy.

in their responses to please be as brief as they can. Will the hon. 
member please put his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Secretary of 
State for Finance. I hope he will finally answer. Will the 
Secretary of State acknowledge that the current tax system 
discriminates against families who care for their children at 
home?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions)):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not only Friday but I 
think there is a full moon.
<P>
	The third answer is this. Our tax system is based on, as 
members all know, individual tax returns. We do not have family 
tax returns. There are certain things in individual tax returns that 
affect the family. Yes, there are certain distinctions in the 
Income Tax Act for a variety of things. It does not discriminate 
against them. It  simply recognizes that there are certain items 
that affect the incomes of families.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me clearly 
say that the Reform Party is in no way opposed to families who 
send their children to day care. We are opposed to a system that 
penalizes parents who choose to care for their children at home.

	Will the government ensure a fair tax system by removing the 
penalties for parents who care for their pre-school children at 
home?

question is for the President of the Treasury Board.
<P>
	As part of Public Service Week, it is necessary to recall the 
importance of equal pay for men and women whose functions 
are recognized as equivalent. In answer to a question raised by 
the Official Opposition on March 8, the President of the 
Treasury Board said that this issue was a priority for this 
government.
<P>
	Can the President of the Treasury Board tell us if his 
bargaining agents are about to reach an agreement with his 
employees on the back pay required to bring certain 
classifications up to date?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Treasury Board is in exploratory discussions with the employee 
representatives, the unions.
<P>
	We have held three or four meetings with the Professional 
Institute. We have held at least one or two meetings with the 
Public Service Alliance. We are continuing to explore working 
toward a solution to this matter. We are a pay equity employer. 
We want to resolve this matter as quickly as we can so that we 
can curtail this very long tribunal process that the previous 
government put in place.
<P>
	We want to treat our employees with fairness and equity.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the

promise to respect his own law which forbids any discrimination 
in this regard?

	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	On May 9, 1994, in response to a question from my colleague, 
the member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, the 
minister told this House that he had urged the provincial 
attorneys general to more aggressively pursue the prosecution 
of section 85 of the Criminal Code, the extra penalty for the use 
of a firearm during a crime.
<P>
	I wrote two letters to the minister requesting an explanation of 
what was said to the provinces as well as any responses received 
regarding section 85 but have yet to receive a reply. Will the 
minister advise this House in general terms about the 
communications he had with the provinces over section 85?
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the communications I have 
had with the provinces are those I have described. I have written 
to my provincial and territorial counterparts and have drawn 
their attention to the fact that section 85(1) is there to deal with a 
problem of broad concern, which is the use of firearms in the 
commission of offences.
<P>
	I have encouraged them to see that that section is used when 
the facts permit and that plea arrangements are not entered into 
which result in such charges being dropped in appropriate cases.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Justice stated in this House that he is 
contemplating further laws on guns. The emphasis seems to be 
government intervention with law-abiding gun owners rather 
than action with gun-toting criminals.
<P>
	In view of the problems with section 85 of the Criminal Code 
can the minister indicate what he will do to make it a priority to 
fight criminals who have guns before he pursues a policy that 
interferes with law abiding gun owners?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government has under 
consideration a wide variety of options which have been 
developed through caucus to be brought forward in the form of 
specific proposals. These will be intended and will be fashioned 
to deal with the criminal use of firearms. They will involve 
regulation of firearms that  will respect the legitimate use of 
rifles by hunters and by farmers.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and

who had certainly made a case for a compassionate review in 
terms of his landing and his medical inadmissibility.
<P>
	As a result of that we opened up a line of communication with 
the province of Alberta as well as the province of Saskatchewan. 
I am happy to report that as of this morning through that the 
province of Alberta has accepted the case.
<P>
	It shows that when provincial and federal governments do 
work together and involve the community that first raised the 
question of compassion, we can make decisions that both favour 
the individual circumstances and at the same time uphold the

question is for the Minister of Transport. There are two areas in 
Quebec, namely the North Shore and the Magdalen Islands, 
where airport control services in French are only available after 
an 8 to 15 minute delay, because they come under the 
jurisdiction of the Moncton control unit, which provides regular 
services in English only. Both these areas could be adequately 
served by the Quebec City radar control unit which the 
government is going to close down.
<P>
	My question is this: How can the minister, who claims to be 
concerned with air safety, justify his statement to the effect that 
bilingual services can be provided from a bilingual province 
such as New Brunswick just as well as from anywhere else in 
Quebec, when the regular service provided from Moncton is 
only in English?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
in any air navigation system, there are always areas where 
communication in one official language or the other, or both, is 
difficult. What we are saying, and I want to reassure my hon. 
colleague, is that anybody who uses air navigation services in 
Canada knows that they are exceptional and that they compare 
well with any other system in the world. If, as my hon. colleague 
is  claiming, there are gaps here or there, we will try to see to 
them. But I do not like the fact that he is trying to create a red

necessary steps to ensure their safety.

	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for the 
Minister of Justice.
<P>
	A few weeks ago I attended a briefing by a group of gun 
control activists. They freely acknowledged that ``additional 
controls would have little or no effect on violent crime''. To 
justify their position they pointed to the 31 per cent of suicides 
that are committed with guns and which they claimed might be 
partly preventable.
<P>
	Since 27 per cent of suicides are committed-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order, please. Once again I am loathe to 
intervene in the question and answer period, but I would ask the 
hon. member to please put his question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was into my question. I am 
sorry.
<P>
	Will the minister show some responsibility and protect us 
from ourselves by instituting a rope control program, with rope 
acquisition certificates and a mandatory registration of all ropes 
more than a metre long?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The Chair is a little confused. I am not quite 
sure if that is a hypothetical question or not, but I will permit the 
hon. minister to answer it, if he likes.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be delighted. I 
should first observe that the hon. member has demonstrated that 
if we give him enough rope he will hang himself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a supplementary. On 
Wednesday my colleague from Prince George-Peace River 
pointed out that no hard data exists to demonstrate that further 
gun control legislation will reduce gun related crime. On several 
occasions the minister has stated that we must look for the root 
causes of crime rather than caving in to knee-jerk reactions.
<P>
	Will the minister commit that he will introduce no further gun 
control legislation until there is hard statistical evidence that the 
current legislation is not working?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the approach which we take 
for safe homes and safe streets will be comprehensive dealing 
with the causes of crime, dealing with strengthening the 
criminal justice system and dealing as well with crime 
prevention.
<P>
	The facts show that after the introduction of gun control 
legislation in 1976, indeed the criminal misuse of weapons did 
diminish and that is the statistical fact.
<P>
	We are going to devise, we are going to introduce, we are 
going to develop with the support of caucus proposals for further 
regulation of firearms that will make this society even safer. 
That is only part of the comprehensive agenda of this 
government with respect to crime and violence in Canada.

<P>
	There are disturbing reports in connection with the trade

Environment, has consulted on it-the environmental chapter 
will include provisions that will prevent provinces from 
weakening environmental measures as an inducement for 
investment. The chapter will encourage upward harmonization 
of environmental measures. Finally, the chapter will allow for 
the use of the precautionary principle.

Speaker, yesterday during clause by clause consideration of Bill 
C-33 and Bill C-34 in the Standing Committee on Aboriginal 
Affairs and Northern Development the member for Yukon was 
present and allowed to vote at the committee.
<P>
	She was not a legal voting member according to Standing 
Order 114(2)(c). The standing order reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At any time when no list has been filed with the clerk of the committee 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section or when no notice has been received by 
the clerk of the committee pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the Chief 
Whip of any recognized party may effect substitutions by filing notice thereof 
with the clerk of the committee, having selected the substitutes from among all 
the Members of his or her party and/or the independent members listed as 
associate members-pursuant to Standing Order 104(4)-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The relevant phrase is: ``the independent members listed as 
associate members''. House of Commons records will indicate 
that the member for Yukon was not then and is not now an 
associate member of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal 
Affairs and Northern Development.
<P>
	Although a substitution form was filed by the chief opposition 
whip with the clerk naming her as a substitute, she did not meet 
the requirements as an independent under the standing orders in 
order to be a legitimate voting member. Yet the chairman of the 
committee allowed her to vote on more than one occasion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5523"> 5523 </A></B>
<P>
	Should you, Mr. Speaker, review the minutes of the 
committee meeting you will further note that I raised the matter 
as a point of order and it was dismissed by the chair. Even 
though the chair, the hon. member for Prince Albert-Churchill 
River, was made aware of this irregularity he continued to allow 
the member for Yukon to vote and participate as a member of the 
committee in good standing.
<P>
	We are not questioning the presence of the hon. member for 
Yukon as the elected representative of Yukon. What we are 
questioning is the chair's primary responsibility to ensure that 
the committee operates under the rules established by the House 
of Commons.
<P>
	I realize, Mr. Speaker, you rarely rule on proceedings in 
committee. However this is a clear breach of the standing 
orders. It is not a matter which can or should be left in the 
committee where it originated. The rules have been broken 
throughout the entire clause by clause consideration of Bill 
C-33 and Bill C-34. The report of the committee should be ruled 
out of order and the committee should be directed to go back and 
reconsider clause by clause Bills C-33 and Bill C-34.
<P>
	The chairman of the aboriginal affairs committee whose role 
it is to uphold the rules of the committee knowingly allowed the 
rules to be broken. I suggest the chairman of the aboriginal 
affairs committee resign and allow another member to preside 
over clause by clause reconsideration of Bill C-33 and Bill 
C-34.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I also was a substitute member on that committee for a 
portion of last evening and starting at roughly 4.45 a.m. today.
<P>
	It is well known by you, Mr. Speaker, that committees are 
masters of their own business. That is a principle that has long 
been accepted by Parliament and in previous rulings. Need I 
remind the Chair of the ruling on the Lachance case in the early 
1980s as well as the ruling on what is known commonly as the 
Blenkarn report on the goods and services tax.
<P>
	Furthermore, in the unlikely event, Mr. Speaker, that you 
were to review the proceedings of the committee you would find 
that in no case was any vote in a position whereby one person 
would have changed the vote. In fact for virtually all votes we 
had scores of 6:2 that were registered; in other words six people 
carrying each clause versus two against. The only exceptions I 
remember during the whole night were the odd votes on which 
one member of the Reform Party voted with the government 
making the score 7:1 instead of 6:2.
<P>
	To review what I said previously, whether or not the vote 
deems that it is appropriate for him to review the business of the 
committee would not change the outcome of the vote. In any 
case, Mr. Speaker, sustaining the precedents I have brought to 
your attention I think you would rule that in cases such as these 
the Speaker has not interfered with the reports of committees in 
the past.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
use this opportunity to point out what I believe is a serious fault 
in our system. While you review the committee events of last 
evening perhaps a point to keep in mind is the people of Yukon 
chose the hon. member for Yukon to represent them as their 
member of Parliament, knowing full well she was also a member 
of the New Democratic Party.
<P>
	The issue before the aboriginal affairs committee last night 
was dealing exclusively with that territory, Indian land claims 
and Indian self-government in the Yukon territory. Being the 
only member from that territory it seems not unreasonable that 
she would want to play an advisory role, a serious role, in an 
issue that dealt explicitly and exclusively with her constituents.
<P>
	Technically my hon. friend may be correct that it reveals some 
of the inappropriateness of some of our standing orders, 
particularly as they refer to committee and the role of so-called 
independent members. For my friend-and I respect the 
technical case that he is making-to suggest for a moment that 
the sole representative for the Yukon territory not be allowed to 
participate in critical legislation regarding her constituents 
surely must point out a major flaw in our system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have listened to hon. members and 
the point is not that the hon. member was allowed to be present 
and participate in the committee. The point is that this was a 
clear breach of the rules, of the standing orders. The chairman 
was in complete breach of his responsibility as chairman by not 
recognizing the point of order I raised, which was a very clear 
point of order.
<P>
	As I mentioned, we have no difficulty with the hon. member 
for Yukon being present. The difficulty we have which we raised 
in the committee meeting last night with the chairman was that 
by allowing her to vote the chair was in clear breach of the 
standing orders that govern the committee proceedings.
<P>
	We ask, Mr. Speaker, that you rule on that point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on 
the same point of order. I would simply like to advise the House 
that I was in attendance at the committee meeting between 
midnight and 5 a.m. during the point at which the question was 
raised by the hon. member.
<P>
	The clerk presented the appropriate documents to the Reform 
Party for examination and advised the chair of the committee 
that the member for Yukon was eligible to vote. The chair 
proceeded on the basis of the advice of the clerk appointed by 
the House.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> I would like to speak, if I 
may, Mr. Speaker, on the point of order that was just raised. In 
my mind, the Official Opposition is perfectly entitled to allow 
any member of this House it pleases to speak on an issue that not 
only concerns a member from a party other than ours but also on 
which the hon. member in question had special knowledge.
<P>
	We think it is an extremely open-minded thing to do to 
transcend party boundaries and draw on the parliamentary 
expertise of all members of this House so as to improve the bill 
under review and ensure it better meets the needs of the people 
for whom it is intended.
<P>
	I do not think it is in the interest of the Reform Party to try and 
control or decide beforehand who should or should not be 
allowed to speak on this bill. We have willingly agreed to let the 
hon. member use speaking time which was ours. I believe there 
are precedents in parliamentary law in that regard. I think such a 
gesture serves democracy well, as it reflects unselfishness and 
care for first-rate legislative action.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the same point of order, I made it 
clear earlier that we had no objection to the presence of the hon. 
member for Yukon there and in fact participating in the debate. 
The point I raise in this point of order is the fact that she was not 
a legal voting member of that committee.
<P>
	Even though the chief opposition whip had signed the proper 
notice with the clerk, the fact is the member for Yukon was not 
listed as an associate member and therefore-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I think the member 
already made that point earlier. We do not need to hear points 
repeated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like one short opportunity to intervene in this 
point of order as well.
<P>
	I am an associate member of that committee. The leader of my 
party, the member for Yukon, was sitting on my behalf in the 
aboriginal affairs committee.
<P>
	What this debate points out is that there could be a flaw in our 
standing orders that this House now has an opportunity to 
correct, knowing the difficulties that it puts in place for 
independent, associate or other members of this House who have 
an interest in committee work but who are not members of a 
specific committee.
<P>
	On behalf of the member for Yukon and my party I want to 
thank the members of the Official Opposition for their 
co-operation and assistance in allowing the member for Yukon 
to participate in the way she was able to during that committee.
<P>
	I think the work the members of the Official Opposition have 
done in this case should serve as an example of the change that 
we need to make in the standing orders so that we will be able to 
allow forms to be signed by someone who cannot sign a form, to 
allow for participation of other members.
<P>
	Members realize that an associate member has no way to 
transfer his or her place at the table to another member and that 
the only means of voting is to take the place of a member who 
does have a voting spot which rests with the three major parties.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Hon. colleagues, I wish to thank all the 
hon. members who have spoken on this rather sensitive 
question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are dealing with Standing Order 114. The matter gets 
before the House today because of the fact there will be a report 
presented from the relevant committee. The matter will be 
considered carefully, taking into mind all of what the members 
have said today and the Chair will make a ruling on it 
presumably on Monday.

<HR>

<P>
March 8 of this year the Prime Minister announced a review of 
the operation of the administrative flight services.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	I am pleased to announce today that the government has 
finished its review on how we operate the Challenger air service. 
As a result, we are completely revamping the delivery of this 
service to save Canada's taxpayers more than $24 million a year.
<P>
	We are replacing the more costly service that the previous 
government ran with a more scaled down version. As the Prime 
Minister promised, on March 8 we looked at options that were in 
keeping with the government's objectives of frugality and 
integrity.
<P>
	We have delivered on our promise. The costs of the new 
service will be nearly 60 per cent less than under the previous 
government, dropping from $41.4 million to $17 million a year.
<P>
	I want to make it clear that a flight service for the royal 
family, the Governor General, the Prime Minister, ministers of 
this cabinet and foreign dignitaries is essential in a country as 
vast as Canada.
<P>
	The severe time restraints under which these people work 
makes this service absolutely necessary.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Each of our major trading partners provides a similar service 
to its head of state and ministers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Now that we are confident we can deliver the service cost 
effectively, I expect that ministers will make use of the fleet for 
their official duties when the schedules of commercial air 
services cannot meet their needs.
<P>
	Variable costs for flying now are expected to decline from 
about $4,600 an hour to $2,200 an hour. The cost per flying hour, 
if you add in capital costs, is estimated to decrease from about 
$17,000 to $6,800. This is only one example of the kind of 
specific measures which I will be implementing and this 
government will be implementing with a view to reducing 
expenditures of the federal government.
<P>
	We have cut back the number of Challenger planes from six to 
four. We have cut the flight crews from eleven to six. We have 
re-engineered maintenance arrangements and we have lowered 
training costs without sacrificing any safety.
<P>
	From now on the Department of National Defence will 
continue to provide the Challenger aircraft and crews, but 
Transport Canada will provide service and maintenance, with 
the private sector providing many of the other support services, 
the baggage handling, the meals and the lounge services.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We involved the Auditor General in the review, addressing 
concerns he raised in his 1993 report. In a recent exchange of 
correspondence with the Prime Minister, the Auditor General 
has generally expressed support for the renewal of the service.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government's decision to revamp the administrative 
flight service puts the Challenger service on a sound footing. It 
is a reliable, cost effective secure transportation service for the 
government and fits in well with the government's commitment 
to operate as cost effectively as it can.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. There has 
been a very slight pressure of time issue that needs to be dealt 
with. I wonder if the House would give its unanimous consent to 
interrupt the statements by ministers for just a moment to allow 
the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to introduce a bill.
<P>
	I think you would find there is consent to do that. I apologize 
for this interruption, particularly to members of the opposition 
who are going to make their responses. It will only take a

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc 
Quebecois is moderately satisfied with the statement by the 
President of the Treasury Board on the review of the operation of 
the Canadian government's Challenger air service. The 
circumstances of this review recall a less than glorious episode 
in this government's history and the use of government aircraft 
by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5526"> 5526 </A></B>
<P>
	After the public outrage at the federal government's undue 
expenditures, the obvious step was to rationalize the expenses of 
members of cabinet. I want to point out that the government 
could have avoided taking the blame for this widespread 
practice of wasting public funds if it had agreed, as the Bloc 
Quebecois requested and still requests, to set up a public 
spending review committee that would scrutinize every 
government expenditure. By refusing to allow this exercise and 
by resisting change until public opinion forces it to act, the 
Liberal government has shown that its approach to public 
administration is largely improvised.
<P>
	How many mini-scandals will it take for this government to 
finally decide to change its expensive practices? How many 
scandalous episodes will it take for this government to stop 
wasting public funds? Is there any justification for this 
government's excessive spending, when millions of Canadians 
and Quebecers are living on welfare because the government 
lacks the courage and the political will to promote a genuine and 
pro-active full employment policy?
<P>
	In an article published on February 1 in <I>La Presse</I>, journalist 
Claude Picher said we can never criticize enough the kind of 
mistakes made by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, if 
we want the government to manage public funds in a vigilant 
and responsible way. I agree.
<P>
	At a time when the number of unemployed is increasing daily, 
at a time when the national debt puts Canada among the most 
indebted Western countries when the federal government's 
spending power flies defies rationalization of government 
spending, the government must not be allowed to forget these 
incidents so that government waste in all its forms can be 
eliminated.
<P>
	The presentation by the President of the Treasury Board 
reflects confidence in the government's new system for 
managing air transportation for its ministers. I wish I could 
share that confidence, but I must say that it is not easy. This 
government has so far failed to show the political will to cut 
unnecessary spending. It continues to encroach on provincial 
jurisdiction, it continues to make partisan political 
appointments and to attack social programs while maintaining 
tax shelters for the wealthiest people in this country. In other 
words, today's announcement is no guarantee that the 
government will immediately win the trust of the Official 
Opposition.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, we in the 
Reform Party applaud the statement by the President of the 
Treasury Board regarding the completed review of the operation 
of the administrative flight services. The saving of some $24 
million of taxpayers' dollars is indeed good news to all 
Canadians.
<P>
	While we acknowledge that some use by the royal family, the 
Governor General and the Prime Minister may be required, the 
important change in direction is the directive to ministers to use 
commercial air service as a first priority. With the Auditor 
General's being involved in this review, we trust an agreement 
has been reached on the cost per flying hour.
<P>
	I would further request that this government keep Parliament 
informed by providing it with complete and accurate 
information about the flight services, as the Auditor General 
recommended in his 1993 report. In this way Parliament would 
be better able to monitor any wasteful spending and perhaps 
locate new areas of savings as they relate to this service.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	I would also request that the minister table the review it 
conducted of the flight service. The government is finally doing 
what the private sector started doing three and four years ago, 
cutting costs in order to survive in these difficult times.
<P>
	While we in Reform recognize this reduction in government 
spending, we suggest it is only the tip of the iceberg. There are 
millions more taxpayers' dollars to be saved by further cuts in 
government spending.
<P>
	We encourage the government to keep looking. It is on the 
right track.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Will the government establish a national environmental technology

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> The federal government has provided 
start-up funding for three National Environmental Technology 
Advancement Centres (NETACs) as non-profit corporations 
operating at arm's length from government, offering technology 
commercialization services to small and medium sized 
enterprises throughout Canada. The centres have so far obtained 
support from the private sector and other levels of government 
that exceeds the federal government's $12 million contribution 
over four years.
<P>
	The competitive process to establish the NETACs included an 
extensive consultation with the environmental industry and

<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
opportunity to speak on Bill C-43.
<P>
	Today in the House of Commons we sit among seats held by 
over 200 newly elected representatives from all across Canada, 
most of whom, like me, are novices. There is no doubt that in the 
federal election of October 25, 1993, Canadians sent a clear 
message that they wanted back control of what they see as a 
decaying democracy, a political environment increasingly based 
on who you know, not what you know your constituents want.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5529"> 5529 </A></B>
<P>
	The whole issue of elected officials being more accountable 
to the people they represent has increasingly become a pressing 
and troubling issue for Canadians and they are demanding 
action.
<P>
	Who could forget the now famous quote from the former 
leader of the Liberal Party during the election campaign. When 
accused of handing out patronage appointments to senior 
Liberal supporters he declared on national TV, ``I had no 
choice''. Who will forget the legacy of the man who accused Mr. 
Turner?
<P>
	The last 10 years have seen more scandal, more patronage, 
more impropriety by elected public officials and more PR 
campaigns to cover up the scandals than I believe Canadian 
society has ever experienced. It all climaxed during the last 
election. Politically conscious Canadians once and for all 
proved that they had had enough, throwing out 75 per cent of the 
incumbents.
<P>
	The issue behind today's debate is not simply private interests 
cajoling public officials. The issue transcends the question of 
how to control and make more transparent the access these 
private interests have with public officials. The issue was 
articulated by the Prime Minister during his speech in this 
House. The Prime Minister talked about trust. In this vein the 
Prime Minister said that in a democracy, elected officials must 
be accountable to the interests of all Canadians, not just the 
privileged few.
<P>
	Such words are music to my ears. If the Prime Minister was 
fully aware of what he was saying, and I think he was, and if he 
fully intends to put into practice this populist ideology, then I 
am half way to returning home to my family and my medical 
practice.
<P>
	However, as Canadians saw with the previous government, 
actions speak louder than words. It is one thing for politicians to 
accuse others of improprieties and to preach about patronage, 
conflict of interest and ethics. Canadians demand action, not 
PR.
<P>
	The actions of the government, of the Prime Minister are to 
appoint, and I underline the word appoint, an ethics counsellor. 
Oh, they tell us we will review and study the legislation. This 
actually is Tory legislation from the previous government 
dealing with registering lobbyists.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	Note that although the Prime Minister says the interests of all 
must be considered, only the Prime Minister and not the duly 
elected representatives of the people through Parliament will 
decide who is the ethics watchdog. Only to the Prime Minister, 
not the duly elected representatives of the people through 
Parliament, will the ethics counsellor be accountable.
<P>
	Given all of the public attention and the humble, trust us kind 
of speeches made by the government on public trust and 
accountability, together with the Prime Minister's 
announcement yesterday on appointing an ethics counsellor, I 
must say I am little saddened.
<P>
	Canadians demand action on this issue. Can hon. members not 
sense and understand that? Canadians are sick and tired of slick 
rhetoric and public relations. They see right through it and no 
wonder. They certainly have had enough experience with that 
type of activity over the last 15 years. Action is what they want. 
Action.
<P>
	Canadians are no longer willing to stand idly by as outsiders 
while politicians line their own pockets and promote their own 
interests or those of their friends and relatives. If we as elected 
officials really and truly want to clean up this place, if we really 
and truly want to dispose of shady, sleazy politics which cast 
shadows not only over this fine city, but the quality and degree 
of democracy in this entire country, all of us can do it.
<P>
	The vast majority of members know on any given day for any 
given subject what the consensus majority of their constituents 
believe and want. As a non-professional politician I would say 
that is one of our most important jobs. The other even more 
important job as publicly elected representatives is to represent 
our constituents' views.
<P>
	This indeed is how I interpreted the Prime Minister's remarks. 
I will repeat what he said: ``We must take into account the 
interests of all Canadians, not just the privileged few''. Yet the 
Prime Minister is against allowing MPs in the Liberal Party to 
vote freely according to their constituents' views. The Prime 
Minister is against the idea of allowing constituents to recall 
their representatives if they do wrong. Are such policies not 
contradictory to the humble power to the people statements he 
made yesterday and which are printed in the Liberal red book?
<P>
	I leave the answers to these questions to the existing seat 
holders in this Parliament. We who occupy these privileged 
places must eventually reconcile our consciences. As long as we 
represent to the very best of our abilities on each and every issue 
the consensus views of those individuals who are paying for us 
to be here, the many thousands of people in our constituencies 
and our parliamentary raison d'être, we should have no 
difficulties whatsoever at the end of the day saying to our 
constituents, our families, our children and our grandchildren 
that we did the best we could.
<P>
	Should anything we do in whatever way cause us to contradict 
the consensus views of our constituents, then we must ask 
ourselves: Who are we doing this for? Is it for ourselves to 
promote our narrow self-interests? Is it for our friends or 
relatives to promote their narrow self-interests? Perhaps we 
could justify our representation in the interests of Canada, 
maybe Alberta, or maybe Quebec. Perhaps we could justify 
voting a particular way on certain issues simply in the interests 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5530"> 5530 </A></B>
<P>
of our party. Of  course that would be good for Canada, whether 
Canadians know it or not.
<P>
	As a parliamentarian I believe there is no cause which should 
take greater precedence than to do things that in our hearts we 
know it is what our constituents would want us to do. They know 
what they want. We just have to ask them more often.
<P>
	What about those other noble causes: our friends, our 
relatives, Alberta, Quebec, Canada, our parties? I believe our 
constituents would tell us that by simply representing their 
views accurately on every issue we would automatically 
collectively represent what is best for Canada, our political 
parties, our true friends, our families, our children and our 
grandchildren.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened attentively to the hon. member's speech. I 
still cannot figure out whether the member is for or against the 
bill. It is indeed most difficult to do so. I know the hon. member 
is in favour of families and that is very good. He is probably in 
favour of wholesomeness as well and that is good too.
<P>
	We are dealing with a bill today as proposed by the right hon. 
Prime Minister and as presented in the House by the Minister of 
Industry. I have waited a long time for this bill.
<P>
	In 1987 I was a member of the Cooper committee, the original 
parliamentary committee which produced the legislation that 
exists today. The legislation was less than perfect. It did not 
include the major recommendations of the committee at the 
time.
<P>
	One of the highlights of the Cooper bill was that after three 
years of coming into force the legislation would be up for 
review. The Holtmann committee did that review. I also was a 
member of that committee. If members have not guessed 
because of the defeats last year of course I am the only survivor 
of either committee and a survivor of both. Therefore, I have had 
the opportunity to work on this issue on several occasions in the 
past.
<P>
	The report presented last year by the Holtmann committee 
was not a Tory bill as the member across the way said. It was a 
unanimous decision of the committee which was presented and 
received the broad support of the House. Maybe it was not the 
Reform bill but I do not apologize for that. It was a report 
produced by the duly elected people. Maybe that concept is alien 
to the member who just spoke as well, but it was produced by all 
of us in the last Parliament and it was unanimous.
<P>
	Today I stand proud because the Prime Minister in producing 
this legislation included most of what we asked for. Ninety per 
cent of what was in our report has ended up in this legislation. 
Furthermore, there were things I was looking for as an 
individual member and the rest of the committee was not willing 
to put in the report last year. This Prime Minister has addressed 
those issues as well.
<P>
	For example, last year the committee recommended in 
recommendation 22: ``That lobbyists proceed immediately to 
establish a professional association with an industry-wide code 
of ethics''. I wanted that to go a lot further. I produced an 
amendment to that at the committee saying that in addition to 
what was in recommendation 22 we should also have a measure 
whereby if lobbyists failed to produce their own code of ethics 
the government would impose one on them. That is what I 
wanted last year.
<P>
	Guess what is in the bill now? The Prime Minister said that we 
will impose a code of ethics through the new independent officer 
who will overview this system. He will develop a code and he 
will impose it on the lobbyists. They have no choice. The 
lobbyists have had years to produce such a code but have failed 
to do so.
<P>
	I recognize some of the difficulties that industry has. A few 
players in there were less than desirable characters but that is 
not true for the majority of them. Some very honourable people 
are lobbyists. No one can tell me that the representation from the 
Canadian Federation of Agriculture to my office is less than 
honourable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Nobody can tell me that when people from the UPA call their 
MPs they do not have the best interest of their members in mind. 
Being a lobbyist is not in itself an undesirable activity. They are 
not all mean bastards. But a few rotten apples have spoiled it for 
everybody else.
<P>
	And that is the truth. I say to the member who spoke before me 
that after being in Parliament for a while, he will realize that 
most lobbyists are honest, but a few of them have done rather 
suspicious things, to say the least.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Where does that bring us? Last year and the year before we 
were studying lobbying legislation. We were studying a new 
conflict of interest code. The Prime Minister has found a way, 
through this ethics counsellor, an independent officer, to impose 
rules that are even stronger than what we have now on the 
registration of lobbyists. He has addressed the issue of conflict 
of interest: one for ministers, their spouses and families; on the 
other side for members of Parliament, once we develop a code 
for ourselves. That is a very important consideration. It has been 
done. It has been addressed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5531"> 5531 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to speak briefly about the independence of the ethics 
counsellor. I have heard one or two members make allegations 
that the ethics counsellor is not independent because he reports 
through a minister to the House. That is not necessarily true. The 
assistant deputy registrar general, which is the position this 
officeholder holds right now, operates in a quasi-judicial 
manner.
<P>
	The Competition Tribunal and other bodies like it report 
through ministers but they operate independently, 
quasi-independently, or at arm's length from the government. 
The Director of Investigations is another one. That is probably a 
better example of someone who operates very much in an 
independent manner, yet the estimates and so on report 
nominally through a minister. There are plenty of cases like that.
<P>
	In this case the Prime Minister looked at a person who was 
holding an independent office of the kind I just described. He 
was chosen to do the job, after consultations with both 
opposition leaders.
<P>
	Finally, once the person is appointed, the appointment has to 
be reviewed by a parliamentary committee under our present 
standing orders. Need I remind members of that. Therefore it is 
an independent position.
<P>
	Yes, the reports as to whether or not a lobbyist breached a 
code will be made through the Minister of Industry, who must 
report to the House within 15 days of having received that 
report. It is not optional. That report is automatically tabled in 
the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	What will be in this report? It could, for instance, tell the 
House about lobbyists who charged fees that were too high, and 
therefore suspicious. I believe it is a good initiative. It goes very 
far in the sense that lobbyists will be identified publicly and 
individually.
<P>
	I am one of those who thought that lobbyists' fees should 
automatically be made public. It is one approach and it is the one 
I put forward. Today, I recognize that this information would be 
buried under the mountain of data released.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We call that the paper blizzard. If you provide enough 
information it is about the same as not providing any.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has very cleverly designed this plan so 
that only those lobbyists who do controversial things will be 
reported to Parliament through the registrar general. This would 
include the fees of those lobbyists. Therefore, if lobbyists-and 
I assume they would generally be tier ones-do something 
questionable, it would be reported to Parliament.
<P>
	The rules in themselves do not change parliamentarians and 
they do not change people. We do need good rules and we will 
have good rules. These proposals will be reviewed by a 
parliamentary committee. I hope to have the honour of 
representing my party on that committee.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that what is most important is good 
ethical and moral behaviour by all of us in Parliament. I think 
that will then filter down to people in the public service and 
everywhere else and we will regain the confidence of the people 
as we have started to do over the months since our party has been 
in office.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure 
for me to speak to this bill to amend the Lobbyists Registration 
Act. This legislation will regulate the work of those who lobby 
government departments and agencies on behalf of their clients' 
interests.
<P>
	I have read the bill and support a number of its provisions. 
Naturally, I support the fact that the bill requires lobbyists to 
disclose the nature of their activities. I also agree that the 
departments and agencies who are being lobbied must be 
identified. I also believe it is a good idea that the identity of 
individuals or corporations involved in lobbying be clearly 
disclosed.
<P>
	These are the main provisions I see in this bill. Basically, we 
expected these provisions.
<P>
	Other positive aspects of the bill, to my mind, are the fact that 
it calls for the establishment of a code of ethics governing 
lobbying activities and the appointment of an ethics counsellor 
to oversee the application of the legislation.
<P>
	Generally speaking, these are the positive sides to this bill. It 
would be rather ridiculous if we only had negative things to say. 
However, if we examine the bill in relation to what has now 
come to be known as the Pearson Airport scandal, we see that as 
it is now worded, the bill would not have prevented this scandal 
from occurring. We would not have received any new 
information besides what we already have.
<P>
	With this bill, we would have learned that some lobbying took 
place with respect to the privatization of part of Pearson Airport. 
That is nothing new. We would have learned that the Department 
of Transport was also lobbied. But we knew that already. 
Perhaps an inquiry would have been called by the person 
responsible for the application of the legislation. Well, an 
inquiry was held into the Pearson Airport deal. The Prime 
Minister appointed a special investigator who looked into the 
deal and released a report, which explains why certain facts 
came to our attention. We have learned in particular that there 
was something in the wind because the investigator did not have 
the power to force people to testify, so that we could find out 
what really happened.
<P>
	The bill before us provides for a code of conduct which is not 
a statutory instrument and cannot force people to testify.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5532"> 5532 </A></B>
<P>
	Having reviewed the bill before us, I submit that this bill 
would have been of no use to us in getting to the bottom of the 
Pearson Airport scandal.
<P>
	As you can see, this bill is seriously flawed. I will try to 
describe briefly the flaws I see in this bill and explain how I 
would like to contribute to future debates on this bill.
<P>
	Flaw number one: the ethics counsellor is appointed by the 
Governor in Council, in other words, the government, the Prime 
Minister, the Cabinet, as in the case of Mr. Nixon, who was 
appointed to investigate the Pearson Airport deal. I would say 
his being appointed by the government undermines his 
authority. As I see it, he should have been appointed by the 
House of Commons, just like the Chief Electoral Officer of 
Canada. This gives him unquestioned prestige and authority.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Flaw number two: the code of conduct is not a statutory 
instrument. This code, as described in the bill, seems to be little 
more than a pious wish list. Lobbyists are advised to behave in a 
certain way, but the code is not a statutory instrument. This is 
going to make it difficult for the person responsible for its 
application to summon witnesses, to question their statements, 
to shed light on suspicious deals. I think the non-regulatory 
status of the ethics code is a major weakness of the bill before 
us.
<P>
	Another shortcoming is that lobbyists are not required to 
make public the amounts involved. When a lobbyist receives 
$10,000 for his services, I think he is not in the same situation as 
if he received $1 million or $2 million.
<P>
	The hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, who 
spoke before me, said that he thought of disclosing the amounts 
paid to lobbyists. The argument he just put forward to justify his 
change of mind is that there would be so much information that 
it would be impractical for potential lobbying researchers to dig 
out the figures. I think the hon. member changed his mind a little 
too fast because of an apparently flimsy justification. Whether 
there are 5,000 or 10,000 reports, Canadians interested in 
democracy will make an effort to look at them. Whether there 
are 10 or 20 people looking, if they see problems, they will be 
able to warn the population, and I think journalists will be smart 
enough to use this information. I think it would be important to 
know how much lobbyists received for their services.
<P>
	Another element of the bill that has not been pointed out but 
should be in my opinion-I will be told, I am sure, that it has to 
do with the Income Tax Act or with other tax laws-is that the 
government has kept the tax deduction for lobbyists' fees. It is 
somewhat ironic that, on the one hand, the public is denied this 
information and that, on the other hand, since the people who 
hire lobbyists benefit by being allowed to claim a tax deduction, 
this information is provided to the Department of Revenue.
<P>
	It could be said that lobbyists want to have their cake and eat it 
too. It means that when things are not favourable, they want to 
keep it a secret, but when they can benefit financially, there is no 
problem as long as tax confidentiality is preserved. I think that 
this tax deduction is very questionable, especially since 
President Clinton of the United States, who wants to regulate 
lobbying, is thinking of eliminating it.
<P>
	The bill also makes a dubious distinction between two types 
of lobbyists: consultant lobbyists paid to make representations 
on behalf of their clients and in-house corporate lobbyists 
whose main duty is to lobby departments and governments in 
order to obtain benefits for their companies. The bill is tougher 
on consultant lobbyists than on in-house lobbyists.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	But we must say that in-house lobbyists are often employed 
by large corporations which can afford their services and which 
must be accountable to the public. So I think that the lack of 
uniformity in the way this bill treats the various lobbyists is a 
major weakness which may bring the public to question the 
effectiveness of this bill.
<P>
	Another feature I find particularly surprising is that lobbyists 
are not required to name the people they contacted in the 
agencies concerned. A report might say: ``So-and-so contacted 
the Department of Transport, the Department of Human 
Resources or the Department of Justice''. But we would like to 
know whom this person contacted. Was it the minister or a 
senior official? I think that it is important to find out what went 
on and to shed light on lobbying activities.
<P>
	I shall conclude because my time is almost up. Basically, 
Quebecers and Canadians want to know who is lobbying. They 
want to know for whom the lobbying is done. They want to know 
how the lobbying is done. They want to know why the lobbying 
is done and how much it costs. I think that it is important and 
when the principle of this bill is considered, my party will seek 
to ensure that this law has all the necessary provisions so that the 
people of Canada and Quebec are kept informed of lobbyists' 
activities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
support the government's motion to send this bill, an act to 
amend the Lobbyists Registration Act, to the committee prior to 
second reading.
<P>
	No Canadian requires the services of a lobbyist to approach 
this government. I am sure that all members of this House would 
agree that our doors are always open to our constituents and we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5533"> 5533 </A></B>
<P>
do our best to ensure that the views of those constituents are well 
represented in government decision making.
<P>
	Moreover, all Canadians have a right to make their own views 
known to ministers of the crown. Every day ministers receive 
hundreds of letters from Canadians expressing their opinion on 
matters within their jurisdiction. Many Canadians make their 
views known directly to the department or agency of the crown 
that handles the issue under consideration.
<P>
	I refer particularly to the farm organizations in the 
constituency that I represent which deal with matters such as 
cattle, hogs, chickens, wheat and a number of agricultural 
commodities that have had representatives here in Ottawa for 20 
or 50 years. They have a right to do so.
<P>
	This government upholds the right of Canadian citizens to 
deal with public officials but as we know, some Canadians do 
hire lobbyists. At the same time, government sometimes seeks 
the advice of groups and organizations in order to find out what 
impact its actions will have on Canadians. Our challenge is to 
ensure that lobbying does not discredit the democratic process.
<P>
	I would like to outline why this legislation does not follow the 
recommendations of the Standing Committee on Consumer and 
Corporate Affairs and Government Operations to eliminate the 
distinctions between tier one and tier two lobbyists.
<P>
	The committee had concluded that tier one and tier two 
lobbyists perform similar functions and recommended one 
definition and the same reporting and disclosure requirements 
for all lobbyists. This legislation on the other hand is based on 
the premise that lobbying performed by consultant lobbyists is 
different from that done by in-house lobbyists.
<P>
	It has named three different categories: consultant, corporate 
in-house and organization in-house lobbyists. I believe that this 
accurately reflects the kind of lobbying activities that are going 
on out there and in fact prevents any kind of confusion of the 
issues in terms of those who are writing reports or consultant 
reports for individual organizations and non-profit 
organizations. Those are the so-called big guns, the Canadian 
Bankers Association for example. Those two types of activities 
are different.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	In other respects the legislation follows the committee's 
recommendations closely. It implements more detailed 
disclosure of all lobbyists. The question of whether increased 
disclosure requires the elimination of two tiers was one that the 
government had to examine very carefully. All organizations 
have told us that they agree with the need to make lobbying more 
transparent. No one is disputing that. They accept the need to 
provide more specific disclosure. They recognize that 
information filed under the existing Lobbyists Registration Act 
is not adequate.
<P>
	When it comes to the question of removing the distinction 
between the two tiers, representatives of corporations and 
organizations say that there are significant differences between 
their work and responsibilities and those of, as I pointed out, the 
consultant lobbyists in the tier one category. Corporate and 
organization in house lobbyists are by nature and status very 
substantively, fundamentally different from consultant 
lobbyists who operate under contract on behalf of clients.
<P>
	To begin with, the activities of the in house lobbyists are 
already well publicized. Further, associations are informed by 
their members to pursue their common objectives on an ongoing 
basis. That is why we are requiring the association rather than 
the individual to file on an annual basis. Non-profit 
organizations will also have to disclose substantially more 
information, but this will not create administrative demands 
beyond their ability to comply.
<P>
	These organizations recognize the value of greater 
transparency in their activities. All in house lobbyists will be 
required to provide annual listings of issues or specific subjects 
of concern, the departments or agencies they expect to contact, 
and in addition the communication techniques they plan to use. 
They will also have to provide updates as changes or new 
information arises or if the project is terminated. They must also 
provide annually a description of the organization's goals and 
objectives or their business activities. Corporate in house 
lobbyists must give the name of the parent company and any 
subsidiaries with a direct interest. Organization lobbyists must 
describe their membership.
<P>
	The government wants to continue the valuable dialogue and 
discussions with associations and organizations in order to find 
out how the government's actions might affect Canadians. At 
the same time the bill will improve transparency of these 
processes by requiring again all lobbyists to disclose 
substantially more information. That is why I support the 
legislation.
<P>
	The subcommittee on industry will want to look at these 
issues once more when it studies the legislation prior to second 
reading. The government assures us that it will maintain an open 
mind on the amendments the committee might recommend.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to the motion to refer Bill C-43 to 
committee prior to second reading. That is significant in that a 
broader discussion regarding the transparency of the political 
process and the accountability of politicians to the Canadian 
public may take place before coming to the House for full 
debate. Therefore I am pleased to endorse the motion referring 
the bill to committee prior to second reading. In my support for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5534"> 5534 </A></B>
<P>
the motion I will explain what I believe to be the strengths and 
the weaknesses of the bill and then I will suggest some changes.
<P>
	There is an attempt here to make the political process more 
open. This is a necessary move, given that there are today few 
professions despised more than a political career. There is a 
good reason for this sorry fact. Constituents in my riding of 
Calgary Southeast have told me time and time again that they 
want to be included in the governance of their country. They 
want to have decisions made that reflect their wishes and that 
benefit their best interests. These Canadians are tired of a 
government that ignores them and succumbs to the special 
interests of powerful lobbyists. Part of the mandate that 
members of my party have received is to put an end to this 
disempowerment.
<P>
	In my last town hall meeting we were discussing the issue of 
criminal justice reform when a man rose to express his concerns. 
He challenged me when he said to all in attendance that their 
input would not make any difference, that politicians were not 
interested in hearing what constituents had to say, and that if 
politicians did hear the message was ultimately ignored. That 
was pretty harsh criticism. All of us here should take note that 
Canadians remain frustrated and worried about where their 
country is going.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	It is often said that perception is reality. In the case of 
disempowered Canadians the opposite is true. In fact reality was 
perceived. My colleagues on this side of the House in the 
Reform Party have a comprehensive package of policy 
proposals that will change that cynical reality. Our proposals 
will give the power back to the constituents where it rightfully 
belongs.
<P>
	The government has borrowed another idea from the Reform 
Party by allowing Bill C-43 to go to committee prior to second 
reading. It is easy therefore for me to support the motion when it 
has come so clearly right out of our blue book.
<P>
	The motion engenders everything that Reform stands for 
when we speak of opening up the political system and making 
access to the political process more transparent. As well, the 
intent of the government to make amendments to the Lobbyists 
Registration Act, the LRA, is to require lobbyists to disclose 
more information to the public. I applaud some of these changes 
for they too are right out of the Reform blue book.
<P>
	Maybe I should send a copy of the blue book to the other side 
of the House because we hear there is confusion among Liberal 
backbenches as to what legislation will be brought forward next 
in the House. We can end their guesswork. They need only check 
our blue book to find out what the government plans to do next.
<P>
	What is happening in the House this session is quite 
interesting. We have Liberals trying to pretend that they are 
Reformers. They recognize that our policies are those Canadians 
want to see enacted in legislation. However and unfortunately 
we see what happens when Liberals try to be Reformers. They 
cannot get things quite right. They tried for criminal justice 
reform but because they  are not Reformers they miss the big 
picture. The same thing is happening with Bill C-43. The 
Liberals are missing the big picture. Making changes to the LRA 
and appointing an ethics counsellor are fine as far as they go, but 
typically they go off track in some important respects and they 
definitely do not go far enough.
<P>
	Bill C-43 will give the ethics counsellor the power to require 
lobbyists to report lobbying fees with respect to government 
contracts. In giving the ethics counsellor this power the bill fails 
to define clearly his authority. A question comes immediately to 
mind such as: Under what circumstances will the ethics 
counsellor require a lobbyist to disclose this information? The 
circumstances appear to be discretionary and given that the 
counsellor reports directly to the Prime Minister he may be 
subject to undue influence.
<P>
	Bill C-43 is a classic example of a bill with much bark but no 
bite. There is a simple solution to the problem. The bill should 
require all lobbyists to disclose all donations and fees received 
over $500 and expenditures over $10. They should be required 
to file quarterly reports and to file year to date information as 
well. This process is currently used in the United States. It 
appears to be an appropriate and adequate model.
<P>
	In the last Parliament another bill on the same topic died on 
the Order Paper. It was coincidentally also labelled Bill C-43. 
The reason that bill did not go anywhere was that it created 
another layer of bureaucracy. We were assured during the 
briefing on the bill yesterday that Bill C-43 would not do that. 
We have yet again more verbal assurance from the government. 
We know what happens when we get verbal assurances, do we 
not? We need only to look to the Ministry of Canadian Heritage 
to confirm that.
<P>
	Bill C-43 would appoint the existing assistant deputy 
registrar general as the ethics counsellor. However we are told 
that he will keep his old job as the ADRG. Now I ask: Will he 
receive two salaries? He presently requires a staff of 25 to fulfil 
his responsibilities as ADRG. Now that he has two jobs it would 
seem that his staff will have a lot more work to do. There are 
only three possibilities here. He could do one job terribly. He 
could do both jobs poorly. Or, he could hire more staff in order to 
do both jobs well. I suspect he will want to do both jobs well. At 
least I hope he will.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	How much more money will his office require to fulfil his new 
responsibilities? Can the government tell us how much this new 
ethics counsellor will cost the Canadian taxpayer? Despite the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5535"> 5535 </A></B>
<P>
assurances the government has given us that it will cost nothing 
to implement the bill I remain highly sceptical.
<P>
	The Liberal government talks the good talk of opening up the 
political process but it does not understand what that really 
means. When it states that it wants to facilitate better action to 
the political system it demonstrates through legislation like this 
that it does not fully understand the magnitude of the problem. 
Tinkering with the LRA will only take us one small step toward 
regaining the confidence of Canadians. The focus of this 
discussion for me is the confidence of Canadians. Tinkering 
with the lobbyists act demonstrates that the government 
recognizes special interest groups, endorses special interest 
groups, listens to special interests, funds special interest groups, 
and enacts legislation to satisfy special interest groups.
<P>
	The Prime Minister speaks often of restoring the trust of 
Canadians. Neither the bill nor the motion will allow Canadians 
to control the government's overspending or to control its 
deficit of some $40 billion and its debt of some $519 billion. If 
the government were serious about winning the trust of 
Canadians it would get its fiscal house in order. Let me remind 
members opposite who have forgotten what real access to the 
political process means that the last government did not know 
what it meant. We all know where its members are buried. It 
appears that this one does not either.
<P>
	Real access to the political process means giving real power 
back to Canadians as individual constituents. Let me share with 
the House, as I conclude, some beliefs that will demonstrate 
this. The government should be guided by stated values and 
principles shared by Canadians in their political beliefs. We 
believe public policy and democratic society should reflect the 
will the majority of the citizens as determined by free and fair 
elections, referendums, and the decisions of legally constituted 
and representative parliaments and assemblies elected by the 
people. This does not include buckling to undue pressure from 
lobbyists.
<P>
	We believe in the common sense of the common people, their 
right to be consulted on policy matters that are public ones 
before major decisions are made, their right to choose and recall 
their own representatives and to govern themselves through 
truly representative and responsive institutions, and their right 
to directly initiate legislation for which substantial public 
support is demonstrated.
<P>
	Unlike the hon. member for Saint-Denis we do not believe the 
average voter is illiterate and cannot print his or her name on a 
voting list. We believe in the accountability of elected 
representatives to the people who elect them and that the duty of 
elected members to their constituents should outweigh pressure 
from lobbyists and special interests.
<P>
	Above all else, we must listen to the voices of our 
constituents. We will not permit the lobby of special interest 
groups to narrow our agenda.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my great 
pleasure to rise in the House today to discuss Bill C-43. We 
cannot represent others if we cannot control ourselves. I think 
that is the essence of the bill. It is very important members of 
Parliament, parliamentary secretaries and cabinet ministers be 
able to control themselves.
<P>
	The essence of the bill is basically to restore integrity to our 
system. We can all remember going through the last election that 
one of the big issues was respect for members of Parliament. 
Clearly members of Parliament were not well respected. They 
were held in contempt in some cases. Some of this issue has not 
gone away by the mere exercise of an election. There is still a 
great deal of mistrust out there. It is a very good move our Prime 
Minister is so concerned about the issue that he personally 
brought the bill to the House.
<P>
	I would like to discuss two specific aspects of the bill into 
which it is basically divided. First are changes under the 
Lobbyists Registration Act and second is the establishment of 
conflict of interest guidelines.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	Why would we need a lobbyist in the first place? Companies 
do have the right to have lobbyists. I know we talk about tier one 
and tier two lobbyists. Essentially companies would have the 
right to be represented to their governments.
<P>
	I think the real essence of it is that this representation needs to 
be tempered. There must be a balance. What do I mean by a 
balance?
<P>
	In my riding this week I dealt with a Mrs. Elizabeth Wardell of 
Bowmanville. She was trying to live on a disability income of 
$850 while at the same time paying $350 a month for drugs. She 
gets no support from our system.
<P>
	I would like to argue that Mrs. Wardell has just as much right 
to consideration under drug patent legislation as the largest drug 
companies of this country. Indeed many of us may argue that she 
has more of a right. I will repeat again, influence must be 
tempered.
<P>
	The most important views of this country are not those of Bay 
Street, James Street or Howe Street, but of Main Street, Main 
Street Canada. The new legislation will increase the visibility of 
the lobbying process.
<P>
	I would like to refer to those areas of changes to the existing 
lobbying registration act. Lobbyists will now be required to 
disclose what departments and government agencies they will 
contact, disclose communication methods to be used and 
register the name of the departments and governmental agencies 
to be contacted.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5536"> 5536 </A></B>
<P>
	In essence when all is said and done the ethics counsellor will 
be able to decide what areas these particular lobbyists are 
interested in focusing in government. This will give us a concept 
from where this kind of activity is coming from and where it is 
directed at government.
<P>
	Many people have argued in the House that it does not have 
any teeth, that it is a waste of time and it is a media show. I have 
discovered that here are some of the teeth in the legislation. For 
those who do not adhere to this process there are fines of up 
$25,000, the role of the RCMP is being strengthened by 
increasing the limitation period for laying charges in summary 
proceedings from six months to two years. If lobbyists 
knowingly make false or misleading statements they could be 
liable to a fine of up to $100,000 and a prison term of two years.
<P>
	These are very serious charges. These are very serious results 
of not abiding by this legislation. I think very clearly the 
government is very interested in cleaning up our act.
<P>
	Through these changes I believe that we will start to temper 
the views of lobbyists and special interest groups but, more 
important, give government back to the people.
<P>
	I would like to discuss a second aspect of this legislation 
which is conflict of interest. I am a chartered accountant. I have 
been enrolled in the Institute of Chartered Accountancy since 
1974. We have a code of ethics. Most professional organizations 
have a code of ethics. If you break it you are out.
<P>
	Why not in this House have a code of ethics? That would 
assume we are professionals. I will give a quick definition of 
professional. It is one who values the interest of their clients 
over those of their own personal interest.
<P>
	In reality what conflict of interest guidelines and ethics 
counsellor are attempting to do is make the people of Canada our 
clients, to put the importance of our clients way above our own 
personal interests.
<P>
	This is what the Prime Minister means when he is clear to the 
commitment of duty, but the interest of the electorate must come 
before those of ourselves.
<P>
	I am sure many members of Parliament have had the same 
kind of problem from being a respected professional to going 
out and being a politician. I remember an incident at a spring fair 
in the last election. People would come up to me and say: ``So, 
you are a crook too''. Nobody has ever in my life referred to me 
as a crook. Because I had changed my cloak, if you will, and had 
suddenly become a ``politician'' aspiring to be a member of this 
House, I was thought of as a crook. In some ways that kind of 
spirit is still out there. We have to address the root causes of that. 
We have to set standards in this good House.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	This section has teeth as well. I would like to refer to section 
20 of the guidelines. This refers to parliamentary secretaries and 
cabinet ministers: ``Guest hospitality, other benefits, including 
those described in section 21, that could influence public office 
holders in their judgement and performance of official duties 
and responsibilities shall be declined''.
<P>
	I just picked that out of interest. I wonder how many of our 
parliamentary secretaries and the cabinet ministers are going to 
be looking under their Christmas tree this year, wondering 
whether these things have to be returned based on this 
legislation. I think it is very real. It is a very real influence.
<P>
	To bring the two aspects together, one being the conflict of 
interest aspect and the second being the reform to the Lobbyists 
Registration Act, the ethics counsellor basically has a number of 
functions. One is to develop a code of conduct in consultation 
with interested parties. A second is to have the powers to 
investigate possible breaches of the code of conduct.
<P>
	The most important aspect of all is to make a public report as a 
result of this investigation. This will be done once a year. When 
I saw this I immediately thought of the Auditor General. I 
thought of the great opportunity for the opposition parties to 
make political hay from this. That is a possibility, a good 
possibility.
<P>
	Imagine a government dedicated to integrity and changing the 
system that would invoke legislation of this kind which will 
only serve to possibly embarrass it. We can clearly see the 
strong commitment our party has to changing the integrity and 
the office of elected officials.
<P>
	In conclusion, under these revised, specific codes of ethics, 
they will clean up our system. The only problem with these 
things is some people will say they do not go far enough, that we 
could have extended it more specifically to all members of 
Parliament.
<P>
	The people who are exempted from this legislation are the 
opposition parties. There is no code of ethics for them. There is 
no commitment to a higher standard for them. There is no 
professional enrolment or engagement for them. Maybe they 
would like to bring forward their own code of ethics.
<P>
	In any case, this is a tremendous move in the right direction 
for the people of Canada, empowering the people of Canada to 
bring back government and the voices of the people of Canada to 
this House.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. There has been 
some consultation. I am not sure whether it is a conclusion yet. 
Perhaps while I am making this proposal, it will give further 
time for the House to consider it.
<P>
	I would like to seek agreement that consideration for this 
particular bill be extended. In other words, that government 
business be extended by one-half hour, and that at the 
conclusion of the half hour the issue be disposed of, this 
particular item be disposed of at that time.
<P>
	Second, that in exchange for doing that, so as to not 
inconvenience any members, we would agree by unanimous 
consent to have only two speakers at Private Members' Hour, 
dealing with the item put on the Order Paper by the hon. member 
for Kamloops. Only he and one member for the Reform would 
speak on that particular private members' item.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	At the conclusion of that debate, the initiative of the member 
for Kamloops would be withdrawn and referred to a 
parliamentary committee. I do not know whether there is 
consent for the parliamentary committee on agriculture to be 
more specific. I know this is a lot to digest in a very few seconds.
<P>
	It is done to accommodate members of one party who would 
prefer to speak on this bill and forgo the time for speaking on the 
other one. The ultimate effect essentially is not to lengthen the 
time of the sitting, that the House would terminate at exactly the 
same time. I do not know whether that suits hon. members.
<P>
	Perhaps there is a request to repeat all of that. Of course I am 
willing to do so.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Perhaps we could split that in half. Is 
there unanimous consent to extend debate for half an hour?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to the 
second part of the deputy whip's motion that only two members 
speak and that the matter be referred to the standing committee 
on agriculture?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think you have listed the first 
and third items. There was one in the centre that was not 
addressed. It was the issue that this government order be 
disposed of at the conclusion of the 30 minutes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I sort of assumed that was the case. Is it 
also agreed that it would be disposed of?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, unless I 
am mistaken, I do have ten minutes to make my speech. Thank 
you very much. I am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill 
C-43.
<P>
	When we looked at the Pearson Airport deal, I think we were 
all hoping that a bill would be tabled to tighten up the Lobbyists 
Registration Act, and are pleased that the government decided to 
propose this legislation, even though it is, in our opinion, far 
from being enough.
<P>
	I have rather mixed feelings about this bill. On the one hand, I 
agree that it is a first step in tightening up the provisions 
concerning lobbyists but, on the other hand, I feel that the 
proposed measures are not enough. I will discuss this more in 
detail later on.
<P>
	Earlier this morning, the hon. member for 
Madawaska-Victoria said that lobbies were an essential 
component of our democratic system. She may be right, but we 
must ensure that lobbying does not corrupt the democratic 
process, and I think this is the goal of a bill designed to better 
monitor the role and the work of lobbyists.
<P>
	The hon. member for Jonquière was quite right when he said 
that the bill, in its present form, would not have prevented what 
we refer to as the Pearson Airport scandal. In fact, it is very 
symptomatic to see that the government waited until the 
conclusion of the debate on the bill concerning compensation to 
those involved in the Pearson Airport deal, before finally tabling 
its legislation on lobbyists.
<P>
	This bill is essential because, if we look at the American 
experience-which we can observe from up close-we see that 
lobbyists in the United States have gained such power that, in a 
way, they control several decisions made by the White House 
and the Congress. A number of positive points must be 
emphasized in Bill C-43. First of all, the appointment of an 
Ethics Counsellor. I think the principle is fully justified and that 
there was an obvious need to appoint an Ethics Counsellor. We 
also find it very positive that this Ethics Counsellor is being 
given investigative powers.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	As the Leader of the Official Opposition said yesterday, we 
fully support Mr. Wilson's appointment to the position of Ethics 
Counsellor. Mr. Wilson has had a highly respected career; he is a 
very honourable man, and we think he is fully qualified for this 
position.
<P>
	We note the government's intention to establish a 
parliamentary committee whose mandate would be to develop a 
code of ethics for senators and members of Parliament. We also 
note its intention to expand and tighten the code of ethics for 
public 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5538"> 5538 </A></B>
<P>
office holders, namely ministers and senior public servants; 
also, its intention to establish a code of ethics for lobbyists.
<P>
	I personally feel it is entirely appropriate that the Ethics 
Counsellor be responsible for administering these three codes of 
ethics. This will eliminate the scattering of responsibilities. I do 
feel, however, that there are a number of shortcomings in the 
bill. First of all, the Ethics Counsellor will not be appointed by 
and accountable to Parliament, but rather by the Governor in 
Council.
<P>
	While the Ethics Counsellor is required to present an annual 
report to Parliament, and while Parliament must periodically 
review this legislation, the fact remains that, because he is 
appointed by the Governor in Council-therefore by Cabinet 
and the Prime Minister-it is difficult to establish a clear 
administrative link and reporting relationship; in my opinion, 
this is all the more incongruous in that the registrar will continue 
to report to the Department of Industry. I think we should ask 
why the Ethics Counsellor is appointed by the Governor in 
Council, therefore, by the Prime Minister. If we want the Ethics 
Counsellor to be entirely credible and as unbiased as possible 
for this work, which would include dealing with possible 
conflicts of interest involving Cabinet members, I think this 
appointment should not be made by the Governor-in-Council, 
representing the wishes of Cabinet, but rather by Parliament 
itself.
<P>
	According to the red book, and I quote, ``the Ethics 
Counsellor will be appointed after consultation with the leaders 
of all parties in the House of Commons''.
<P>
	I cannot deny that the Leader of the Official Opposition and 
the leader of the Reform Party were informed of Mr. Wilson's 
appointment, and I do not deny that we are entirely in favour of 
this appointment, as I noted earlier. But, given the measures 
provided for in this bill, we must wonder about the attitude 
subsequent governments might take. Would subsequent 
governments pay just as much attention to the opposition's point 
of view on the appointment of an ethics counsellor? This is what 
we are questioning with respect to the prospect of designation by 
the Governor in Council.
<P>
	We must also deplore the fact that the distinction between the 
two types of lobbyists is maintained. I will, with your 
permission, refer again to the red book that has been quoted so 
many times since the beginning of this session because, of 
course, the government boasts about this process of 
transparency in parliamentary and government institutions it 
will undertake in order to restore public trust in our 
parliamentary institutions and our government.
<P>
	So the red book says, among other things, and I quote: ``To 
increase the transparency of the government's relations with 
lobbyists, and to give effect to some of the measures described 
here, a Liberal government will implement the unanimous June 
1993 report of the House of Commons Standing Committee on 
Consumer and Corporate Affairs respecting the Lobbyists 
Registration Act''.
<P>
	Well, the first recommendation of the Holtmann report 
suggests that, and I quote ``The distinction between Tier I and 
Tier II lobbyists be eliminated''. But it is maintained. How do 
you explain that a lobbyist working for a large corporation can 
have two months to file a return while consultant lobbyists have 
only ten days? What is the basis for such different treatment?
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	We should not differentiate on the basis of status, but rather 
according to the type of activity. Someone who plays the piano 
is a pianist; someone who lobbies is a lobbyist. Whatever status 
they have, all lobbyists perform the same activity and we should 
not keep this artificial difference.
<P>
	I also believe that we should have done away with the fiscal 
exemptions for lobbying expenses, something which, by the 
way, was suggested by the Minister of Transport. These 
exemptions mean that the government is subsidizing the work 
undertaken by private interests to influence the 
decision-making process.
<P>
	I believe that direct referral to committee, which virtually 
does away with second reading, something we regret a little, has 
a positive aspect in that it allows members to voice their opinion 
on the principle of the bill. In committee, the Bloc Quebecois 
will try to prevent this bill from becoming an empty shell, a 
mere cosmetic operation. The Bloc Quebecois will co-operate 
with the government, but it also expects the government to be 
open and receptive to the constructive suggestions that might be 
made by the various political parties in the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a great pleasure to speak to this motion to send Bill C-43 to 
committee.
<P>
	I cannot think of a type of legislation that is more important to 
all members of the House of Commons. I like to think that this is 
the kind of thing I was sent by the people in my riding, to do in 
the House.
<P>
	I took notes of two things as this debate progressed. One is the 
tremendous co-operation that has been shown by members of 
the opposition parties to examine this bill very candidly and to 
look for ways to improve the bill and to find deficiencies. I also 
took note of the minister's statement this morning that he is 
willing to entertain any kind of bona fide, progressive 
suggestion, any kind of amendment.
<P>
	I do have something I would like to add to this bill as an 
amendment. It has to do with a subject that is of great interest to 
me and to other members of the House and that is special interest 
groups.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5539"> 5539 </A></B>
<P>
	For the last three months I have made it my particular interest 
to examine the past practices of governments funding special 
interest groups, particularly government funded advocacy 
groups. These are really another type of lobby as we have heard 
already in the House.
<P>
	I have looked very carefully into these groups. They are 
usually non-profit organizations. They are usually umbrella 
organizations that claim to represent hundreds of thousands of 
Canadians and hundreds of other organizations.
<P>
	One of the very great difficulties with this situation where 
organizations like this are funded is that the nature of the law, 
both the Access to Information Act and the laws governing 
Revenue Canada make it impossible for a member of Parliament 
or a member of the press to independently examine the books of 
these special interest groups. Even their applications are 
protected under the Access to Information Act. The balance 
sheets they present annually are as they choose to present them. 
They are not subject to close examination unless by chance 
government audit. We have no control in that respect.
<P>
	Even if these special interest groups, be they advocacy groups 
or other special interest groups are audited, it would be found 
that the majority of them are incorporated companies. It means 
that the principals of those companies which are not accountable 
for how they spend government money, are not accountable 
when the auditor comes by and perhaps finds something very 
much amiss.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not want to name any particular groups. I am deliberately 
being general. This goes even beyond that. In my research I have 
looked at many government funded advocacy groups that are up 
front, but among the special interest groups there are many 
groups that ostensibly are using the money for charitable or 
non-profit purposes. Because we cannot independently examine 
their books, we do not know whether they are using some of this 
money for lobbying purposes. We have no control. We may have 
lobbying with government money under the table, shall we say, 
and this is a very serious concern.
<P>
	I would like to address this problem with two amendments to 
Bill C-43. We are talking about special interest advocacy 
groups, probably over 100, and we are talking about millions of 
taxpayers' dollars. Mr. Speaker, I hope you will give your due 
attention to the wording of these two proposed amendments. I 
have worked very hard on them. I have to say I am not skilled in 
preparing amendments and I am sure the staff can do better than 
I.
<P>
	The first amendment I would suggest is that for individuals or 
organizations defined in the act as lobbyists it shall be an 
offence to use money received from government to lobby 
government. That is the first amendment and would take care 
across the board of all these umbrella groups that are taking 
money from the  taxpayer and using it to lobby government, 
which at the very least is a conflict of interest.
<P>
	On the other hand, we do not want to discourage legitimate 
charities or legitimate non-profit organizations from lobbying 
government when situations arise that affect them very closely. I 
would suggest that the Canadian Cancer Society certainly would 
want to speak to the government on the issue of the price of 
cigarettes and similar health issues. We have to provide that they 
can still lobby to some degree while shutting off those special 
interest groups that are secretly lobbying.
<P>
	The second amendment I propose is this. For individuals or 
organizations that are not lobbyists as defined in the act it shall 
be an offence to use more than 10 per cent of money received 
from the government to lobby government. In this way we have 
taken care of the legitimate concerns of charities while actually 
putting teeth in the law for those who would abuse the privilege 
of receiving government money for acts of charity and use it 
instead to lobby for special interest purposes.
<P>
	I hope that when the committee considers Bill C-43 they will 
also consider these two proposals.
<P>
	I would like to just touch very quickly on a few deficiencies in 
the act. Some members of the Bloc have mentioned them. I have 
difficulty with the one tier, two tier system, but for different 
reasons than I have heard here. The one tier system is defined as 
an individual, whereas the two tier system is basically 
organizations and corporations. The one tier individual actually 
is required to declare more than the tier two organization.
<P>
	The difficulty is many lobbyists incorporate themselves as 
companies so rather than being individuals they can incorporate 
and become tier two. We need to very carefully plug up that 
problem because we want to make sure that the individual 
consultant type lobbyist is fully governed by the restrictions and 
limitations that we wish to put him under.
<P>
	I have one other difficulty. I have a problem with the ethics 
counsellor and the concept of an ethics counsellor in one 
respect. He is empowered to investigate and bring forward the 
results of his investigation to Parliament.
<P>
	The problem is that nothing in the act indicates whether the 
ethics counsellor, when he gets his evidence, whether that 
evidence is going to be subject to the restrictions of the Access 
to Information Act and Privacy Act.
<P>
	In other words, you could have a situation where the ethics 
counsellor gets third party information which he is not allowed 
to disclose as a result of the Access to Information Act and 
Privacy Act.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="5540"> 5540 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1400 ) </B>
<P>
	You would have a situation in which he would be investigating 
but we, the parliamentarians, would not be able to see a full and 
candid report.
<P>
	Therefore I really urge the committee to look very carefully at 
the implications of these two acts, the Access to Information Act 
and the Privacy Act, and make sure that however it is done the 
ethics counsellor is able to report as fully as possible on his 
findings before this House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at the outset, I want to acknowledge that the bill 
entitled An Act to amend the Lobbyists Registration Act is a step 
in the right direction. It imposes additional requirements on 
lobbyists and provides the public with a better understanding of 
the role they play.
<P>
	This bill is, however, nothing but a watered-down version of 
the red book commitment to implement the June 1993 report of 
the Standing Committee on Consumer and Corporate Affairs 
and Government Operations respecting the review of the 
Lobbyists Registration Act.
<P>
	What kind of promises were contained in the red book? The 
first commitment made was to eliminate the distinction between 
Tier I and Tier II lobbyists. The government has not followed up 
on this undertaking, which means that there will continue to be 
two categories of lobbyists to whom different rules apply. Yet, 
the Liberal members were the ones who demanded that the 
distinction be dropped during the discussions on the registration 
of lobbyists in the Standing Committee on Consumer and 
Corporate Affairs and Government Operations.
<P>
	Here is what the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell 
had to say about this matter on February 2, 1993: ``There is a 
concern about the in-house lobbyists, about the fact that we are 
not asking as much information from them as from others; 
namely, we are not asking the topic about which they are 
lobbying. Does this not make it easy for someone to hire a Tier I 
lobbyist and merely put him on the payroll? In other words, you 
convert him into a Tier II and you put him on the payroll for a 
year because you know this person will be lobbying for the drug 
patents act or some other controversial topic, for example. By 
putting him or her on the payroll, you effectively reduce the 
information that you have to divulge''.
<P>
	The second commitment made was to establish a code of 
ethics governing conflict-of-interest situations involving 
public figures, for example, members of Parliament or Cabinet 
and senior officials. The government has only partly fulfilled 
this particular commitment since it has not given this future 
code regulatory status, which would have made it more legally 
binding. Therefore, any attempt to deceive will be met  merely 
with a reprimand, not with legal or criminal sanctions. This 
government is harder on young offenders than on friends of the 
system and the parliamentarians who are at their beck and call.
<P>
	A third promise made in the red book was to eliminate tax 
deductions for lobbying expenses. Canadians must realize that 
they have elected 295 members of Parliament to represent them 
and that day after day, opposition members question the 
government in the hope of getting answers which, when they do 
come, are only partial, while Parliament Hill bustles with 2,800 
lobbyists who call the shots with taxpayers' money. Let us recall 
the role played by lobbyists in what has come to be known as the 
Ginn Publishing and Pearson Airport scandals. In his report on 
the latter scandal, Mr. Nixon noted that the lobbyists played a 
prominent part in attempting to affect the decisions that were 
reached, going far beyond the acceptable norms of 
``consulting''. That is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	Also, nothing in this bill provides for lobbying expenses to be 
made public, even as part of an inquiry. Yet, such information is 
extremely useful in assessing the activities of lobbyists. On that 
subject, the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell 
stated on February 23, 1993: ``I do not agree that knowing how 
much is spent on lobbying is of interest neither to those involved 
nor to the public''. In the case of the Pearson scandal, it is in the 
public interest to know who are the lobbyists who worked on 
that deal and how much they were paid to do it. It is even more 
important because in this case as in many others, former 
high-ranking government officials are now selling their 
knowledge of the inner workings of government and using their 
former contacts. It is the revolving door approach.

	In the case of Pearson Airport, the scandal is overwhelming. 
On the one hand, lobbying fees were deducted from the taxes 
paid by the corporations involved in the attempted privatization 
of Pearson Airport, and on the other, taxpayers will be hit a 
second time since, under clause 10 of Bill C-22, those 
corporations will be compensated.
<P>
	Still on the issue of lobbying fees, the government allows 
conditional fees to be paid by people who hire lobbyists if and 
when they succeed in getting certain favours from the 
government for their client, such as a contract, for instance. On 
February 16, 1993, the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell stated very clearly, and I quote: 
``I believe that conditional fees should be banned''.
<P>
	The fourth undertaking in the red book was to reveal the 
players in the government decision-making process by asking 
various questions, for example: Who could be influenced? 
Which lobbyist requested a meeting with which minister? 
Which public servant met with which lobbyist to discuss which 
issue? What was the particular item on the agenda, or what issue 
did the parties discuss?  Was it a bill, an amendment, a subsidy, a 
<P>

<P>
regulation, a policy, a program, or the awarding of a contract? 
Here again, the promise has not been kept.
<P>
	This is probably the most disappointing aspect of the bill. 
Indeed, merely requiring that all lobbyists disclose the 
government department or agency contacted is clearly 
unsatisfactory. Real reform should help us find out the names of 
the people lobbyists are trying to influence. While in opposition, 
a lot of the current ministers, cabinet and government members 
were very harsh with lobbyists, but now they seem to have 
changed their minds. Maybe because lobbyists are hanging 
around their offices all the time.
<P>
	For example, in June of 1993, the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell said that the public had the right 
to know who is doing what to whom and for how much money. 
At the time, he thought it was unfortunate that these 
considerations were not included in the legislation.
<P>
	He also said, on February 16, 1993, that he was one of those 
who favoured a registration system as long as loopholes were 
eliminated and the parties concerned required to provide useful 
information. He went on to say that the system could be 
improved by providing accurate, concise and valuable 
information.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Liberal government was obviously under 
pressure from the lobbyists and from friends who hire them. 
This shows, I think, that we probably should have started by 
amending the political party financing legislation in order to be 
able to examine quietly and without undue pressure the issue of 
lobbyists, unlike what seems to have happened with this bill. I 
hope that the working committee will take note of these 
recommendations.
