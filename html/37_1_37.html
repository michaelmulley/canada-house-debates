require, upon the setting up and operation of the financial 
consumer agency, the commissioner of the agency to report its 
activities to parliament through the Minister of Finance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have stood in the House on many occasions calling for the 
independent arms of government agencies and commissions to report 
not through a minister but directly to parliament, and in this 
case to the Standing Committee on Finance.  The motion reflects 
that an amendment be put that would require Financial Consumer 
Agency of Canada to report to the Standing Committee on Finance 
on a permanent basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 13 deals with the operation of Interac services.  The 
bill calls for the association to report every rule change during 
the normal course of operation to the Minister of Finance. This 
is an onerous demand.  We would make an amendment that would give 
the Interac Association a very clear and transparent framework to 
operate under that is self-regulating.  Its compliance people 
would have a very clear understanding of what is required of them 
by the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion would require that the Minister of Finance provide: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) a statement of the reasons why, in the opinion of the 
Minister, it is in the public interest to designate a payment

adequately address a Minister's concerns, the Governor in Council 
may designate a payment system. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The broad, transparent and clear framework included in the bill 
by the Minister of Finance would be sufficient for the 
association to conduct its normal day to day business 
transactions.  It would not burden it with a requirement to 
report and discuss every rule change so long as it was operating 
within the broad framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I wanted to say as far as the motions put forward 
from the Canadian Alliance in Group No. 1. Overall it is a 
progressive bill.  While we criticize the government for being 
tardy on it, we are happy with the bill.  It is bringing Canada's 
banking system to a more progressive stage so that we can compete 
with our competition around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask government members to see the prudence and the common 
sense in these amendments and I am sure they will support them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Group No. 1 deals with Motion Nos. 1, 8, 12 and 13.  Two 
of them are in my name and I wish to say a couple of words about 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 2 deals with the powers of the Financial Consumer 
Agency of Canada.  The bill is a very complicated piece of 
legislation dealing with financial institutions.  It is 900 pages 
thick and affects about 1,400 pages of statutes.  It is perhaps 
the most complicated bill ever debated in the House of Commons as 
one particular bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the bill and the statutes that will be changed, 
much of what will happen will be through regulation by the 
federal government.  The regulations are extremely important in 
terms of the purport and the effect of the legislation on the 
ordinary person living in Halifax or in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should do a number of things to improve the legislation 
before the House today.  I would suggest one very small thing 
that can be found in one of my motions.  The powers of the 
Financial Consumer Agency of Canada should be enhanced in terms 
of penalizing corporations that actually violate the new law. 
Under the present regulation it is suggested that an individual 
would be charged up to $50,000 if there is a violation and a 
financial institution would be charged $100,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My amendment would change the maximum penalty ceiling for 
corporations from $100,000 to $500,000.  Some may ask why 
$500,000.  It is because $500,000 was originally suggested by the 
Liberal Party in one of its white papers a year or so ago. This 
is not a very dangerous amendment.  It is something that could be 
supported by the House and is perfectly reasonable in terms of a 
penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Perhaps I am too late.  The hon. member was speaking to a motion 
that is not presently before us since we are still dealing with 
Group No. 1.  The motion he is speaking to is in Group No. 2. 
However, I believe he was just moving on to the next one so I am 
too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is why I was 
speaking in generalities about improving the powers of that 
financial agency.  Motion No. 8, which is part of the first 
grouping, would speak directly to parliament through a democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a bank merger, under the current legislation the 
Minister of Finance would have the final say.  That is the way it 
is today.  The Minister of Finance has the final say.  My 
amendment would, except in the case of insolvency, give the 
Parliament of Canada the final say.  There would be a vote in 
parliament on whether or not a bank merger would go ahead.  That 
is not very radical, but bank mergers could potentially be 
extremely important items on the public agenda or in terms of 
public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remember how in January 1998 four of the large banks wanted 
to merge: the Bank of Montreal, Royal Bank, TD and Scotiabank. We 
had a great debate on the matter.  I am proud to say that our 
party at the beginning was very much opposed to these mergers, 
arguing that they would not help consumers and that they would 
concentrate more power into fewer hands in terms of financial 
institutions.  I remember people saying that there was no use in 
fighting the large banks as they were powerful and would win. 
However, we led that opposition and within a year or so there was 
a lot of opposition across the country and in December 1998 the 
Minister of Finance said no to the merger of those four large 
banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result we now have a new mechanism in Bill C-8 before us 
today.  Instead of democratizing the process and making 
parliament more meaningful in terms of the power MPs have to 
speak on behalf of their constituents, the Minister of Finance 
will have the final say as to whether or not a merger goes ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying in our amendment that a resolution of parliament 
should be the final say.  We should vote yes or no.  It would 
expand and empower the role of members of parliament so that 
someone from Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Quebec, Ontario, or anywhere 
in the country would have the final say in terms of the debate 
and the argument as to whether or not a merger is in the public 
good. We would decide if it is good for the country, if it will 
help consumers, or if it is good for rural Canada or different 
parts of Canada where mergers are to take place.  The power 
should not reside in the hands of one minister, the Minister of 
Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, please try to divorce yourself from the idea that 
we will have the Minister of Finance for all time.  This minister 
and the next minister may or may not make the proper decision. 
We should not leave that power in the hands of the Minister of 
Finance.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is part of parliamentary democracy.  It is part of 
democratic and parliamentary reform.  It is part of empowering 
this place to be more meaningful and relevant to Canadians.  When 
we see the alienation from this parliament and we see fewer 
people casting their ballots, it makes us wonder why we do not 
empower ourselves and make this institution more meaningful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons has to be a check and a balance on the 
powers of the executive and cabinet.  Why do we not do that as 
members of parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members across the way voted for the motion, it would not be 
a vote of non-confidence in the government.  In the case of a 
merger, unless there is an insolvency, parliament would have the 
final say.  In the case of an insolvency the Minister of Finance 
would have the power to make that decision and make it very 
quickly.  If the process is established under the bill, and this 
item is on the public agenda, then why would the Parliament of 
Canada not have the final say instead of the Minister of Finance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion is a timid little step in the direction of 
parliamentary reform and parliamentary democracy and would make 
this place more relevant and meaningful.  I hope members across 
the way will see this as an opportunity to bring in parliamentary 
reform and bring back more democracy to make this place more 
meaningful and more important in the lives of the average 
citizen.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
start by informing you that we support some of the amendments 
made by the Canadian Alliance, in particular Motion No.1 by the 
hon. member for Prince George<B>—</B>Bulkley Valley<B> </B>relating to 
accountability to parliament and to a report on the 
administration of the act being provided to parliament from time 
to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having gone carefully through the banking bill on more than one 
occasion, and before that the white paper from the Minister of 
Finance, following up on the MacKay-Ducros report, I noted that, 
for perhaps the first time in a piece of legislation of this 
significance, the Minister of Finance had incredible 
discretionary powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members need only give this bill a cursory examination to 
see, every ten pages or so, that the minister can intervene to 
make decisions.  These decisions are at his discretion.  His 
discretionary powers are such as have never been seen before. 
Thus, Motion No. 1 by my colleague for Prince George—Bulkley 
Valley is a marked improvement over what we had before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the entire process, I will have the opportunity to 
touch back on this important aspect of ministerial discretion as 
opposed to what we ought to find in a bill, which is enhanced 
parliamentary responsibility and better monitoring of decisions 
taken by the minister or the governor in council.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  We are dealing with

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will be speaking to 
Group No. 1.  I take this opportunity to thank the members of the 
House of Commons finance committee for their constructive 
approach to this very important and very massive legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment on Alliance Motion No. 1 which deals 
with the reporting of the financial consumer agency. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that under Bill C-8, the Minister of Finance 
is responsible for the financial consumer agency of Canada. 
Reporting arrangements have been specified which would allow the 
minister to appropriately monitor the activities of the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the bill currently contains a provision that ensures 
that the consumer agency will be fully accountable to parliament. 
In particular, clause 34 of the bill requires the minister to 
annually lay before each House of parliament a report showing the 
operations of the agency for that year and describing in 
aggregate form its conclusions of the compliance of financial 
institutions with the consumer provisions.  The financial 
consumer agency of Canada accountability structure and government 
reporting requirements mirror those that are currently in place 
for OSFI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second motion in this group from the Alliance, Motion No. 
13, deals with the Canadian payments system.  The process for 
designating a payment system in the proposed legislation is very 
extensive and would require the minister to consult with payment 
system managers and participants before notification of 
designation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not necessary to detail in legislation, as proposed in 
Motion No. 13, process issues that would likely be part of any 
consultation.  It is likely that the minister would outline the 
public interest reasons for the possible designation during the 
consultative period.  It is possible, but if the payment system 
manager and participants addressed the concerns of the minister, 
there would not be a need to designate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go now to the motions presented by the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle, the NDP finance critic.  Motion No. 8 
concerns itself with bank mergers.  I should make it absolutely 
clear to the House that the government recognizes the importance 
of the role that parliament can play in assessing the public 
interest impact of bank mergers in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the merger review guidelines include referral to 
both the House finance committee and the Senate banking 
committee.  Through the reports of these committees to the 
Minister of Finance, the views of parliament would be considered 
in reviews of large bank mergers in Canada.  The report of the 
finance committee would be presented to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance, however, is ultimately responsible for 
the safety, soundness and efficient functioning of the financial 
sector in Canada.  The ultimate decision regarding whether a 
merger is approved or not needs to rest with the Minister of 
Finance and should not be conditional on approval by a resolution 
in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the proposed change could seriously undermine the 
safety and soundness of the financial services sector.  Since 
mergers involving troubled institutions would not require the 
special resolution, this would signal to Canadians that at least 
one of the banks involved is in financial trouble.  This could 
lead to a run on either one or both of the institutions, which in 
turn could seriously undermine the public's confidence in the 
financial services sector and the payment system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now go to Group No. 1, Motion No. 12, from the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle.  The motion deals with adding a new clause 
that would require any regulations made under the new bill in a 
calendar year to be referred to a committee of the House, the 
Senate or both for a comprehensive review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members are aware, Bill C-8 is a significant legislative 
initiative that sets out in comprehensive detail the key policy 
framework announced in the government's June 25, 1999 white 
paper.  Within this framework, there are authorities to provide 
flexibility to specify elements of the new regime in regulations. 
Any regulations proposed under this framework would be subject to 
the same rigorous oversight process that applies to regulations 
proposed under any other federal statutes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Privy Council Office will review the regulation to ensure 
that it is consistent with the objectives of the legislation and 
interested stakeholders will be given an opportunity to comment 
on the proposed changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key component of this regulatory flexibility is that it allows 
the government to respond to rapid changes in the industry in a 
more timely way than might be allowed by a five year review of 
the legislation.  The motion, as proposed, would negatively 
impact on this flexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A yearly review of the regulations would create uncertainty for 
the industry as to any changes proposed by the government in a 
particular area.  To the extent that the review created delays, 
the proposed motion could lead to regulatory initiatives not 
being completed in a more timely way than a full fledged 
legislative amendment.  For this reason, the government does not 
support this proposed change. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-8, a massive bill, as 
has been mentioned.  It is a bill which, when I hold it in my 
hands, increases my weight by about 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the proposed amendments in Group No. 1, we see 
that they are there to improve the bill.  I will speak 
specifically to Motion No. 1 right now, put forward by my 
colleague, which deals with the reporting section.  The 
parliamentary secretary just stated that there is a provision in 
the bill for this.  For clarity, I will read from page 15 under 
“Annual Report”.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister shall cause to be laid before each House of 
Parliament, not later than the fifth sitting day of that House 
after September 30 next following the end of each fiscal year, a 
report showing the operations of the Agency for that year and 
describing in aggregate form its conclusions on the compliance of 
financial institutions with the consumer provisions applicable to 
them in that year. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members notice who is reporting?  It is the minister.  The 
minister shall lay a report on the table.  Of course the minister 
can say exactly what he or she wants.  It is reported in the 
House and we all know what happens to reports.  Routine 
proceedings take place every day in the House and someone 
presents a report under the tabling of documents.  Under one of 
those proceedings, the minister could simply table a report 
showing the operations of the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 is really quite different.  It is difficult by 
reasoned debate to persuade the members on the other side of the 
House because I am not sure they are listening.  If they are 
listening, they do not show it by their body language.  All we 
see is a bunch of green foreheads over there that are not 
really— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  As the hon. member 
knows, since he has been in the House for quite a while now, the 
hon. members in the House are to be addressed with respect.  I 
caution him to perhaps change the words he just used or to excuse 
himself, if he wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  My apologies, Madam Speaker.  I was simply 
urging the members opposite to listen carefully and perhaps even 
to consider voting in favour of the amendments that have been put 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will digress for a second.  A motion was passed by a majority 
not long ago that said that amendments at report stage in the 
House were not to be received by the Speaker.  Then there were 
some really broad, sweeping statements made.  The fact is that 
when we make amendments in committee, they are voted down by the 
majority in the committee before they have been given serious 
thought.  I am contending that amendments made in the House often 
get no serious thought.  I think it is time that we change that.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like members to seriously consider and support Motion 
No. 1 put forward by my colleague.  Instead of the minister 
giving a report in the House, Motion No. 1 states that the report 
should go to the House of Commons: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—on all matters connected with the administration of this Act, 
which stands permanently referred to the Standing Committee on 
Finance, and of the consumer provisions. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with a balance.  Banks have tremendous power but 
we need them.  They are an important component of the engine of 
our financial well-being and our economic development.  However 
we need a balance between their powers and provisions and the 
protection of individuals, small businesses and others.  We say 
that the report should automatically be referred to the finance 
committee and to the House of Commons and not just simply be a 
report tabled by the minister.  I would urge members to seriously 
consider supporting that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now make reference to Motion No. 13 put forward by my 
colleague, which deals with the designation of payment system. 
Someone might read <I>Hansard</I> somewhere down the road, or may 
be listening on television or perchance listening in the gallery 
today, who does not even know what the payment system is.  The 
fact is that we have huge numbers of financial transactions every 
day ranging from mega corporations transferring millions and 
sometimes billions of dollars, down to an individual using a 
credit card to make a purchase of a couple of small items at the 
drug store. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a payment system that is the communications link between 
all our financial institutions.  When I write a cheque drawn on 
the credit union to which I belong and it is processed by someone 
who deposits it in one of the banks, there has to be a 
communications system.  The government, rightly, has the 
authority to designate the payment system.  Motion No. 13 
suggests that the minister must provide in writing the rationale 
for either declaring a payment system valid or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read subclause 37(3) of the bill on page 408.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before a payment system is designated, the Minister shall consult 
the manager and the participants of the payment system and may 
consult interested parties, with respect to the effect of the 
designation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says “may consult”, not have to, anybody who is affected. 
The provision of Motion No. 13 would strengthen this and would 
require the minister to do the work much more thoroughly.  The 
motion says: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the process by which consultation of the manager, the 
participants, and other interested parties who could be affected 
by the designation can take place, including how the Minister's 
concerns can be addressed; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a strengthening of that.  I would again ask members 
opposite to give some heed to the actual wording of this 
particular amendment.  It is a good amendment because it 
strengthens the relationship between the banks and the people who 
use their services.  It shows an accountability which exceeds 
just simply a minister being able to do pretty well anything he 
wants with a consultation which me may or may not use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment on the motions put forward by the member 
for Regina—Qu'Appelle in Group No. 1.  My present inclination is 
to be oppose his motions on a rational basis.  Quite clearly we 
have very few banks in Canada.  If I read his amendments 
correctly, they say that amalgamations should be approved by 
parliament. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1045"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT10"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT10"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1045
<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is probably true that we have five maybe six major banks in 
Canada right now.  It is foreseeable that some of them may try to 
merge their operations for whatever reason, but I will not go 
into those.  We know we went through an exercise like that not 
long ago.  It is reasonable to expect that this could occur 
again.  The member is proposing that it should be approved by the 
House of Commons and by the Senate.  That is what his amendment 
basically says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose one could not be opposed to that if we were looking at 
one or two occurrences.  However there are hundreds of smaller 
financial institutions around the country.  I think we would 
probably err if each of those would come before the House every 
time a little outfit in one town wanted to amalgamate and merge 
with another one in a neighbouring town to strengthen their 
position.  It is not clear in the amendment that the member would 
exclude many of these. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My inclination is not to favour that amendment for the reason 
that these things could be held up interminably waiting for a 
parliamentary calendar which would permit us to deal with them. 
That would be my primary objection but in principle it is 
correct.  It is in the House where presumably members of 
parliament have the voice to represent the needs of the people 
who are dealing with the banks. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
since this is the first time I have addressed the House during 
this parliament, I am sure that you will permit me a small 
aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to thank the 50% of the voters in the lovely riding of 
Rivière-des-Mille-Îles who voted for me in the last election and to 
assure the other 50% who did not that I am still their MP and 
I will represent everyone in my riding, regardless of how 
they cast their ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I especially wish to thank the volunteers, who played a 
big role in my getting elected, as you know from your own 
personal experience, Madam Speaker.  It is thanks to the work of 
your volunteers and mine, who worked their hearts out, that we 
have a seat in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, I wish to welcome the new recruits, particularly my 
friend, the member for Châteauguay.  He will find the House a 
place of wonderful experiences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, I would ask you to pass on a message to the Speaker and 
to all your colleagues who were elected and appointed. I am 
certain that you will do a splendid, non-partisan job, and that 
you will ensure that we pay careful attention to the rules and 
procedures under which we must operate.  Madam Speaker, I thank 
you in advance for the work you will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now for the main topic. 
As everyone knows, I rise this morning to address Bill C-8, an 
act to establish the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada and to 
amend certain acts in relation to financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by giving a brief background to the bill.  It will 
be recalled that the MacKay report was tabled in 1998.  My 
colleague, the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, was a key player, 
suggesting some interesting amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, although we supported Bill C-38 in theory, subject to 
certain amendments, there was an exchange of correspondence with 
Quebec's then finance minister, Bernard Landry, who is now, as 
everyone knows, Premier of Quebec. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT11"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT11"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1050
<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this exchange of correspondence between the Quebec 
minister of finance of the day and the federal Minister of 
Finance went nowhere.  Fortunately, Bill C-38 died on the order 
paper because of the call of the precipitous election in 
November, for wich most Canadians still doubt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are this morning debating Bill C-8, which replaces C-38. 
Basically, the Bloc Quebecois can live with it, so long as a 
number of amendments are made. 
We have noticed in the new C-8, which is almost identical to C-38, 
that a number of changes have been made as the necessary result 
of the exchange of correspondence between the two finance 
ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it leaves a bad taste in the mouth, since the concerns 
of the Quebec finance minister of the day, Bernard Landry, are 
not included in the bill.  They are, rather, included in a 
schedule setting out guidelines for the reclassification of the 
banks, which had been in schedule 1 previously and whose owner's 
equity was less than $5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to this schedule, the Bloc Quebecois has some concerns, 
since the schedule provides that: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Minister of Finance, in his sole decision, shall take into 
consideration, before permitting an exchange or the sale of one 
bank to another, the security and solidity of the bank, the 
direct and indirect jobs, the location of the decision-making 
centre and the management of the bank, the needs of consumers, 
the banks business and activities and the banks prospects for 
the future in the context of world markets. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The six points I have just outlined are just wishful thinking, 
since the bill would allow the current Minister of Finance, who, I 
believe, owns a shipping company, has adopted the practice since, 
of being the only master on board, like the ship's 
captain, when decisions are to be made. 
So, the minister has all the powers to ignore these six points 
without us being able to say or do anything about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 is much too important to allow a single individual, a 
single captain, that is the Minister of Finance himself, make 
the decisions about any changes to this legislation. This is 
very close to dictatorship. It is also dangerous considering 
that the government opposite has a great tendency to engage in 
cronyism and take care of its friends.  We should be 
careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly suggest that the final decisions be made by 
parliamentarians. We are here to make decisions. We are not 
decorating plants, we must make decisions.  We must really be 
careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that is of concern to me and certainly to my 
friend, the hon. member for Drummond, is that the bill is three 
tiered with the possibility for an individual to own a 
bank. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1055"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT12"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT12"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1055
<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It begins with large banks, that is those with equity in excess 
of $5 billion. The limit on individual ownership of shares is 
20% of the value of the bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second group includes banks with equity of one to five 
billion dollars, such as the National Bank, the only Quebec bank 
with a federal charter. Since equity for these institutions is 
less than $5 billion, 65% of the shares of that bank can be held 
by a single shareholder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we are back to the style of our finance minister, our great 
shipmaster, the only person who can decide how a bank can run 
itself. Will the bank defend the interests of its shareholders? 
Surely, since it is the majority shareholder.  However, it will defend 
these interests to whose detriment.  To the detriment of service 
and employees.  This is cause for concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are small institutions with less than $1 billion in 
equity, which can be owned 100% by one person. Unfortunately, 
that was not what the MacKay report recommended, as it suggested 
that ownership rules be changed to allow and foster the 
regrouping of small and medium sized financial institutions in a 
financial holding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the MacKay report, several small 
financial institutions could associate and form a large bank 
with equity of $5 billion or more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that my time is up, but I will indicate 
two other issues of concern to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Bill C-8 does not meet the expectations of the Bloc 
Quebecois about community reinvestment, not in the least. 
Second, it provides no protection to savers and investors.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me preface my comments by saying that one of the things the 
government sought to do as a result of the MacKay task force, and 
indeed, one of the many recommendations in the MacKay task force, 
was to give flexibility or give provisions in the bank 
legislation to allow for the progressive restructuring of the 
credit union system in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have met continually with the people from Credit Union 
Central, the credit unions out in B.C. and representatives of 
that group.  They have told us that they are prepared to 
restructure their operations so they can expand their service to 
Canadians, so that in the event there are bank mergers of 
domestic banks and there is a perception that competition is 
going to be tough, they want to fill that void.  In order for 
them to do that, they have to restructure their operations.  They 
want to be able to bring more branches in under an umbrella type 
of structure.  In order to do that, they need to have some 
flexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe I am correct when I say that the 10-50 rule applies to 
credit union structures now.  As I recall it, one can either have 
a 10% interest or a 50% interest only.  I am sure that the 
parliamentary secretary will tell me if I am on the wrong track 
here, but I believe that is the gist of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they want is to have flexibility on the participation 
between the umbrella group and the branches that would be 
operating under this new business structure.  I know the 
parliamentary secretary is warm to this proposal by the credit 
unions and by Credit Union Central. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment would in fact give the credit union parties 
looking for this change the flexibility to set up their new 
structure and the flexibility to fill the void in customer 
service at the ground floor consumer level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the secretary of state for banks and financial 
institutions knows about this desire on behalf of the credit 
unions.  I am of the opinion that the government has perhaps said 
to the credit union people who have been talking about this that 
it does not have a problem with this but that perhaps the credit 
unions should show the government how to do it.  The government 
has sought the advice of the people in the credit union 
structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment reflects a suggestion by the credit union people 
to the government on how they can be given that flexibility.  I 
will close here and just assume that the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Finance will see the wisdom of this amendment 
and ask his colleagues to say yea when it is called.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important thing for Quebec is to protect the largest 
bank in Quebec, the National Bank. This is a very important 
concern for our nation. This bank is the Quebec's largest bank, 
and Quebec businesses have their money there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will make the National Bank more vulnerable than the 
big Canadian banks, and that is unacceptable. This bill provides 
for a three tier system, as far as individual control of banks 
goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to explain once more something I have already 
talked about in the House, and I think I made myself clear at 
the time. 
Let me just go over the general concept to show the people who 
are watching, as well as you, Madam Speaker, what is going on in 
that system that we want to create and that seems acceptable to 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, for the big Canadian banks, the Royal Bank for 
example, voting shares that one shareholder can own increase 
from 10 to 20%. So, for banks with assets worth $5 billion or 
more, one shareholder could own 20% of the bank's shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is, however, and this is the case in Quebec, that 
small banks, those with assets worth less than $5 billion, the 
Minister of Finance is allowing one shareholder to own up to 65% 
of the bank's voting shares. This means that one shareholder 
could purchase 65% of the shares of the National Bank. 
That individual would control the assets of the Quebec people. 
It is incredible. Why is there such a difference? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is one shareholder allowed to own 20% of the Royal Bank's 
voting shares, but when it comes to the National Bank, a single 
shareholder, it could be a foreigner, if he has the money and holds 
65% of the bank's voting shares, could decide to transfer the 
bank's head office, lay people off, transfer the bank's assets, 
transfer Quebecers' money outside the country because he is a 
foreigner, and the whole company will be administered in a 
foreign country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, those are the people's concerns. What will happen? In fact, 
jobs will probably be lost, and it is unacceptable to think that 
only one individual can manage most of this financial 
institution's assets. That is why we are denouncing this 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there was a certain change while this bill was being 
studied.  Mr. Landry, now the Premier of Quebec, made demands 
that were incorporated in this bill.  However these demands are like 
guidelines on the reclassification of the banks that were 
included before in schedule 1, banks with equity capital of less 
than $5 billion, of which the National Bank is one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea was to include these guidelines in the bill, but they 
remained guidelines.  It is a small step, but not enough for us. 
We must really ensure that these guidelines are incorporated in 
the bill.  I would like to quote some of them: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All transactions involving a reclassification will be evaluated 
on the basis of merit. 
It will have to be shown that the operation will add to the 
bank's growth potential and that it will lead to better customer 
service. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guidelines also state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In determining whether a transaction involving a 
reclassification is in the public interest, the Minister of 
Finance shall take into consideration all the factors he 
considers relevant, including the security and solidity of the 
bank, the direct and indirect jobs, the location of the 
decision-making centre and the management of the bank, the needs 
of consumers, the bank's business and activities and the bank's 
prospects for the future in the context of world markets. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These elements, as they are not in the bill, may be amended by 
the minister as he sees fit.  This is a matter of concern for 
us. 
It is all very nice that these guidelines were accepted, but 
what bothers us is that they are not included in the bill. They 
may be respected or not, as the minister sees fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public as well as parliamentarians must put a great deal of 
trust in the minister right now, because he tells us is 
completely sincere.  However if a new minister comes along, because 
ministers do change, whose philosophy is different from that of 
the current minister who wants us to trust him, how could we be 
sure that what we ask this new minister with a different 
philosophy will be respected? It is very important that this be 
included in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This process has to become more transparent and it should not 
cause us any more problem. 
Right now, there is something of a sword of Damocles over the 
National Bank because everything is up to the minister and 
nothing is set out in the bill. If it were, we could always 
refer to the legislation to show what the intent was, but it is 
not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, we support the bill. We have worked very 
hard. My colleague from St-Hyacinthe—Bagot has even tabled a brief 
with the committee. He has put forward points that were included 
in the bill. However, we feel that we have been elected to 
protect the interests of Quebec consumers in our ridings. We are 
somewhat concerned right now, and when I say somewhat, I 
really mean to say that we are very concerned about the 
situation in which this bill puts the National Bank and the 
small banks with less than $5 billion in capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise the issue, but this is a concern not only for members of 
the Bloc Quebecois, but also for the directors of the National 
Bank. In view of this, the National Bank decided a few weeks ago 
to adopt a series of rules in order to prevent a hostile 
takeover at its expense. Looking for strategic partners, the 
president of the National Bank said that maintaining the head 
office in Montreal was simply not negotiable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shareholders passed two resolutions to protect the National 
Bank against a hostile bid. They agreed to drag things out so 
the directors would have more time to examine other bids. 
They also agreed to drop the limit on the number of common 
shares that could be issued by the bank. These measures clearly 
illustrated the concerns generated by the new environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, the Minister of Finance is giving himself the 
power to determine at his discretion, the future of 
Quebec's major banks. As I mentioned before, we find it 
unacceptable that this discretionary power has such sway, more 
even than the law itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In concluding, I would like to say once again that we will 
support this bill, but we would like the Minister of Finance to 
take into account the concerns of Quebecers and of the members 
of the Bloc Quebecois.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, before I deal with my three amendments I want to say 
publicly in the House that I support the position of the credit 
unions in terms of amending the legislation to make it easier for 
them to establish a national financial institution. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I moved a similar amendment in committee and it was turned down. 
We had the support of all four opposition parties: the Alliance, 
the Conservatives, the Bloc and me for the New Democrats.  We had 
a recorded vote in the committee.  Interestingly enough all the 
Liberals voted against the particular amendment asked for by Bill 
Knight, the CEO of Credit Union Central of Canada.  The credit 
union made its position very well known to the government, to the 
members of the committee and to the House of Commons.  It wants 
an equal and level playing field with the banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason it needs this kind of amendment is that there is a 
different culture in the credit union.  It is one of a 
co-operative where one entity does not own another entity, which 
is the case with other financial institutions.  In the credit 
union there is one member, one vote.  It is truly a democratic 
structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without an amendment to that effect it will make it very 
difficult for the credit unions to establish a national credit 
union system where people can go with their bank cards from one 
province to another and still do their financial transactions 
with the Credit Union Central of Canada.  I indicate our support 
for the amendment in that regard, which is part of this group as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have three specific amendments before the House today in this 
grouping.  One of them I referred to earlier in general in the 
last round of debate: the changing of the penalties for the 
Financial Consumer Agency of Canada.  Under the agency there will 
be all kinds of power, regulations and activities it can do, but 
when it comes to penalties, the maximum penalty for an individual 
who is in violation of the act is $50,000 and for a financial 
institution it is $100,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Financial institutions are very large.  Some of them have 
revenues in excess of $10 billion a year.  Some of our banks are 
extremely large.  I am suggesting in our amendment that we move 
the penalty for financial institutions from $100,000 to $500,000. 
The reason is that it makes the penalty more real, more 
meaningful for very large financial institutions than just a 
penalty of $100,000.  It is more in accordance with the size of 
their assets and the kinds of business they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our banks are doing very well.  If we look at their balance 
sheets and their retained earnings and profits in the last few 
years, we see that they have gone up in many ways in an 
astronomical sense.  I am thinking of Royal Bank, TD Bank, 
Scotiabank and Bank of Montreal, which is having a few more 
problems but is still doing very well.  All the big six banks are 
doing very well as we speak.  I think a penalty that is more a 
reflection of their size would be $500,000 rather than $100,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment I am proposing is found in Motion No. 10. 
It is to set up a no frill bank account and to have a charge for 
that of $3 a month.  I am very interested in hearing what the 
parliamentary secretary has to say about this point.  I am 
ashamed to say that I have moved what is almost a Liberal 
amendment today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the government white paper in June 1999 it said 
that there should be a no frills account established for 12 
transactions for a fee of $3 to $4 a month.  In the bill itself 
the government dropped the idea of having a no frill account for 
$3 a month.  What I am doing is moving a Liberal amendment, 
saying that there should be a no frill account and that the 
maximum charge should be $3 a month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we doing this?  We are doing this because many low 
income people have difficulty with the cost of bank transactions 
today.  In my riding of Regina—Qu'Appelle I represent most of 
the inner city in Regina.  The poverty rate is extremely high. 
Many people are on welfare.  Many are earning minimum wage.  Many 
are struggling to make ends meet and have difficulty with bank 
service charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some banks have on a voluntary basis been introducing special 
accounts with lower charges, but many people still find these 
charges to be very steep and very excessive.  We should have 
legislation which says that there should be a minimum number of 
charges for each and every Canadian, rich or poor, and that the 
maximum charge for such an account should be $3 a month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong with that?  Our banks are making a lot of money. 
Our banks are also making a lot of money on the poor people.  We 
do not have, as has the United States, a community reinvestment 
act that forces banks to invest a certain amount of money in the 
communities they take their money from. 
We do not have many of those kinds of regulations.  It is not 
onerous for a bank to be asked to establish a no frills account 
for low income people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my good friend from Souris—Moose Mountain, who 
represents the neighbouring riding to mine in southern 
Saskatchewan, certainly supports the idea as well.  He also has a 
number of low income people in his riding, a number of aboriginal 
people in his riding who would certainly be in support of 
establishing this kind of an account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It speaks to equality, to a more egalitarian society and to the 
common good.  It speaks to opening up financial institutions to 
every Canadian, regardless of the size of his or her pocketbook. 
It speaks to what parliament should speak to: improving the 
common good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very anxious to hear what the parliamentary secretary will 
say on behalf of the government about this issue.  I remind him 
once again that it is really a Liberal amendment.  It was taken 
out of the government's white paper of June 1999 when it 
suggested a no frills account to the tune of some $3 per month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third amendment in my name is in Motion No. 11 which 
provides for an amendment to the Bank Act to ensure that branches 
could only be closed for reasons of non-profitability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today banks will often close branches even though they are 
profitable, which leaves many communities without banking 
services.  What I am saying in this motion is that if a bank 
branch is profitable it should not be closed down.  If it is not 
profitable, then it should have the right to pull out of a 
particular community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had some interesting things happening on the prairies. 
In the last year the Bank of Montreal sold a number of its 
branches to credit unions in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta. 
I have a couple of examples in my own riding of 
Regina—Qu'Appelle where the credit union has taken over some 
branches from the Bank of Montreal.  The Bank of Montreal in this 
case has made an accommodation with the credit union movement to 
provide a very important service to a particular community.  I 
have seen in a couple of communities in my riding where people 
appreciate that the service is there.  They do not have to drive 
an extra 20 or 30 miles to another town to be provided with 
banking services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This again speaks to fairness and equality.  Coming from rural 
Canada, it probably speaks to the fact that rural Canadians 
should not be discriminated against in terms of banking services. 
If the banking service is profitable, if the branch has made 
money over the years by providing loans to farmers, to the small 
business community and to consumers in a small town, it should 
not be able to close down that branch.  We think that should be 
part of the legislation before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only rural Canada.  In parts of urban Canada, the 
parts of inner cities where there is a lot of poverty, often a 
branch will pull out even though it might be profitable but not 
as profitable as it might be in a wealthier suburb. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could go on at length in terms of what should be said here. 
However I refer interested members to a presentation that was 
made to our committee by the Public Interest Advocacy Centre when 
it spoke about the accountability of banks, branch closings, and 
the services that should be provided to Canadians and the 
community at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I commend these amendments to the House.  They are 
straightforward.  In particular, I look forward to the response 
from the parliamentary secretary when he talks about the $3 a 
month bank account for consumers.  I am also interested in seeing 
what his reactions are to the suggestion of making amendments for 
the credit union movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not seen his briefing notes, but he will say that the 
government will try to accommodate credit unions through 
regulation.  In other words, he is asking us to trust him, trust 
the government, trust the minister and trust the bureaucrats. 
Even the minister responsible for sport will be cynical about 
some of that.  The parliamentary secretary will say that they 
will bring in the proper regulations so that the credit unions 
will be on a level playing field with the banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The credit union movement is saying that is not good enough. The 
Credit Union Central of Canada has said that.  Various centrals 
across the country, such as the Van City Credit Union in British 
Columbia, have also said that.  They want an amendment to the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not do that in this House, I predict they will go to 
the other house and lobby senators to make the change.  It will 
be sent back to the House of Commons and we will be debating this 
piece of legislation and amendment in a few weeks' time.

<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to go back to the comments made by the hon. member 
for Drummond on the importance of the whole issue of the 
classification of banks and the degree of ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of those who are listening, I should point out 
that the new bill on financial institutions establishes three 
categories of banks: major banks, that is those with equity of 
$5 billion or more; medium size banks, that is those with equity 
of $1 billion to $5 billion; and small banks, that is those with 
equity of less than $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For each of these categories, the degree of ownership is 
different. For example, in the case of major Canadian banks, 
such as the Royal Bank, an individual cannot hold more than 20% 
of the voting shares, while 80% of the shares must be widely 
distributed among the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has a major impact on medium size banks, such as the 
National Bank in Quebec. For these banks, including the National 
Bank, the new degree of ownership is 65:35. In other words, a 
single individual can own up to 65% of the voting shares and 
thus have full control over the National Bank, while the other 
35% must be widely distributed among the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new provision leads us to fear the worst in Quebec.  This 
bill discriminates somewhat against the National Bank, the 
largest in Quebec, because the treatment of the Royal Bank, the 
largest in Canada, where one individual is allowed to own a 
maximum of 20% of voting shares, and the National Bank, where 
one individual may own up to 65% of voting shares, creates 
discrimination which is unjustified under the circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that the purpose was to improve the National Bank's 
funding flexibility.  I have often asked the Minister of Finance 
why one individual holding 65% of National Bank shares confers 
more flexibility than 65 individuals with 1% each.  I have never 
had an answer. 
These new provisions are cause for alarm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I read comments by economists to the effect that this 
is no big deal,  because the National Bank's equity is 
increasing by leaps and bounds anyway, and soon will be in 
excess of $5 billion.  Such an analysis is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certain that the bill states that the banks can be 
reclassified.  This means that, should the National Bank one day 
have over $5 billion in equity, it could be classified as a 
major bank and therefore the voting share split would be 20%:80%. 
In other words, with this bill a single individual could own 20% 
of voting shares and the other 80% of voting shares would be 
public, rather than the present 65%-35% split. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point on which I disagree with the economic experts is that, 
under this bill, which must be read carefully, the Minister of 
Finance has three years to change the bank's classification. 
That time limit can be extended as he sees fit. In other words, 
even if the National Bank attains the $5 billion equity ceiling, 
the Minister of Finance could decide to wait three years before 
reclassifying it as a major bank subject to the 20%:80% split of 
individual and public voting shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only may he wait three years before recategorizing it, but 
he has the authority to extend this period.  In other words, 
even with equity of $5 billion and more, the National Bank would 
not automatically be recategorized as a major bank and would 
therefore still be in the 65:35 category, that is 65% of shares held 
by one person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a danger in this.  Not only is the National Bank the 
biggest bank in Quebec, but it is also the bank that finances 
SMBs.  As well, Quebec is proud to have such a large bank, 
which, through the contribution of people like Mr. Bérard, has 
grown at record speed to become the flagship it is today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concern about this is so great that even Mr. Landry, former 
finance minister and deputy premier, and now premier, of Quebec, 
wrote to the federal Minister of Finance last June 2 to suggest 
a number of public interest criteria for evaluating any banking 
operation involving a mid-sized bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my great surprise, just before the election, the Secretary of 
State for International Financial Institutions had even agreed 
to these criteria being part of the banking bill. 
He had even signed beside the four criteria suggested by 
Mr. Landry, saying “Yes, provided that it is not only for Quebec, 
we can Canadianize—as it were—these criteria, and make them 
part of the bill”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few days later, the secretary of state changed his 
mind.  I do not know why, but after putting his signature on 
this document, he changed his mind and subsequently refused to 
include these evaluation criteria in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no substantive difference between Bill C-38 as it was 
before the election and Bill C-8 today. When the Minister of 
Finance and the secretary of state released the new Bill C-8, 
they also issued press releases and attachments, one of which 
concerned the evaluation criteria for operations involving 
mid-sized banks, such as the National Bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On reading these criteria, we realized that the government had 
understood the message on additional criteria.  We were 
satisfied with that, but only half satisfied.  What we called 
for, and this is the heart of the amendment, it is the essence of 
the amendment we are proposing this morning, is that these 
criteria, which parallel the bill and are to be used as 
guidelines by the Minister of Finance in making a decision 
regarding the shares in a medium size bank, such as the National 
Bank, must not be left to one side and left out of the decision 
making process, but incorporated in the heart of the Bank Act, 
to ensure reference is made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, we are not telling the government to reject all 
transactions involving the National Bank.  That is not the 
intent.  We want to ensure additional security, additional 
criteria leading to the best possible decisions benefiting 
Quebec's economy and finances and the financial sectors of 
Quebec and Canada too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not asking the government to be obtuse or to reject every 
proposal.  We would be the first to criticize this sort of 
attitude, because we want our financial and banking institutions 
to move ahead and to take their place in the world, the National 
Bank and others too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, it is with an open mind that we are proposing these 
amendments and we hope that the government will accept them. I 
would say, and this is evidenced by all the representations that 
we have made, that since the beginning of the process, the McKay 
study, the white paper and the bill before us, the Bloc 
Quebecois has always looked positively at the reform of the 
financial institutions act, particularly since it is three or 
four years late. The delay is getting longer by the week, 
considering how quickly the financial sector is changing in 
Quebec, in Canada and in the rest of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope this bill will be quickly passed. However, would it 
be possible for the government to show some openness for once? 
We are not asking much; we are not asking for a complete 
overhaul of the bill. 
We are simply asking the government to reassure Quebecers who 
are concerned about the new provisions that specifically apply 
to the National Bank. They hope that this new reform of 
financial institutions will have a positive impact on the 
financial sector and will not raise concerns about takeovers 
that would be detrimental, particularly to the interests of 
small and medium sized businesses in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government which, through its secretary of state, has 
already agreed to the four conditions, the four criteria 
proposed by Mr. Landry in June, to include these criteria in the 
core of Bill. It recently tabled a document, along with Bill 
C-8, that includes these criteria, albeit in a different format, 
but it includes them nevertheless.

</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I am asking the government to simply show some openness by 
taking that document and including it directly in the core of 
the bill. If it does that, the Bloc Quebecois will support the 
bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise to speak on these specific amendments 
in Group No. 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, with regard to Motion No. 2 and the stiffer penalties for 
violations of the rules relative to consumer protection, while I 
understand the hon. member's notion of making the punishment even 
more onerous, the fact is that the legislation would give a 
greater amount of intrusion and regulation of the financial 
services sector than any other sector or industry in Canada.  I 
understand the hon. member's philosophical foundation for the 
amendment but I disagree fundamentally with his intention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Motion No. 9, I generally agree with the notion that we need 
to improve and increase levels of flexibility for the Canadian 
financial services sector players which include the banks, credit 
unions et cetera.  The greater level of flexibility in ownership 
rules for small banks makes a great deal of sense if we are 
serious about increased levels of competition.  I would not agree 
with Motion No. 9 in general because I think it is contrary to 
the principles of the MacKay report and to the general direction 
that I believe is sound in terms of moving toward greater levels 
of flexibility in the financial services sector to increase the 
level of competition and ultimately services to consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 10 is very well placed.  While I may disagree with 
it, it is important that the hon. member presented it.  It points 
out the hypocrisy on the part of the Liberals.  It was Liberal 
policy to have a $3 basic account.  Now the Liberals are lining 
up opposed to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we prepared to have these kinds of rules for every industry? 
For instance there is the food distribution business.  Clearly 
food is a necessity since we cannot live without food and we also 
cannot live without shelter, unless we were to pass laws that 
would require grocery stores and distribution companies or real 
estate developers to provide a basic level of service to people 
at very low levels of cost or perhaps even free.  It is incorrect 
and not logical for us to impose these same levels of onerous 
restrictions and over regulation on the financial services 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I disagree with some elements of the legislation, they are 
the parts that would lead to a greater level of intrusion and 
over regulation of the financial services sector than any other 
industry in Canada.  The motion in some ways would make it even 
worse, more onerous and unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably it is good politics to present motions that are 
anti-bank but it may also be very bad public policy if in fact 
our interests are consistent with the long term interests of 
Canadians.  In general, greater levels of regulation can also 
lead to greater levels of cost of compliance and ultimately 
higher levels of services charges for consumers and/or lower 
returns for bank shareholders.  The bank shareholders include 
about seven million Canadians indirectly or directly who are 
counting on their long term returns from their investments, 
particularly for retirement income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 11 deals with prohibition of bank closures for any 
reasons but non-profitability.  It is very intrusive and 
difficult to determine. 
Frankly this gets into issues of bookkeeping and cost allocation. 
It would be almost impossible to implement the principle of the 
motion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1145"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, there is a greater level of transparency and there is a 
process put in place for branch closures in the legislation which 
goes quite a long way further than we have seen in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do agree with the hon. member in terms of the notion that the 
credit unions should be engaged more actively when there are 
going to be branch closures in order to ensure that every 
possible avenue has been identified and pursued to ensure 
continued services to communities, particularly smaller 
communities.  I think the Bank of Montreal and the credit union 
movement have created a very positive example of how that level 
of co-operation can benefit consumers and citizens in smaller 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it was about a year ago when a number of Bank of 
Montreal branches closed in the western provinces, but instead of 
waiting for public backlash the Bank of Montreal pre-emptively 
negotiated with and announced a deal with the credit unions, 
which resulted in only a minimal disruption of services to 
consumers in those communities.  I support that kind of 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of Motion No. 14, again I am supportive.  It is 
consistent with the underpinnings of the co-operative movement, 
the credit union movement and the distinct democratic culture of 
the credit union and co-operative movements.  If we are serious 
about enabling the credit unions to compete more effectively with 
banks, the amendment in fact makes a great deal of sense, because 
it enables them to compete and at the same time remain consistent 
with the democratic underpinnings of their movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, I think this is a positive amendment and it is 
regrettable that the government does not support it.  On the one 
hand the government is saying it wants to create greater levels 
of competition from the credit union movement, and on the other 
hand it is not providing the legislative vehicle through which to 
ensure that the credit union movement can also take advantage of 
this greater level of competition.  I support Motion No. 14. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I thank you for recognizing me at this time, which 
actually accomplishes a couple of goals.  First, since I have had 
to stand five or six times to be recognized, I have been afforded 
needed exercise.  Second, I appreciate being able to speak before 
the parliamentary secretary on this particular grouping because I 
can hopefully change his mind since I think he may have 
considerable influence on the way the votes are conducted on the 
other side.  At least I would hope he has, although I sometimes 
even wonder about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me address the issues that are before us in this group of 
amendments.  I will begin, of course, with the matter of the 
penalty that is proposed to be amended by the member from the 
Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He proposes that the maximum penalty be changed.  In order to 
see how the clause reads now, I need to haul out this book, the 
bill we are amending, Bill C-8.  It says the maximum penalty for 
a violation is $50,000 in the case of a violation that is 
committed by a natural person and $100,000 in the case of a 
violation that is committed by a financial institution.  That is 
for breaches of the act and of the regulations made by the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to draw attention to the fact that this states the 
maximum penalty, so I think arguments could be made in favour of 
this particular amendment.  The maximum penalty right now is 
$100,000 and the amendment says it should be a maximum of 
$500,000.  This does not mean it is going to be applied. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT23"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT23"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1150

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, if we read the next section, which is not 
referenced in this amendment, it states that in assessing the 
penalty these are some of the issues which are to be taken into 
account:  the degree of intention or negligence on the part of 
the person committing the violation; the harm done; the history 
with respect to previous convictions or violations; and any other 
criteria that may be prescribed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In assessing a penalty for a violation, I am sure that a large 
bank, a huge financial institution, would, under that 
prescription, be given a larger penalty than a small credit union 
somewhere, depending on the severity of the violation.  Yet at 
the same time, I am somewhat inclined to have a substantial 
penalty when a large business just will not comply.  That could 
happen.  I cannot imagine under what circumstances, but it could 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think, for example, of a large but unnamed mall in Edmonton. 
When it first started in business we had the Lord's Day Act in 
place in Alberta, which meant that some days were available to 
families to spend together because basically all of the stores 
were closed and just essential services were provided. It was a 
wonderful time, actually, when I look back at it, when we could 
get together with our families.  We had freedom.  People were not 
obliged to go to work.  It was the same day for everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then that particular mall said that if it were to be fined 
$10,000 a day every time it was open on Sunday that was a fair 
and reasonable cost of doing business.  It just paid the fine and 
broke the law with impunity.  There was no provision under the 
law to escalate the penalty; it was just a straight $10,000 a 
day.  The mall gladly paid the fine and made a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I believe that is where the erosion started.  Then 
it went right across the country, so that working people now no 
longer have a day off each week that applies to all family 
members.  Very seldom do we see a family being able to get 
together.  Either mom has to work or dad has to work or one of 
the kids who has a job at the store has to work.  They cannot be 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an example of a penalty so small that the business was 
not compelled at all to obey the law.  In that sense, I have a 
bit of a tendency to be in favour of just increasing the maximum. 
It would not necessarily be applied, but this amendment would put 
some teeth into this for those who were in blatant violation and 
who continued to be so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must hurry because I have spent too much time on that 
particular provision.  The next motion is Motion No. 9.  That has 
to do with the application of a problem specific to Quebec at 
this time but which could happen in other provinces as well.  In 
order to preserve my time, let me simply say that I have an 
inclination to agree with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 10 has to do with the provision that the banks should 
provide for a low cost account.  I do not really believe that we 
should have this in legislation or in law, although I agree with 
the principle of it.  I would much rather see the banks provide 
these necessary low cost accounts and advertise that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a bank were to have an ad in the paper that said there were a 
number of people in our society from whom they just did not make 
a great deal of money but for whom they felt obliged to provide a 
banking service at a low cost, I think the bank would get a lot 
of public relations benefit simply by advertising that and 
providing a service.  The bank could ask small businessmen in 
towns and cities or wherever to support its business with their 
business.  I think it would benefit the bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the principle that a person of limited financial 
means should have the ability to go into a bank and cash a cheque 
and to have a low cost bank account.  That is definitely a 
principle I agree with.  As I said, the only reason I would vote 
against this is that I think would be overkill.  I also do not 
agree with putting in a fixed amount, because maybe the bank 
could do it for less.  Maybe of necessity it has to be $4 and a 
bank would be in violation if we ensconced $3 in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am opposed to this particular motion on the basis that it is 
too specific, and I think the same goals, which I agree with, can 
be achieved by other means.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I turn now to Motion No. 11, also put forward by the NDP member, 
which proposes that the closing of the branches of a bank “can 
only take place for reasons of financial non-profitability.”  I 
hate to say it, but this is a dreadful amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is a huge imposition on business operations.  It is 
like telling farmers they could plant only a certain kind of crop 
and the only reason they could ever quit planting would be if 
they were not making money on it; otherwise, they would have to 
plant that crop.  I disagree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the banks should have a certain degree of flexibility 
to open and to close branches based on an efficient way of 
providing services in the community.  For example, let us say 
that there is a branch over here and there is a branch over 
there.  With modern transportation it is now much easier for 
people to get around, so if the banks decided to have one branch 
operating in the middle instead of having two branches operating, 
it would mean the closure of two branches.  Neither of them might 
be losing money, but the bank could be more efficient and provide 
a better service for less cost, including services for low income 
people.  I do not think we should stand in the way of this.  In 
this particular instance, I would simply say that I would be 
really hard pressed to support Motion No. 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last motion is the one on the credit unions, proposed by the 
member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley.  I propose that we 
heartily support it.  This is where I want to get the ear of the 
parliamentary secretary over there and have him influence all of 
his Liberal colleagues to vote in favour of this very fine 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to believe in the credit union movement.  My dad was a 
leader in the credit union in Saskatchewan for many years.  He 
was on the board, on the finance committee and on the loans 
committee.  He did all sorts of things.  As a result of having 
grown up in that kind of an atmosphere, I guess, I am sort of 
inclined toward credit unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years I have given some business to the banks for 
different reasons, but I have found that in a competitive market 
my dealings with the credit unions have been most satisfactory. I 
do not hesitate at all to give a little bit of free advertising 
to them here today.  They can use this clip if they want to.  I 
give them permission.  I do not know whether the rules of the 
House of Commons permit that, but I certainly support the credit 
union movement and this amendment strengthens it.  The reason we 
should favour this amendment is that one of the best things for 
the Canadian financial services industry is to have good 
competition, where we can say to our financial institutions 
“Treat me like that and I am out of here”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to run out of time here, but I remember when I had a 
bank loan for purchasing a car.  I asked the bank whether I could 
pay the loan off more quickly.  The bank said that I could but I 
would have to pay a penalty.  Members would not believe it, but 
the total payment the bank wanted in order to have me pay off 
that loan early was greater than the sum of the remaining 
payments.  I said to the bank that either it was nuts or it 
thought I was.  I was not willing to comply with that.  I just 
finished off my payments and said that if that was how the bank 
did business I would look elsewhere.  Sure enough, soon I found 
another financial institution that pleased me more and I just 
moved my business to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the very best thing we can do:  provide competition. 
Credit unions are one of the primary ways of holding the banks 
responsible and giving them some real competition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, what I propose to do is deal 
with the motions in the following order:  Motion No. 14 from the 
member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley; then those from the 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, the Bloc amendments; and then 
finally the amendments from the NDP member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dealing first with Motion No. 14, of course the members on this 
side of the House do not need convincing about the importance of 
the credit union movement and the kind of expanded and enhanced 
role we would like to see them play in the Canadian economy by 
providing consumers with more choice and by providing more 
competition.  That is a given.  The Secretary of State for 
International Financial Institutions, when he spoke at committee, 
gave the undertaking that the government would work with the 
credit union movement to try to enhance its role in the Canadian 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to this particular motion, which was actually put 
forward by the NDP at committee, I would just like to mention 
that the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle seems to argue that the 
legislation does not provide equal treatment to credit unions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The credit union movement, when it came to the committee, was 
looking for preferential treatment.  We cannot accept having 
treatment for the credit union movement that would be 
preferential to the treatment we have for other financial 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on this side are not the only ones to work actively with 
the credit union movement.  The Department of Finance has worked 
closely with it in developing Bill C-8.  The resulting 
legislation responds to the need of credit unions for greater 
structural flexibility as they move to restructure their 
operations and become more integrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However with this new flexibility come prudential concerns 
resulting from a whole new set of ownership possibilities, most 
of them unknown at this point.  Because the landscape is changing 
so quickly we must be concerned about the potential for 
prudential risks.  The control requirement is necessary to 
safeguard against such risks and is designed to ensure the parent 
company has the power to intervene in situations where a 
subsidiary might get into financial trouble.  These same 
provisions apply to other financial institutions such as large 
banks and insurance companies that are also widely held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the broader risks associated with this new flexibility it 
is more prudent, in the government's view, to establish a general 
safety net or prohibition and to provide the regulatory 
flexibility to make exceptions as necessary.  This is a common 
use of existing regulatory authorities.  If unforeseen 
circumstances arise, a general prohibition allows us to err on 
the side of caution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The change made to proposed subclause 396(a) at committee would 
broaden the scope of the regulation making authority and provide 
further comfort to the Credit Union Central Canada, CUCC, that 
the government had all the flexibility it needed to provide 
exceptions from the control requirements as necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Finance is already engaged in an extensive 
drafting exercise to prepare the regulations stemming from Bill 
C-8.  It has had early discussions with the CUCC on the 
possibility of drafting a regulation that would provide the 
required flexibility.  Once approved, the regulations would have 
the same effect as legislation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now want to speak to Motion No. 9 by the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. This motion deals with the matters the 
minister might take into account in determining whether or not 
to approve acquisition of a significant interest in a bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The matters to be taken into account under proposed paragraph 
(<I>i</I>) of the motion are contemplated in paragraph (<I>f</I>) on the 
conduct of businesses and operations of applicants. 
Consequently, the minister shall have the legislative authority 
to take into account the matters outlined under paragraph (<I>i</I>). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since there is no need to amend the legislation to allow the 
minister to take these matters into account, it was determined 
for reasons of clarity and transparency to have these matters 
set out in the guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guidelines indicate the government's commitment to take 
these matters into account in category changes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will clarify a point made by the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot.  In his speech he seemed to imply that a 
bank with assets of over $5 billion may not be subject to the 
widely held rule.  Bill C-8 states that banks with assets over $5 
billion would automatically be subject to the widely held rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have other motions before us from the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle, the NDP finance critic, and I will now refer 
to them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move to Motion No. 10, which deals with low cost 
accounts.  The member for Regina—Qu'Appelle and others spoke 
about how the government and the Liberal Party have talked about 
the need for low cost accounts.  The amendment from the NDP would 
amend the definition of low fee retail deposit accounts in clause 
439(1) to specify that such accounts shall cost $3.  The members 
opposite seem to be implying that we do not have a commitment to 
low cost accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 in fact establishes the low cost account and that is 
exactly what the Liberal government has advocated for some time. 
Rather than reneging on our promise, the bill delivers on that 
promise.  As members are aware, the Department of Finance has 
successfully negotiated low cost account memoranda of 
understanding with each of the major banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The views of consumer groups on the desired features of the low 
cost account were sought prior to negotiating the arrangements. 
Taking those views into account, the accounts adhere to certain 
standards, including a maximum monthly fee of $4 and the 
availability of some in branch transactions.  Providing banks 
some flexibility in pricing and designing the accounts ensures 
consumers greater choice in obtaining low cost accounts that best 
meet their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 11 from the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle deals with 
branch closures.  I will comment on that briefly.  Our proposed 
reforms are intended to encourage financial institutions to be 
more responsive to the public without unduly interfering in the 
day to day business decisions of banks.  Some members opposite 
have clearly pointed out that the motion presented by the member 
for Regina—Qu'Appelle is intrusive into the day to day decision 
making of banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Issues such as branch operating hours and closures are a matter 
for individual banks and the marketplace to decide.  That being 
said, we believe consumers should receive adequate notice of 
branch closures to facilitate adjustment to the closures.  Under 
our new policy framework, should a financial institution choose 
to close a branch it would be required to provide at least four 
months' notice.  If the branch is the last one in a rural 
community, six months' notice would be required.  The notice 
period would give the community an opportunity to discuss 
alternatives with the institution or to approach other financial 
institutions that could perhaps fill the gap.  That deals with 
the motions in Group No. 2.

shall be to ensure that the board of directors assesses the

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Madam Speaker, basically, these amendments have three 
purposes.  The first is to give more power to shareholders of 
financial institutions. Earlier, we spoke about the special 
ownership structure of the Canadian financial sector and that is 
precisely the idea of the first motion. We said, for example, 
that for large banks 20% of the shares can be held by a single 
shareholder and that 80 % of voting shares would be widely 
distributed in the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effects of such a distribution can be negative since small 
shareholders have very little to say, particularly during annual 
meetings of the large Canadian banks, and the bill is designed 
to strengthen the powers of those small shareholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We add our voice to that of the Association de protection des 
épargnants et des investisseurs du Québec, the APEIQ.  We want 
to give our support to its campaign for more democracy at annual 
meetings of banks, as well as in the way the boards of directors 
of financial institutions operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this point, in our first group of amendments, we say that 
shareholders, no matter how small, have a right to be heard and 
to participate in any decision made by the financial 
institutions. To do so, they must receive prompt and timely 
notice of a general meeting. 
They must have all the documents relevant to this meeting and 
they must also be allowed to be heard, not just on matters 
having to do with the profitability of the financial 
institution, but also on any other matter which directly or 
indirectly affects the activities of the institution per se. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  Right now, it is not possible for 
shareholders at a general meeting to raise matters having to do 
with the social aspects of a company's activities.  Nor may they 
raise political issues.  For instance, they could not ask 
questions about the activities of a company in which they were a 
small shareholder in countries where democracy was not the rule 
and where fundamental rights were not respected.  It is not 
possible at a general meeting to table resolutions along these 
lines or even to question the board of directors. 
It is time that this changed.  It is now 2001 and the democratic 
system in use at the general meetings of major financial 
institutions is completely archaic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also other motions, one of which was to avoid any 
possibility of conflict of interest.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person cannot sit on the board of a major bank and also 
provide that bank with goods and services.  This would make him 
or her both judge and party to the action when it came time to 
make decisions relating to the financial institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, someone cannot be a member of the board of a bank 
and a shareholder in a company of external auditors, for 
instance, hired by the bank to audit its financial statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are proposing then is to ensure that there are new 
provisions which would, for example, call for questions to be 
asked and for it not to be acceptable for a board member to be 
directly or indirectly involved in providing the institution 
with products and services.  Nor would it be allowed for a board 
member of one financial institution to also sit on the board of 
another.  This could lead to problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the gist of what we are proposing.  It is also the 
position of the Association de protection des épargnants et des 
investisseurs du Québec, APEIQ, which we totally endorse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our hope that, in the spirit of greater democratization 
and transparency of the activities of the financial 
institutions, the government will support such proposals, along 
with the members of the other opposition parties.  They cannot 
help but improve things from the point of view of equity, small 
shareholder participation, democratization and, above all, 
transparency of the activities of these major financial 
institutions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>After parliament has completed consideration of Bill S-11, the

part in the amendment of the Canada Business Corporations Act to 
express their views on the appropriateness of making similar 
amendments to corporation governance provisions that apply to

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bank ownership is widely spread in Canada and it is so intended 
in order to limit a big shareholder's capacity to control one or 
more financial institutions while these are considered to be 
public services. Unfortunately, this widespread shareholding has 
had a perverse effect—

</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, “a perverse effect”, 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—by leaving way too much influence in the hands of the directors

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports the recommendations made by the 
Association de la protection des épargnants et investisseurs du 
Québec, and that is why we brought forward the motions read 
earlier. 
We have moved many more in support of the association, but they 
were rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The association has made numerous representations to the federal 
government, to the McKay Commission in 1997, to the Standing 
Senate Committee on Banking in 1998 and to the House Standing 
Committee on Finance in November 1998. Despite these many 
meetings, Bill C-38 and Bill C-8 did not take any of the 
association's recommendations into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the most part, these recommendations refer to the 
recommendations made by the association. I would like to quote 
some of these recommendations if I have enough time, but I know 
that time flies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First there is the restriction on the number of boards a 
director is allowed to sit on at any one time. Our proposal 
dealt with the restriction on the number of boards a director 
would be allowed to sit on at any one time. What exists now is the old

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Saskatoon—Humboldt 
requested the unanimous consent of the House on some report and 
it was given. We are therefore resuming debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> As I said, our proposal dealt with limiting 
the number of boards on which a director can sit at the same 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were saying that, right now, what exists is the old boys' 
club rule where “I appoint you, you appoint me and we appoint 
one another”, which makes boards of directors increasingly less 
efficient and less representative of shareholders. We believe 
that the number of boards of directors on which a person is 
allowed to sit should be very limited, because one needs time 
and a minimum of dedication to do a good job. The bill 
completely ignores those recommendations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there is the elimination of potential conflicts of 
interests between board members and those who provide goods and 
services to the institution. Our proposal dealt with the 
elimination of potential conflicts of interests between board 
members and service providers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 contains no provision to that effect, except the general 
provision on very general conflicts of interests. 
As we know, in the United States and even in Canada, there has 
been some success in getting shareholders meetings to pass, 
often against the will and recommendations of bank managers and 
other corporate directors, resolutions making it a requirement 
to disclose at least the fees paid to external auditors for 
audit services, on the one hand, and general consulting 
services, on the other hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a consultant who is paid $1 million to audit 
records, while at the same time being paid $10 million for 
various consulting services could presumably have some 
difficulty presenting a critical internal audit report. Everyone 
understands that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, there is the requirement to submit financial statements 
for review and discussion during the annual shareholders' 
meeting. 
That proposal seeks to clarify the legislation so that the agenda 
of the yearly shareholders' meetings include the item 
“consideration of financial statements and auditor's report”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, according to the <I>Canadian Oxford Dictionary</I>, 
the word consideration means more than just tabling, but 
the act of considering and careful thought means not just tabling, 
but giving careful thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the financial statements are the main report of the agents 
on their management of the corporation, consideration and 
discussion of that document is a basic right of the principal 
shareholders, even those of banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the presentation of the officers' remuneration 
policy to the shareholders' approval. With respect to banks, 
which are essentially public service companies operating in a 
very protected environment compared to other companies in the 
private sector, we find the remunerationpaid to officers 
literally outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we know the process through which they receive very 
positive recommendations about remuneration systems providing 
they are paid this or that amount. Nevertheless, the end 
result is that the officers of these institutions are not 
necessarily paid a basic salary, but aggregate remuneration with 
a very generous option plan, and that is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the adoption of a code of procedure respecting the 
conduct of shareholders' meetings, the purpose of this proposal 
is to facilitate active and effective shareholder participation 
in meetings and to protect them from the arbitrary decisions of 
presiding officers who are anxious to cut short shareholders' 
remarks. Our suggestion is that each corporation prepare a code 
of procedure respecting the conduct of these meetings and that 
this procedure be adopted at an annual meeting of shareholders 
within a reasonable timeframe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some banks, and more particularly the Laurentian Bank, have 
voluntarily adopted such a code, but it is not a requirement of 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corporations should also be required to prepare a comprehensive 
report on all shareholders' meetings and send it to all 
shareholders. Our recommendation is that corporations be 
required to do so. Some of them already do, but there is no 
requirement to that effect in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another suggestion is to reduce the barriers that prevent 
shareholders from making proposals before and during 
shareholders' meetings. This suggestion is being made generally 
rather than by the board or the management of banks exclusively. 
At this time, a shareholder must hold 5% of the shares of a 
financial institution or public corporation or have control to 
be entitled to present candidates as directors on the board.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do members know how much 5% of the Royal Bank shares represents? 
It represents $900 million. I do not think any members has 
that much money or has the proposed control of a bank to be 
able to present candidates. I do not know too many people with 
that kind of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Paul Martin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Of course. Access should be given to all 
bona fide shareholders: most shares are held in trust by 
brokers, and these intermediaries are the registered 
shareholders. 
Only these intermediaries hold the list of actual shareholders, 
so the corporation does not know who these shareholders are and 
cannot communicate directly with non registered shareholders. 
This would ease communication between the corporation and its 
shareholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position of chairman should be separate from the position of 
chief executive officer. We are also proposing a reduction of 
barriers to the shareholders' right to submit proposals for and 
during shareholders' meetings. Thus, we recommend a reduction of 
barriers to the shareholders' right to submit proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time, the act and the bill provide that the 
bank's management may refuse a shareholder's proposal that is 
primarily for the purpose of promoting general economic, 
political, racial, religious, social or similar causes. 
It may essentially refuse almost anything and it is only public 
pressure, so to speak, that forces banks to accept shareholders' 
proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our proposal also deals with branch closures. We are told that 
banks will now be able to proceed with branch closures. We would 
like this to be very transparent. People, especially those 
living in rural and isolated areas where there are less 
services will be given a six month notice. How lucky; a six 
month notice to warn them that their bank will be closed. And 
who cares about where they will get the same services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in the bill on this. There is only the 
minister who is convinced that his bill will help ordinary 
people, small investors and small savers. I hope these flaws 
will be corrected in the bill before it is passed.

<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert Thibault (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved 
that Bill C-22, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, the Income 
Tax Application Rules, certain acts related to the Income Tax 
Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Customs Act, the Excise Tax 
Act, the Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act and 
another act related to the Excise Tax Act, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK85"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to 
present Bill C-22, the Income Tax Amendments Act, 2000 for second 
reading today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the bill amends several sections of the Income Tax Act, 
more important, it implements key elements of the government's 
five year tax reduction plan which was introduced last year. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Briefly, this plan will provide $100 billion in tax relief by 
2004-05, thereby reducing the federal personal income tax paid by 
Canadians by 21% on average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Families with children will receive an even larger tax 
cut—about 27% on average. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also includes many additional measures, including 
technical amendments that were introduced in Bill C-43 last fall 
but which died on the order paper when the election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of these amendments are relieving in nature.  Some correct 
technical deficiencies in the act while others lighten the 
administration of the tax system.  Whatever the changes, one 
thing is certain, each is based on the principles of fairness and 
equity in the federal tax system to which our government has been 
committed since coming to office in 1993. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once we eliminated the deficit in 1997-98, we began to cut 
taxes for all Canadians.  The bill before us today is the biggest 
step forward in our tax cutting efforts to date and is based on 
four key principles. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, our approach to tax reduction must be fair starting with 
those who need relief most, middle and low income earners, and 
especially families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we will focus initially on personal income taxes since 
that is where we are most out of line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we will ensure that Canada has an internationally 
competitive business tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, we will not finance tax relief with borrowed money 
because that means an inevitable return to higher taxes in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the government, fiscal responsibility is fundamental and tax 
cuts are essential.  At the same time, it is essential that an 
effective, fair and technically valid tax system be maintained, 
which is the thrust of the legislation before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now discuss the main measures in the bill beginning with 
some of the personal income tax changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 the government promised Canadians that it would set out 
a multi-year plan for further tax reductions.  The 2000 budget 
delivered on that commitment by making the most important 
structural changes to the Canadian tax system in more than a 
decade with a special emphasis on the needs of families with 
children.  The bill provides for tax rate reductions at all 
income levels as of January 1, 2001. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The low and middle income tax rates fall to 16% and 22% 
respectively.  The top 29% rate is reduced to 26% on incomes 
between about $61,000 and $100,000, which means that the 29% rate 
applies only to income over $100,000. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While tax burdens will fall for all Canadians, the decline will 
be felt substantially by middle income earners.  In addition, the 
bill would eliminate the 5% deficit reduction surtax as of 
January 1, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One component of the five year tax reduction plan must be in 
place by July 1 of this year because it benefits Canadian 
children.  I am referring to the increased support for families 
with children through the Canada child tax benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, the Canada child tax benefit is a key 
element of federal assistance to families.  It is an income based 
benefit with two components: the Canada child tax benefit base 
benefit for low and middle income families and the national child 
benefit supplement for low income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maximum Canada child tax benefit for the first child will 
rise to $2,372 in July 2001, well on the way to the five year 
goal of $2,500 by the year 2004.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the second child, the maximum Canada child tax benefit will 
increase to $2,308 in July 2004.  Together with increases 
announced in previous budgets, annual Canada child tax benefits 
will exceed $9 billion a year in the year 2004, of which low 
income families will receive about $6 billion and middle income 
families about $3 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill contains other personal income tax changes that are 
specifically designed to help those who need it most. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the amount on which the disability tax credit, the 
DTC, is based is increasing from $4,293 to $6,000 effective 
2001.  This tax relief will increase over time, as the DTC is 
fully indexed to inflation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list of relatives to whom the disability tax credit can be 
transferred has expanded to make it consistent with the medical 
expense tax credit rules.  In addition, speech language 
pathologists will now be able to certify eligibility for the 
disability tax credit with respect to speech impairments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another measure increases the maximum annual amount that can be 
deducted for child care expenses to $10,000 from $7,000 for each 
eligible child for whom the disability tax credit can be claimed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amounts on which the caregiver tax credit and the infirm 
dependant credit are calculated are both going up to $3,500. 
With full indexation, this tax relief will continue to increase 
over time. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, individuals with certain mobility impairments may 
qualify under the medical expense tax credit for renovation 
costs that enable them to gain access to, or be mobile or 
functional within, their home.  Bill C-22 includes reasonable 
incremental costs relating to the construction of a principal 
residence to help these individuals. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To provide additional assistance to students, the annual 
exemption for scholarships, fellowships and bursaries received in 
conjunction with programs for which the education tax credit may 
be claimed increases to $3,000, up from $500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to mention that self-employed individuals will now 
be able to deduct one-half of their Canada pension plan or Quebec 
pension plan contributions on self-employment income.  The 
remaining one-half will continue to be eligible for a personal 
tax credit at the lowest tax rate.  Without the bill they would 
be entitled only to the credit on both the employer and employee 
contributions, which would put them at a disadvantage vis-à-vis 
owner-operators who can deduct the employer share. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The technical amendments in this bill are too numerous to 
mention in the short time allotted to me in this debate. 
However, I would like to highlight a few of them before moving 
on to the business tax changes implemented in this bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the personal tax side, some of the changes ensure that the 
rules under which clergy can claim a deduction for their 
residence are clarified.  They also ensure that Revenue Canada 
can release information about a former registered charity as long 
as it relates to when the organization was a registered charity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They ensure that municipalities do not have to file T4s for 
volunteers to whom they paid not more than $1,000.  They also 
ensure that the exemption applicable to reasonable travel 
allowances to part time teachers be extended to teachers who do 
not have other jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The five year tax reduction plan also goes a long way toward 
making Canada's business income tax system more internationally 
competitive.  This is important because business tax rates have a 
significant impact on the level of business investment, 
employment, productivity, wages and incomes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this in mind, Bill C-22 includes significant corporate tax 
rate reductions.  Corporate tax rates will drop to 21% from 28% 
for businesses in the highest taxed sectors, such as 
high technology services, to make them more internationally 
competitive.  These reductions begin with a one-point cut 
effective January 1, 2001. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By 2005 the combined federal provincial tax rate, including both 
income and capital taxes, will drop from the current average of 
47% to 35%.  This would put our businesses on a more competitive 
level with other G-7 countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two measures in the tax reduction plan involve capital gains. 
The first provides a tax deferred capital gains rollover for 
investments in shares of certain small and medium sized active 
business corporations.  It includes increasing the $500,000 
investment limit, originally announced in the 2000 budget, to $2 
million as announced in the economic statement and increasing the 
size of small businesses eligible for the rollover from $10 
million to include corporations with no more than $50 million in 
assets immediately after the investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second measure reduces the capital gains inclusion rate to 
one-half.  This would reduce the tough federal provincial tax 
rate on capital gains in Canada from an average of about 31% to 
about 23%, lower than the typical U.S. combined federal state top 
rate of about 25%.  Both measures would improve access to capital 
for small businesses with high growth potential.  High technology 
industries would particularly benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consistent with this change to the capital gains inclusion rate, 
the deduction for employee stock options would increase from 
one-third to one-half.  As a result, employees in Canada would be 
taxed more favourably on their stock option benefits than 
employees in the U.S.  The bill defers the taxation for certain 
stock option benefits and allows an additional deduction for 
certain stock option shares donated to charity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another measure that I want to discuss relates to branches of 
foreign banks operating in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These new rules stem from the 1999 amendments to the Bank Act, 
which allow foreign banks to establish specialized, commercially 
focused branches here.  Previously, foreign banks could operate 
in Canada only through Canadian incorporated subsidiaries. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax system for the new foreign bank branches would now be 
comparable to that for Canadian banks.  These new rules would 
give foreign banks a time limit window to move their operations 
from a Canadian subsidiary into a Canadian branch without undue 
tax consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with the personal tax measures, the business tax changes are 
too numerous to discuss individually during today's debate.  I 
would like to summarize a few of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, for example, provides a tax deferred rollover for 
shares received on certain foreign spinoffs.  It strengthens thin 
capitalization rules.  It phases out over a three year period the 
special income tax regime for non-resident owned investment 
corporations.  It treats provincial deductions for scientific 
research that exceed the amount of the SR & ED expenditures as 
government assistance.  It ensures appropriate treatment of 
foreign exploration and development expenses in computing foreign 
tax credits.  It introduces a temporary 15% investment tax credit 
for grassroots mineral exploration and it amends the corporate 
divisive reorganization rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other technical amendments ensure that Canadian corporations 
that hold shares of non-resident corporations through 
partnerships are not subject to double taxation.  The additional 
capital tax on life insurance corporations is extended until the 
end of 2000.  Shares of one foreign corporation can be exchanged 
on a tax deferred rollover basis for shares of another foreign 
corporation.  The tax treatment of resource expenditures and the 
rules governing gifts of ecologically sensitive land are 
clarified.  In a chain of corporations, a corporation is 
controlled by its immediate parent, even where the parent is 
itself controlled by a third corporation. 
Replacement property rules do not apply to shares of the capital 
stock of corporations, and a member of a limited liability 
partnership under provincial law is not automatically a limited 
partner under the Income Tax Act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the more technical changes incorporated into 
the bill.  There are three remaining measures that I wish to 
discuss briefly before closing.  The first involves changes to 
the rules governing the taxation of trusts and their 
beneficiaries. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 addresses the tax treatment of property distributed 
from a Canadian trust to a non-resident beneficiary.  It also 
introduces measures dealing with the tax treatment of bare, 
protective and similar trusts, as well as mutual fund trusts, 
health and welfare trusts and trusts governed by RRSPs and 
RRIFs. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the existing rules whereby an individual can roll 
over property to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a spouse or 
common law partner would be extended to alter ego trusts and 
joint spousal or common law partner trusts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several new anti-avoidance measures designed to ensure that 
transfers to trusts cannot be used to inappropriately reduce tax 
are also included in the bill.  For example, there would be 
limits on the use of rollovers where trusts were used to avoid 
tax when a beneficiary emigrates.  Also, income allocations to 
beneficiaries could not be used by trusts to circumvent the rules 
ensuring that spousal or common law partner trusts, alter ego 
trusts and joint spousal or common law partner trusts would not 
allocate income to others before the beneficiary, spouse or 
common law partner dies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, rollovers to a trust would be denied if the 
transfer was part of a series of transactions designed to defer 
capital gains through the use of a trust as an intermediary 
between a vendor and purchaser of property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A final anti-avoidance measure would prevent certain pre-1972 
trusts from using graduated income tax rates if they received 
property from a trust not subject to these rates, and the 
beneficial ownership of the property had not changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second measure I wish to highlight involves the new taxpayer 
migration rules, which are also part of the government's ongoing 
commitment to greater fairness in the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1972 Canada has had special tax rules that apply when 
people give up Canadian residence.  The basic entitlement of 
those rules is a deemed disposition that treats the immigrant as 
having disposed of property immediately before leaving. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years, questions have persisted as to the exact scope 
of this deemed disposition on departure from Canada and its 
interaction with Canada's international tax treaties.  Under 
Bill C-22, Canada retains the right to tax emigrants on gains 
that accrue during their stay in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also clarify the effect of the new rules on 
various kinds of rights to future income and would allow 
returning former residents to reverse the tax effects of their 
departure, regardless of how long they were a non-resident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, former residents would be able to reduce the 
Canadian tax payable on their pre-departure and distribution 
gains by certain foreign taxes paid on the same  gains.  This is 
part of Canada's commitment to avoiding international double 
taxation, a commitment that is reflected in our network of tax 
treaties as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1999, in anticipation of these rules coming into effect, 
Canada has been negotiating its tax treaties to reinforce 
protection against double taxation when immigrants' pre-departure 
gains are taxed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A final measure, deals with amendments to the Income Tax Act 
that relate to the June 3rd, 1999 agreement between Canada and 
the United States concerning foreign periodicals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the 1960s the Income Tax Act has precluded the deduction 
of advertising expenses unless a newspaper or a periodical is at 
least 75% Canadian owned and has at least 60% original Canadian 
content.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the Canada-U.S. agreement, this rule no longer 
applies to advertisements and periodicals.  Instead, advertising 
expenses and periodicals with at least 80% original editorial 
content would be fully deductible and advertising expenses and 
other periodicals would be 50% deductible regardless of 
ownership. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, after July 1996, the meaning of Canadian citizen 
will include Canadian pension funds and other entities that own 
Canadian newspapers to ensure that they qualify as citizens 
under the ownership requirements of the Income Tax Act.  For 
periodicals, this amendment applies from July 1996 to May 2000, 
after which time nationality of ownership is irrelevant. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, while the bill is lengthy, very detailed and 
technical in nature, its components are all very important and 
deserve to be passed without delay.  Most are relieving or 
clarifying measures and a few are housekeeping measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated earlier, each measure is designed with the 
principle of tax fairness in mind and there are many taxpayers 
out there who will benefit from these changes.  The measure with 
the highest profile of course implements the key components of 
our government's five year tax reduction plan.  In summary, that 
plan reduces the tax burden at the middle income level, increases 
support for families with children and makes Canada's business 
income tax system more internationally competitive.  As I stated 
earlier, the five year tax reduction plan will provide $100 
billion in cumulative tax relief by 2004-05. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all hon. members of the House to give the bill quick and 
speedy passage and, most importantly, to keep in mind all the 
Canadian children who will benefit from the increases to the 
Canada Child Tax Benefit on July 1.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, congratulations on your elevation to the Chair.  I 
am pleased to rise to debate Bill C-22 which is, as the hon. 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance has indicated, 
a very substantive tax bill which appeared before this place in 
the form of a ways and means motion several days ago in the 
session.  It seeks to give effect in part to tax changes proposed 
by the hon. Minister of Finance in his economic political 
statement here before the dissolution of parliament at the call 
of the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say at the outset that the bill before us is a classic 
example of what has gone wrong with parliamentary oversight of 
legislation, particularly with respect to taxation.  The bill 
before us has some 513 pages of technical amendments.  I can say 
with a fair degree certainty that not a single member of this 
place, let alone the parliamentary secretary who just spoke or 
the minister he represents, has read or will read.  It is a bill 
that exercises enormous power over the lives of Canadians through 
the Income Tax Act which in itself has coercive powers delegated 
to it by this parliament.  The some 500 pages of 
amendments in the bill are amendments to a tax act which runs 
over 1,300 pages long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind my hon. colleagues that in the House in 1917, 
before it burned down, this same parliament passed what was 
called the temporary Income War Tax Act.  It ran all of seven 
pages.  The government of the day of then Prime Minister Borden 
said that the bill was only necessary for a short period of time 
to finance the war effort during the great war and that we would 
be able to repeal it shortly thereafter. 
This was an income tax which applied only to very wealthy 
Canadians at the time, people who were in the top fraction of 
income earners.  The vast majority of Canadians were unaffected 
by it.  The politicians said that it was temporary and that would 
be repealed. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not look like a repeal bill to me.  This looks like 
another 500 pages of amendments on top a 1,300 page statute of 
which I doubt a single person in this country understands the 
totality.  There might be a tiny handful of tax experts in 
academia or in the Department of Finance who have even a vague 
grasp of the myriad complexity of the Income Tax Act which we are 
seeking to amend today.  This is a testament to the enormous 
complexity of the tax code with which Canadians must grapple 
every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That act in 1917 was passed in good faith by parliamentarians 
and committed to the Canadians, who they were taking money from 
to finance the war effort, that it would be repealed.  It was 
not. Not only was it not repealed, it was added to, broadened and 
expanded to bring more and eventually every single working 
Canadian into its ambit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we end up with an enormous, complex web of tax laws which 
inhibit the wealth creating potential of this nation which 
diminishes our productivity.  It drives down our competitiveness 
and undermines the standard of living of Canadian families who 
are working harder to get ahead but who are falling behind 
because of the tax act which the bill seeks to amend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say as a matter of principle on behalf of the official 
opposition, the Canadian Alliance, that we stand four-square 
against this huge complex and destructive system of penalizing 
work, investment, risk taking and wealth creation.  These are the 
very virtues and habits upon which a prosperous and free nation 
is built.  All of those things are undermined by taxation in 
general and this extraordinarily complex tax system that we have 
in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A political philosopher once remarked that the power to tax is 
in fact the power to destroy.  It is the power of government to 
use its monopoly on coercive force to reach out the hand of the 
state and to take from individuals, businesses and corporations 
the fruits of their labours.  We can never underestimate just how 
destructive that power can be.  We can never know how many small 
businesses or how many dreams have been vanquished because people 
were unable to realize their potential and dreams of starting up 
and operating a successful business because they were unable to 
keep enough of the fruits of their labours to keep their heads 
above water.  That is what the bill represents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the parliamentary secretary who just spoke perhaps 
does not reflect often on the first principles of taxation.  It 
is important for us every now and then in this place to remember 
the enormous power that we wield through this taxing power.  We 
do so somewhat recklessly.  As I suggested, I am certain that not 
a single member of the House has now or will read the entire 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tried to make my way through as much of it as I can. I 
consulted the experts in the finance department.  I received the 
bill a couple of days ago and I am supposed to stand here on 
behalf of the official opposition, which has a quasi 
constitutional obligation to be the watchdog of the government 
particularly with respect to issues like this, and provide a 
thorough, detailed, thoughtful analysis and assessment of the 
bill, when these 500 pages of technical amendments were just 
delivered to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know for certain that the finance minister not only has not 
read the bill, he is likely at best vaguely familiar with the 
impact of the amendments contained herein. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the official opposition will vote against it for a 
number of reasons, this will undoubtedly go on to the finance 
committee which, I predict, will have fairly brief hearings 
because none of the members will be able to penetrate the 
impenetrable complexity of the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well meaning and very bright officials from the Department of 
Finance will appear before the committee to explain and analyze, 
as best they can, the impact of the bill.  The committee members, 
who were elected to represent the best interests of their 
constituents and to uphold any parliamentary oversight and scrutiny, 
will have to take the bureaucrats at their word and then the bill 
will come back to this place and be passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will not understand what they have passed because of the 
complexity of the act.  That is a very serious concern, but it 
does not need to be that way.  In a more functional democratic 
institution, the American congress for instance, both the upper 
and lower houses have ways and means committees with independent 
legislators and adequate staff resources.  The staff of those 
committees have become experts on the complexities of tax 
legislation and are able to frame and craft bills of this nature 
with a real understanding of what they are doing.  The U.S. 
congress has specific committees to deal with taxing power and 
taxing legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, congress and the people it represents have the 
benefit of real, serious, substantive democratic oversight and 
input into tax legislation.  We only pretend to have such input 
in this place because of the dysfunctional nature of parliament 
and the complexity of the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do I know that is the case?  How can I prove that the 
consideration of tax legislation does not work in this parliament? 
It is very simple.  This bill, and at least three other bills before the 
House right now, include amendments to tax legislation that seek 
to undo the drafting mistakes of previous bills passed by 
parliament.  It is unacceptable that we waste the valuable time 
of parliament time after time by undoing mistakes made in the 
drafting of legislation.  Those mistakes were not identified by 
members of parliament because they do not have the expertise, the 
time or the resources.  What is the point of digging down into 
the depths of a bill if it will be passed anyway? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have time to ensure at a meaningful level that the 
bureaucrats have it right.  The minister does not do that.  He 
receives draft legislation from bureaucrats, rubber stamps it and 
sends it to parliament.  We ought not spend time correcting the 
errors that drafting officials and bureaucrats have made.  If we 
had more serious parliamentary scrutiny, oversight and 
involvement in the development of tax legislation, and a tax code 
which made sense to ordinary taxpayers, we would not need to 
constantly revisit bills such as the one before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those reasons my party stands four square for the reform and 
simplification of the tax code.  I will quote from the Canadian 
Alliance policy declaration.  It was not dreamed up by any one 
person.  It was the result of a grassroots, bottom up democratic 
process.  Our members agreed that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will restore public confidence in the fairness of the Canadian 
tax system by reducing its complexity.  We will restore 
indexation and move towards a simpler tax system, built around— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a novel concept for a government which likes to play the 
politics of envy and class warfare.  It continues: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—a single rate of taxation to ensure lower taxes for all 
Canadians.  We believe that all Canadians above a minimum income 
level should share in the cost of the services provided by 
government, which benefit us all. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we seek to do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. parliamentary secretary suggested the bill would give 
effect to what he called, disingenuously, the largest tax cut in 
Canadian history.  That is absolutely bogus.  He argues the bill 
would give effect to the political statement made by the finance 
minister in October. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give credit where it is due.  After seven years of 
advocacy in this place by the Reform caucus and then the Canadian 
Alliance that tax relief be our nation's highest economic 
priority, and after millions of Canadians demanded to see a 
little more of what they earn and said they were fed up with 
Liberal tax increases, the finance minister, days before an 
election, finally came forward with some modest tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However they are not real tax cuts for real people.  I challenge 
people to take the paystub test.  People who watch the debate in 
this place see me and my colleagues stand to demand the finance 
minister cut taxes and they see him stand to say he has already 
done so.  How are people to know which of us is telling the 
truth?  I have a very simple test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I need some clarification.  The member said his party supports a 
single rate of tax, and yet in the last election it did not even 
include it in its platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  With the greatest of respect, if I 
looked high and low, nowhere would I find anything in that 
statement resembling a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, not only was it not a 
point of order.  It was completely inaccurate.  Our platform 
included a policy for a single rate of tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make clear what I was saying.  People are confused by 
competing claims about whether taxes have been cut.  They can be 
the arbiters.  They have very simple documentary evidence to 
adjudicate the test.  It is called their paystub. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite everyone listening to or watching the debate to look at 
their paystubs and compare them to the paystubs for the same week 
or month last year.  They will see that the supposed Liberal tax 
cut for this year was actually a tax increase.  It is bogus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we combine the impact of Bill C-2 regarding Canada pension 
plan payroll taxes, which was passed during this fiscal year by 
the previous parliament and is the largest tax increase in 
Canadian history, with the myriad of other tax increases imposed 
by the government and the snail's pace at which its modest tax 
cuts will apply, Canadians at most income levels will find they 
are paying more than they did the year before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they are not, it is because of the foresight of provincial 
governments.  Provincial taxes in Ontario and Alberta have gone 
down, thanks to the leadership of people like Mike Harris and 
Ralph Klein, but federal taxes have stayed the same or gone up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister and his parliamentary secretary claim the 
bill includes $100 billion of tax relief.  A nice round figure 
like that is like pricing something at $9.99 in a department 
store.  The finance minister was told by campaign officials to 
get the number up because he needed a nice, big round number to 
talk about in the election.  They decided it would be $100 
billion.  It is nothing of the sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims $100.5 billion of gross tax relief in the 
bill and $3.2 billion of that is an increase in spending.  The 
government has taken the Canada child tax benefit, which is an 
entitlement program and a spending program, and booked it as a 
tax cut.  Once again the paragons of clean accounting in the 
government opposite are misleading Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the $29.5 billion by which the government 
increased the Canada pension plan payroll tax.  The government, 
after enormous pressure from this party, from the Canadian 
Taxpayers Federation and from the Canadian people, finally 
decided to stop the insidious back door tax grab on inflation 
known as deindexation.  Under deindexation people were bumped 
into higher tax brackets and paid more taxes.  They did so 
because they were getting cost of living adjustments and not 
because of any real increase in income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance objected to deindexation.  Finally the 
government responded to our objection and stole our policy by 
agreeing to reindex the tax system, but not retroactively to 1986 
when the Mulroney government deindexed the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say parenthetically that the Liberal Party in the 1988 
and 1993 elections ran against the Tory Party, and rightfully so, 
for having deindexed the tax system in 1986.  However when it 
finally came to setting things right, did the Liberals give back 
the money that had been stripped out of people's wallets by taxes 
and inflation since 1986?  No, sir.  They reindexed.  They did 
not give back the some $9 billion that people had lost to 
deindexation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals say they will adjust tax brackets, exemptions and 
credits upward to account for the consumer price index so that 
they no longer impose a tax on inflation.  That is good.  However 
they count that as a tax cut.  In other words, the government 
counts a non-increase as a cut.  They tell Canadians they will 
not tax them on inflation and that Canadians should be grateful 
it will be counted as a tax cut.  There are accountants in this 
place who would find that pretty specious.  The government has 
declared $21 billion worth of specious, non-existent tax cuts 
which are merely non-increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we add all that up, the real total net tax cut in the 
government's bill is $47 billion over five years.  That is about 
half the tax relief proposed by the Canadian Alliance over five 
years based on comparable accounting.  It is a fraction of the 
tax relief proposed by U.S. President Bush of $1.6 trillion to 
$2.3 trillion, depending on how we count it, over 10 years for a 
country with taxes that are already lower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would not be such a problem if Canada had its tax burden 
under control.  However it does not.  Revenues to the federal 
government last year were at their highest level in history.  The 
government is bigger in terms of the money it hoovers out of 
people's wallets, purses and small business tills than any 
government in the history of the dominion.  Personal income taxes 
in Canada consume a higher percentage of gross domestic product 
than in any other nation in the G-8.  At 17.6% of GDP we have 
the highest personal income taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a recent study by Price Waterhouse that was 
published in <I>The Economist</I>, Canada has the highest 
corporate income tax rates in the OECD, the Organization for 
Economic Co-operation and Development, the 23 principal 
industrialized countries in the world.  Of those 23 countries, 
yes, we are number one when it comes to business tax rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look down the line, we see that none of this will change 
under the bill.  When the tax cuts here have been fully 
implemented, and after the Bush tax changes have been implemented 
in the U.S., Canada will still have income taxes far higher than 
those of the United States and our other principal competitors. 
That is having an impact on our competitiveness and our standard 
of living.  We know that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that Canadians are working harder now than they ever 
have and are falling behind.  We know we have an 
increase in the brain drain: the loss of talent and human capital 
to the United States and other jurisdictions, in large part 
because of the tax burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that Canada has fallen from second to 16th place in the 
OECD in terms of our standard of living over the past 15 years. 
We went from the second highest per capita GDP to the 16th, to 
the middle of the pack.  Over the past 10 years, by comparison, 
Ireland leapfrogged over Canada in terms of its growth in per 
capita GDP, which is the best measure of increases in the 
standard of living, in large part because it provided huge tax 
incentives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member opposite said that it was because of something other 
than tax relief.  My brother moved a company with 30 very well 
paying jobs to Dublin because of the tax cuts offered in Ireland 
and the huge advantage it offers over Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an agenda that would restore the competitiveness 
of the nation.  It would continue to impose on Canadians an 
enormous burden of taxation into the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would do a number of other things to which we object. 
First, there are a couple of elements which do step in the right 
direction.   Reducing the inclusion rate on capital gains to 15% 
is something that should have happened a long time ago.  We would 
like to see that inclusion rate go down to 33 1/3% so that we 
stop penalizing people who invest their whole lives in a business 
or in a property.  This is a form of a death tax.  We work hard 
our entire life, we invest in a business or property and we look 
forward to passing that on to the next generation.  We, as 
individuals, may not take any benefit from it, but guess what? 
The moment we die, the Government of Canada comes in with deemed 
capital gains, which is really a form of estate tax or death tax, 
and grabs one-third of our lifetime earnings that were in that 
investment.  That is wrong.  We should not penalize people's 
lifetime investments.  We should not diminish their abilities to 
pass on to the next generation their life's savings as we do 
through deemed capital gains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of technical changes in the bill.  One of the 
technical changes with which we have a great deal of trouble is 
the fact that the bill would continue the unfairness with which 
single income families with children are treated under the tax 
code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will recall that this was a very hot issue at one 
point in the last parliament.  The Secretary of State for 
International Financial Institutions, in response to a question I 
put to him about why the government discriminated against single 
income families with kids and why there was as much as an 80% tax 
penalty for those families versus their dual income counterparts, 
stood in his place and said that the government discriminated 
against single income families because they did not work as hard 
or have as many expenses as the double income families.  That was 
pitting one kind of family against another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we said then and I say now, let me inform the secretary of 
state that moms and dads who stay home to raise small kids, to 
care for the elderly and the infirm, and to build families and 
homes, work just as hard, if not harder, as those of us in the 
paid workforce.  They deserve and demand our respect and fairness 
in the tax code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current tax code's discrimination against those families 
must be eliminated and fairness must be brought in.  The Canadian 
Alliance has proposed, among other things, equalizing the spousal 
or equivalent to spouse basic exemption with the basic personal 
exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill we would have two classes of citizens: those who 
are primary income earners and their spouses.  They have equal 
worth and that worth should be reflected in the tax code by a 
spousal exemption equal to the basic personal exemption.  That 
would not done here.  We would continue to penalize the stay at 
home parents.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would raise that exemption from $8,000, which it will 
eventually get to pursuant to this bill after several years, to 
$10,000. That would lift hundreds of thousands of working 
families off the tax rolls so that instead of giving money to be 
misspent by the government they could invest it in their own 
priorities, their own children and their own homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would bring in a child tax deduction.  We would provide a 
deduction of $3,000 per child so that families with children 
would be able to keep more of what they earn to reflect the costs 
of raising kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government do?  Absolutely nothing of the sort. To 
the contrary, the bill before us raises the so-called child care 
expense deduction from $7,000 to $10,000.  This is another piece 
of discrimination because only certain families would get to 
claim the child care expense deduction.  Only those dual income 
families with receipted child care expenses could make use of it. 
Only 17% of tax filers could claim this deduction, and even a 
smaller fraction could claim it to the full amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a mother with three children is the main income earner and 
the father decides to stay home until the kids are in school, the 
tax code says that the dad's work at home cannot be deducted. The 
tax code says that it has no value to society and therefore will 
not be recognized.  However, if a parent decides instead to earn 
a second income and drops the kids off at a day care on the way 
to the second job, the federal government will give recognition 
for the third party costs of child care.  The at home costs, the 
opportunity costs, the forgone income and the real financial 
costs of raising children at home are recognized nowhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is intolerable that we should be increasing discrimination 
against single income parents.  We will oppose the bill on that 
ground alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill includes an element which further erodes parliament's 
recognition of the unique and important role and status of the 
institution of marriage in our society and culture.  It does so 
by bringing forward further amendments to change any reference 
from spouse to common law partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a change which was begun in a bill amending the Income 
Tax Act in the previous parliament, but in one of the many 
drafting errors to which I referred earlier the officials 
neglected to amend certain sections of the bill, saying that 
in various sections reference to spouse as part of the 
institution of marriage has been abolished for all intents and 
purposes from the Income Tax Act.  It is an institution which in this 
and every other society I know of has been given certain 
privileges because it is the basis of the family, 
the basic institution of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have said from time immemorial that the institution of 
marriage should be given certain preferences and privileges to 
protect the family.  The bill would further erode the 
distinctiveness of that institution by saying common law 
partners, not spouses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a parliament or as a country should not be ashamed of 
declaring that the spousal commitment in the covenant of marriage is 
a fundamental contractual relationship in the development of 
strong and healthy families and that they are necessary to having 
a strong and healthy society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is another reason we oppose the bill.  It further 
undermines and weakens marriage as an institution.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of other provisions in the bill which the 
Alliance finds objectionable.  It does include certain technical 
changes to which we do not object.  Here is an interesting one: the foreign 
actors' tax credit.  Most people may ask what that is 
all about.  It turns out that we currently withhold 15% of the 
income of Hollywood actors who come to Canada to act in Hollywood 
movies.  We then reserve the right to force them to file a tax 
return and tax them even more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Hollywood movie actors have been shedding crocodile tears 
about this unfair tax treatment by Canada.  The same government 
which cannot find the fiscal room to help out single income 
families, has decided to give millionaire Hollywood movie actors 
a tax break in the bill.  Lo and behold, Sylvester Stallone and 
Bruce Willis will be at the front of the line when it comes to 
tax relief from the government.  Single income moms and dads can 
stay at home without fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would do this by raising the withholding tax from 
15% to 23%, a very modest increase, but then it says that the 
actors would not have to file returns beyond that.  These are 
people making millions of dollars at the highest possible 
marginal rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My office staff called the movie producers, the Hollywood 
actors, the actors' guilds and so on to hear what they thought of 
this move by the government.  They were in favour of this because 
it would be a big tax cut for the millionaire Hollywood movie 
stars.  They said that if we did not make this change, they might 
not keep coming back to work in Canada.  I find it very odd when 
I look at the priorities that the government has for tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Alliance have talked about raising the basic 
exemption for individuals and spouses, or equivalent to spouses, 
to $10,000.  We talked about introducing a $3,000 deduction per 
child.  Let us just figure out what that means.  If we had a 
Canadian Alliance government, it would mean that a family with 
two parents and three kids would pay no taxes on their first 
$29,000 of income.  It would mean that a single mom could give 
her first child the equivalent to spouse deduction of $10,000, so 
that a single mom with two kids would have $23,000 tax free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures would lift 1.4 million low income Canadians off 
the tax roles altogether, giving them a hand up so they could get 
ahead.  It would stop penalizing them for earning that small 
incremental income to try to get ahead economically.  The 
government does nothing in the bill to lift Canadians off the tax 
roles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When our party came out with its bold and powerful proposal to 
eventually get to a 17% single income tax rate and lift 1.4 
million low income people off the tax roles and to restore and 
create family tax fairness, the government said that it looked 
popular.  It said that it was testing well in the polls so it had 
better try to outflank the opposition.  What did it do?  It came 
up with a new basic rate of 16% in the bill and thought that 
Canadians would be fooled by that because, after all, 16% is 
lower than 17%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it is.  However, for the people, for whom it matters, those 
at the lowest income levels, there are no increases in the basic exemptions 
and deductions. Those are far more generous.  What the Liberals want is 
for a single mom working as a waitress to pay 16% of her paltry income. 
Our plan would say that a low income individual would pay no taxes at all 
because we want that individual to get ahead through higher 
deductions and exemptions at the bottom end of the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I encourage the government to think about the 
enormous complexity of the Income Tax Act and the destructive 
effect it has on our economy and our society.  It should 
think of the tens of thousands of bright, young Canadians, whose 
educations we subsidize, who leave the country every year to 
pursue their economic opportunities elsewhere in large part 
because of diminished opportunities and our tax system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want them to think about the low income working families, the 
single moms and the seniors on fixed incomes who are forced to 
pay taxes today.  I want them to join us in dreaming about 
creating a tax system which is simple, fair and low, which 
rewards risk taking, investment and productivity and which 
rewards the virtues upon which a prosperous society is built. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to invite them to join us in the opposition in proposing 
a tax system that lifts the low income people off the tax rolls, 
that puts the family first and restores fairness to the tax 
system and that stops the beggar thy neighbour, class warfare 
politics of envy approach, which informs the so-called progressive 
tax system that penalizes people who succeed, work hard and get 
ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite them to do all of those things by opposing Bill C-22, a 
bill that once more adds yet another destructive layer on to the 
tax act which was first passed in this place in 1917.  I hope 
they will join us in doing that and working together to create an 
economic environment of opportunity which rewards risk taking, 
saving, investment and hard work.  That is what Canadians are 
asking for and that is what we are fighting for by opposing 
the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to speak to Bill C-22 implementing certain 
provisions of the latest budget of the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say right away that we will oppose this bill, because we 
have repeatedly criticized, not only during the course of the 
regular budget of March 2000, but also when the Minister of 
Finance tabled his mini budget in the fall, the fact that the 
huge tax resources at his disposal over the next five years were 
being badly used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we speak of huge tax resources, the situation has not 
changed, even with the prospect of a downturn in the States. We 
will return to this later. In the next five years, even taking 
into account a downturn in the economy in fiscal 2001-02 linked 
to that of the States, the Minister of Finance will have some 
$135 billion in surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a lot of money, $135 billion.  It is slightly down from 
what he anticipated last year in fact because of the American 
situation.  Last year, the talk was of $147 billion or 
thereabouts.  Now the figure cited is $135 billion.  However, the 
possibility of making choices around these huge surpluses remains 
essentially the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is faced with a situation in which, 
through various unfair measures he created, on the 
backs of just about everyone, annual surpluses that will reach 
record levels in the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has accumulated these surpluses and will continue to do so on 
the backs of the unemployed. He will take from the employment 
insurance fund between $5 billion and $6 billion annually to 
create his budget surplus.  Five to six billion dollars a year will be 
taken from the contributions by employers and employees, 
contributions which have nothing to do with those of the federal 
government.  The government has not contributed to this fund for 
a number of years, but still takes $5 billion to $6 billion 
annually from it.  It is shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, the Minister of Finance has taken $38 billion 
from the EI fund surplus. This money came from the pockets of 
employers, workers and mainly the unemployed. 
What must be kept in mind is that, if the surplus in the EI fund 
is accumulating as rapidly as it is, it is because of two things: 
first, employer and employee contributions are too high, and 
second, the majority of people who are out of work are excluded 
from the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind hon. members that only 43% of people who end up 
unemployed are in fact eligible for employment insurance. 
Corrective measures by the government will remedy some of this, 
but only a tiny portion, not all of it.  Despite the improvements 
made by the bill on employment insurance, most of those who are 
left out will continue to be.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Year in, year out, the Minister of Finance is going to continue 
to pocket at least $5 billion of the $6 billion EI fund surplus 
to add to his budget surplus and to look good, as well as to be 
able to give tax cuts to the richest members of Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, we must not lose sight of the fact that the Minister of 
Finance created this surplus, and will continue to add to it, at 
the expense of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For six years now, the Minister of Finance has cut transfer 
payments to the provinces for the funding of education, health 
and income security.  This was money that the provinces did not 
have, year after year, to meet their citizens' needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The surplus is in Ottawa, while the needs are in the provinces. 
The health sector needs money, and the Minister of Finance had 
plenty.  Last year the Minister of Finance did restore some 
funding, but year after year they are still some $2 billion short 
of what is required to cope with changing health costs, caused in 
large part by the aging of the population.  Over the next five 
years, the shortfall in transfers will total $10 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the greying of the population, we know there will be 
a natural increase of 3% in health requirements, in Quebec and 
elsewhere in Canada.  This increase is solely because of the fact 
that the population is aging.  The Minister of Finance has not 
taken this phenomenon into account and the surplus continues to 
accumulate in his coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year again, in spite of the downturn in the U.S. economy, 
the Minister of Finance will have a surplus of about $18 billion 
to $20 billion. It is easy to have such surpluses when one does 
nothing and makes the provinces do the work by cutting 
transfers, by not indexing in view of the urgent needs in health 
and education, and by shamelessly dipping into the employment 
insurance fund. It is easy to accumulate surpluses under these 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that with the surpluses for this year and the four 
previous years, the Minister of Finance could do a lot more than 
what he intends to do under his five year plan. He is in a 
position to target groups that need help. The Minister of 
Finance intends to give major tax cut to those who earn $250,000 
and up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From this year on, those, and there are not too many of them, who 
earn in excess of $250,000 and others such as millionaires and 
billionaires will enjoy significant tax cuts. They will get 
about 70% of all the tax cuts planned by the Minister of 
Finance. If a person is earning $250,000 this year, he is lucky 
because he will get the largest tax cuts, because of the changes 
related to the partial inclusion of capital gains, because of 
tax cuts as such, or because of indexation. These people will 
get at least $9,000 to $11,000 in tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, a single parent with dependent children is not so 
lucky, because he or she will only get about $250 in tax cuts 
this year. Talk about equity and social justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under our proposals, with the same tax resources the Minister of 
Finance has estimated for the next five years, we in the Bloc 
Quebecois would have taken measures to ensure that starting 
this year families earning $35,000 or less would not pay any 
taxes. Everyone else would have benefited from a 50% tax break. 
That is what I call being progressive. That is what I call 
dealing with the needs of the people, the real needs of the 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance could have diverted his resources to the 
majority of taxpayers, as we have done. Nine out of ten taxpayers 
would have benefited from a tax break under our proposals, not 
just 1% of all taxpayers, the richest taxpayers in Canada and 
partisans of the Liberal Party and our millionaire friend, the 
finance minister, but nine out of ten, that is 90% of taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can come up with these proposals using the same basic 
figures as the Minister of Finance did, why has he not redirected 
his policies?

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the estimated tax resources for the next five years and 
despite the downturn in the U.S. economy, because we adjusted our 
estimates accordingly, the Minister of Finance could have used $5 
billion of the $6 billion EI surplus every year to improve the 
system, raise the benefits and expand the system to include the 
57% of the unemployed who do not currently qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal workers, women and especially young workers who are 
particularly hard hit by the vicious employment insurance system 
could have benefited this year from decent EI benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we able to come up with a scenario whereby each year 
$5 billion stays in the EI fund to help young people, women and 
also families? We are talking about a good parental leave plan in 
Quebec City, not the useless kind of plan being proposed to us. 
With our forecasts with regard to surpluses, why are we able to 
do all these things? It is because we in the Bloc Quebecois 
believe that our first duty is to serve the most disadvantaged, 
those who belong to the middle income category, those into whose 
pockets the federal government has been dipping since it came 
into office in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let is not forget that these nine taxpayers out of ten, to whom we 
wanted to give tax cuts considering the huge surpluses that will 
accumulate in the federal government's coffers, are the ones who 
pay the biggest share of taxes. Indeed, the federal government 
gets most of its tax revenues from families in the $25,000 to 
$80,000 a year income range. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all these surpluses, the federal government is not thinking 
about those families. It is not thinking about those who have 
been taxed to death these last few years. It does not want to 
ensure that they benefit from these surpluses, but it wants to 
ensure that millionaires do. That is the kind of social justice 
practised by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not even talk about social housing any more. It is not a 
priority for this government, as evidenced by the fact that it 
has not invested a cent in this area since 1993. Yet, the needs 
are enormous. Since that year, the number of families spending 
more than 50% of their income on housing has almost doubled. If 
one spends 50% of one's income on housing, it means that there is 
only 50% left to buy food and clothing for one's self and one's 
children.

<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Before beginning Statements by Members, I have 
something to say about the point of order the hon. House leader 
of the Bloc Quebecois raised yesterday concerning the Prime 
Minister's reply to a question posed by the hon. leader of the 
Bloc Quebecois on March 21, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Roberval alleged that the office of the 
Prime Minister had improperly intervened with the publications 
process to change the reply given by the Prime Minister as it 
appeared in the blues so that it read substantively differently 
when printed in <I>Hansard</I>. 
Specifically, he said that the phrase “nous n'avions pas 
d'intérêt financier” was changed to “nous n'avions pas de parts” 
and that this constitutes a substantive change that is 
unacceptable under our usual practices. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have now had an opportunity to review all the pertinent 
information on this case: the video tape of the exchange, the 
blues and the official <I>Hansard</I>, and I asked for and received 
a report from my officials on this matter.  This is what have I 
learned. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The videotape of the exchange shows the Prime Minister's reply, 
with the phrase “nous n'avions pas de parts” just as indicated 
in the official <I>Hansard</I>. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1400"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that portion of the tape is admittedly hard to 
understand and the reply may have contained some additional 
words that remain unclear in listening to the tape. It appears 
that the transcriber preparing the blues, faced with a difficult 
portion of the tape to decipher, sought, as is often the case, 
the context of the question in the words of the questioner. So, 
the words “nous n'avions pas d'intérêt financier” appear in 
the blues, which, I remind hon. members, are the unedited 
transcript of the first take on transcribing events in the 
Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The change from the phrase in the blues “nous n'avions pas 
d'intérêt financier” to the phrase in the <I>Debates</I> “nous n'avions 
pas de parts” was made by the <I>Hansard</I> editors as a result of 
their listening to the tape and coming to the conclusion, as I 
invite members themselves to do, that this was the accurate 
transcription of the phrase used in the Prime Minister's reply. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am satisfied that there was no impropriety here and no 
interference with the usual practices concerning the preparation 
of the official record of House <I>Debates</I>.  I thank the hon. 
member for his intervention. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore conclude that the allegations of the member for 
Roberval are without foundation and the matter is closed.

face, including the erosion of foreign markets for North American 
softwood lumber if we are not able to produce an economically and 
competitively priced product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to make the Americans aware of the changing 
products that are now entering the marketplace as alternatives to 
traditional building materials.  Countervailing duties and other

the Leader of the Opposition has written four or five times to

something that is totally without precedent, something never

back saying “Oops, there is something here we have to change. We 
will get back to you later”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, retired Justice W. D. Parker, who conducted the 
Sinclair Stevens inquiry, has called for an independent judicial 
inquiry into this.  He said “A commission will make findings of 
fact”.  No one at that time was shrieking louder for an inquiry 
into the Sinclair Stevens matter than these Liberals.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the documents released at 
noon today show that the Prime Minister continued to have a financial 
link with the Grand-Mère golf club after November 1993.  His company 
was a signatory to the September 1999 agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 2.1 of the third document says that once the Akimbo 
shares are transferred to Michaud, the Prime Minister's company 
“will no longer have any right of ownership or interest”, I 
emphasize “or interest in respect of these shares”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Prime Minister tell us that he had no financial 
link, nor any interest in respect of the shares, when those 
interests ended in September 1999, in an agreement which his 
company signed? 
<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
was an account receivable, and the lawyers wanted to cover all 
the aspects with respect to any transaction in order to wrap up 
matters as clearly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say this to the Bloc Quebecois leader.  Not so very long 
ago, the member for Roberval once again said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he not understand that the only way to settle this matter—the 
only way, there are not 50 of them, only one—is to 
provide us with the record of sale, as we have demanded so many 
times already? Let him provide that, and the problem will be 
over. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was said in the House on March 15, 2001, which proves 
that is all they want. They are unable to attack the government— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie. 
<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, that 
was because we believed the Prime Minister at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am getting at is that when the lawyers have made 
provision for everything, they have also provided that an 
interest in the shares remained.  They provided for more than 
that.  They provided that the Prime Minister's company would be 
responsible for compensating Michaud “for damages and costs of 
any sort”, including article 3.6, “arising from proceedings or 
inquiries of any nature”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, through this agreement, the Prime Minister is 
proving to us that he has every interest in an inquiry not being 
held, not even in the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs, because his company would have to pay the cost of 
Michaud's lawyer.  That is why he does not want an inquiry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
like everyone else, the Bloc Quebecois leader has repeatedly 
asked the ethics counsellor whether there was any conflict of 
interest.  He gave his answer when he appeared before the 
committees in 1999.  Today, the only problem remaining, he said, 
was the deed of sale.  That was tabled today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is sad is that, with real problems in the country, this is 
what the opposition is focusing on.  They want to go after the 
Prime Minister's reputation.  The Prime Minister is very well 
known in this country.  There were 172 members— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Roberval. 
<P><A NAME="LINK138"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the most 
serious problem in this country is the lack of credibility of 
its leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to be complete, the sale documents must be accompanied 
by the stock certificates, because the sale of shares only 
actually takes place when the certificates are signed at the 
back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the Prime Minister not table the stock certificates with 
the bill of sale to certify that the shares no longer belonged 
to him, assuming he endorsed them? 
<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
let it be clear that, at one point, Mr. Prince returned all 
these documents to the company, to Mr. Michaud. Last week the 
lawyer clearly stated that a resolution was passed by the 
company on November 1 saying that I had sold my shares and 
that a few days later I was no longer a director of that 
company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of November 1, 1993, I and my company had no interest in the 
company, no connection with the golf club. This is clear, as 
evidenced by the documents that we tabled today, which is 
something unprecedented. 
<P><A NAME="LINK140"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the Prime 
Minister signed away his shares in 1999 as a contracting party, 
either he never endorsed the stock certificates and always 
remained the owner since he had not been paid or else he 
endorsed them and they were returned to him and endorsed again. 
If that is the case, we would like to know when the Prime 
Minister became a shareholder again.

because he refuses to understand, and we know that opposition 
parties have a very hard time finding things that are wrong with 
our government. Again, the member for Roberval said “There is 
only one thing to do and it is to table the bill of sale”.

to a major disagreement over the carbon sink concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand we have the Americans tripping through the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

get serious here for a minute.  The Prime Minister knows 
perfectly well the American president has served notice that he 
has no intention of meeting the U.S. Kyoto commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government doing the Americans' dirty work?  It is 
bad enough for Canada's reputation as a responsible environmental 
citizen to be smeared because we refuse to take the lead on 
tackling greenhouse emissions at source. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government adding insult to injury by urging the 
poorest nations of the hemisphere to buy favour on the eve of the

American position on greenhouse gases?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and

sinks in either agriculture or forestry is squarely based upon 
sound science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. gentleman sitting next to the leader of the NDP, coming

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I read in this morning's <I>La Presse</I> that a legal expert, Paul 
Martel, has made the following statement: “Even if shares are 
not paid for, the purchaser becomes the owner, according to the 
Civil Code.  Once the sale is concluded, the parties cannot 
change their minds without going before a judge to get the sale 
cancelled”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an opinion given by a lawyer to a <I>La Presse</I> reporter, 
and certainly for my benefit.  This is a man who knows his law. 
When there is a sale, the sale is effected at the time the two 
parties give their consent. 
<P><A NAME="LINK166"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, is the 
Prime Minister's participation in the 1999 agreement as a 
contracting party not confirmation that the Prime Minister still 
had a direct ownership tie to his shares and that, by stating 
otherwise, he and his ethics counsellor have misled the entire 
House of Commons? 
<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have to keep repeating the same thing.  My apologies to the Liberal MPs, 
who are ladies and gentlemen showing a great deal of patience 
with the irresponsibility of the opposition, when they would 
prefer to discuss real problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the thousandth time, I repeat: I sold my shares on November 
1, 1993; the record of sale was tabled here this morning.  We 
were owed money, most of which was collected in 1999.  We gained 
nothing.  We acted in the interest of the constituents of the 
riding of Saint-Maurice, by creating jobs in a riding with one of 
the highest rates of unemployment in Canada.

my point of order arises from the decision of the Chair to rule 
my supplementary question to the Minister of Foreign Affairs

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to appeal to the Chair, perhaps on reflection, to 
recognize that the question I was asking related specifically to 
the implications of three members of the House accepting a trip 
to Sudan paid for by a corporation which has been heavily 
criticized by a minister of the crown.  Clearly that may have 
implications on Canada's foreign policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question was put specifically to the foreign affairs 
minister.  It raised serious concerns about the implications of 
the decision of these members to accept this payment, but more 
specifically it sought guidance from the minister with respect to 
his administrative responsibilities as minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Marleau and Montpetit, at chapter 11, the relevant provisions 
on questions, I would draw the attention of the House and the 
Chair to two citations: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—Members should be given the greatest possible freedom in the 
putting of questions that is consistent with the other 
principles. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then it goes on to refer to the specific criteria of the 
question, saying that members should “seek information” and of 
course: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—ask a question that is within the administrative responsibility 
of the government or the individual Minister addressed. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect, one of the members who made the decision to accept 
this funding from Talisman is the vice-chair of the foreign

with respect to Canada's role in this important issue.

opportunity.

<UL><UL>

should—ask a question that is within the administrative

legal or otherwise— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member asked the minister for his opinion on what some 
other hon. member had done.  It had nothing to do with government 
expenditure.  It had nothing to do with the Department of Foreign

the hon. member's question, to take a trip from someone else. 
That is not the business of the minister and in my opinion it is 
clearly not part of the administrative responsibility of the 
government.  The member was seeking an opinion.  He violated the 
principles on two counts.  The question was out of order.  I have 
no doubt on the issue.

members may be aware of them, not in the press gallery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two possibilities: either you remind government 
members that they have a duty to table the documents in the House 
and that, if they have not tabled them officially, they should 
withdraw the statements to that effect made in the House or let 
us finally see them table the documents officially, which is not 
the case at present.

confusing two or three different matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, he knows very well that a Minister may table a 
document, not that he must do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it was not a minister.  The hon. member ought to check 
with his leader, who no doubt is aware of this.  The documents 
were made public, not by a minister but by the ethics counsellor.

do exactly that; in other words, I will make the documents public

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as you know, I have been 
on my feet on a number of occasions, and would have been today 
during routine proceedings, regarding questions that I have 
placed on the order paper.  You are very familiar with this, Mr. 
Speaker.  I would like to refer you to yesterday's <I>Hansard</I>, 
page— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  If the hon. member is going 
to raise the same point again might I suggest that he wait until 
tomorrow's routine proceedings when we come to questions on the 
order paper.  I am sorry he was not here this morning and I must 
say I was sort of surprised he was not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do not think we should go into questions again now. 
Questions were dealt with this morning.  The House agreed to 
allow them all to stand, so it is off the face of the record, as 
it were, until tomorrow.  The hon. member will be free to raise 
the issue again then and I would invite him to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to listen to a lot.  The hon. member had better 
get to his point very  quickly if he has something new to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it goes beyond that.  It 
is misleading the House.  I have been informed that these 
questions were coming.  They have never been tabled.  Why not? 
How many times do I have— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member should have asked that this 
morning when the questions were allowed to stand.  If he had a 
question, that was the time to raise it, not now.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 2000 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK209">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-22, an 
Act to amend the Income Tax Act, the Income Tax Application 
Rules, certain Acts related to the Income Tax Act, the Canada 
Pension Plan, the Customs Act, the Excise Tax Act, the 
Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act and another Act 
related to the Excise Tax Act, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to be able to go on with my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying before you so politely interrupted me for 
question period, despite the expected downturn in the U.S. 
economy during the current year, the federal government has 
accumulated surpluses that will increase federal tax revenues 
over the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even using conservative estimates of federal tax revenues due to 
a possible economic downturn in Canada during the current year, 
we could get surpluses over the next five years totalling some 
$135 billion, and this is based on pessimistic estimates of 
economic growth rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying before question period, it is easy for a finance 
minister to accumulate surpluses when he does not need to make 
any special efforts. He only has to squeeze annual surpluses of 
$5 billion to $6 billion out of unemployed Canadians to create a 
budget surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was also able to save money by cutting provincial transfers 
for social and education programs. He has generated revenues 
since 1993 through hidden personal income tax increases, by 
refusing to index tax tables before last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This just goes to show that the Minister of Finance has 
incredible opportunities to make the right choices and promote 
social justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister knows full well, since he is the one who has been 
emptying the pockets of middle income families, that a 
large part of the tax reductions he brought in does not go to 
middle income families or to those families who made sacrifices 
by paying high taxes or by being subjected to EI cuts. They are 
not getting the share of surpluses to which they would be 
entitled if the government wanted to reward those who have been 
most responsible for putting our fiscal house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance could have taken exactly the same amount 
he intends to spend on tax reductions over the next five years, 
which is about $73 billion, to reduce taxes for low and middle 
income families.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to our own calculations, if the Minister of Finance 
redid his homework, he could bring in measures that would ensure 
that, as early as this year, families with an income of $35,000 
or less, particularly single parent families, would not pay a cent 
in federal income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They pay taxes now and they are not the ones who will benefit 
the most from tax reductions this year. Those who will benefit 
from significant tax reductions are those who make $250,000 and 
more. They will save at least $9,000 to $11,000 in taxes this 
year. For a single parent family with dependent children, we are 
talking about savings of some $250 this year. They 
are laughing in people's faces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also tantamount to laughing in the faces of nine out of ten 
taxpayers who have significantly helped to get Canada's public 
finances back in order and helped the finance minister amass huge 
surpluses, but are still unable to benefit from our financial 
house being put back in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The poor will still have to wait for social housing, since the 
Minister of Finance has announced no new measures in the last 
budget or in last fall's mini-budget to help thousands of 
families who are hurting because they have to spend too much 
money on shelter, compared to what they spend on basic needs like 
food, clothing and heating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Finance took over the department in 1993, 
about 500,000 households in Canada were spending more than 50% of 
their income on shelter. Nowadays, we have over 850,000 
households spending more than 50% of their income on shelter. 
What it means is that these people have to feed and clothe their 
children and heat their house with only half of their income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People spending more than 30% of their income on shelter are 
considered as the less fortunate since they have to cut spending 
on other basic needs in order to pay the rent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of these devastating figures, with estimated surpluses 
of some $135 billion over the next five years even with the 
expected downturn, why has the finance minister not thought about 
reinvesting in that area?

making it all the way to the end.  I hope, Mr. Speaker, that you 
will show some understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I was interrupted I was saying that when one puts 
30% of one's income into accommodation one is viewed as needing 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of such outrageous figures, which reveal that an 
additional almost 60% of homes in Canada spend over 50% of their 
income on accommodation, how is it the Minister of Finance did 
not give a moment's thought to spending a cent on social housing? 
It would have been easy to allocate $2 billion or $3 billion of 
the $135 billion expected surplus over the next five years.  Why 
did he not think of that?

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why, on the other hand, did he think to turn to the 
millionaires, people who are not having a hard time, people who 
do not need $9,000 or $11,000 in savings this year?  However, 
people earning less than $15,000 a year would certainly like to 
have had better housing for their family.  No, this is not one of 
the Minister of Finance's priorities, not at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the billions he has, how did he end up taking money out of 
the pockets of the unemployed, the disadvantaged and the sick, 
those who cannot benefit from proper transfers corresponding to 
the needs of the people in the health care sector? How did he end 
up picking the pockets of students, too, who could have used some 
of the manna going into the government coffers?  Why did the 
Minister of Finance not think of putting money into these 
sectors?  Why did he not give a moment's thought either to 
increasing Canada's contribution to international aid, which has 
shrunk since this heartless minister has been Minister of 
Finance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can this man continue to believe that the best way to fight 
poverty and unemployment is to continue to make off with the 
surplus in the employment insurance fund every year?  How can he 
not have given a minute's thought to doing something for the 57% 
of people who are excluded, the people out of work who are not 
eligible for employment insurance? It is because he needs the 
dough, because he needs to make use of the surplus to offer tax 
cuts to those with annual incomes of $250,000 and up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can this man not have thought that it would be a good idea 
to raise the old age pension, particularly for older women living 
alone? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Barely 16 months ago, a National Council on Welfare report 
informed us that the situation of seniors who are on their own, 
particularly the women, is getting worse, and that additional 
funding was needed to help them and keep us from returning to the 
vicious circle we were in prior to 1960s.  Back then, there was 
no safety net for these people.  How can this man still want to 
make women and children the first ones that have to pay? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance's reaction to that, when I said it the 
other day, was to laugh. 
I would love it if, at some point, the camera would catch his 
smile when we confront him with such evidence, when we tell him 
that women and children are paying for his negligence, when we 
tell him that his grabbing billions of dollars from the 
employment insurance surpluses, $38 billion since 1994, directly 
hits women and children first, and further marginalizes young 
people. He is still smiling. I would love it if the camera would 
catch him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also smiles when we tell him about elderly women living 
alone. There is nothing funny about the plight of elderly women 
living alone and getting increasingly poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did this man think of reducing taxes for millionaires before 
using money to help the poor and the homeless? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, an alderman from Hull, whom I salute and congratulate 
for his work, told us that in the Outaouais region there are not 
only more and more homeless people who lose their jobs, who lose 
everything, but that entire families are also homeless. There are 
no shelters for these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the Minister of Finance, who must know the Outaouais 
since he has been living here for several years, not to mention 
the fact that he is a member from Quebec, not think about using 
part of the billions that he is taking from the poor to build 
facilities to house these homeless families? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One sometimes wonders if the minister and his government have a 
heart. Mr. Speaker, you know what a heart is. You do. I am sure 
that you have one, but I sometimes have doubts about whether the 
Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see how priorities are set with regard to budget 
allocation and when we see the savage cuts in social programs, 
particularly income support programs, over the last few years, we 
cannot help but wonder if he has a heart. If he has one, he must 
have one since he appears to be alive and well, it is not in the 
right place, as my grandfather would have said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If his heart were in the right place, with the means available 
to him today to really meet the needs of those in difficulty, of 
middle income families that have been bled white by taxes for 
almost two decades, he could have made the right decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge him to go back to the drawing board and to make sure that 
these billions of dollars that will be coming are allocated in a 
way that will benefit the right people, low and middle income 
people, particularly families, as well as the unemployed. These 
people would benefit from a true reform of the EI plan, which now 
excludes 57% of the clientele it is supposed to serve. These 
funds should also be put toward full indexing of federal 
transfers for health, education and income security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of social housing, there are crying needs. Will our 
shouts be loud enough to make the finance minister understand 
that there are people in the street who are cold and hungry? Will 
we have to shout louder and louder to express the pain of those 
helpless people who cannot speak for themselves here, who cannot 
speak directly to this heartless government? How loud will we 
have to shout to express their pain? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There comes a time when we do not know anymore what data we should 
bring here, because we have the impression that the people 
opposite do not care. We can mention facts that speak for 
themselves, talk about the 25% increase in child poverty since 
they took office, the 60% increase in people who must spend more 
than 50% of their income for housing, we can tell them that 57% 
of the unemployed, mostly women, are excluded from EI benefits, 
the people across the way just do not care. What will it take to 
make them understand? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should not be so difficult for the Minister of Finance to 
re-examine his forecasts. Incidentally, he will be making an 
economic statement in May. I hope he will have the decency to 
stop taking us for morons and come up with concrete numbers. Even 
if these numbers are a bit pessimistic due to the U.S. economic 
downturn, I hope he will not have the outrageous idea to try to 
pull the wool over our eyes once again. I hope he will not take 
us for what we are not and take Canadians for fools. At one 
point, one has to stop laughing at people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, he said that it was a good thing he made conservative 
forecasts in spite of the fact that the opposition blamed him for 
being cautious. However there is a difference between being cautious 
and hiding the facts. There is a difference between being 
cautious and accurately stating the facts. There is a difference 
between being cautious and being cynical when people say they 
need information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has shown cynicism these past few years 
by forecasting surpluses that were half the real surpluses. 
I even remember one time when, within a six month period, the 
finance minister, who claims to be competent, open and 
transparent, was off by 130% in his surplus forecast for a four 
or four and a half month period. Who was he trying to kid? He 
said he was happy he erred on the side of caution. What caution? 
He was not the least bit cautious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has spent the surplus he has creamed off the EI fund, to the 
tune of $38 billion since 1994. He has put it towards debt 
reduction. He has used it to lower taxes to millionaires. Where 
is this so-called caution? Where is the EI cushion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suppose there is a downturn in the economy resulting in an 
increase in the number of unemployed, then we will need more 
money to help them. Where is the cushion to do that? It is gone. 
Where is the finance minister's caution? It has gone by the 
wayside.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give you the real numbers. Before the downturn in the 
U.S. economy, we were expecting a surplus of roughly $148 billion 
over the next five years. For once we were in agreement with the 
finance minister, and we will not start arguing about a few comas 
or decimal points. With this year's downturn, and we have also 
taken into account next year's downturn and a normal real growth 
of the GDP, the gross domestic product, we came up with a 
projected surplus of $136 billion at worst. This would mean a 
shortfall of about $12 billion over five years. A little over two 
billion a year is not that bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the finance minister would only stop lowering the taxes for 
the rich and use the bulk of the surplus to lower the taxes for 
middle and low income earners, invest in social housing, correct 
the inequities and injustices of the employment insurance 
system, and index the health, education and income security 
transfers, there would be no problem. Every year he could even 
pay back some of the federal accumulated debt. He would be able 
to do that. He better not come up with numbers lower than this 
projected surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he does, we will travel across Quebec, and Canada if 
necessary, to let everybody know that the finance minister is 
taking everybody for a ride. People are not stupid. He should 
take his responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, we will be voting against Bill C-22 because it 
does not serve the interests of the majority of taxpayers. When 
they talk about tax reductions, we must know to whom they are 
addressed. They are for the finance minister's friends. It is not 
you and me, it is not middle income families, it is not low 
income families. They will get almost nothing this year. It is 
the people who earn $250,000 and more who are benefiting from 
these cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to his tax reduction plan, the finance minister should 
go back, take a good look in the mirror and ask himself if he is 
proud of what he did. I am sure the mirror would tell him that he 
is not proud of himself. He will have a second thing to do: sit 
down at his desk, do his homework again and rethink the tax cuts, 
give them to low and middle income people and consider the 
unemployed. For once, he should have the heart to look at what he 
has done since the beginning of his mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a good idea if he started having more feelings, if 
he behaved a little more like a human being, if he developed a 
little of what is called social partnership. I do not know if he 
is aware of this concept. He talks about compassion, a more 
liberal and bourgeois value. However social partnership means 
partnering with people who live in poverty to try to bring them 
some relief. He is in a major position and he could bring some 
relief to these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply ask him to reconsider his past decisions, to do his 
homework over and to reflect on what I have told him: to help 
people, to bring them some relief, to demonstrate some social 
partnership and to show some heart. It seems to me that this is 
easy, that one does not need magic to do it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to say a few words about the budget 
implementation bill.  Like my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois, 
I wish to indicate that the NDP will also be opposing the bill at 
second reading because it speaks to the general economic 
direction and position of the Government of Canada.  The bill 
tells us what the government and House of Commons priorities 
should be in terms of the direction of our economy for the next 
three to five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance believes that the most important 
priority is to have a massive tax cut of around $100 billion over 
the next four years.  That is not in sync with what Canadians are 
saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on public opinion polls and from speaking with people on 
the street the most important priority is not a tax cut primarily 
directed at the wealthy, unless they are members of the Canadian 
Alliance.  That is their big priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance has convinced the government that the number one 
priority is to cut taxes massively.  That is being applauded 
enthusiastically by one member of the Canadian Alliance from 
Manitoba.  What I am saying must therefore be accurate.  However, 
the Canadian Alliance priority, and now the government's 
priority, is not in sync with what Canadians want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen in all the polls where approximately 7% or 8% of 
the people say that the most important priority is to cut taxes.

care, in education and in the environment.  They want to invest 
in our farmers who are in the biggest crisis since the 1930s. 
Those are their priorities and those are the areas they want us 
to spend the important part of the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of tax cuts, Canadians want a more progressive and fair 
tax system.  They do not want the flat tax system that has been 
advocated by the Canadian Alliance.  The minister himself is 
going in the direction of having a flat tax.  He is doing this by 
changing the taxation regime in terms of capital gains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until recently, 75% of capital gains was included in taxable 
income.  If someone made $10,000, $100,000 or $1 million on the 
stock market or anywhere else, 75% of that was included in the 
taxable income and taxed at the marginal tax rate.  Now the 
minister would reduce that to two-thirds of capital gains, 
instead of 75%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that was not good enough, in the mini statement last fall he 
reduced it from two-thirds to 50% of capital gains.  If someone 
happens to be a very wealthy dishwasher in a restaurant and 
happens to make $1 million in capital gains, only half of that 
would be included.  That is what the minister thinks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are very few ordinary people who would be able take 
advantage of this tax change.  It would help the wealthy. They 
would get the biggest bang for their buck in terms of having 
their taxes reduced, and reduced drastically.  The major measure 
in the bill would be a tax cut for the wealthy, for people who 
make a lot of money in capital gains, for the bankers, for the 
large corporations and for the privileged.  This is happening 
under a Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I know you have been a member for a while and you 
would probably agree with me that what we have across the way is 
probably the most conservative Liberal government in the history 
of the country.  It is much more conservative than the 
governments of Pierre Trudeau, Lester Pearson or Liberal 
governments that went before.  It is more conservative because of 
the agenda of the Reform Party and the Alliance that are driving 
it to the right.  That is what is happening and that is why the 
issue has to be debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member who spoke before me, that the 
priorities of the government are wrong.  Canadians do not want to 
spend almost all the fiscal resources that we have, two-thirds or 
three-quarters, maybe 80% or 90%, depending on how strong the 
economy is with the recession or near recession we are entering 
into, in terms of a massive tax cut.  The want the money to be 
spent on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go back to 1995, the government across the way, again on 
the advice of the Reform Party, massively cut expenditures to 
health in terms of transfers to the provinces.  Canadians want 
those transfers to the provinces increased.  They want the best 
first class health care system anywhere in the world to be 
restored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I turn to another big issue that the government is ignoring 
because of the tremendous priority placed on massive tax cuts, 
and that is aid to the farmers.  A little while ago the 
government announced some $500 million to farmers.  Our farmers, 
particularly the grain and oilseed farmers, are going through the 
biggest crisis that they have gone through since the 1930s. As a 
result of that crisis, many farmers have now left the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between the fall 1999 and the fall 2000, over 20,000 farmers in 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta have been forced off the land, 
largely because of federal government policy that is not 
supporting our farmers like it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few days ago there was an article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
which stated that the American government supports its farmers or 
subsidizes the grain farmers to the tune of eight times more than 
we do.  That is why American farmers are better off.  The 
European farmers are better off yet in terms of money that they 
get from Brussels.  The government across the way is staring a 
big farm crisis in the face and instead of providing more money 
for the farmers, $1 billion or $1.5 billion instead of $500 
million, it is giving $100 billion in tax cuts, many to the 
wealthy and the big corporations. 
That is wrong and that is why we should be changing the economic 
and fiscal direction of the Government of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the bill is all about.  We are implementing the 
fiscal moves and the taxation cuts of the Minister of Finance. 
What he is doing is wrong in terms of the direction of Canada. We 
only have so much money.  We only have a pie of a certain size. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If $100 billion goes into cutting taxes, how much will be left 
for farmers and for health care?  How much will be left to fight 
poverty and to fight the problems of the environment which are 
worsening day in and day out?  We do not have a very proud record 
in terms of the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If $100 billion goes into cutting taxes and padding the pockets 
of big bankers and the wealthy, how much will be left for the 
first nations and the Metis?  How much will be left for social 
housing, students, tuition fees and the education system?  How 
much will be left for science and technology in terms of research 
and development?  How much will be left for the infrastructure 
needs in the towns, cities and municipalities?  How much will be 
left for fishermen on the east and west coasts, for the lumbering 
industry in British Columbia and elsewhere, or for the mining 
industry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we spend $100 billion out of $100 billion, depending upon the 
slowdown in the economy, or $100 billion out of $130 billion if 
the economy does not slow down as much as feared by many people, 
how much will be left for the real priorities of Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have the government party and the official opposition 
party applauding a massive tax cut—in fact the opposition wants 
an even larger tax cut than provided by the Minister of 
Finance—it shows how out of touch those parties are with the 
priorities and needs of ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to have money invested in people.  They want a 
people's agenda.  In 1995, when the present Minister of Finance 
brought down his budget, it was the people of the country who 
suffered through the most massive cutbacks we have ever had by a 
federal government in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of those cutbacks had to occur because of the tremendous 
problem of the debt and the deficit, but instead of just cutting 
back in a more moderate and selective way we had the slash and 
burn policy by the minister across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Liberal friend from Winnipeg was horrified by the big cuts to 
the health care system.  He knows the health care system very 
well.  My Liberal friend from Peterborough was horrified by the 
cutbacks in transfers in terms of education.  He knows 
post-secondary education very well, being an old professor from 
Trent University in Peterborough.  When I say old, I mean a man 
with a lot of seniority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a parliamentary system where government members have to 
sit on their hands, be mute and say “Aye, aye, good soldier” 
when they vote in the House of Commons on particular bills. It is 
up to us to try to persuade the Minister of Finance of the error 
of his ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last decade, the decade of the nineties we saw the gap 
between the rich and the poor widening once again.  Throughout 
the sixties, seventies and into the eighties the gap between the 
wealthy and the poor was narrowing.  In the sixties and into the 
seventies we had the advent of proper old age pensions and the 
Canada pension plan.  Between 1972 and 1974 we had a minority 
parliament with the Liberals and NDP working in combination.  We 
had the indexing of social programs like the old age pension and 
an increase of transfers to the provinces for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the real emphasis on social policy and on social 
justice we saw the gap between the rich and the poor narrow 
throughout the sixties, seventies and into the eighties.  What 
happened in the nineties, particularly after 1995?  There has 
been a widening of the gap between the rich and the poor, where 
the wealthiest 20% of the people are making more and more of the 
national income and the poorest 20% of the people are making less 
and less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One only has to look at two studies, one by Statistics Canada 
and one by the Vanier Institute of the Family.  Both had the same 
conclusion.  The gap between the rich and the poor was widening 
and not narrowing throughout the nineties.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the budget, taxation and monetary and fiscal 
policy, we should be looking at how we can narrow the gap between 
the rich and the poor.  We should look at how we give more 
opportunities to each and every single Canadian.  We should look 
at how we can create more of a common good in terms of our 
policies, in terms of greater equality of condition and sharing 
and opportunities for every Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead we are going the other way.  We are creating more and 
more poor and disadvantaged people.  All one has to do is go to 
the inner cities of Regina, Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal or 
Winnipeg to see that there are more homeless people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Walking from my hotel this morning, I saw a couple of homeless 
people sitting on the street begging for money.  It was around 
7.30 a.m or 8.00 a.m.  That is a common scene in Ottawa and it is 
only two or three blocks away from Parliament Hill.  Yet we have 
the Canadian Alliance and the government saying we need more 
money for big tax cuts for the wealthy. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik comes from a 
relatively poor riding.  When the Minister of Finance decided to 
cut taxes for the rich and large corporations in Canada, the 
member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik stayed in his seat and 
did not say a single word about the fiscal policy of the Canadian 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for a member such as him, who represents a region 
where there is much poverty, to stand up and tell the finance 
minister that his fiscal policy is all wrong, that it is unfair 
for the country, that it is inequitable for Canadians. 
We do not see that happening in the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the widening gap between the rich and the poor.  I 
mentioned the cutbacks in education and health.  I mentioned the 
cutbacks to our farmers.  We had millions of dollars cut from 
farm programs in the last number of years.  I believe the time 
has come to reverse the direction of the Government of Canada and 
to once again start investing in programs that help ordinary 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of having a $100 billion tax cut, let us spend most of 
that money on health care and education, on opportunities for low 
income people and on giving opportunities to the first nations 
and the Metis people, who in many cases live in situations that 
are very similar to countries in the Third World. We are not 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are still parts of the country where the unemployment rate 
is much too high.  There are more and more soup kitchens.  There 
are more people living on the streets.  There are more shelters 
for homeless people and more food banks.  These are opening all 
the time.  At the same time we see the closures of bank branches, 
we see the opening of food banks.  All this is happening in a 
country that is extremely wealthy and in a country with 
tremendous advantages, education and resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need now is the public policy to make the proper 
decisions.  We need to invest in our people.  We need to invest 
in our farmers to make sure they have the equality of condition 
with the American and European farmers, which would put them on a 
level playing field.  If we do that, the farmer will produce. 
Farmers will be selling their products and creating jobs in urban 
Canada. This will benefit the whole economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to invest in health care and education.  We need to 
invest in the people to create in the future the most highly 
skilled workforce in the world second to none.  If we do that, we 
will be a stronger, more viable country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to what the member opposite had to 
say.  I appreciated his mentioning me even though it was in a 
slightly disparaging way.  He talked about tax cuts, tax changes 
and things of this type.  I would like to ask him a few 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, what are his thoughts about the extension of parental 
leave to 12 months?  That is a measure which involves an 
expenditure by the government and, by the way, by others.  There 
was an increase in the disabled tax credit, which I was very 
pleased about.  That is a tax cut and a tax measure.  The 
caregivers tax credit, which is still a fairly new thing, will 
increase.  He also mentioned if I interest in higher education. 
We have increased the student tax credit.  All these are tax cuts 
by the government. 
Not that he is old, but I know of his enormous experience in the 
House of Commons.  I think he was here before anyone who is 
present here at the moment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed the Speech from the Throne mentioned the lifelong 
learning account.  The idea, as I understood it, is that each of 
us should have something like an RESP where we could put money 
aside in the same way as we do with an RRSP, so that our children 
could use the tax free funds for their education.  This money 
would be tax free as long as it was used for furthering our 
educational opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the hon. member think about that proposed tax measure? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are many things in 
the Speech from the Throne and the budget that one agrees with. 
Anything that tries to redistribute income and wealth to make 
this a more fair and egalitarian society, I agree with.  Some of 
those measures are very positive like reinvesting in the social 
fabric of our country and in the people's agenda. However, a lot 
of these things were cut back in the budget of 1995, as the 
member across the way knows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we have a fiscal surplus of well over $100 billion 
projected for the next five years, most of the money, maybe 75% 
or 80% of the it, should be invested be invested in people. These 
are good examples of where some of the money is going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My quarrel with the government is that instead of putting 75% or 
80% of the money into social programs, infrastructure, farm 
programs, programs to help students, education, science and 
technology, research and development, health care and so on to 
rebuild the social infrastructure and human deficit, the 
government has gone the other way by putting 75% or 80% into tax 
cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in having some changes in tax fairness and a more 
progressive tax system.  Rolling back the GST is a good example 
of that.  We should create more marginal tax rates.  Instead of 
having three we should have five.  This would be a more 
progressive tax system.  We should make sure we have tax 
fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, my quarrel with the government is its priority.  It has 
not done that.  Most of the money is going to cut taxes, a lot of 
which is for the wealthy people.  It is not going to the ordinary 
farmer in Prince Edward Island who is having problems with the 
trade war on potatoes with the Americans.  It is not going to the 
ordinary farmer.  In many cases the money is going to people who 
do not need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, wealthy people do not need big tax cuts.  They invest it 
often in offshore stock markets or projects.  Second, with 
respect to stimulating the economy, the middle class the 
household debts are now at the highest level I think they have 
ever been.  Their tax cuts will go to pay down some of the 
household debts and this does not stimulate the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For low income people, of course the tax cut is a stimulative 
measure but they get little of that tax cut.  At a time when the 
economy needs to be stimulated, when it needs a shot in the arm, 
these overall across the board tax cuts of the Minister of 
Finance are not the way to go.  The way to go is to put the money 
into people to build up our human infrastructure.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise today to speak on Bill C-22. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments to the Income Tax Act represent a collection of 
baby steps, some of which are in the right direction.  Some 
represent a significant further complication of an already far 
too complicated tax code.  Most represent politics and the 
triumph of politics over public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the general direction of these tax measures, we 
will find that there is no general direction to the these 
measures.  In fact, they resulted from a flimsily put together 
pre-election document, sometimes referred to as a mini budget. It 
is referred to as a mini budget but I suggest it reflects the 
government's mini vision of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is these baby steps, these tinkerings, these policies 
do not reflect what Canadians need and are particularly not what 
the tax code needs.  We need a significant level of tax reform in 
Canada.  Tax reform can be used as a vehicle for economic growth. 
Instead of making tax tinkering part of its pre-election policy, 
Canadians would be better served if the government was to utilize 
tax reform as a vehicle for long term economic growth.  That 
would benefit all Canadians and improve our competitiveness 
globally.  These tax measures do not do much to provide for 
greater long term competitiveness for the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the government's record since the election in 1993 
relative to international confidence in Canada's economy, the 
most damning reflection or gauge by which to judge the government 
is our falling dollar and the fact that under this government our 
dollar has lost over 11 cents of value.  That is the dollar 
reflects the share value of Canada Inc.  Under this government we 
have seen an 11 cent decline in our country's dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time there is a loss in the value of the Canadian dollar 
in comparison to the U.S. that leads to a pay cut for every 
Canadian.  We depend greatly on the goods and services we consume 
from our neighbours to the south.  A loss in the dollar 
represents a direct loss in our standard of living and ultimately 
in our quality of life in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax policy and fiscal policy provide a very important key to 
providing long term strengthening of the dollar.  The government 
refuses to discuss the falling Canadian dollar under the guise of 
deferring to the Governor of the Bank of Canada and his 
responsibility over monitoring policy.  Fiscal policy levers in 
the long term are as important as monetary policy levers in 
providing long term strength to the Canadian dollar.  The 
importance of fiscal policy, that is tax and debt policies and 
strategic spending policies to the long term strengthening of the 
Canadian economy, is where the government's record has been a 
less than impressive one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the types of tax reform measures that we would like to 
see and that would make a great deal of sense are those that 
address some of the most pernicious and uncompetitive natures of 
our Canadian tax burden.  One is our capital gains tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even after there was some tinkering in this economic statement 
and some reduction of capital gains taxes, we still have a higher 
tax burden in capital gains than the U.S.  For the government to 
eliminate personal capital gains tax would cost the federal 
treasury about $4 billion a year.  This would put us ahead of the 
U.S. in a very important area of taxation, particularly in areas 
of new economy, biotechnology and in some of these other areas 
that are emerging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of encouraging new economy venture investments, 
particularly during a time when market conditions are so 
turbulent and we need to try to provide whatever incentives we 
can to maintain early investors' interest in these areas, the 
elimination of personal capital gains tax would provide a great 
incentive for Canadians to invest and help continue to grow the 
economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be even more important now than it was a few months ago 
as we see the economic downturn that we are experiencing in 
Canada, in the U.S. and indeed globally at this point.  It 
becomes even more important in some areas.  I have referred in a 
specific sense to capital gains taxation.  It is even more 
important now that we try, for once, to be ahead of the U.S. as 
opposed to constantly trying to keep up and in fact always being 
a couple of steps behind.  That is one area where we would have 
liked to have seen a more dramatic and visionary step as opposed 
to the tinkering the government has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that most of these tax measures occur over a five 
year period.  If hon. members look at the degree to which these 
tax reductions will impact Canadians in the short term, it is 
actually much less than what the government would like Canadians 
to believe, particularly when combined with the payroll tax hikes 
that became effective recently with the CPP payroll tax hikes. It 
is clear that the net tax benefit or the net benefit to Canadians 
in a take home pay context is minimal or in fact none if members 
again take into account payroll taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever way the government would like Canadians to view these 
measures, it will become painfully obvious to Canadian taxpayers 
when they are receiving their cheques and with their tax 
deductions that these measures have been half measures and have 
not really addressed the fundamental issues of high taxes in 
Canada.  Canadians have the highest income taxes in the G-7 and 
the second highest corporate taxes in the OECD.  Even after full 
implementation of these tax measures over a five year period, we 
would still end up having about the third highest corporate taxes 
in the OECD.  That is assuming that none of the other countries 
reduce their tax burdens, and we already are aware that at least 
seven of them are entertaining and moving toward lower taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even as we see a slight narrowing of the gap between Canada and 
the U.S. in terms of tax burden in the short term, we see the 
U.S. now introducing the largest tax cut in its history.  The tax 
cut is being negotiated currently and is making progress through 
congress.  We are still behind.  The mini budget introduced prior 
to the last election did not do much to get us caught up to the 
U.S. economy in the current context and yet we are now going to 
see, under President Bush, a leapfrogging further ahead.  Again, 
Canada will be further behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent report from the Fraser Institute drew, in a convincing 
way, a direct linkage between Canada's low dollar and Canada's 
systemically high levels of taxation on all fronts.  We have yet 
to see a firm commitment from the government, not just on tax 
reform as a vehicle for long term strengthening of the Canadian 
economy, but also for debt reduction.  Debt reduction, when we 
have approximately four times the per capita debt of the U.S., 
should be a much higher priority than the government has made it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, many of these tax reduction measures are simply 
spending measures in the form of targeted tax cuts.  Rewarding a 
particular kind of behaviour is nothing more than spending.  It 
is another way to encourage people to do something that they may 
not do otherwise.  People end up making decisions based on tax 
policy as opposed to what makes sense from a business policy, 
from an investment policy or from a personal perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is, this mini budget, this pre-election document, was 
far from what Canadians needed in the most turbulent February we 
have seen in the last seven years.  In the last seven years there 
has not been a worse February for the government to avoid having 
a budget in than this last February, when the government ducked 
the issue and decided arbitrarily not to have a budget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is, Canadians, particularly with the difference in the 
economic conditions between the time when the mini budget was 
introduced and today, need a budget more than ever.  Whether it 
is the decline in the global capital markets or the dramatic 
declines in the TSE, the NASDAQ and the New York stock exchange, 
Canadian investors and individual Canadians have seen their 
retirement savings diminish sharply in recent weeks.  At the same 
time, they are seeing their standard of living decline because of 
a weakening dollar.  There is a significant and reasonable 
concern among Canadians which should be addressed, not through an 
economic statement in the spring and not through a state of the 
union address which the finance minister has talked about 
providing, but through a full budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also offensive from a democratic accountability 
perspective, because this parliament, with its new members in 
some cases, has not actually been asked to approve a budget 
introduced after the last election.  There are a number of new 
members of parliament in the House and government spending and 
government estimates ultimately should be accountable to this 
place, to parliament.  For the government to determine that it is 
not important to engage parliamentarians in the approval of 
government spending and tax policy through the support of a 
ratification of a budget in the House is really and truly 
offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of reasons why we have concerns with the 
government's policies, with its tax policies and general fiscal 
policies.  However, these concerns are not just our concerns. 
These are concerns shared by many Canadians, particularly by some 
of Canada's top economists.  We are seeing a unified front from 
Canada's economists relative to the lackadaisical approach of the 
government on specific tax policies.  In the words of Terence 
Corcoran, a journalist, “If weak currency created growth, Canada 
would be a world leader”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister once said that a weak dollar is actually good 
for tourism.  I think this indicates his economic naiveté but 
also his genuine belief that a country can devalue its way to 
prosperity.  The fact is, a weak dollar is no way to guarantee 
long term growth and an increase in the standard of living of a 
people.  In fact, it is quite the contrary.  If the Prime 
Minister's argument is correct, that somehow reducing the dollar 
can improve tourism, let us think about this.  The logical 
corollary of his argument is that if we would reduce the dollar 
to zero ultimately we could become the largest exporting nation 
and the most successful exporting nation in the world.  Of course 
we would be giving away our products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister said in 1990, I believe at the time when he 
was running for the Liberal leadership the first time, that he 
would, if given the opportunity, manage the dollar's decline down 
to its natural level of about 78 cents to 80 cents.  He has done 
so well that he has managed the dollar's decline down to the 63 
cent range.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are asking a legitimate question.  They want to know 
why the finance minister is not doing more to strengthen the 
intrinsic value of the Canadian dollar as opposed to accepting 
its decline.  Is it that the Liberal government has accepted that 
currencies such as Canada's will in the long term be marginalized 
and that the best way to get rid of the independent Canadian 
dollar is to simply euthanize it, to let it wither on the vine 
and let it decline to such a level that Canadians will say, as 
they have already started to say, they would be better off with a 
common North American currency? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe we would be better off with a common North 
American currency.  To give up our monetary policy levers would 
be a mistake.  If we give up our floating currency with the U.S., 
there needs to be another operative mechanism to reflect things. 
For instance, the commodity crisis that occurred about two years 
ago in Asia would have manifested itself not in a reduced 
Canadian dollar at that point, but in higher levels of 
unemployment.  Without the floating Canadian dollar, I would 
argue that the operative mechanism that would reflect differing 
levels of productivity or commodity price valuations would be 
unemployment rates.  I am concerned about the notion of losing 
that very important tenet of economic sovereignty that is the 
independent monetary policy and the Canadian dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the government watch over the decline of the Canadian 
dollar and not defend it?  If we in this place do not take steps 
to strengthen the Canadian dollar in the long term through more 
aggressive and innovative tax and debt reduction policies and 
more innovative tax reform packages, and if we do not deal with 
this in a more forward thinking and visionary way, we and 
certainly the government will have to accept the blame for the 
Canadian dollar withering on the vine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At some point, and I am not sure when it will be, if we continue 
to see the cyclical decline of the Canadian dollar, Canadians are 
going to ask why we have an independent currency.  I do not want 
to see us get to that stage and I am concerned that we are 
precariously close to that position right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a government that has seen the Canadian dollar drop by over 
11 cents under its seven year term, it is important to remind the 
government that under the previous Mulroney government the dollar 
lost only one cent during the same period of time.  If the value 
of a country's currency reflects global investor confidence in 
that country, I would suggest that investors do not have a great 
deal of long term confidence in the government.

Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find it strangely ironic that 
parties on the right, if we want to call it that, always talk 
about the Canadian dollar.  Of course there is a concern about 
the Canadian dollar, but on the one hand those members talk about 
the markets and how we should worship at the altar of the 
markets, but in the same breath they talk about how the 
government should be doing something about the Canadian dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the member is not indicating this to the House, he 
knows that recently the Canadian dollar has actually been doing 
better than other currencies.  I am talking about the European 
currencies, the euro, and the Australian dollar and the New 
Zealand currency.  That is nothing to take a lot of relief from, 
but we do know the story, and that is that people are flocking to 
the U.S. dollar as a safe haven, which is strangely ironic in the 
context of the marketplace because markets in the U.S. are taking 
a beating and some of the economic fundamentals are not 
terrifically strong.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, there we have it.  It is a migration to the U.S. 
dollar.  The member for Kings—Hants talked about income taxes. 
This bill implements the $100 billion tax reduction package so 
that average Canadians will see their personal income taxes 
reduced by 21% and Canadians with families will see theirs 
reduced by 27%.  No matter how we cut it, that is a very large 
cut in personal income taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have five small questions, if I may.  The member talked about 
taxes.  I wonder if he forgot that large businesses in Canada on 
average pay 5% less income tax than those in the U.S.  I wonder 
if he neglected to mention that for small businesses earning up 
to $75,000 a year corporate taxes in Canada and the U.S. are 
similar but that for small businesses above $75,000 corporate 
rates in Canada are significantly lower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if he forgot to mention that capital gains in Canada 
are two percentage points lower than the average top tax rate.  I 
wonder if he forgot to mention the more generous treatment for 
employee stock options here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if he neglected, just as an oversight, to mention the 
permanent 20% research and development tax credit for all R and D 
expenditures in Canada, a country with one of the most 
progressive and advantageous R and D regimes in the world.  I 
wonder if he forgot that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the parliamentary 
secretary for his question.  He is quite right.  The Canadian 
dollar is doing very well compared to the ruble.  That being the 
case, I suggest to the hon. member that there are other measures 
we should use.  One might be the U.S. dollar, given the degree to 
which our trade relationship with the U.S. exceeds our trade 
relationship with Russia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For our dollar to be strong relative to the ruble, as my 
grandfather used to say, is like peeing oneself in a dark suit. 
It gives one a nice, warm feeling, but nobody knows.  It does not 
make any difference.  That is not why, I am sure, the hon. member 
is wearing a dark suit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said I had neglected to mention a few points.  The 
reason I neglected to mention that taxes are lower in Canada than 
in the U.S. was because they are not.  There is a reason we 
neglect to mention things we know are absolutely, completely and 
utterly false.  Because I understand the differences between tax 
levels in Canada and those in the U.S., I neglected to mention 
some of the mistruths he introduced in the House today.  I am 
certain those mistruths were unintentional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our capital gains taxes, regardless of income level, are still 
considerably higher than those in the U.S.  Our corporate tax 
burden is still the third highest of the 31 OECD countries, and 
after five years of tax reduction it will still be about the 
third highest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still have some of the highest marginal tax rates for 
successful Canadians.  If we look at basic levels of income, 
Canada's cutoff point for taxing low income earners is about 
$3,000 lower than in the U.S.  In Canadian dollars the difference 
is closer to $4,000.  The hon. member would like to think, I am 
certain, that we are a kinder and gentler nation, but Canada 
taxes low income earners far more harshly than does the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While he crows about the baby steps his government has taken in 
the right direction, I suggest he should remember that a tortoise 
moving in the right direction on the autobahn is still roadkill.

Speaker, there are two methods by which the dollar could go up 
immediately.   We could raise interest rates or we could cash in 
the 63 cent dollar right now, join the United States and allow 
Washington to make decisions for us.  I wonder if that is a 
method the member thinks we should use to get our dollar up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  No, I certainly do not support a single North 
American currency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not looking for a short term, band-aid solution for the 
dollar but a long term strengthening of our currency through 
fiscal policy levers.  I would certainly not present fiscal 
policy as an immediate overnight solution to strengthening the 
dollar, but in the long term it can have a significant impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are only two levers we can use to strengthen our dollar in 
the long or short term:  monetary policy, which is in the hands 
of the Bank of Canada, or fiscal policy whether in tax and debt 
reduction policies or spending policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the policies that in the long term will require vision 
and commitment.  If we are to strengthen Canada in a comparative 
sense, particularly with regard to tax policy, we must cut not 
only taxes which are politically unpalatable but those which have 
the most deleterious impact on long term growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, reducing our debt over the long term, not simply as a 
percentage of GDP but in real terms, would have a significant 
impact on strengthening the Canadian dollar.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would not want to pass up this opportunity to speak to 
Bill C-22, the Income Tax Amendments Act, 2000, which was 
recently tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have examples from families in resource regions.  I have here 
letters written in September and addressed to the Minister of 
Finance of Canada.  Other letters were addressed to the Minister 
of Finance of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to pit provinces against provinces, but as a 
result of the changes made by the Quebec government to its 
family policy in 1998, the amount of the Canada child tax 
benefit has been lowered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I received a letter from Clémence Côté. Her husband, Louis 
Germain, works in the mining industry in Val-d'Or. She said 
“Today, my children are being penalized”. One must understand 
what it means when someone writes that her children are being 
penalized. She wrote “Today, my children are being penalized by 
the Canadian tax system. I have a large family; I have 10 
children. Dear Minister, I would like to ask you for an 
exemption so that I may receive the full amount of the Canada 
child tax benefit regardless of our family income”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian tax system does not make allowances for families 
with 10 children or some have 11 or 12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her husband, who makes a good living working in the mines, earns 
in excess of $60,000, $62,000 or $63,000, and does overtime in 
order to help finance his children's education. With 10 
children, a mother has a lot of work at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This mine worker, Mr. Germain, does a lot of overtime because 
several of his children are in school and have been allowed to 
take up only one sport either at school or at the community 
level. Even if a child wanted to take up two or three sports, 
his parents could not afford to pay for it. The same is true of 
transportation for children who go to school in Val-d'Or. She 
pays the school board for their transportation and she still has 
to pay back her benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I found bizarre in all this is that several years ago, as a 
result of a 1999 letter from the Minister of National Revenue, 
they asked why the Canada child tax benefit had been changed in 
Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial governments may enter into agreements with the 
Government of Canada to change the amount of the Canada child tax 
benefit that their residents will receive depending on the number 
or the age of children, or both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before July 1998, the method used to calculate the benefit was 
different for Alberta and Quebec compared to the other provinces 
and territories. These two provinces had chosen a calculation 
method based on the age of the child and his or her rank in the 
family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that, before July 1998, Quebec residents were 
entitled to a base benefit of $869 for the first child, $1,000 
for the second child, and $1,597 for the third child and each 
subsequent child. After making changes to its family policy, the 
government of Quebec advised the Minister of Finance of Canada 
that, starting in July 1998, the benefit paid to Quebec residents 
would no longer be based on the rank and age of the child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the Canada child tax benefit is calculated the same way for 
Quebec residents as for residents of other provinces and 
territories, except Alberta. The base benefit is now $1,020 per 
child, regardless of his or her rank in the family, since the 
amount of the Canada child tax benefit to which a family is 
entitled has been reduced following a decision made by the 
government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of the two jurisdictions, we must realize that 
several families in Quebec have seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, 
twelve or thirteen children. They have to repay the tax benefits 
when the husband's income is too high, because of overtime work 
especially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the message I want to send. We have to find a way to 
help large families. Nowadays, families with five or six children 
are considered large families. For families with ten children, 
the Government of Canada should find way, through some kind of 
exemption, to help them out, especially in resource regions, but 
also in urban areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know how much it costs to look after children's 
education or to enrol them in a sport program. That is the 
message I want to send. We should take into account the number of 
children in all Canadian families. We count one, two, three, and 
then it seems that senior officials tell their ministers “We 
stop at three. Passed the third or fourth kid, it does not make 
any difference”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, it is important, which is why I want to send a 
message to the finance minister. We need to find a way to help 
out these large families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think members will find it surprising that I want to 
address another issue here today. A poll published on March 9, 
2001, and I mention the year because some people might think it 
was carried out a number of years ago, show that four out of five 
Quebecers are in favour of a salary being paid to the stay at 
home parent. At least 82% of those surveyed said they strongly or 
somewhat agreed that a salary should be paid to the parent who 
stays at home to take care of the kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why? There is another way about it. I have made several speeches 
on this issue in the House. 
I have tabled motions and petitions to have a salary paid to the 
parent, mother or father, who stays at home to raise children. 
This would actually help reduce poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw an article written by a woman who lives in Montreal, which 
said “The important thing is to be at home with the children 
during their first three years of life”. Parents are given a one 
year parental leave. What should we pay a person who stays at 
home? Maybe we could, like Germany or other countries, provide a 
supplement of $250 a week in order to help the family or the 
person who stays at home with the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to raise one final point. It is the issue of 
pensions, those paid to seniors living below the poverty line. 
Steps should be taken to increase their income upon reaching 
retirement age, especially after retiring. 
Members will recall that a few years ago, we had interest rates 
of 16%, 17% and 20%, and things were going pretty well. Today, 
retired seniors are relying on assets deposited in banks or 
invested mutual funds with a 2% or 3% rate of return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why a majority of Canadians are in favour of pension 
reform.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing is to raise pensions, to reform the pension 
system so that people, and particularly seniors, have a decent 
income. Some single seniors always receive the same amount. 
Sometimes, their cheque is increased by $1.04 for a three month 
period, as a cost of living adjustment. The pension system 
should be reformed and people should have a decent income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I mentioned these three cases. We often hear about 
them in my community. Long term solutions must be found.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member a question with respect to what 
he was saying.  He was talking about the problem of mothers and 
fathers who want to stay home with their children after the one 
year is up.  Under the Liberal scheme, the only way that could be 
arranged is to have a child every year.  The limit is a year.  If 
a person has not worked in between, then they would probably be 
ineligible.  After the first year, the second and third child 
that may come would not be eligible for those benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member have any solution to that quite clear dilemma in 
the Liberal plan? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Mr. Speaker, nobody can replace the mother 
during the first three years in the life of children.

with the opposition parties in order to find real long term 
solutions. Now is the time to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned the first year, but I can tell members that all 
Canadians think it is important that a mother stay at home 
during the first three years of her children's life.

<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to speak in the debate.  The Liberal 
government is getting slack.  This morning we debated a bill 
which was over 900 pages in length.  This little itty-bitty bill 
of 500 pages now seems like child's play in comparison.  My party 
will have a look at it.  We are debating it for the first time 
today, so the debate is on general principles.  After this it 
will go to the finance committee where some of the details will 
be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole study of taxation is intriguing in the academic sense. 
We have come to accept a level of taxation that is on the verge 
of being obscene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have told this story in the House before, and if any members 
recall it, my apologies, but it is very important.  About three 
or four years ago I gave one of those one minute members' 
statements.  I told the Speaker about a tragedy we had in our 
home.  A guy came to the house.  He backed his truck up to the 
door and proceeded to move everything out that we had accumulated 
over the years.  He took half of our sofa set.  He looked 
upstairs and saw four beds and he took two.  He cut my beautiful 
old grandfather clock in half and took half of it and put it in 
the truck.  I phoned the police before they took all the phones 
and asked them to get over to my place.  I told them that we were 
being robbed.  The police said that I should give them more 
details.  I did and they said that they could not come and that 
they could not help.  As a matter of fact the police did show up 
a little later and they insisted that I help the guy load. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an absurd story, but this is what happens every year to 
average Canadians.  One half of our earnings are taken from us 
through the various levels of taxation from the federal, 
provincial and municipal governments.  Tax freedom day in most 
provinces is around July 1, which says that half of our income is 
confiscated every year. 
If we do not help the guy who is owed and if we do not deliver 
the money that we have earned, we are held in contempt and can go 
to jail.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to characterize the levels of government as though 
they are crooks, yet I know I am right on the verge.  I do not 
want to say that, so I will not.  They are not really stealing 
our money because it is taxation.  However it is still money I 
have earned that I cannot use for my family.  I have very few 
needs.  We can see that all I need is a square meal a day, or 
two, some basic clothing and basic shelter.  Give me a bicycle to 
ride or preferably a motorcycle.  My needs are simple and I 
simply want the best.  I do not have many needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I do have a great need to provide for my family. 
Fortunately my children are now grown up and on their own so 
things are a little easier.  Now I only have a very expensive 
wife to provide for.  When the children were younger I was 
teaching at a technical institute.  All hon. members probably 
know this.  I worked there for 27 years.  We also made the 
decision that mother would be a full time mom.  The children 
needed to have someone there when they came home from school to 
care for them and to show them that they were important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to supplement our income, which even back then was not 
quite adequate to meet all our needs, including paying the 
mortgage, the utilities and everything, the decision was made 
that I would teach part time in the evenings.  I taught a night 
class almost always two nights a week.  This was way back and it 
dates me.  Hon. members can tell by my grey hair that I am an old 
guy.  I used to say that I worked Tuesday nights for Trudeau and 
Thursday nights for my family.  It was a 50:50 deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though we are dealing with Bill C-22 to amend the Income 
Tax Act, the question that is not being addressed is the overall 
huge load of taxation which burdens our families and burdens 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also indicated recently, and I will repeat this because I 
feel it is important, that my family and I not only pay our taxes 
but we also believe in charity.  Due to the fact that we needed 
to look after our future, and as we have always felt insecure 
about the inadequate provisions of the government, namely the 
Canada pension plan, we have tried to put a bit of money into 
RRSPs.  We ended up living on about 30% of my income as 70% of it 
was gone:  50% to taxation; 10% to charity, plus or minus a bit; 
and 10% to future savings, usually a little less because I could 
not afford that much.  It was a struggle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the reasons I became a member of parliament. In 
1988, when the Reform Party was just starting, I picked up one of 
its brochures and all these things attracted me: the elected 
Senate, true democratic responsibility, and a justice system that 
would work on behalf of law-abiding citizens.  However the one 
that really struck me was the belief that governments should live 
within their means so that we could reduce and not increase the 
debt.  That was during the Conservative years when the debt was 
going up by $25 billion, $30 billion and peaking at $40 billion a 
year, just before they were finally turfed.  That was one of the 
reasons they were turfed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was attracted to the principle that said we should have a 
balanced budget so that we would no longer increase the debt, the 
principle that we should start paying the debt down so that we 
could relieve ourselves of the necessity of interest payments and 
thereby have more money available to governments for programs 
that citizens value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the rest is history.  We came here in huge numbers in 
1993. 
When I first joined the Reform Party I did not anticipate that I 
would be transposed from my career at NAIT's teaching 
mathematics, computing and interesting things like that into 
trying to persuade a Liberal government to reduce taxes, balance 
the budget, hopefully pay down the debt and reduce interest

</I></B></P><P align=left>However I stand here proudly this afternoon when I see what has 
happened in the last seven years.  We have been the beneficiaries 
of a very robust economy in the United States which has a huge 
influence on our economy.  That is undeniable.  At the same time 
I believe it was our presence here which made it respectable to 
talk about fiscal prudence and to reduce the amount we were 
spending.  The government was also able to exercise, with our 
help, a little discipline in not spending all the additional 
revenue that came rolling in that was beyond its expectations and 
certainly beyond its planning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like what happened in the year 2000.  I am a little 
disappointed in the election.  I wish we would have the Liberals 
in opposition.  That would have been a lot more fun.  One of the 
things which did happen just four days before the election was we 
had a mini-budget, the primary election document for the 
Liberals.  That is what the bill is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must give the Liberals a grudging commendation here.  They 
sure do know how to run elections.  I saw a cartoon of the Prime 
Minister right after the election.  It showed the increase in the 
number of seats.  He was reading a paper that said “Liberals 
re-elected with a resounding majority”.  The Prime Minister, 
speaking to Canadian taxpayers, was saying that was the best $200 
million of taxpayer money he ever spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that an election costs around $200 million.  It is quite 
an expensive project.  That is what it took to put the Liberals 
back into power.  I am giving the Liberals a weak commendation in 
that their pre-election document showed they were ready to go the 
way we were saying Canadians were asking parliament to go, namely 
to exercise some fiscal responsibility and implement tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the polling data right now and if we ask Canadians 
what they think is important, the number one issue is health 
care, and rightly so.  Whenever we are ill and we need some help 
from the medical profession, we live in a country where we have 
come to accept that it will be available.  It ought to be that 
way.  I believe very solidly in our principle, which is also a 
principle of the Canada Health Act, that no one should be denied 
needed health care because of financial situation.  I concur with 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are saying that is the number one issue.  The number 
two issue is either crime, punishment or the justice system. Down 
the line a bit comes tax cuts, as the member from the CCF said 
just a moment ago.  He usually calls my party by the wrong name, 
so why can I not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that tax cuts were actually quite low.  That is because 
when Canadians are asked to priorize something they put these 
things in rank order.  We make the mistake of drawing the 
conclusion, because tax cuts are maybe third, fourth or fifth on 
the list, that they are not important to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the importance that Canadians place on those 
issues they would probably all be close to equal.  If we asked 
how important health care was on a scale of one to ten, a person 
might say ten.  When asked how important tax cuts are, they might 
say that is a nine.  It is not as important so it ranks out that 
way, but it is still important to them.  I hear that from many 
people who ask why they work like slaves from early morning until 
late at night and do not seem to get ahead.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very frankly, even with these timid tax cuts that the Minister 
of Finance introduced in budget 2000—and of course most of the 
things in the mini budget from last fall have not yet been 
implemented—the actual reduction in the total deductions in the 
average person's paycheque is not huge, if it is there at all. As 
a matter of fact, with the new payments for Canada pension the 
bottom line for most families is about the same or sometimes even 
a little worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In broad generalities as I am leading up to my talk on Bill C-22 
today, I really think we need to address very carefully the level 
of taxation in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I want to talk a little about the complexity of it.  I 
talked a bit this morning on Bill C-8, the banking bill, but we 
have had other bills in the House that have to do with changing 
the taxation system or the revenue system, and sometimes we deal 
with government expenditures.  I find it frankly astounding, and 
I hope I never lose my astonishment, that a week ago in one 
evening we sat here as members and in a matter of about 20 
minutes approved the expenditure of some $15 billion or $16 
billion.  Those were the supplementary estimates just to get the 
government to the end of this fiscal year.  The amount of money 
we approve here is amazing.  I believe the responsibility we have 
as proper stewards of the money entrusted to us is of the utmost 
importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I want to see happen is a reduction in the 
complexity of our tax system.  My goodness, I remember not long 
ago reading an interpretation bulletin on the GST which 
differentiated between buying cooked shrimp and cold, frozen 
shrimp.  There is a different rate of GST applied to the two of 
them.  In one case it was considered that because they were 
cooked they were a meal and therefore the GST applied.  In the 
other case they were frozen, therefore they were groceries.  GST 
is not charged on groceries.  That is only one minute example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 discusses proposals for amending the Income Tax Act as 
well as the Canada Pension Plan, the Customs Act, the Excise Tax 
Act, the Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act and 
another act related to the Excise Tax Act.  All of this is 
included and does not increase the simplicity of it.  It 
increases the complexity of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already I am led to believe that there are very few Canadians, 
even among our best tax lawyers, who know that code.  As a matter 
of fact, any of our citizens who have had the occasion to go to 
one of the tribunals to get a ruling on a tax dispute are hoping 
for some reasonable hearing there because, depending on who one 
gets, one gets different interpretations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One person in my riding told me that he phoned Revenue Canada to 
ask about a certain issue.  He got an answer that he did not 
think was right, so he phoned again, got a different person and 
got a different answer.  Then he thought, just a minute, there 
are two different answers here, so he went for two out of three 
because he still did not really know.  He phoned again, hoping 
that he would get one of the other two answers, and lo and 
behold, there was a third answer.  The complexity of it is a 
great frustration.  The bill, among other things, increases that 
complexity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign the Alliance Party was proposing 
that we go to a single rate tax.  That is not a flat tax.  That 
is a misnomer we are often accused of.  A single rate tax is 
simply the same kind of a tax system we have now with basic 
exemptions and other deductions, but instead of three rates as we 
had at that time, we said we would reduce them all to the same 
rate of 17%.  I suppose we could have achieved the same result by 
simply saying that the amounts where these rates kick in are some 
high number and it would have probably been more saleable than 
the way it was presented. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that we are proposing deductions.  We are proposing 
huge tax breaks for middle income and lower income families.  The 
Liberals are crowing about the fact that people who are now 
making a family income of $20,000 a year are going to get a tax 
break of maybe 16% or 20% or whatever number it is that they use. 
Under our plan that reduction would be 100%.  They would be 
removed from the tax roll completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under our plan, a family of four, a mum, a dad and two kids, 
would pay zero tax on the first $26,000 of income and then a 
straight 17% on the remaining, whereas the Liberal government 
goes on and on with exemptions of maybe $15,000 or $16,000 and 
then 17% on everything after that, although they are proposing to 
reduce that to 16%.  That, by the way, is also a bit of sleight 
of hand.  If we just talk about the rate but apply it on more of 
the income the total tax bill is higher than if there were a 1% 
higher rate but a great deal more of the income exempt from tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In wrapping up, I would simply like to say that some of the 
measures in the bill go in the right direction.  I am rather 
concerned about some of them.  They go in the right direction but 
not far enough.  In any case, there are some things in the bill 
that are woefully inadequate.  I am looking forward very much to 
hearing about the bill in committee, not only from officials but 
also from witnesses who will come to our committee and give us 
their read on it.  I am sure that in the finance committee we 
will have a great time analyzing the bill and reporting back to 
the House in due time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to what my colleague opposite had to 
say, just as I have been listening to presentations all 
afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the member takes a great interest in these things. 
Frequently today concern has been expressed about the economy in 
one way or another and we have had suggestions as to where the 
problem is.  I heard the member say that it was the dollar and so 
perhaps by manipulating the dollar we could help the economy. 
There are different things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it does strike me that whatever we read in the media 
lately about the economy and what could be done about it, it is 
all speculation by economists.  They all have different theories 
as to what we can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me, and this is where my question lies for the 
member, that in times like these we should not rely on economic 
theories which are just that, theories.  In times like these, 
times of modest uncertainty, the only thing we can do that we 
know is going to pay off in the future is invest in the future. 
Our tax policies and our spending policies should be geared to 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we say, we should invest in people.  We should invest in 
prenatal care and post-natal care.  We should invest in our 
elementary schools and make them as effective as possible.  For 
example, we should put them all on the Internet in the modern age 
so that kids in kindergarten can get used to computers and used 
to being on the Internet.  Going further up the system, we should 
give scholarships to make it possible for young people to go to 
college and to university.  We should make the tax environment as 
good as is humanly possible for research and technology.  We 
should have tax breaks to educate not just scientists but people 
in the trades and things of that type. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member is this:  what does he think about 
that?  Does he not think that in fact what has been happening 
these last several years has been exactly that and that by 
investing in people in all of those ways we are laying the best 
foundation we can for a strong economy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
astute question.  I agree with a lot of what he says.  I too 
believe that children ought to have a pretty good head start in 
their lives.  I think it is primarily the responsibility of the 
parents to make sure it happens and the responsibility of 
government to get out of their faces so they can do it.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is true for most of them.  Then there are some who need 
assistance from the larger community, be it the municipal, the 
provincial or the federal community.  Tax dollars are involved in 
giving grants and helping people in genuine need.  I have some 
reservations about that, but I do agree with it in principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret, as I said in an earlier speech, that one of the things 
that has happened is that the Liberals, trading on the fact that 
as Canadians we are indeed compassionate, have instead taken away 
from us the fiscal room to be compassionate as individuals.  They 
are taxing us to death, such that now when I see a needy person I 
am more likely, not speaking for myself personally but as an 
average citizen, to see whether I can help get them on some 
government program rather than simply ask them to come to my 
house for help in getting a job.  That is what we did when I was 
a younger man.  It worked well, because there was some personal 
accountability and mentoring.  It works much better than a 
government program which unfortunately in many cases produces 
dependence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the dollar, it is like driving along in my car 
in an 80 mph zone and my speedometer is telling me I am going 30. 
I say to myself that I had better get a new speedometer.  No, the 
speedometer is showing my actual speed.  I do not need a new 
speedometer.  I need to step on it so that I can get with the 
program and get to the speed the traffic is moving at.  To a 
large degree, I believe that is what our Canadian dollar is like. 
It is simply an indicator of our economic health.  It should be 
of huge concern to the government that right now our economic 
indicator is showing that we are running at about 65% efficiency 
vis-à-vis the Americans, our next door neighbours.  We are only 
about two-thirds as productive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no excuse for that.  We have a land that is rich in 
resources.  I could list them all.  We have a tremendously 
energetic population and we need to have to survive in our 
climate.  There is no reason in the world why we would not have 
the capacity to be above the Americans on a true measure of 
standard of living, yet we know that our standard of living is 
way lower than theirs on many measures.  It is indicated again by 
the value of the Canadian dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it is an indicator.  I do not think one should fiddle 
with the indicator.  Rather, one should try to correct the 
factors that have produced that particular measure in our 
productivity and economic efficiency. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened as the member for Elk 
Island described in his story the length of time it took him to 
get his tax holiday.  As he talked some of the reasons suddenly 
began to emerge.  I saw the scenario wherein he had big parties 
and invited people over and they had tons of shrimp and then ran 
around his house using six or seven phones to make phone calls. I 
am sure that the average Canadian gets his or her tax holiday 
much sooner than the member for Elk Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about positioning for elections.  He also talked about 
the single rate tax, not the flat rate tax, and of course we know 
that leading up to the election the member's party went from 17% 
to 17% and 25% because of concerns the party had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in British Columbia not too long ago.  A lot of good parts 
of B.C. are Alliance territory.  A lot of people told me that 
the single rate tax would be great because they could take their 
incomes and multiply by 17% or 25%.  However, the member today 
and at other times in the House has really affirmed the fact that 
they would still have all the deductions, such as medical 
expenses over a certain amount, the charitable donations, RRSPs, 
et cetera.  I suspect we would still have a big Income Tax Act. 
I wonder if the member could talk about how we would reduce 
complexity under the 17% and 25% scenario he described earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that cleaning 
up the complexity of the tax act goes far beyond just going to a 
single rate or even to two rates.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that under Bill C-22 the government proposes 
to go from three categories to four beginning next year.  That is 
because it loves high taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must look at the complexities of the issue.  Some formulas in 
the bill are illustrated very well, but others are really quite 
convoluted.  The Income Tax Act is full of that.  The question of 
what applies must also be addressed.  The categorization of which 
tax bracket a person falls into is one question but it is a minor 
one.  I will concede that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the tax itself, we must recognize that when 
taxes are reduced there is a tremendous spinoff in the economy 
because the money is not destroyed.  When taxes are reduced 
taxpayers do not throw that money into the fireplace.  They use 
it to provide for their families and give the local economy a 
kick.  I would much rather hire a guy to fix my leaky roof, which 
would give him a job and get my roof fixed, than send the money 
to Ottawa where it is spun in circles and nothing really happens 
with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the question from the parliamentary secretary, 
although I did not have time to give him a full answer.  He is 
certainly on the right track by asking if we should simplify the 
code.  My answer is a resounding yes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wanted to 
point out that I raised this issue in the House during the 36th 
parliament, in our reply to the economic statement or 
mini-budget. Bill C-22 is the exact copy of this mini budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised that nothing has been changed. The government 
could have addressed certain problems or weaknesses in the 
economic statement that was made just before the election. 
Throughout the election campaign, the Liberal government boasted 
a lot, through its members and candidates, about the upcoming 
tax reductions. There would be something for everybody, they 
said, because they had put the nation's finances in good shape, 
and were making a surplus. They said they would help all those 
that had been affected by drastic cuts. 
The finance minister had room to manoeuvre with $147.9 billion, 
including the agreement on health signed with the provinces on 
September 11. We can safely guess that right now his room to 
manoeuvre is much bigger, but today our discussions centre on 
the $147.9 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax cuts can be expected for 2004. I think that this is the time 
of year when everybody in Canada and in Quebec is checking their 
tax returns before submitting them to the Department of National 
Revenue. Few are lucky enough to be able to say “I have 
benefited this year of a real tax cut that has allowed me to put 
my finances in order”.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some examples of what tax cuts will probably look like 
in 2004. A single parent family with an income of $30,000 and 
one dependent child would have a $550 tax cut and would still 
pay $1,545 a year. That is for a family with a $30,000 income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a $50,000 income, the same family would have a tax cut of 
$1,200 or twice that of the single parent family with a 
$30,000 income. With a $80,000 income, the same family would 
have a $2,300 tax cut or four times more than that of the 
family with a $30,000 income. With a $100,000 income, the tax 
cut would be $3,200, or 5.8 times more than that of the 
family with a $30,000 income. 
The tax reduction for Canadians earning $250,000 would be 
$6,500, 11 times higher than the tax reduction for a family 
earning $30,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the more than four million women, that is 60% of women, earning 
less than $30,000, this statement is a slap in the face. A 
family with an income of $30,000 and one child should not pay 
any taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reduction of the capital gains inclusion rate means average 
gains of $11,600 for taxpayers earning $250,000 or more, 
compared to average gains of $320 for those earning between 
$80,000 and $150,000, 36 times less than the average gains for 
those earning $250,000. As members can see, these tax reductions 
are for the rich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in this bill for women, for young persons, and 
for single senior citizens, most of whom are women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In your riding, Mr. Speaker, there are probably many single 
senior citizens. Unfortunately these are mostly women who are 
poor. Their pension income comes to about $12,000 a year. What 
can one do with $12,000 a year? It is a shame that the 
government did not think about these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since our population is aging, there will be more and more 
single older women. These are women who have lost their 
husbands. We tend to forget widows. With huge surpluses and 
$147.9 billion to play around with, it is unacceptable that the 
government did not think about those single women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no provisions for the basic financing of women groups 
working within organizations. They were completely forgotten. 
These women are often volunteers. They earn unacceptable salaries 
in those organizations. Their work is aimed at keeping the 
centres open in order to help and support single women, older 
women, women going through difficult times or facing problems of 
domestic violence. These women groups do their best to keep the 
centres open, and there is nothing in the budget to help them 
carry on their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing either for old workers, men and women, who lost 
their jobs. We had been vocal in the House, trying to convince 
the Minister of Finance to take into account people hit by plant 
closures. There will be others, because it is a given with 
globalization. There will be plant closures. New plants are 
opening, but there is also rationalization. Big companies are 
rationalizing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, Celanese was the backbone of the economy in 
Drummondville. Some 50, 40 or 30 years ago, everyone in my riding 
knew someone who worked at Celanese. That company once had 6,000, 
7,000 and 8,000 employees. It was really the cornerstone of the 
region's economic development. As the years went by, 
transformations took place, and the plant moved to Mexico last 
year.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a good proportion of middle-aged workers, between 50 
and 60 years old, who were nearing retirement and who received 
early retirement benefits. These people were not eligible for 
employment insurance. They had to use money they received as 
separation pay. After a year, they had to rely on employment 
insurance and, later, on social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, we had measures aimed at helping older former 
workers. Perhaps they were not the best measures, perhaps they 
had shortcomings, but at least these people could keep their 
pride because they did not have to rely on social assistance 
while waiting to receive their pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were totally abandoned. These people who worked hard for 30 
or 40 years in the same factory, for the same employer, were 
forced to retire because of globalization and the closing of 
factories. They were told “Go home now; you must rely on social 
assistance”. It is totally scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing for social housing either. There is nothing for 
international assistance. There is nothing for transfers for health and 
education. Now, I want to say a few words about indexation, 
because we know that even if funds were injected into health, 
costs were not taken into consideration. As the population ages, 
the cost of equipment, new technologies and drugs is 
skyrocketing, and we have to take this into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing for shipbuilding. The government has earmarked 
$1 billion to cover the increase in heating costs, but is sending 
each person a small cheque. 
We talked about it in the House. I met with single elderly 
people with incomes of $13,000 or $14,000 a year, who heat their 
home with oil, and have seen their heating bills double and 
nearly triple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone who used to pay $400 for heating oil will have paid by 
the end of this winter between $800 and $1,000. This is 
outrageous when their yearly income is $13,000. The government 
issued cheques for $125 instead of keeping the money to target 
people who really needed it. The government took this initiative 
and sent cheques to help with heating expenses to everybody, 
including those who do not use heating oil. It does not make 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have nothing against giving money to people who qualify for 
the GST rebate; I am happy for the people who received a $125 
cheque. It was certainly welcome, especially during the holiday 
season. However, what did the government do for people such as single 
women who have only $13,000 a year to live on, whose heating 
expenses went up? It could have tried a bit harder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is similar to distributing goodies before an election is 
called, to make everybody happy; this creates a lot of visibility 
but solves nothing. People will get even deeper into poverty to 
avoid freezing this winter, as their heating bill doubles and 
nearly triples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does one do when one is poor and does not want to freeze? 
One goes without food or without heat and one literally freezes 
in order to be able to eat a little bit. This is unconscionable 
on the part of a government with a $147.9 billion surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has done a lot to pay down the debt. This is called fancy 
accounting. The finance minister has been very cautious. With the 
surplus he did not announce, he was able to reduce the debt. I 
have nothing against reducing the debt, but people who were put 
through the wringer and literally bled to death should come 
first.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot has been done for debt reduction and for millionaires. As 
a matter of fact, a family with one child and a $250,000 income 
will benefit from a tax reduction. However, a family with one 
child and a $30,000 income will not get much of a break. I would 
call that exploitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these huge surpluses that made the Minister of Finance 
burst with pride, we were expecting him to give a break to those 
who were really instrumental in getting our fiscal house in 
order, those to whom we owe the fact that we have not had a 
deficit for four years, those who continue to be bled white by 
federal taxes, those thanks to whom the finance minister can be 
thrilled about having these surpluses right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We thought the main beneficiaries of these tax cuts would be low 
and middle income families, not very high income families that 
can benefit greatly from tax loopholes. With the help of a good 
tax expert, people earning $250,000 can save a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has the audacity to say that surpluses will not 
exceed $6 billion this year, whereas close to $12 billion has 
already been accumulated in the coffers of the federal 
government.  I know my figures are not correct because it is 
actually more than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance could have done more for the 
disadvantaged, and for low and middle income taxpayers. I am 
talking about the workers who contribute to the EI fund as well 
as small and medium size businesses. They are the ones that end 
up paying for tax cuts for the rich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also talking about the unemployed men and women who are not 
receiving any EI benefits because of the drastic cuts made and 
because of the tightening up of the eligibility criteria. 
The ones who are paying now for the tax cuts to the rich are 
rural families, and I think my colleague from Jonquière, who has 
responsibility for this issue, knows this well and will no doubt 
inform the House at some point about what is going on in the 
regions, young people, women and seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know why the government has presented this statement that has 
now evolved into Bill C-22.  It was because the election was 
about to be called and they wanted to thumb their noses at the 
Canadian Alliance.  What the Alliance was proposing at that time 
was a uniform rate, and the government wanted to win over the 
electorate. So, it adopted as its own the Alliance's uniform 
rate, which was universally denounced as favouring millionaires. 
It now has included it in its bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $100 billion in surplus has come from the pockets of low and 
middle income taxpayers and, let me say again, from the 
unemployed, women, young people, sick people and the most 
disadvantaged members of our society.  This is absolutely 
indecent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not be too hasty with our rejoicing.  Tax cuts are 
always welcome.  Certainly, no one can be opposed to a tax cut. 
We must not be too quick to rejoice, however, because, as I have 
said, it will not show up in our tax returns this year.  It will 
probably be in 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance could have had a budget this year, not a 
year and a half down the road, and let us have the benefit of 
these tax cuts this year.  I mentioned earlier that, according to 
the information available, a single parent family with an income 
of $250,000 and over will benefit from a far greater relief to 
its tax burden, 40 times greater, than a family with one 
dependant and an income of $30,000.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Families with an income of $250,000 get a $20,000 net tax 
reduction, while those with an income of $35,000 and one 
dependent get a mere $500. These families should not pay any 
taxes. They do not in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all the money it has, the government still manages to go 
after these families. There are 1.5 million children living in 
poverty in Canada. Does that make any sense?  Children 
are poor because women and families who are poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A family with a $35,000 income and one dependent is poor, but 
still must pay taxes. It will pay $1,425 in taxes. It will 
benefit from a $500 tax reduction, but not this year, only in 
2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister kept saying, even in this House, that people with 
an income of $35,000 do not pay any taxes. He said it several 
times in the House. It is strange to hear him say that they do 
not pay any taxes and then announce that they will get $500 in 
tax reduction. Very strange indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would rather rely on the figures from our own research. People 
cannot be fooled that easily. The minister said repeatedly that 
those families do not pay any taxes and then announced that they 
would bet getting a $500 tax reduction. I truly believe 
those families are paying taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also see in the budget that the government shamelessly 
keeps on accumulating surpluses, because, as was mentioned 
earlier, the tax reductions will take effect in only a year and a 
half. Meanwhile, the government keeps fiddling with the figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say that we were opposed to the statement and to the 
mini budget, and that we will not support this bill because it 
does not meet the needs of the Canadian and the Quebec society.

I wish to thank my colleague from Drummond for her comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the Bloc Quebecois has to kill time between now and 
the next referendum is held. Everybody knows that. In that 
spirit, I would like to note and ask my colleague— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold: </B>  Madam Speaker, I raise on a 
point of order. The member for Chicoutimi—Le Fjord is mocking 
the intelligence of my colleague from Drummond. I find it totally 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B> I would not want to serve 
as an advisor to every member's conscience. It would certainly be 
advisable for everyone to choose their words carefully, but if 
the member wants to defend himself, he may do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> Madam Speaker, I will do just that and ask 
the member for Jonquière whether she received a response from Mr. 
Clinton to her letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was elected to represent the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean area. 
It does not seem possible to me that the federal government can 
be held responsible for all the problems in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that vein, I would point out that this year the federal 
government is going to make $14 billion in equalization and 
Canada social transfer payments.  The problem does not always lie 
with the federal government.  The problem is that the Bloc 
Quebecois does not direct the equalization and social transfer 
payments to the regions in accordance with objective guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  It is too bad that the member has fled 
the House of Commons.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of health, our region has an annual deficit of $75 
million.  This is not the federal government's fault; it has been 
going on for years and years, to the point where I would like to 
tell the member for Drummond that more and more people in our 
region would like the federal government to transfer less money 
to the government of Quebec and invest more money directly in the 
region, so that we can manage our own development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The losses we are suffering in the management of natural 
resources, such as aluminum and lumber, are occurring in sectors 
that do not come under federal jurisdiction.  We have lost 8,000 
jobs in the aluminum sector. It is not the fault of the federal 
government if we have not yet begun to process aluminum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to point out that the 
federal government is going to invest $52 million in an aluminum 
processing research centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member for Drummond agree to let the federal 
government invest more directly in resource regions, because 
everyone agrees that the government of Quebec is neglecting the 
resource regions in all sectors?  As for regional development, 
all it is doing is creating committees, such as the CRCD, and the 
CSD.  The PQ has a bad case of committeeitis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enough of saying that the federal government is responsible for 
all Quebec's problems.  One might wonder whether the problem did 
not lie with the government of Quebec's management and its lack 
of respect for the regions. I am in favour of the federal 
government investing directly in the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> That was not what you said when you were on 
this side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> It is what I have always said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B> If members want to ask 
questions, they may take advantage of the question and comment 
period to do so. The hon. member for Drummond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Madam Speaker, what is outraging is the fact 
that this hon. member was not saying the same thing when he was 
on this side of the House. Now that he is on the other side, he 
has changed his tune. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When plants were closing and my colleagues and I were raucous in 
the House, calling for help to be provided to former older 
workers of the Canadian Celanese and the Cavalier Textiles in my 
region, as well as in his, he told me “When my party gets into 
office, we will restore measures for former older workers”. He 
is now on the other side and his party is in office, but I am 
still waiting for the measures that will be implemented to help 
these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the CHST, I would point out to my hon. colleague 
that initially the federal transfer for health and education was 
supposed to be 50%. Since 1993, the federal government has 
withdrawn support and its share has now declined to 14%. That 
doesn't make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been drastic cuts. All the provinces, not just Quebec, 
but all the provinces agree that, if our provincial health 
systems are in danger, it is because of the cuts made by the 
federal government. So it is very insulting to come and tell us 
things like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister made his financial statement, for once we had 
calculated the same flexibility as the finance minister. We too 
had calculated $147.9 billion. We had the same forecasts. 
Each year we used to come up with forecasts and the finance 
minister would say that we were mistaken. However, we were right, our 
figures were right and he had to recognize it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This time, he came up with the same figure as us, as I was 
saying, that it $147.9 billion, but it is probably more than that 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the tax burden reduction, the Minister of Finance 
forecast personal income tax reductions of $75.2 billion over 
five years. What I wanted to say it that we were suggesting a 
different way of allocating the $147.9 billion to assist those 
who suffered drastic cuts, particularly in the area of health.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a humble Address be presented to Her Excellency praying 
that she will intercede with Her Majesty to cause the British 
Crown to present an official apology to the Acadian people for 
the wrongs done to them in its name between 1755 and 1763. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Madam Speaker, it is with great pride and pleasure that 
I rise today in the House to launch the debate on Motion No. 241, 
a highly solemn and truly historic motion for Acadians and 
everyone throughout the world who is of Acadian descent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I understand the symbolic and historic meaning of this 
motion that I have the honour to sponsor. It reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a humble Address be presented to Her Excellency praying 
that she will intercede with Her Majesty to cause the British 
Crown to present an official apology to the Acadian people for 
the wrongs done to them in its name between 1755 and 1763. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of its very formal presentation normally used for 
communications between parliament and the British crown, this 
motion may, at first glance, seem impertinent and even slightly 
offensive to Her Majesty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit respectfully that it is not so.  The motion does not 
violate the oath of office that each of us has taken in order to 
sit in this House.  It is not disloyal to ask for formal 
recognition of indisputable historical events and for the 
presentation of an official apology, which should have been made 
a long time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one asks for an apology, does it mean that one is prepared 
to forgive the descendants of those who were responsible for the 
exactions?  Most certainly. 
We should not be spiteful toward those people who cannot be held 
responsible for the actions of their ancestors.  However, we cannot 
ever forget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 200 years after these tragic events, nobody has ever 
admitted to responsibility for, and hence the occurrence of 
those events. It is as if, historically, it were a non-event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Curiously, this matter is both taboo and ubiquitous. The British 
crown did some serious wrongs to the Acadian people, who is very 
aware of that wrong; it even strengthens its national identity. 
However, it would appear that no one dares to ask for an 
accounting, probably because people fear it will spark a painful 
debate.  Yet, we should be able to look at our past with 
lucidity and serenity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we cannot judge the past by today's values and principles, 
some people state without hesitation that such exactions, if 
they were committed today, would be considered as genocide or as 
a crime against humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In situations such as this, experts generally agree that 
impunity and more particularly the refusal to acknowledge the 
facts are the main breach of elementary justice, something that 
can prevent forever normalization of relations after the events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe that is why, more than 200 years later, these events are 
still taboo and ubiquitous, as I said earlier, as they still 
permeate the collective psyche of the Acadian people. 
In my opinion, acknowledging the facts and presenting an apology 
would be the least the British crown could do to make amends, in 
view to the abuse committed on its behalf against the Acadian 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the House of Commons, which is supposed to be the embodiment 
of Canadian democracy, refuses to look back at our past and to 
ask the British crown to acknowledge these historical facts, who 
will do it?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, I know that this initiative of mine does not meet 
with the approval of all members. I have to admit I expected 
that kind of reaction. Everything the Bloc Quebecois does on 
behalf of francophone and Acadian communities in Canada is 
almost always viewed with suspicion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my party takes an initiative on behalf of francophone and 
Acadian communities in Canada, somebody always finds a way to 
accuse us of trying to make political hay at the expense of 
these communities. However when the Bloc Quebecois makes the mistake 
of remaining silent on a problem they have, we are accused of 
not caring about them because we are too concerned with 
separation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must stress right from the start that it is not as a member of 
the Bloc Quebecois that I took this initiative. I say to my 
potential critics that I have a right to exist outside of my 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather as a Quebecer of Acadian descent that I took this 
initiative. If today I am a Quebecer it is because my ancestors 
had to take refuge in Quebec, more specifically in 
Saint-Grégoire-de-Nicolet, as a result of the deportation of the 
Acadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first ancestor to come to America, Barthélémy Bergeron, came 
from Amboise, in Touraine. He landed in New France in 1684 as a 
volunteer for the King.  He first settled in Quebec City where he 
is thought to have worked as a baker. A member of the first 
Compagnies franches de la Marine, created to serve in the 
American colonies, he took part in campaigns and raids led by the 
famous Pierre LeMoyne d'Iberville.  After 1673, he settled 
in Port-Royal, in what is now Nova Scotia. He married Geneviève 
Serreau de Saint-Aubin, the daughter of an Acadian nobleman, with 
whom he had several children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1704, after the raid led by Colonel Church 
against Port-Royal, Barthélémy Bergeron and his family were taken 
prisoner and kept in captivity in Boston for two years. After the 
Treaty of Utrecht was signed in 1713, Nova Scotia fell into the 
hands of the British. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1604, the control of Acadia had switched between France 
and England no less than seven times. In 1730, at the urging of 
church authorities, Barthélémy Bergeron and his family moved to 
what is now New Brunswick, becoming one of the pioneering 
families in the village of Sainte-Anne-du-Pays-Bas, which is now 
called Fredericton, the capital of the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with an impending war against France and doubtful about 
the loyalty and neutrality of His Majesty's French and Catholic 
subjects in Acadia, British colonial authorities came up with a 
strategy which has unfortunately been a source of inspiration 
throughout human history, and which the Romans had successfully 
used many years before. They were simply going to deport these 
supposedly subversive populations and scatter them throughout the 
various British colonies in America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 5, 1755, in the Minas area, Lieutenant-Colonel John 
Winslow read the deportation order to the men of the community 
who were held captive in the church. Here is an excerpt from 
that order: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—it is ordered that your lands and tenements, cattle of all kinds 
and livestock of all sorts, be forfeited to the British Crown, 
along with all other effects, saving your money and household 
goods and you, yourselves, be removed from this Province. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1755 and the months following the signature of the 
Treaty of Paris in 1763 more than 10,000 Acadians were 
deported. 
Of that number, at least one third died in shipwrecks, from 
diseases due to the terrible conditions on the ships carrying 
them to unknown destinations or from the weather conditions and 
the hardships they faced once they had arrived at their final 
destination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the physical suffering were added the pain of exile and the 
humiliation of destitution and poverty felt by this peaceful 
people who, through effort and ingenuity, had succeeded in 
making the salt flats of Acadia productive, to ensure their 
subsistence.  For many of them there was also the 
heartbreaking experience of the forced separation of families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what explains the poignancy of Longfellow's epic poem 
about the tragic destiny of Évangéline, who was separated from 
the man she loved at the time of deportation and spent her life 
trying to find him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many, the exodus lasted many years, because most of the 
colonies where they were intended to settle did not have the 
infrastructure to integrate these unexpected immigrants, often 
seen as undesirable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that exodus, many of them were brought to the colonies in 
New England and others ended up in the Caribbean, in France, in 
England, but also as far as French Guyana or the Falkland 
Islands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of these exiles later settled in Louisiana, then a 
Spanish colony, while others began a long and difficult journey 
back to Acadia. However, they were never again to see the 
beautiful and fertile land they had cleared and farmed, 
because it now belonged to English settlers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of the 19th century, close to a third of the 
Acadian people had found a safe haven in what would later become 
Quebec. After 1763, tired of hiding to escape from British 
troops, the children, grand-children and great-grand-children of 
Barthélémy Bergeron were among the last to leave Acadia to take 
refuge in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a winter in Cacouna, most of them finally settled, along 
with many other Acadian refugee families, in 
Saint-Grégoire-de-Nicolet, which came to be known informally as 
“Petite-Cadie”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other members of the family of Barthélémy Bergeron, though there 
were fewer of them, chose to settle in the Gaspé Peninsula, in 
the area of Carleton, and in Louisiana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For four generations, my ancestors contributed to shaping the 
face of Acadia. 
Besides the Bergerons of Amboise and the Serreaus of Saint-Aubin, 
I also count the Héberts, the Bourgs and the Moricets among my 
ancestors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud of my Acadian origins and, despite what some might 
want to say or do today, nobody can make me renounce them. Some 
may suggest that I am not an Acadian and that I therefore have 
no authority to take this initiative, but one undeniable fact 
remains: if it had not been for the deportation, I would 
probably be an Acadian today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Acadian diaspora resulting from the deportation 
is directly affected, as much as the Acadia of today, by the 
motion now before the House. As a matter of fact, the 
deportation made us what we have become today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a few years ago that I really became aware of my Acadian 
origins. This new awareness prompted me to embark on a real 
search for my roots, which led me to visit the Atlantic 
provinces several times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I travelled throughout historical Acadia and today's Acadia, 
from Port-Royal to Louisbourg, from Fredericton to Plaisance, 
from Grand-Pré to Moncton, from the Acadian peninsula to Prince 
Edward Island, from the Magdalen Islands to 
Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, and as far as Louisiana. I met many 
people who are interested in this issue as well as experts, 
including Stephen White, genealogist at the Université de 
Moncton's Centre d'études acadiennes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is a combination of three events that led me to 
bring forward this motion in the House of Commons. Having 
attended the last Congrès mondial acadien held in Louisiana, I 
was able to see the considerable damage caused by the 
assimilation of the descendants of exiled Acadians in those 
areas. 
I have since come to espouse the powerful idea of a great 
Acadian community, proud, united and transcending borders, an 
idea that permeated the latest Congrès mondial acadien. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also troubled by the controversy surrounding the choice of 
Moncton to host the latest Sommet de la Francophonie.  It will 
be recalled that a number of activists criticized this choice as 
being too symbolically charged. We need only remember that 
Colonel Robert Monckton, whose name the city now bears, was 
guilty of behaviour toward the Acadians that would today earn 
him, as I mentioned earlier, an appearance before the 
international criminal tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this apparent downplay by Canadian authorities of the 
tragic events surrounding the deportation of the Acadians might 
have been considered negligible had a member of this House, a 
member of the federal cabinet at the time, not also tried to 
minimize the effects of the deportation by saying, in France, 
that she had forgotten the year this unfortunate operation had 
begun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to put an end to this apparent offhandedness of 
Canadian authorities with respect to this tragic period of our 
history, it became important to me to have the House of Commons 
give formal consideration to the matter and recognize 
officially, for the first time in its history, that these events 
did indeed occur.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore put this motion on the order paper of the House of 
Commons at the end of October 1999.  However, losing out in the 
draw, it died on the order paper with the dissolution of 
parliament last fall.  I therefore put it back on the order 
paper of the House with the start of this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did this in good faith, wanting to pay tribute to the courage, 
tenacity and determination of the men and women who valiantly 
faced adversity and assured the survival of these astounding 
people, the Acadians. 
I would like to pay tribute to our mothers and fathers and to 
our sisters and brothers who have tirelessly defended their 
language and their culture in the past and who keep on doing so 
today in many corners of America, promoting them in a colourful 
way well beyond Acadia. I want to pay tribute to the 
organizations that defend and promote the rights, interests and 
specificity of the Acadian communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should not be forgotten, or their struggles, and their 
ceaseless efforts will have been in vain. This motion is not 
about changing history. History cannot be changed and there is 
nothing we can do today that will take away the sufferings of 
the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we want to be able to learn for what happened in the 
past, we need the courage and the vision to face facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Pharaohs of ancient Egypt had understood that the only way 
for them to guarantee their own immortality and to ensure that 
their achievements would not be forgotten was to carve them in 
stone, as if engraving it in the collective memory. They 
therefore thought that hacking out such carvings, making them 
disappear, would automatically doom the events and the people 
they depicted to indifference and oblivion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no right to maintain this apparent indifference toward 
one of the most dramatic events in our history, as we dooming it 
to oblivion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine that, on hearing about the motion being debated today, 
some members of this House had never heard of the events 
surrounding the deportation of the Acadians, and could hardly 
believe that such events could really have happened in 
Canada. 
This gives some idea of the scope of the problem is, and shows 
that we should address it immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As elected representatives of the population, we have a 
historical responsibility. We do not have the right to commit a 
sin of omission. The memory of a people is at stake. The memory 
of what happened should not be mere folklore for Acadians only. 
Our duty today is to officially acknowledge these historical 
events and ask that an official apology be made. It is that 
simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all the more important since the deportation order, 
which was in effect until 1764, has never been officially 
lifted, it would appear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should mention that this motion does not provide in any way 
for the compensation of families and descendants of those who 
were deported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will soon have in the House the great privilege of making a 
historic gesture by voting on this motion. I urge all my 
colleagues in the House to set aside partisan considerations and 
support this motion massively. This is a fundamental question 
that transcends party lines. The House should make the necessary 
solemn gesture toward history and toward the Acadian people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jeannot Castonguay (Madawaska—Restigouche, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to answer the 
member for Verchères—Les Patriotes and his motion asking the 
Governor General to intercede with Her Majesty the Queen of 
England to cause the British crown to present an official apology 
to the Acadian people for the wrongs done to them between 1755 
and 1763. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of Canada, like that of any other country, has its 
sad moments of which we all agree we have no reason to be proud. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT95"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT95"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1750

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These moments are made up of events sometimes centuries old. 
This is the case with the deportation of the Acadians. History is 
sometimes cruel. However, the history of Canada is not made up of 
injustices only. It is, for the most part, based on progress, 
advancement and growth. Today, we must look toward the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The least we can say today is that the sudden interest of the 
member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes is surprising. Surprising, 
indeed, because if we go back a little in time, it is quite 
obvious that this initiative goes against the logic of the Bloc 
Quebecois. I know that the Bloc's logic may sometimes remind us 
of the <I>Twilight Zone</I>. Nevertheless, the colleagues of the 
member of Verchères—Les-Patriotes and even the leader of his 
party have rarely shown a true and honest open-mindedness 
regarding the fate of Acadians and of francophones outside of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not so long ago, in October 1997, the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois said in an interview to the Fredericton <I>Telegraph 
Journal</I> that the salvation of Acadian artists was conditional 
upon their exiling themselves to Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> This debate in incredibly non-partisan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jeannot Castonguay:</B> To be recognized, to reach the top, in 
other words to succeed, every Acadian artist must pack up and 
move to Montreal. 
This reasoning is simplistic but not new. Outside Quebec, there 
is no salvation. We have heard that one before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what we had never heard is what the Bloc Quebecois leader 
added at the time. He said, in reference to Acadian artists that 
“they themselves were proof that it simply does not work outside 
Quebec”. Allow me to be sceptical as to the real intentions of 
the Bloc Quebecois in bringing this motion forward in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc Quebecois members are interested in our history or our 
existence to the extent that it serves their interests and their 
objective. They want people to believe that they are trying to 
correct the mistakes of the past, to shed light on a dark episode 
of our history. One would think that such an initiative would be 
made in consultation with those concerned, namely the Acadians. 
That is the least the Bloc Quebecois could do. But its logic does 
not work like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois' logic is based on an out of date and 
disrespectful paternalism toward Canada's francophone and Acadian 
communities. Again, this is nothing new. In 1994, the member for 
Rimouski—Neigette-et-la Mitis, whose riding is close to Acadia, 
told the Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne to 
mind its own business, because that organization had dared get 
involved in the debate on sovereignty. Now, they are telling us 
not only to mind our own business, but that they will meddle in 
our affairs, with or without our agreement. Let me make one thing 
very clear: Acadians are not the wards of the Bloc Quebecois. 
Acadians form a thriving community that is proud of its roots and 
that is looking to the future. We do not need a self-appointed 
guardian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average observer of the Canadian political landscape can 
easily be led to confuse the logic of the Bloc Quebecois with 
that of the Parti Quebecois. This is perfectly normal, since one 
complements the other. It is particularly easy to illustrate. 
Again, not so long ago, the PQ government refused to take part in 
the Year of La Francophonie in Canada. That was not long ago, 
that was in April 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec minister responsible for Canadian intergovernmental 
affairs, Joseph Facal, explained his government's refusal by 
pointing out that “Quebec cannot, within the Canadian 
Francophonie, be put on the same level as francophone minorities 
in the rest of Canada”. So it all comes down to the statement by 
the Bloc leader: there are those who are saved, who live in 
Quebec, and those who are lost, who live outside of the promised 
land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not easy for Acadians to listen to such remarks. Remarks 
inspired, as I said, by the offensive, insulting and hurtful 
paternalistic attitude of the Bloc Quebecois separatists. Who has 
forgotten the now famous words of the member for 
Rimouski—Neigette-et-la Mitis “They have been assimilated—the 
francophones—poof.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Acadians helped build this country. They worked hard and 
with determination for the conservation and protection of their 
culture and of their identity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Acadians have founded schools, colleges and universities. 
They have created playhouses, newspapers and publishing houses. 
They have made exceptional breakthroughs in the areas of culture, 
such as theatre, movies, visual arts, music and literature. They 
have given the world writers, poets, artists, dancers, musicians 
and singers. They have set up an impressive network of businesses 
and have created jobs. They did not wait for anyone to take them 
by the hand and decide for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Acadian community in Canada is not comprised of one, but 
several communities spread out across the whole Atlantic region 
and elsewhere. 
In New Brunswick, the Acadians are concentrated in the southeast, 
the northeast and the northwest of the province, and there are 
also Acadian groups in Fredericton and Saint John. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Nova Scotia, there are vibrant Acadian communities in St. 
Mary's Bay, on the southwest shore, on Madame Island and in the 
Chéticamp area, in Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Prince Edward Island, the Acadians live in the Évangéline 
region. In Newfoundland, they are concentrated near Cape St. 
George, in St. John's and in Labrador City. Many also live on the 
Magdalen Islands, in Gaspé, in the Montreal area and in western 
Canada. All of these communities, some of them large and others 
not so large, illustrate the vitality of the Canadian people and 
of its two official languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Acadians take part in the success and prosperity of our 
country. The Government of Canada recognizes their vitality and 
their essential contribution to Canadian society. They are part 
of the seven million people in Canada who speak, sing, write, 
work and live in French. These francophones are evidence of the 
vitality and the extraordinary determination to move ahead and to 
flourish in a continent where the majority is anglophone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The English and French languages and the people who speak these 
languages have shaped Canada and helped define its identity. 
Canada's linguistic duality has its source in the very roots of 
our country. It is impossible to be interested in today's Canada 
without acknowledging the importance of these two languages and 
these two linguistic communities in Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get back to the main subject of this debate. While Bloc 
Quebecois members claim the opposite, recent history has taught 
us that the interest this party shows for francophone and Acadian 
communities in Canada is always motivated by a hidden political 
agenda. This motion hides the real intentions of the mover, and 
we cannot accept it. In this sense, intellectual honesty demands 
that we refuse to support this motion and this is why I invite 
members of this House to oppose it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate today on 
private member's Motion No. 241 which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a humble Address be presented to Her Excellency praying that 
she will intercede with Her Majesty to cause the British Crown to 
present an official apology to the Acadian people for the wrongs 
done to them in its name between 1755 and 1763. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the sentiment, the emotion and the sense of 
personal justice at the heart of the motion.  For the benefit 
Canadians watching the debate, I will sketch some of the details 
that have given cause for the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Acadia was explored initially by the Italians who named the 
region Arcadia in 1524.  A treaty passed the area back to the 
French in 1697.  Beginning in the 1670s French colonists left the 
major settlement at Port Royal to found other centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the war of the Spanish succession of 1701 to 1713, Acadia 
came under English rule.  From 1713 to 1744 the relatively small 
English presence permitted the Acadian population to grow at a 
pace that surpassed the average of the whole region.  This period 
was referred to as Acadia's golden age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>England demanded from its conquered subjects an oath of 
unconditional loyalty, but the Acadians agreed only to a position 
of neutrality.  This was accepted at that time.  England began 
bringing its own settlers into the area around 1749.  The British 
in Halifax decided to settle the Acadian question once and for 
all.  By refusing to pledge an unconditional oath of allegiance, 
the Acadian population risked deportation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Acadians initially refused to make the pledge, then 
acquiesced.  Lawrence, the English gentleman in charge of the 
settlement, was unhappy with a reluctant oath and executed the 
plan for deportation.  Why deportation?  Lawrence feared a 
combined attack by Louisbourg and Canada against Nova Scotia 
joined by the Mi'kmaq and the Acadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to historical record, the deportation process lasted 
from 1755 to 1762.  The Acadians were put onto ships and deported 
to English colonies as far south as Georgia.  Others managed to 
flee to French lands to hide in the woods.  It is believed that 
three-quarters of the Acadian population was deported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no distinction whatsoever made between the innocent 
and the guilty.  The tyrannical decision to deport was carried 
out under circumstances of the harshest cruelties.  More than 
7,000 third and fourth generation persons were transported from 
their homes and dispersed among the colonies bordering on the 
Atlantic, from Massachusetts to Georgia.  Their lands and 
possessions were forfeited to the crown without compensation. 
What is to be done now?  The motion demands an apology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us review a recent apology made by the Canadian government. 
Let us consider an exchange between Brian Mulroney and the late 
Pierre Trudeau concerning the apology to Japanese Canadians for 
their internment during the second world war.  Mr. Trudeau said, 
as per the June 29, 1984 <I>Hansard</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no way in which we can relive the history of that 
period.  In that sense, we cannot redress what was done.  We can 
express regret collectively, as we have done. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He further stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see how I can apologize for some historic event to which 
we or these people in this House were not a party.  We can regret 
that it happened.  But why mount to great heights of rhetoric in 
order to say that an apology is much better than an expression of 
regret?  This I cannot too well understand. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does Mulroney not apologize for what happened during the 
Second World War to mothers and fathers of people sitting in this 
House who went to concentration camps?  I know some of them, Mr. 
Speaker.  They were not Japanese Canadians.  They were Canadians 
of Italian or German origin, or some old French Canadians who 
went to jail, who went to concentration camps during the Second 
World War.  Why do we not apologize to them? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He further said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is the purpose of the Government to right the 
past.  It cannot re-write history.  It is our purpose to be just 
in our time, and that is what we have done by bringing in the 
Charter of Rights. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 14, 1994, the Liberal's position on redresses was 
articulated by the then secretary of state of multiculturalism 
and status of women, and not the one who is not apologizing for 
our gaff.  At that time it was Sheila Finestone.  She said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seeking to halt the wounds caused by the actions of previous 
governments, 6 ethno cultural communities have requested redress 
and compensation totalling hundreds of millions of dollars.  The 
government understands the strong feelings underlying these 
requests.  We share the desire to heal those wounds. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way there are now eight ethnocultural communities.  She 
continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is whether the best way to do this is to attempt to 
address the past or to invest in the future.  We believe our only 
choice lies in using limited government resources to create a 
more equitable society now and a better future for generations to 
come.  Therefore the government will not grant financial 
compensation for the requests made.  We believe our obligation 
lies in acting to prevent these wrongs from recurring. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this latter quote is most significant because this is 
what the hon. member from the Bloc Quebecois is up against in 
trying to have the government support his motion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I seriously doubt that he will be successful.  The apology and 
compensation package given to the Japanese Canadians has sent a 
precedent from which Italians and Ukrainians interned in World 
War I and World War II have also demanded apologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ukrainian group, according to the recommendations issued by 
the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association, has requested 
principally that Ottawa fund educational programs and provide for 
historical plaques, not direct compensation to victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Italians were not happy with Mulroney's expression of regret 
issued November 4, 1990 and are seeking a full apology and 
compensation.  Both these groups cite the apology given to 
Japanese Canadians as the reason they are deserving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also remind the House of another situation.  One of the 
political parties in the House was in power in 1914, when 376 
passengers who were British subjects arrived on a ship named 
<I>Komagata Maru</I>.  They were not allowed to land on Canadian 
soil because of an exclusionist immigration policy based on race 
and the country of origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy had its origin in the 1880s when the Canadian 
government first imposed a head tax on Chinese immigrants.  The 
government erected a variety of barriers until 1962.  The 
passengers on the <I>Komagata Maru</I> thought they had the right 
to enter Canada because they were British subjects.  Ninety per 
cent of the passengers on the ship were Sikhs.  The rest were 
Hindus and Muslims, but they were all from Punjab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sikh soldiers who had served throughout the British empire 
thought they should be able to work wherever the British flag was 
flying.  The passengers went without food and water on several 
occasions for more than 24 hours and the immigration officials 
held them incommunicado.  Even the lawyers hired on their behalf 
were not allowed to see them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Punjabi residents of Vancouver raised money to pay for the 
charter.  After two months of detention in the Vancouver harbour, 
the government brought in the cruiser the <I>Rainbow</I> and aimed 
its guns at the <I>Komagata Maru</I>.  The ship was escorted with 
352 passengers still on board.  It was a bitter and disappointing 
moment for the friends watching the ship disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A voyage that began on April 4th did not end until September 
29th in Calcutta, India, where the police opened fire on 
passengers and killed 19 of them.  Others were arrested.  In a 
more tolerant Canada, the <I>Komagata Maru</I> remains a powerful 
symbol for Sikhs and one that other Canadians should understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a consequence, we are beginning to reassess our past.  Will 
the government offer an official apology? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, I join 
with my colleague from the Bloc, the hon. member for 
Verchères—Les-Patriotes to speak on Motion No. 241 praying Her 
Excellency to intercede with Her Majesty to cause the British 
crown to present an official apology to the Acadian people for 
the wrongs done to them in its name between 1755 and 1763. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the House that this is private members' 
business, a private member's motion, which means that normally 
representatives of the various parties had to sit at a table and 
determine unanimously if the motion would be a votable item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members sitting at that table had disagreed, if, for 
instance, some Liberal and Alliance members had decided at that 
meeting to say no, we would not even be able to debate this 
motion for three hours and then vote on it. What it means is that 
members agreed with this motion. So, the House has to realize 
that this is a private member's motion and not a Bloc Quebecois 
motion. 
I wanted to make that clear. That is the reason I support my 
colleague from the Bloc Quebecois, who is half Acadian, wants to 
speak for the Acadians and is asking for an apology. Let me turn 
now to my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a full-blooded Acadian, I know about this historic period, as 
all Acadians do. What we call the deportation of the Acadians is 
surely the saddest period in the history of Acadia. 
The fact that I am sitting here, in this House, as an Acadian 
proves that it did not have the desired results.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They were asked to take the oath of allegiance to the British 
crown, in the hope that this would prevent these neutral people 
from taking up arms against the British. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It so happens that any self-respecting Acadian is a Catholic, 
and believe me, a practising Catholic. The Acadians refused to 
take the oath for two reasons: as Catholics, they were concerned 
about losing their right to practise their religion freely, and 
they were also concerned about being forced to take up arms 
against their motherland, France, or their cousins from Canada. 
All they wanted was to remain neutral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the authorities in London at the time, as a 
result of the correspondence sent by the lieutenant-governor, 
decided to let them go, since they refused to take the oath of 
allegiance, and thus acquire their lands, which were considered 
the best in the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, a judge from Nova Scotia ruled that any Acadians 
refusing to take the oath of allegiance would lose their property 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately Acadians were never invited to appear before the 
judge to plead their case, and the decision was fatal. 
It is following this ruling that it was decided that Acadians 
would be deported from the province of Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that this was in 1755. Seasons were sometimes 
difficult and resources very scarce. In the summer of 1755, 
preparations were made for the deportation of these neutral 
people. 
After the whole issue of the oath of allegiance, several 
thousands Acadians had already left the area, because relations 
had become very tense between the two groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, in Acadia, there were about 180,000 Acadians. 
Impressive, is it not? So the order to send enough ships to 
transport them to the chosen destinations was given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything had been well organized. The plan was to arrest all 
the Acadians they could in the most populated areas of Acadia, 
to embark them on ships and to disperse them in the 
Anglo-American colonies along the Atlantic coast, from 
Massachusetts to Georgia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important meeting was called in every local church where the 
heads of families, young men 10 years old and older and old men 
were held prisoner. Several Acadians, sensing danger, had fled 
into the woods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, several thousand were prisoners. Entire families were 
separated forever. Women never saw their husband again and 
hundreds of children became orphans. 
Is was a tragedy. One can imagine the suffering and the distress 
of these families. The same operation was carried out in several 
Acadians villages in 1755. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the words of Colonel Winslow, who was in charge of putting 
the Acadians from Grand-Pré and from all the area around Minas 
Basin on board the ships, according to Bona Arsenault, author of 
<I>L'histoire de l'Acadie</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inhabitants, wrote Winslow 
that very day, left their houses with sadness and regret. Women 
were very distressed, carrying their newborns in their arms; 
others brought along in carts their infirm parents and their 
personal effects.  In short, it was a scene in which confusion 
was mixed with despair and desolation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read these words with emotion, and I am certain that all those 
present can understand and share the consternation experienced 
by my ancestors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once they were separated, the Acadians were crowded into ships 
and sent to the Anglo-American colonies.  Some 7,000 Acadians 
were to be deported in this way to the colonies to face their 
fates alone, while others were enslaved.  Some fled into the 
forest, where they met death from cold, illness or starvation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This deportation went on for several years.  The Acadians were 
chased mercilessly from their homeland and plunged overnight 
into abject poverty, separated from their loved ones.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As any one familiar with Acadians will know, an Acadian can 
never be kept down.  Many came back to the maritimes, to 
restore their dear Acadia.  They settled in New Brunswick, Nova 
Scotia, Prince Edward Island and even the Gaspé, never again to 
see their family members or the members of their former 
communities from whom they had been separated by deportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite Canadians to visit the maritimes some day to 
learn more about the events in history that left their mark on a 
people, but also on Canada.  I am sure some of my colleagues 
in the House have Acadian blood in their veins, as my 
colleague for Verchères—les-Patriotes has just discovered. 
They have Acadian blood in their veins and do not know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> I don't. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Maybe not, but one never knows.  We could look 
into it. It would be a discovery of some significance for these 
individuals to find out that they have Acadian blood in their 
veins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In supporting Motion No. 241, I am speaking on behalf of all the 
Acadians who lost their lives, their families and their children 
in that part of Acadian history that has shaped the history of 
Canada and my own history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Acadian people are still around and have their own 
distinguishing characteristics and culture.  Over the years, they 
have never been as vibrant and proud of their identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I was disappointed to hear the member for 
Madawaska—Restigouche turning the debate into a partisan issue 
because I believe that every member elected to this place has the 
right to be here and to introduce a private member's motion, 
regardless of his political affiliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that the member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes was 
sincere in introducing his motion.  I have trouble accepting that 
members would rise in the House and accuse another party of being 
at fault.  We are Canadians.  As a pure-blooded Acadian, all that 
I am asking is that, when an error has been made or atrocities 
committed, it is not hard to say “I am sorry”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too have children.  If I make a mistake as a father, if I have 
done something wrong, I assume my responsibilities and I say “I 
am sorry, I made a mistake”.  This is how one wins the respect of 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We perhaps cannot forget certain disciplinary actions that were 
taken, but we can at least accept them.  We can see the future. I 
am forced to make this comment because I am disappointed at the 
speech made by the member across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether a minister did not write his speech for him. He 
calls himself the Acadian MP, but I think they will always say 
that they are Brayons.  I do not want to start another debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois motion will not turn back the clock, but it 
will right a terrible wrong.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a great 
pleasure for me to take part in this debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the hon. member for Verchères—Les-Patriotes for 
bringing the motion forward.  I believe the motives of the hon. 
member are genuine.  This is part of his personal history of 
which he is very proud.  From my brief conversation with the 
member this evening I believe it was in that spirit that he 
brought forth the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a people with a proud history.  Anyone who 
has done even peripheral reading on the history of the Acadians 
before 1755, during their expulsion in 1755 and after their 
return in 1763 or 1768, depending on the situation, knows that it 
is almost surreal.

</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Progressive Conservative Party is indeed supportive of 
the principle of the motion, we are also respectful of the 
Acadian community's right to generate its own request for an 
apology based on the desires of its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one should be too territorial in that regard.  It would be 
wrong for me to say that because the province of New Brunswick, 
the province I come from, has the largest Acadian population it 
should have the largest say in the matter.  We should consult all 
Acadian peoples whether they reside in Newfoundland, Prince 
Edward Island or Nova Scotia.  I point out that on their return 
from Louisiana many Acadians made their home in Quebec as well, 
where they have lived quite proudly for generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Acadian identity is intrinsically linked to the tragic 
events that surrounded the deportation.  The community has 
survived the centuries based on that common historical link.  I 
am very proud to live in a province that is proud of its history 
and its origins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need symbols to remember our collective history, and I am 
proud of how we embrace our linguistic and cultural duality in 
New Brunswick.  On the front lawn of the legislature in 
Fredericton, where I understand the hon. member has roots, the 
Acadian flag flies proud.  Except for the star of Mary, it is 
essentially the same as the flag of France.  The Acadians chose 
that flag because of their French roots but added the star of 
Mary, a symbol of the Roman Catholic Church, because they had an 
independent history of their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some concerns regarding a letter the Societé nationale 
de l'Acadie wrote to the hon. member for 
Verchères—Les-Patriotes.  The letter said: 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although, obviously I agree with the principle of the motion, I 
must tell you that we are indignant about the fact that it was 
brought forward without anyone having the courtesy to consult the 
Société nationale de l'Acadie beforehand. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Societé nationale de l'Acadie is very concerned about not 
having proper consultation, and we should be respectful of that. 
We should also be respectful of the provincial legislatures that 
are involved.  The premiers and legislatures of other provinces 
might want a say in the issue as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always been respectful that the province of Quebec has 
the right to speak for its own future.  I would argue as well 
that the Societé nationale de l'Acadie has the responsibility and 
the right to present the position of Acadians in requesting an 
apology of this nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party is very supportive of what I 
would say is the genuine motivation of the hon. member for 
putting the motion forward.  We say to the hon. member that it 
would perhaps be best if the motion were not taken away but set 
aside until the member has a chance to consult Acadian groups to 
see if a consensus can be achieved regarding the timing of the 
initiative.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there a solution or a compromise?  We live in a nation 
founded on compromise, and that spirit exists in all cultures in 
Canada.  Upon further consultation with the provinces, the 
Societe nationale de l'Acadie and perhaps other organizations 
representing the francophone and Acadian communities, we should 
be able to determine the timing.  At the end of the day, and I 
think the hon. member would agree, the timing of this should be 
decided by those collective bodies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps there is a negative implication to the motion.  Again, 
it is perhaps better that the motion be tabled because a vote by 
parliament against it may send the wrong message to the public 
that parliamentarians do not support the motion in principle. 
That is simply not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be prudent for us at this time to set the initiative 
aside until a broader consensus is built and to let the Acadian 
community make the decision for itself.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an event of major importance to Canada and our hemisphere. 
It is entirely appropriate that the House take note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The past twenty years have seen remarkable change in the 
Americas.  Democracy and the growth of free markets have raised 
new hopes and opened up new possibilities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dialogue and co-operation among the democratically elected 
governments have intensified in every field of endeavour and in 
every sphere of common interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has played an active role in supporting democratic 
transition and bringing out beneficial economic and social 
change.  We are engaged in the Americas because it is the right 
thing to do and because it is in our interest to do so.  Our 
future prosperity and stability are linked to our ability not 
just to recognize opportunities, but to act as a leader in this 
hemisphere. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our economic relations with the hemisphere have expressed our 
overall successes.  They have grown faster in the past 10 years 
than with any other region of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 90% of our trading is with the Americas, including the 
United States.  Its value has increased 170% in this period. But 
our relations are far from limited to trade. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year we celebrated the 10th anniversary of our membership 
in the Organization of American States and hosted perhaps the 
most remarkable general assembly in OAS history.  We are also 
working with other governments in the hemisphere across a range 
of sectoral interests that would have seemed unimaginable 20 
years ago.  Ministers in virtually every cabinet portfolio, not 
just foreign affairs and trade, meet regularly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is strongly supportive of the contribution of 
legislators in furthering understanding and co-operation in the 
Americas.  The inaugural meeting of the interparliamentary forum 
of the Americas, known as FIPA, was hosted by Canada's parliament 
earlier this month.  Its recommendations across a wide range of 
interests and the constructive input we have received from civil 
society have contributed to the policy development process for 
the upcoming summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Preparations for the Quebec City summit are nearing completion. 
The summit implementation review group, the intergovernmental 
body developing a declaration and plan of action for the summit, 
is setting out a coherent and balanced agenda with three main 
themes:  strengthening democracy, creating prosperity and 
realizing human potential. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to ensure that summit initiatives reflect the priorities 
of our hemisphere. Moreover, we are working with international 
and regional organizations, and with multilateral development 
banks, to get the necessary human and financial resources to 
turn our commitments into reality. 
This is fundamental for the credibility of the summit process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I alluded to the major themes of the summit. I do not believe 
that anyone can question their importance or relevance. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strength and unity of the hemisphere is based fundamentally 
on collective undertakings to consolidate democracy, protect 
human rights, promote the rule of law and enhance human security. 
A commitment to improving the quality of democracy is at the top 
of the summit agenda and will be further strengthened at Quebec 
City.  The summit declaration should, and I have every confidence 
that it will, make democracy an explicit condition for 
participation in summits.  Such a clear and vigorous statement 
would be an important outcome of the Quebec City summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summit will also mandate increased hemispheric co-operation 
to strengthen democracy by supporting improved electoral 
processes and systems, an area where Canada has been making 
important contributions for a number of years.  It will seek to 
rally support for international human rights instruments and for 
national institutions that promote and protect human rights 
within hemispheric countries.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Strong democracies must also be inclusive and put in place a 
forum for reasoned debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has worked to ensure that the process leading to the 
summit in Quebec City is open and transparent. Our country has 
been a leader in terms of consulting with and informing its 
civil society, through open meetings of the OAS special 
committee on the management of summits, and in other 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, a commitment to democratic principles and 
institutions, and to human rights, is the main criterion to 
participate in the summits. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments in the hemisphere have expressed serious concerns 
about democracy in Cuba.  It is this reason before any other that 
prevents Cuba from participating in the summits of the Americas. 
Let us be clear:  it is the government of Cuba, not of Canada or 
the other summit countries, that is keeping Cuba from 
participating in the summit process.  If Cuba wants a seat at the 
table, and we would hope that it would, it will need to 
demonstrate acceptance of democratic principles, including 
freedom of expression, political pluralism and international 
norms respecting human rights.  It is Cuba's choice to make. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of the criteria governing participation in the summit 
was raised regarding a number of other countries in the 
hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transition to democracy in the hemisphere is often a recent 
occurrence. Societies that are establishing or restoring 
democratic institutions often do so after years of authoritarian 
or military government. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been setbacks and progress has been uneven in some 
cases, but there has also been a continuing commitment to 
dialogue and to joint efforts to enhance democratic processes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is ample proof that the hemispheric community is actively 
and effectively engaged to enhance democratic processes.  In 
particular, that engagement has been in defence of democratic 
institutions in Ecuador, Paraguay and Haiti.  I would refer 
anyone with doubts on this score to the events last June in 
Windsor and the manner in which the OAS member states united to 
defend democracy in Peru.  As a result, new national elections 
will be held there on April 8. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Commitments to democracy and prosperity go hand in hand with the 
determination to encourage all people to take part in the 
economic, political, social and cultural life of their country 
and their region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Social initiatives at the summit will support education, 
improved health services, gender equality, participation and 
dialogue between governments and native peoples, as well as 
cultural diversity. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the hemisphere will reaffirm its commitment to good 
health as a fundamental building block for political, economic 
and social stability.  It will also carry forward commitments to 
improve access to and the quality of education.  Canada has also 
taken the lead in promoting gender equality as part of the summit 
commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summit will promote partnerships between indigenous peoples 
and governments to advance co-operation among the hemisphere's 
indigenous peoples on matters of common interest, notably in 
education, health and economic development.  I am pleased to 
welcome indigenous peoples from the Americas to Canada this week 
for the first indigenous summit of the Americas and to recognize 
the leadership of Canada's aboriginal communities in this 
important initiative.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It represents a step taken in co-operation with 34 different but

<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I think a lot of people in this place pay lip service to 
the idea of free trade, but sometimes we do not practise what we 
preach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I specifically want to raise the issue of tariffs still in place 
in Canada on products like textiles.  It always strikes me as odd 
that on the one hand we are prepared to send all kinds of aid, 
for instance, to Caribbean countries to help them out because in 
some cases they are in difficult circumstances, but on the other 
hand we will not open up our markets to textiles, for instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the minister could explain why we have taken that 
position and why we will not reduce these tariffs in order to 
ensure that the people in the Caribbean have a chance to prosper 
in the way they should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if it were question period 
I would refer to my colleague, the Minister for International 
Trade.  Indeed, he will have an opportunity to speak momentarily. 
The member for Medicine Hat may want to put his question to the 
minister as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say that in fact the objective of our negotiations toward 
a free trade area of the Americas is essentially to effect the 
very result the member is talking about.  I agree with him that 
if we are going to create prosperity, not just in the Caribbean 
but in developing countries around the world, fundamental to that 
is providing for them access to the markets of the developed 
world.  Otherwise how can we ever expect them to share in the 
prosperity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the example of that actually happening now in Mexico.  We 
see in the northern tier of that country increasing prosperity, 
falling levels of unemployment and rising wages.  In effect, 
NAFTA has worked for Mexico the way we would have expected it to 
happen.  It is not a transportation of jobs à la Ross Perot from 
the United States or Canada.  In fact, what is happening is the 
growth of a middle class in Mexico that is a big market for U.S. 
and Canadian goods, which is why our trade with Mexico has 
increased 100% since NAFTA.  Certainly the principle that the 
member for Medicine Hat espouses is one that I agree with. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, sometime when 
we talk about free trade it is as if we, in the NDP, were 
against free trade. We are not against free trade but in favour 
of fair trade. This is what we need here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we entered into free trade agreements such as, for 
instance, NAFTA, it was to increase the living standard. This is 
not what has happened, on the contrary. In Mexico, the standard 
of living has increased, but it has diminished in Canada. The 
idea was to increase the living standard in countries such as 
Mexico to bring it to the level of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will explain. Today in Canada there are more food banks than 
ever before. Every day new ones are being created. 
This is the kind of thing that is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, let us look at what has happened in the workplace. 
Workers have been deprived of their rights over the last few 
years, which is unacceptable. Free trade agreements such as the 
ones we entered into have not brought us, I believe, what we, as 
Canadians, were expecting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know what the minister has to say about that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley:  </B>Mr. Speaker, first, since NAFTA came into force, 
the unemployment rate has gone down here in Canada. The average 
salary for Canadian families has gone up. The unemployment rate 
went from 11% to around 6.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wealth is being created here in Canada because the most 
important right of workers is certainly the right to work. This 
is what is at the heart of the negotiations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the evening is off to a good start.  We are 
certainly going to have some very interesting exchanges and I am 
very pleased that we are holding an exploratory debate on the 
summit of the Americas in the House this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following on the enthusiastic remarks of my colleague, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, I would like to focus on the trade 
dimension because, of course, that is the dimension which comes 
under my immediate authority and which has to do with 
negotiations for the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to be taking part in the exploratory debate this 
evening.  Our country, Canada, is now resolutely committed to 
the Americas. 
Canada is now strongly rooted in the Americas and I am delighted 
at the leadership our country is now showing in the hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the Prime Minister of Canada, who will host the 
third Summit of the Americas in Quebec City, is demonstrating 
very well how firmly our country is now committed to this 
hemisphere.  I am very proud that the Prime Minister will be 
hosting his 33 counterparts, the heads of state and government 
leaders of 33 other countries. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade can help create stability and prosperity.  The trade 
element of the summit of the Americas is a very important 
contribution.  It is a contribution to wealth and to growth.  It 
is also leading directly to improving the stability and 
prosperity of our hemisphere.  Canada belongs to the Americas and 
to this hemisphere.  It is imperative that we do whatever we can 
to contribute to stability and prosperity which go hand in hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Open economies lead to more open political systems.  There is a 
direct immediate link between open economies and more open 
political systems.  We see it across our hemisphere.  We see the 
extraordinary example of Mexico which joined the United States 
and Canada in NAFTA.  What do we see?  We see a country that has 
achieved in five years the economic development that we thought 
would take twenty years.  NAFTA has helped Mexico to prosper, to 
develop, and it has contributed substantially to making Mexico a 
more democratic country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that Mexico has progressed so fast within NAFTA is 
allowing that great country to have stronger institutions and a 
stronger democratic system.  That is what trade can lead to and 
contribute to.  These are the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have lived it with Chile as well.  I remember how moved I was 
when I represented the Government of Canada in Santiago last year 
when Ricardo Lagos was sworn in as president of that country. 
What an emotion it was for the Chilean people to move in the 
direction of democracy.  Trade is of great importance and we 
already have a free trade agreement with Chile as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a deep conviction on the part of the government to 
contribute to stronger trade links.  We believe that trade leads 
to stability and we need that stability in our hemisphere. 
We believe in our hemisphere.  We have seen the extraordinary 
progress over the last several years.  The FTAA is a vote of 
confidence for the hemisphere's future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that, after several hundred years of theory and 
practice, free trade raises overall incomes.  That happens 
everywhere all the time.  It is extremely important that we 
continue to do it.  Canada has based its economy on export.  We 
are a country that has been very successful at international 
trade.  Only 10 years ago we exported 25% of our GDP. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We exported 25% of our gross domestic product in 1990.  Now we 
export 45% of our GDP.  This shows the progress we have made 
over the last ten years, from 25% of GDP to 45%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has managed to create two million more jobs in our 
economy since 1993.  We must therefore reject the prejudices 
that the jobs are going elsewhere, to Mexico or Latin America, 
when we are negotiating free trade agreements. Free trade is 
good for us, good for everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tony Blair, the Prime Minister of Great Britain and leader of 
the Labour Party, pointed out here in this very House to what 
degree “free trade is for the poor”.  It is absolutely obvious 
that we need to give the rest of our hemisphere the same 
opportunity we have for prosperity and development. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a lot to gain in the FTAA.  Today 94% of the goods 
from Latin American countries can enter Canada duty free.  That 
is not true the other way around.  Canadian access to Latin 
American countries is not nearly as good as their access to ours. 
We need to negotiate better access for Canadian businesses in 
Latin America, Central America and the Caribbean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need rules.  The FTAA is about rules that will avoid the 
continuous arbitrary evolution and rule changes.  It is very 
important that Canada continue that important trend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The developing countries of the world also want to be part of 
these trade agreements so that they too, like Canada, can also 
benefit.  They want the chance for wealth and prosperity that we 
enjoy and that we received largely by participating in the rules 
based system of GATT.  We must move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of things have been said in the House and elsewhere about 
the transparency of the negotiation.  Tonight I will be quite 
clear and open.  Never have I seen such an open and transparent 
trade negotiation.  Canadian leadership has been at the forefront 
of that effort.  Canada was the first nation to post its own 
negotiating position on a website a year ago.  We were followed 
by the United States, Mexico and Chile.  We now have transparent 
website access to the negotiating positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been an architect in the most open free trade 
negotiation that was ever undertaken.  I have challenged the 
opposition to give me one single example of a more open and 
transparent international trade negotiation.  The NDP, which 
keeps talking about these things, could not provide one single 
example. I am very proud of Canada's contribution to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want even more.  We hope very much that when Canada goes to 
Buenos Aires in a few weeks that we will be able to convince and 
persuade our colleagues from all countries to put their positions 
on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to say that in Buenos Aires we will 
be in mid-term negotiations.  A lot of people are getting very 
agitated and saying that in Quebec City a radical decision will 
be made about our future.  Let us put things into perspective. 
The Quebec City summit is extremely important for Canada's role 
and future in our hemisphere.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a meeting of ministers of international trade in 
Buenos Aires next April 6 and 7. 
That will be our mid-way meeting on the negotiations, but people 
need to realize that there are three years of negotiations left. 
There is therefore all the time needed to continue to consult 
Canadians, this House, the standing committee on foreign 
affairs, the business community, the unions and the NGOs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it was quite interesting listening to the Minister for 
International Trade talk about trade.  He stated that the FTAA 
was all about a rules based system that we needed.  It was his 
government that unilaterally created bad relations with Brazil 
when it retaliated and stopped importation of meat without much 
evidence.  We all know that it was retaliation against Brazil for 
not following the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now there is a danger that countries like Brazil will ignore WTO 
rulings and will not follow the rules based system.  What is the 
point of having all these things signed when there is a danger of 
countries not following the rules? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, before I answer the 
member's question I would like to correct what I said earlier, 
that Mexico had released its negotiating position.  It was Costa 
Rica, not Mexico.  I wanted to correct that for the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's question is very surprising.  We know what the 
situation is in Europe and in England.  We know how much it has 
cost that country.  Never has the government ever protected the 
safety and the public health of Canadians more than on the 
important issue of meat.  It was Canada's duty to stop the 
importation of meat.  We defended public health for the security 
of Canadians.  It had absolutely nothing to do with the trade 
challenge that we are having with the Brazilians at the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dispute between Canada and Brazil on the aircraft issue is 
to be dealt with at the WTO panel.  We do not want to contaminate 
our relationship with Brazil.  When the government made a stand 
for public health reasons alone, we would have liked opposition 
members not to have encouraged the Brazilians who may have 
believed some of them that it was a retaliation to trade when it 
was not.

<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I would 
like to present very briefly a few figures to the Minister for 
International Trade and ask for his comments on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What he is saying is that opening new markets fosters economic 
growth and, as a result, enriches all participants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let us take the world average of the per capita GDP and 
say it is equal to one hundred.  In 1980, the United States had 
a per capita GDP that was equivalent to 482; in 1998, it had 
increased to 625. The world average was 100. As for Mexico, in 
1980, its per capita GDP was 134; in 1998, it had fallen to 84. 
After NAFTA, the differential between the United States and 
Mexico grew, 
but during the same period, Brazil, and we have just spoken 
about this country's protectionist practices, showed an increase 
from 70 in 1980 to 96 in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister not agree that in addition to the opening of 
markets and the upholding of commercial rights we must include 
in these accords the protection of human rights and labour 
rights in order to ensure a real distribution of wealth? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I always find it 
interesting to hear the hon. member for Joliette, the new critic 
for the Bloc, condemning free trade so vigorously when his 
party, as well as the party we could in a way call the mother 
party in Quebec City, that is to say the real Parti Quebecois, 
have always supported free trade.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Joliette rose in this House today but 
unfortunately ,he did not have a blackboard so we could not 
understand all his sophisticated arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the wealth gap is an issue our government is dealing 
with. This is of concern to us. The Canadian International 
Development Agency is making a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here in Canada, we have social policies to compensate the wealth 
gap, but I can assure the House that there is absolutely no 
contradiction. Free trade and international trade raised the 
revenues of the richest and also of the poorest of Canadians. We 
must ensure that the latter benefit even more from free trade. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to the 
special debate on the upcoming summit of the Americas.  I think 
we all agree that it is an honour for Canada to be hosting this 
summit.  I hope it will prove to be a milestone in the creation 
of a new free trade area of the Americas.  The Canadian Alliance 
has consistently championed free trade as being in the best 
interests of Canadians and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well known that the Liberals once opposed a Canada-U.S. 
free trade agreement and NAFTA.  They promised that once they 
were in government they would abrogate those agreements.  We are 
happy they did not follow through with that commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, even Liberals can learn from their mistakes.  Just a 
few weeks ago the Minister of Industry, in Davos, apologized to 
former Prime Minister Mulroney and acknowledged that he was right 
about free trade and they were wrong.  We appreciate that 
acknowledgement.  They should acknowledge that because in 
1989 two way Canada-U.S. trade was $235 billion and by 1999 it 
had grown to $626 billion, an increase of more than 150% in 10 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be sharing my time, Mr. Speaker, with the member for 
Medicine Hat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far from damaging any of our identity or sovereignty, free trade 
helped to establish rules and procedures to clarify our trading 
relationship with the U.S.  We would benefit from a similar 
approach with the rest of Latin America.  Now we can build on the 
success of free trade and NAFTA to deepen and improve these 
relations with the rest of the hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FTAA would provide the mechanism to begin to extend some of 
our prosperity and the opportunity for prosperity to other 
countries.  Therefore, we welcome these negotiations on the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Liberals have learned to mouth the rhetoric of free 
trade, the reality is they cling to protectionism in their hearts. 
Some of the actions taken by the Liberals in recent months may 
threaten the prospect of negotiating a successful FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 11 of NAFTA, the foreign investment provisions, give 
protection to Canadian businesses abroad and also to foreign 
businesses in Canada.  Under NAFTA, from 1998-99 U.S. investment 
in Canada increased by $15 billion to $168 billion, while 
Canadian investment in the U.S. jumped by $10 billion to $120 
billion.  Both countries have seen large increases in foreign 
investment and in both directions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most countries in the Americas actually feel that foreign 
investment provisions similar to those in NAFTA would be to the 
mutual benefit of all countries.  We believe that.  However, the 
Government of Canada appears to be leading the charge to 
undermine those foreign investment rules.  We should not fear 
including chapter 11 in the FTAA when its inclusion in NAFTA has 
brought benefits to Canada and the United States alike in a 
reciprocal way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister for International Trade, who appears at times to be 
unsatisfied with the decisions of NAFTA tribunals in a few 
selective cases, has called for new side deals.  Those side deals 
would amend the meaning of the NAFTA chapter 11 provisions.  The 
official opposition is concerned that retrograde stand will limit 
free trade and deny protection for Canadian businesses operating 
elsewhere in the Americas, and perhaps prevent the 34 countries 
of the Americas from reaching a broader trade agreement.  That is 
our concern 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern we have with the government's trade policy is 
the centralist, father Ottawa knows best approach that the 
federal government takes toward consultation with the provinces.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First the provinces expect the Liberal government to include 
them in the context of the negotiations on the free trade area 
of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to the federal government of the day and its openness 
when the free trade agreement was negotiated with the United 
States some fifteen years ago, and then NAFTA after it, the 
Liberal government is refusing to put a formal mechanism in 
place for co-operation with the provinces in matters involving 
their participation in negotiations with other governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without questioning the federal government's foreign policy 
jurisdiction, there is a way to have the provinces participate 
fully in the negotiation of international agreements and to 
extend the provinces' constitutional jurisdiction to the 
international scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Australia should serve as an example.  In recent years, it has 
reviewed the international treaty and agreement negotiation 
process.  This exercise has resulted in significant reform in 
order to include each of the states in the process, including 
through the establishment of a council of treaties comprising 
the Prime Minister and the provincial premiers as well, along 
with a representation of the provincial officials on the 
standing committee on treaties.  With a little imagination and a 
lot of goodwill, a consensus may be found in which all Canadians 
win. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec, for example, has been at the forefront in having the 
provinces participate in international forums and organizations. 
This theory is known as the Gérin-Lajoie doctrine, following 
interventions by Paul Gérin-Lajoie, a former minister of 
education under Jean Lesage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, Ottawa's stubbornness is what catches the eye, 
when we should all be busy developing a strong position in 
support of Quebec and all the provinces in the perspective of 
the free trade area of the Americas. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there are many other citizens, especially young 
Canadians, who have fears about the consequences of the FTAA and 
other global trade deals.  I know many young people are planning 
to protest in the streets of Quebec during the summer.  I respect 
the protesters' right to free speech, the right to disagree and 
even at times to loudly disagree.  That is one of the privileges 
we have living in a democracy.  However, I hope the government 
will ensure that there is law and order in the streets of Quebec 
and that the summit itself is not disrupted.  I also hope that in 
doing that the government will be fair toward legitimate 
protesters and not attempt to use police authority to prevent 
political embarrassment as it appeared to have done in Vancouver 
during the APEC summit.  We hope that can be avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What concerns me most about the prospect of wide scale protest 
in Quebec City is that it shows that perhaps we as leaders in 
democratic societies have in some ways failed some of our young 
people.  We have not been able to demonstrate to at least some of 
these members of the next generation that democracy, freedom of 
trade and freedom of markets are not just about making money for 
multinational corporations, but also ensuring individual freedom 
and holding out hope for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The free market system allows a university student sitting in a 
college dorm to dream up a computer program that will make IBM or 
Microsoft tremble, and says that the law will protect these 
innovators against large monopolies that might try to intimidate 
them out of business.  International trade agreements protect the 
intellectual property rights of entrepreneurs against companies 
and governments that would profit from their ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In trying to expand free trade, whether in the Americas or 
globally, we are trying to broaden the circle of productivity and 
exchange so that the same right to create and innovate which we 
uphold for our citizens will be extended to citizens of the less 
developed world as well.

by a computer science student in St. John's or a small business 
person in Burlington to be extended to the citizens of Santiago, 
San Salvador and Bogota as well.  We have to demonstrate to our 
young people that free trade, free markets and democracy are not 
about favouring the rich but that it is a noble, principled cause that 
enables the poor to enjoy opportunity and experience progress, 
prosperity and peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year when the International Monetary Fund and the World 
Bank held meetings in Prague and the Czech Republic there were 
protests, as there have been in other global trade and finance 
meetings.  It was striking that most of the protesters were from 
western Europe and the United States.  The majority were not the 
local Czech students.  However these young people were not 
complacent.  Hundreds of thousands of them crowded in Wenceslas 
Square in 1989 during the so-called velvet revolution and forced 
out the communist dictatorship that had ruled the country with an 
iron fist since the Dubcek reforms were crushed in 1968.  Those 
young people of the Vaclav Havel generation had lived under a 
government that had denied free trade, free markets and free 
speech. The young people of Prague saw the alternative and they 
knew what the democratic west had to offer was a better and more 
principled alternative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as politicians and business leaders in the democratic 
developed countries have to learn to make not only an economic 
case or an intellectual case for free trade and free markets, but 
in fact a moral case as well that upholds the virtue of freedom. 
We have to show our youth that a democratic form of freedom of 
enterprise respects individuals, respects their individual 
potential and respects their freedom to grow, to achieve and to 
become all that they were providentially intended to be.  That is 
why we support these initiatives and that is why we will continue 
to stand for these principles. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a short comment and question for the Leader of 
the Opposition.  I as a western Canadian support trade.  It is a 
very important part of the economy of western Canada.  I support 
free trade and expanding trade.  It is very important for jobs, 
productivity and so on.  However, one concern I have about NAFTA, 
and some of the other trade deals, is the argument that it takes 
away some of the democratic control from local countries and 
communities.  Decisions can be made that affect the environment, 
social standards and issues of that sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A case in point was the Metalclad Corporation in Mexico.  In 
1996 it wanted to establish a waste disposal plant in one of the 
Mexican states.  The governor of the state and the local 
community said they did not want it in their state.  Metalclad 
sued that particular state of Mexico and was awarded some $17 
million U.S. That is now being appealed to a higher court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the Leader of the Opposition if he has some 
concerns about the lack of democracy in the trade deals.  It is 
not a question of trade, or more trade in the world or free 
trade.  In many cases there is a lack of democracy for countries 
to make decisions that affect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he share some of those concerns in terms of trying to build 
in some of these safeguards in the trade agreements?  Democracy 
is a very important thing.  People elect parliaments and those 
parliaments should be sovereign over those communities.  In some 
cases these trade deals are just a charter for investors and, in 
my opinion, run roughshod over democratic rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate that 
concern which is an important one.  The point the member made was 
that it was in a process of appeal.  As in any agreement there 
will always be those who will try to move a particular agreement 
to benefit them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the member that when NAFTA was being constructed, it 
was recognized by the provinces of Alberta and Quebec that in 
some nations different areas fell under provincial jurisdiction 
and others under federal jurisdiction.  Two areas which were 
identified as falling under provincial jurisdiction in Canada 
were labour and the environment.  Therefore side accords were 
constructed to acknowledge that.  With those side accords came 
the process of developing regulations and a dispute process so 
that when these came into conflict they could be attended to.

negotiations, these types of things can be put in place to 
prevent somebody from trying to take over and suppress democratic 
rights. In this case we will hope that when the appeal is heard 
there will be a proper reflecting back to those side accords.

want that too, it would be good for them also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question deals with cultural diversity. 
I would like to know if, with the opening of markets within the 
free trade area of the Americas, the Canadian Alliance has 
included in its policy a provision for the development of 
cultural diversity, for the maintenance and development of all 
the different cultures of which the Americas are made up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B> Madam Speaker, I can say tonight that the 
Canadian Alliance will support the provinces' jurisdictions, 
particularly with regard to culture, as the member described. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recognize that these are very important 
things for a province or a state. I can say tonight that the 
Canadian Alliance will continue to support a province or a state 
on this issue because, if it is important to them, it is 
important to us also.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the chance to rise and debate the issue 
today, the summit of the Americas.  While I was not going to just 
at this point, I do want to pick up on the theme at the point 
where my leader left off because I think it is very important. 
That is the idea that we as leaders in this place need to make 
the moral argument, along with the economic argument, for the 
idea of free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For too long I think a lot of us in this place and outside of it 
have been cowed by people who make the argument, sometimes by a 
protest, that we will lose our democracy if we give into the idea 
of a radical notion like free trade.  I want to dispel that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is simply not true historically, ever since Adam 
Smith, Adam Ferguson and David Hume sat around and talked about 
these ideas in Scotland 250 years ago and ultimately brought them 
about and made Scotland a leading country at that time.  At the 
time they were first debating this, Scotland was a poor second 
cousin to its friends below in England.  They embraced the idea 
of free trade and actually exceeded what was being done in 
England. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea spread and ultimately became the new orthodoxy, to the 
point where we of course have it all across North America and in 
the European Union, but also to the point where we have Labour 
Party prime ministers like Tony Blair coming into this place 
saying that we must have free trade, that free trade is the 
answer for people who are on the low end of the economic scale 
and that if we really want to help people who have been poor 
throughout their lives then we need to embrace ideas like free 
trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make that point especially to my friends in the New Democratic 
Party, who I think sometimes have resisted this idea far too 
much, to the point where I think they are hurting the very people 
they would help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for us in this place to stand up and make the 
argument, without fear, for free trade.  There is no question 
that not only does it affirm the principle of freedom that the 
people in this party, at least, believe in so strongly, but it 
also does leave people better off economically.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to congratulate the foreign affairs minister, who made a 
very good point and presented a good argument about how the North 
American Free Trade Agreement has benefited the poorest people in 
Mexico.  He pointed to northern Mexico, particularly around 
Monterrey, where people have prospered to the point where their 
unemployment rate has dropped quite dramatically.  People who 
have been unemployed or certainly underemployed now have well 
paid jobs because of NAFTA, because of free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we need to extend it and try to help people in other 
parts of the Americas as well.  I talked during my question 
period about free trade for the people in the Caribbean.  Those 
are economies that are completely underdeveloped.  Canada to some 
degree stood in the way of that, because we have tariffs in place 
on things like textiles, a value added product that they could be 
sending here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we want reciprocity.  We want to be able to get into their 
markets as well, but we must remember that when we lower our 
trade barriers and they lower theirs, efficiencies are created. 
Productivity increases.  Jobs are created.  Wages go up. 
Everybody is better off.  That is why we must have free trade. It 
helps people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a question of undermining democracy.  In fact, it is 
the most pro-democracy idea around, because what we have when we 
have free trade is people who vote with their dollars.  They say 
they do not only want to have the choice of buying the high 
tariff product that their country has protected from competition. 
They want to be able to choose from all those products out there, 
products that in some cases are much less costly for them than 
those that have been protected by tariffs in their country for a 
long time.  They want that option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who can scarcely afford a tariff economy are the ones who 
benefit the most when they have free trade.  They can use those 
dollars to purchase the things that are important to them.  There 
is a real democracy that occurs when we finally allow people to 
choose the goods and services they want, with their own money. We 
need to recognize that idea of voluntary exchange.  We get away 
from the idea of forcing people to choose from a very limited 
scope of products and allow people to voluntarily exchange goods 
and services across borders as well as within their country. 
That is a very democratic idea, this idea of freedom and 
voluntary exchange.  We should embrace those things if we believe 
in democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to switch gears now, if I may.  Just a couple of 
minutes ago, my friend the foreign affairs minister said that 
Canada, as part of the agreement, would spread the news about 
democracy and make the case that other countries should become 
more democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to argue that it is precisely because this place has 
fallen into disrepair that in some cases we have undermined our 
own argument for democracy.  We have to resort now to holding 
parallel summits at the summit of the Americas, in part, I would 
argue, because a lot of people today can argue that this place no 
longer represents their point of view.  Therefore, they try to do 
an end run around what is supposed to be the most democratic 
institution in the country.  The result is that the government 
caves in and says it will set up the people's summit as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would not have to resort to that if this place were reformed 
along the lines that many of my colleagues have argued.  I think 
of the House leader for the Canadian Alliance who has made a 
powerful case that we could do a lot in this place to give 
confidence to people that their views will be represented in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people across the country felt that way, then they would not 
be doing the end run around parliament.  There would not have to 
be a people's summit.  They would come to committee and make 
their case for free trade or against free trade.  The people on 
that committee would take their views seriously and would make 
recommendations that would have weight in this place.  People 
would know that this democratic institution counted for 
something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, they do not have that confidence today.  As a result, 
we have people who in many cases, I would argue, do not represent 
very many people, but who can make the plausible case that 
parliament is no longer representative so they want to have this 
parallel summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make the point that I do not agree with those groups. 
I do not even necessarily agree with the people's summit, but I 
do think this place should represent the views of those people 
who are going to that people's summit.  There should be room for 
those people to come before whatever committee, make their case 
and have representatives in parliament carry their case forward.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For reasons that are not clear to me, the NDP in particular has 
not been successful in carrying the case for some of those people 
who are opposed to the free trade agreement, but that is the 
NDP's problem.  I simply want to say that parliament could be a 
lot more effective than it has been in reflecting the views of 
people who feel strongly about free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I want to make the point that several years ago the MAI, 
the multilateral agreement on investment, was being discussed by 
the government, along with many other countries.  I think they 
had a good end in mind.  They basically wanted to encourage rules 
based trade in investment, but unfortunately because they 
conducted everything in secrecy the whole deal was ultimately 
torpedoed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the Reform Party at the time that sponsored the only 
debate on that issue.  We in the Reform Party were the only ones 
who brought that issue forward.  We said that the best way to 
ensure that there was not all kinds of conjecture and speculation 
about the MAI, which in some cases was unwarranted, was to 
sponsor debate, get the information out there and allow people to 
find out what was really going on.  Ultimately that deal 
collapsed because there was not enough scrutiny of what was going 
on.  People did not have confidence in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let that be a lesson.  This place could stand more 
debates like that one we sponsored several years ago.  We are 
happy about this debate tonight, but it should go beyond that. 
When this free trade agreement is ultimately consummated, as we 
hope it will be, and comes to this place, as we hope it will, we 
would like to have a debate.  We would like to have a vote in 
this place on the free trade agreement of the Americas.  It 
should not be something the government just signs and then that 
is all there is.  We want to have a debate here and we want to 
have a vote on that agreement, yes or no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by again affirming what my leader has said, 
which is that we need to have free trade.  It is the morally 
correct thing to do for the people of the western hemisphere 
because it leaves those people better off no matter what income 
group they are in.  Second, we need to reform this place so that 
we do not need to have these parallel summits, so that people can 
have confidence in what should be highest democratic forum in the 
country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the chance to comment on this debate. 
I do hope that perhaps somewhere a bureaucrat is taking notes of 
the debate tonight, because there is not a whole lot else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Medicine Hat has made a strong case, as has the 
leader of the Canadian Alliance, about the morality, if we will, 
of the free trade movement that is going on around the world.  I 
think the free trade agreement of the Americas has the potential 
to create a strong middle class in parts of the world that have 
not experienced it.  They have very poor populations with a 
wealthy group at the top, but no strong middle class. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the creation of a strong middle class that should be the 
aim of any international trade agreements we have with other 
countries.  A strong middle class is the best guarantor of a good 
clean environment.  A strong middle class is the best guarantor 
of human rights and democratic reform.  A strong middle class is 
the best assurance of strong labour laws, because a strong middle 
class will be working in a society and will want to have rules. A 
strong middle class is the best assurance of the creation of 
wealth, and the creation of wealth is what the free trade 
agreement could bring to parts of the Americas that have not 
experienced wealth in any meaningful way in their entire 
existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I agree with the member about the danger we are facing. 
I fear we are going to see it.  The NDP has encouraged some 
rather scurrilous behaviour, I think, in Quebec.  I do fear for 
the free trade movement, because the government refuses to accept 
parliament's role in approving, debating and ratifying any future 
free trade agreements.  It is done in Australia, which has a 
system of approving in parliament.  It is done in New Zealand.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States the president can try to fast track it, but 
he knows that he has to have the senate on board.  If it is 
Switzerland there would have to be a referendum on it.  In most 
jurisdictions of the world all the power is not with the 
executive.  It is spread out among parliament, as it should be, 
which creates a sense of confidence in the agreements that are 
being signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I plead with the government in its negotiations and in 
negotiations to come on the free trade agreement of the Americas 
and other free trade agreements to bring those agreements to the 
House of Commons for ratification. By doing so, by opening up the 
debate, it can get all Canadians on side.  These debates and 
these arguments could be made in a free way in the House and in 
committee by bringing in witnesses and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member for Medicine Hat.  Does he 
believe that bringing agreements like the free trade agreement of 
the Americas to the House of Commons would make any difference? 
Would it satisfy those people who will go to Quebec City, bound 
and determined to shut down the free trade agreement?  Would it 
help them to understand and to give us an opportunity to carry 
the argument, as Tony Blair said, in a passionate way about the 
value and the importance of free trade agreements? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate my 
friend's intervention.  He made an impassioned plea for free 
trade in the course of asking his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made a point about the middle class.  Mexico now has a larger 
middle class than we have in Canada.  It is a more populous 
country, but it started out as a country that had a lot of 
wealthy people and a lot of poor people.  However, free trade and 
other economic reforms that it has undertaken have now turned 
that country into a real emerging nation, one that is becoming 
much more prosperous with each passing day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend asked whether a vote in this place on the free trade 
agreement would quell some of the opposition we are hearing from 
NDP members and some of their friends.  I am not convinced it 
would.  The NDP is philosophically so opposed to this that in 
some cases it pays lip service to the idea of democracy and uses 
it as a bit of a stalking horse because it is completely opposed 
to this idea.  We see that almost daily in this place where it 
offers up example after example of arguments against the concept 
of free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to remember that free trade itself is a democratic 
principle.  It is the freeing up of people to trade goods and 
services as they see fit.  It allows people, like my leader said, 
who are just starting out and have an idea to produce that idea 
and exchange it with others around the world or across borders. 
It is a democratic idea.  If my friends in the NDP cannot 
understand that and do not appreciate that, I do not believe they 
are truly committed to the idea of real democracy.

<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, let me begin 
by saying that I will share my time with the hon. member for 
Joliette. We will each speak for ten minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First off, I want to stress the major role played by Quebecers 
in 1988, when they supported free trade for Canada. I remind all 
my fellow Quebecers and Canadians who are listening that, had it 
not been for Quebecers, Brian Mulroney, who was the Prime 
Minister at the time, would probably not have had a mandate to 
negotiate the free trade agreement with the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This happened, however, after a debate that often generated 
strong opposition on the part of the labour and social 
movements. However, a real debate did take place and in the end a 
majority of Quebecers supported this initiative. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1935"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT115"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, I would remind hon. members that, at the time, the 
party now in office opposed the free trade agreement. Not only 
were the Liberals opposed to it, they condemned it with every 
ounce of energy they had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also point out that the free trade agreement was the 
result of a recommendation made by the Macdonald commission, 
which was set up by Prime Minister Trudeau during his last 
mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add, for the benefit of those listening, that 
when the Macdonald commission recommended the adoption of a free 
trade agreement with the United States, it did mention that it 
might not be the best of worlds but that, in the North American 
context, with multinational companies controlling 70% of the 
trade between the two countries, Canada did not really have a 
choice, because other corporations were being penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like to recall this because, when the current government came 
to power in 1993, it also ran against the other free trade 
agreement negotiated by the previous government, the free trade 
agreement with Mexico. Speaking about this agreement known as 
NAFTA, the current Prime Minister had said he would not complete 
it, that he would reopen the negotiations, but he has not done 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then, we have gained experience. 
I am sure that Quebecers are still in favour of free trade. 
However, it is for a reason that there is a strong movement in 
Quebec, in what has become known as the civil society. People 
are concerned that the free trade area of the Americas that we 
are developing will not be specific enough when it comes to 
social rights, the power taken away from corporations as 
compared to the former NAFTA, and democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The civil society, to which the Bloc Quebecois subscribes, is 
saying yes to the free trade zone of the Americas. However, we 
should be cautious and use any leverage we have to make sure 
that the social and cultural requirements of Quebec, which is even 
more in a minority position, with its French language and 
culture, within the three Americas than within North America, and 
the requirements regarding the place of Quebec are met. At this 
point, I will deal with the first point I want to talk about, 
that is the transparency of these negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we mean by transparency? We mean the ability for 
parliamentarians, the civil society, citizens and organizations, 
and not only corporations, because they are involved and 
in the know, the ability for these groups and individuals to know 
what is at stake, and be able to monitor what is going on in 
order to try to influence the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not naive; we know that the Government of Canada, the 
provincial governments and foreign governments are subject to 
strong pressure on the part of corporations, especially 
multinationals, that, under the guise of seemingly legitimate 
reasons, want to have more opportunities to expand and make 
bigger profits.

<A HREF="#LINKT116"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, to be able to monitor what is at stake, transparency 
is required. For us, transparency starts with having access to 
the basic documents which will be used during the negotiations, 
documents which will be presented in Buenos Aires on April 6 and 7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transparency also means that parliament should vote on the 
agreement. I intend to introduce in the House, as early as 
tomorrow, a private member's bill, which hopefully will be 
supported by my opposition colleagues and by the party in power. 
This bill was originally introduced by my colleague Daniel Turp, 
who was unfortunately defeated, and had received broad support 
at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential that we have a power relationship in which 
citizens and groups can tell as forcefully as they can that they 
do not want to be subjected to purely commercial imperatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec should also be involved in this negotiation. I want to 
emphasize that as strongly as I can. Why should Quebec be 
involved and not be merely consulted? It should be involved for 
two main reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one is its language and culture, which it shares 
completely with Haiti only. When Canada stands for that, on the 
one hand, but, on the other, it is one of the countries that— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew:</B> What about the Acadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to be able to 
complete my remarks. 
When his turn comes, I will listen to my colleague with great 
attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like Quebec to be involved because it is a 
French speaking nation and it has its own development model. I 
know the international trade minister can understand this kind 
of argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec model is found in many service sectors where private 
non-profit agencies are largely but not totally financed by the 
government. They often operate in a commercial environment. We 
should find a specific and sufficiently flexible solution so 
that the government does not have its hands tied. This model 
must be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also talk about supply management in agriculture and 
agrifood. It may be a problem elsewhere, but it is an integral 
part of the structure of the Quebec society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec must be allowed to join in the negotiations. I realize 
that Quebec is not the only province to have made this request. 
It has done so along with the Canadian provinces that are 
specifically asking to join in the negotiations, something 
which, as I said, is much more than a consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because our speaking time is limited, I must unfortunately 
conclude. I will point out that this summit of the Americas and 
this free trade area of the Americas are unique. As former 
Quebec premier, Pierre-Marc Johnson, said in committee the day 
before yesterday, the United States represent 75% of the total 
GDP. Four other countries, namely Brazil, Canada, Mexico and 
Argentina, account for 20% of the total GDP, and the 29 other 
countries, 5%.

question, can be complemented by measures, including, why not, a 
structural fund like the one that Vicente Fox requested when he

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened in 
amazement to what my colleague said.  I have heard her raise the 
point about transparency before as if to suggest that there has 
been no consultation by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should consider the following.  The issue has 
been raised at the standing committee as recently as today.  A 
colleague and I were at two different meetings of the standing 
committee on this very topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been extensive meetings with the Minister for 
International Trade with NGOs, including the province of Quebec. 
There have been ongoing consultations with the Minister for 
International Trade and his provincial counterparts.  Our 
positions are on the website, the first time ever that such a 
thing has been done.  The minister has committed to raise the 
need for greater transparency at the upcoming meeting in April in 
Buenos Aires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put a question in committee earlier today and I put it again 
on the floor of the House of Commons.  I would like to give the 
member an opportunity to respond to it.  Could she give us a 
specific example of any trade negotiation involving Canada that 
has been more transparent or even as transparent as the current 
one? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleague to 
listen to me even more carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to transparency, texts are not for consultation 
only; they are for learning. I have taken part in negotiations 
for 15 years. Consultation has a specific purpose: to ask people 
what they want, but the negotiation process is to know what 
people want and eventually to come to some agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we know there are issues such as chapter 11 that involve 
corporations on one side and countries on the other side. We 
must know what is happening there to be able to bring some 
pressure to bear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My specific answer to your question is that this little website 
that contains your partial positions, if you understood the 
first part of my speech, is not enough; it is not enough for a 
democratic exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy that the Minister for International Trade has 
understood this by committing to ask the other countries if they 
are willing to make the documents public. If not, he will 
consider doing the same as the United States and making them 
available at least to parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, for a democratic exercise, we must not only say what 
we wish for, we must know what the stakes are.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would say to my hon. colleague 
from the Bloc Quebecois that in my own personal view this is not 
really a talk about free trade.  It is more a talk about the 
protection of investor rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would her party not agree that prior to any sort of 
profitability being discussed or the protection of investors or 
the movement of goods and services, that environment and human 
rights should be discussed?  The protection of our environment is 
so sacred to any agreements that it must be discussed first. 
Agreements must also be discussed in terms of human rights 
throughout a country, so that a country's workers are not 
exploited to the advantage of another country. Would the hon. 
member agree with this statement?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, I must say to my hon. 
colleague that if he had listened to the speeches of the Bloc 
members, he would know that they covered what he is talking 
about, except that we do not say no. In fact, a no would not 
translate into more power relationships in free trade. We say 
yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would tell him to lobby with us so that the 
negotiations do not start from chapter 11 as it is, which would 
lead to a double standard for investments and social rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is extremely important, but I want to also tell him 
that the southern countries do want access to our markets. 
We must give them that access, while protecting our rights, our 
environment and our culture. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
remind hon. members to begin with that this take note debate on 
the summit of the Americas is in fact the consolation prize the 
federal government has awarded to members of the House of 
Commons after the defeat of my motion of February 15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind hon. members that the motion, which was supported 
by all opposition parties, called for the government to bring 
any final draft of the agreement on the free trade area of the 
Americas before the House so that it might be debated and put to 
a vote before anything whatsoever was signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if it is clear, since my colleague from Mercier has already 
begun to do so, we are going to take advantage of this 
opportunity to remind hon. members of the Bloc Quebecois 
position.  It must also be made very clear that at no time is 
this exercise we are engaged in this evening to be seen as 
replacing a true debate and a decision by this House concerning 
the final free trade area of the Americas agreement, with all 
pertinent information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us, this means not only disclosure of all texts currently 
being worked on by the nine negotiating tables, but also regular 
reports on the progress of negotiations at those same tables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, one of the themes of the summit of the Americas is 
enhancing democratic development.  We find it somewhat 
paradoxical, if not downright contradictory, that at the very 
moment the federal government is telling us proudly about this 
theme of the summit of the Americas, we are here in this very 
House in the process of watering down representative democracy 
by refusing to allow MPs to debate and vote on the free trade 
area of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This calls to mind a proverb in French which could be 
paraphrased this way “Dictatorship is: shut your mouth, and 
democracy for the Liberals—my addition here—is: keep talking”. 
Not only we parliamentarians have this impression, but so does 
the public. We are made to talk and talk, we are informed, but 
what people say, be they parliamentarians or the public, is not 
taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, the debate we are having is not enough to really 
speak of true transparency.  The Bloc Quebecois thinks that 
transparency is vital to the success of the free trade area of 
the Americas, which we support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Mercier mentioned, the Minister for 
International Trade is also a supporter and also believes that 
the current process is not transparent enough, since he agrees 
with the fact that the basic negotiation texts should be made 
public.  This is tantamount to admitting that the current 
processes is not transparent enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago as well, it was making public the supplementary 
proposals in order to strengthen ties with the public.  Clearly 
this all arises from the fact that there is social mobilization 
across the Americas, across Canada and across Quebec, and that 
the Liberal government should take note of the fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we are witnessing more of a monologue by the public and 
parliamentarians and, at best, a dialogue of the deaf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bridges must be built if we are to prevent demonstrations from 
getting out of hand. Not simply at the Quebec summit, because we 
have been rightly reminded that negotiations will continue over 
several years, but so there will be debate throughout Quebec and 
Canadian society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sponsorship system put in place by the federal government to 
fund part of the summit of the Americas will certainly not send 
the right signals to civil society and to all Quebecers and 
Canadians. It is clear that the business world has privileged 
access to decision makers in the whole process, and this is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The business forum will soon meet. I believe that international 
trade ministers will meet almost at the same time in Buenos 
Aires. The business forum has access to the heads of state and 
ministers concerned. 
The Bloc Quebecois is asking that such access be made available 
to all segments of civil society and not just business people, 
as is currently the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government should show leadership and propose, at 
the upcoming summit of the Americas in Quebec City, that the 
continental social alliance be recognized as an essential 
component, as a stakeholder in the negotiation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The continental social alliance includes major union 
organizations, social groups, international co-operation bodies, 
women's groups and environmentalists from across the Americas. 
These people have made extraordinary efforts to set up a network 
across the Americas, and they will be in Quebec City for the 
people's summit. 
This network should have a voice, just like the business forum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague pointed out, the provinces also have a role to 
play. A formal mechanism is needed, particularly for Quebec, the 
only truly francophone state in the Americas. Because we account 
for 2% of the population of the Americas, we have specific needs 
that must be protected and that must be taken into account in 
the negotiations. Therefore, officials from the Quebec 
government must be part of the Canadian negotiation teams and 
binational teams, to protect the interests of Quebec and ensure 
that the right decisions are made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remind the House that the Bloc Quebecois wants to see the 
FTAA agreement contain references to fundamental rights such as 
human, labour and environmental rights.  This is true and it was 
mentioned by many:  Quebecers are already favourably predisposed 
toward free trade.  That is understandable, given that 51% of 
what is produced in Quebec is exported to Canada, the United 
States or other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers are well aware of the principle of international 
trade, by which one imports what one cannot produce or produce 
cost effectively, and exports in order to be able to pay the cost 
of imports,  but one must not export for the sake of exporting. 
This is the principle of free trade which Quebecers are 
defending, not the principle of exporting at any cost, to the 
detriment of labour, human and environmental rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the Minister for International Trade, Quebecers learned 
some lessons from NAFTA and the MAI. They have a better grasp of 
the situation than the minister.  They are only too aware that 
free trade did not resolve all the problems of inequality in our 
society, or in the NAFTA nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the House that even if the minister is more 
visual than auditory—something I learned today—the figures are 
there.  All he has to do is refer to the World Bank figures. 
Canada and Mexico have lost ground compared to the United States 
since the early 1980s, and these are the 1998 figures.  He can 
deny the facts all he wants, but the facts are there and they 
are verifiable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that the problem concerning what workers in 
Mexico are paid is to be blamed on free trade only, but the fact 
is that free trade is not the cure-all for all societies' 
problems, and that other mechanisms are needed besides merely 
protecting the rights of companies and investors. In Mexico, 
people were being paid 22% of the American wage in the early 
1980s and now the figure is 10%. That is a drop by half. Those 
are the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why, within the agreement on the free trade area of the 
Americas, the signatory states commit, in exchange for 
commercial and financial benefits, to respect human rights, 
labour rights, the basic conventions of the International Labour 
Organization and the environmental rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean that we should take a penalty based approach 
to protecting those rights, but there must be a political 
commitment on the part of all states to respect them. If working 
plans are necessary to ensure that these rights are respected, 
and a structural fund has to be put in place, as my hon. 
colleague suggested, to help states with such problems as child 
labour, then that will be done.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one country refuses to respect fundamental rights, it will be 
excluded from the FTAA because it will no longer belong there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Canadians and Quebecers would never have accepted to 
be part of a free trade area with Pinochet's Chile.  We might as 
well recognize that right now, instead of putting our heads in 
the sand like some of us are doing here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to say that the free trade area of the Americas 
could be a wonderful opportunity for additional co-operation 
among countries of North America, Central America and Latin 
America, provided we provide all the ingredients required for 
that FTAA to succeed. 
The ingredients are not there yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why, at the summit of the Americas, the Bloc Quebecois 
will join forces with the civil society in Quebec to prepare an 
alternative to the project now tabled, which we disapprove of 
intensely.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in another life I 
too was involved in negotiations.  I would like to ask my 
question of the Bloc Quebecois collectively, but I will direct it 
to the member for Joliette even though similar comments were made 
by his colleague, the member for Mercier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister for International Trade and the Prime Minister have 
made it clear that they are looking toward the greatest 
transparency possible.  Is the member for Joliette suggesting 
that we actually release these texts unilaterally without the 
agreement of our trading partners?  Is that what he is seriously 
suggesting?  Would he not consider that highly irresponsible? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette: </B>Mr. Speaker, I must say that since the 
minister has informed us that he was going to propose at the 
Buenos Aires meeting that the texts be made public, I think that 
this process can enable us to wait for the Buenos Aires meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After Buenos Aires, it seems to me that we will need to ask some 
serious questions about the way parliamentarians and the general 
public can gain access to more information than at the present 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of Quebec has made the texts to which access has 
been refused us available, and will continue to make them 
available to its MNAs who are members of the Commission des 
institutions du Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the minister identify the countries opposed 
to public access to these documents, so that there can be a 
debate thereafter in this House on all the ins and outs of the 
question and a decision can be reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, I am not in favour of unilateral action, but I am not 
totally excluding it either.  I am waiting to see a full report 
of what goes on in Buenos Aires, in order to have a better idea 
of the situation.  If the countries opposed to making the texts 
public are the ones already known for their conservative, 
sometimes even reactionary, policies, then the situation will, 
in my opinion, be different than if Canada were the only one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, regardless of the situation, the texts should be made 
available to parliamentarians, particularly if they are members 
of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade.

<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to note that the 
member for Medicine Hat and the member for Fraser Valley, both of 
the Reform Party, get very afraid when the New Democrats and 
their leader stand up for the environment and human rights.  They 
get very frightened of that because they do not understand the 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention something to the member from the Bloc for whom 
I have great respect.  He mentioned the growing inequality, not 
only around the world but in this country.  Since free trade, the 
wage, earning and social gaps between the poor and the rich have 
expanded tremendously.  We see it every day.  This is a result of 
the free trade agreement which is not balanced and equitable to 
all people of all economic status in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he comment on that?  Would he agree that there is a 
growing inequality among the various levels of the economic 
ladder? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Paquette:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not one of those who 
blindly endorses free trade, but I will not blame free trade for 
all the ills we are experiencing in Canada and Quebec as well as 
globally.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think one of our big problems stems from the fact that, in the 
last few years our governments made the wrong decisions in 
facing free trade issues. They all moved toward a lowering of 
labour and social costs instead of looking for answers on a 
higher level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that as a society particularly in Canada and in Quebec, 
we will be able to meet the free trade challenge while 
maintaining and raising our social standards. I think we can do 
it, providing the political will is there. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to participate in the take note debate 
this evening on the free trade of the Americas trade agreement 
that is under negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pick on that brief exchange that took place a moment 
ago around the concern that we have expressed again and again, as 
have members of the Bloc Quebecois, about the lack of 
transparency of the government in making available to Canadian 
citizens precisely what it is negotiating on our behalf.  Of all 
the unconvincing, disingenuous arguments that the government has 
put forward, the worst is that it would like to be free and would 
be in favour of releasing the text.  However because some of the 
other governments are not in full agreement with that, it cannot 
do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the test of whether the text ought to be released or not 
to Canadian citizens is whether Canadian citizens are asking that 
it be released.  I do not think there is any question that 
Canadians, who have concerned themselves with the corporatist 
agenda of the government and the fact that by and large the trade 
agreements that the government has signed on to or has been 
actively promoting in recent years that are corporate driven and 
corporate dominated, absolutely want to know what it is that is 
being negotiated on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is opposed to the details and the text of the FTAA being 
released?  It is not the citizens on whose behalf the government 
claims to be negotiating, it is the corporate elite who want to 
be sure that they have their fingers all over it.  They want to 
have the kind of preferential access that the government seems 
quite prepared to give them and to heck with whether citizens are 
happy or not with what is being negotiated on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure some members may have heard Bruce Cockburn.  He is a 
well known and much admired Canadian artist, singer and musician. 
He recently spoke at his induction to the Canadian Music Hall of 
Fame.  On that occasion he expressed, in a way that I think was 
very dramatic and welcomed and which struck a really responsive 
chord with a lot of people, his dismay over the fact that a 
genuine citizens' movement around the world to build community is 
being effectively hijacked by the greedy movement of global 
commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He summed up his feelings in the following way “The mercantile 
system sucked when they tried it in the 1700s and it sucks now. 
This is our community.  This is our world”.  I think the reason 
why Bruce Cockburn struck such a responsive chord is that this is 
exactly the way citizens are increasingly feeling about what the 
government claims to be doing on their behalf in negotiating the 
FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We welcome the debate this evening.  I listened carefully to the 
words of the international affairs minister and the foreign 
affairs minister.  I listened to the words of the international 
trade minister who basically said, and I could not believe my 
ears, that everything is fine and that there is nothing to worry 
about because the FTAA represents a vote of confidence for the 
hemisphere's future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What on earth does that mean?  I would say that is about as 
vague as most of the answers the Liberals have given to the 
dozens of questions that we have been posing in parliament day in 
and day out, week in and week out, to try to get at the 
substantive issues that citizens are genuinely concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard government members again tonight, as well as official 
opposition members, suggest that the New Democratic Party is 
somehow not in favour of trade.  For the record, let me say at 
the outset that we unequivocally represent the importance of 
trade to our economy, to jobs and to future prosperity.  It is 
precisely because we recognize the importance of trade that it is 
critical that we enter into proper trade deals.  That is why New 
Democrats talk about free trade not in some absolutely open ended 
uncritical way, but about fair trade.  That is why we insist on 
talking about the model for trade and about the specific 
principles that underlie the kinds of trade agreements that we 
enter into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say again very clearly for the record, and I do not know 
how many times we have to say it, that we are absolutely in 
favour of rules based trade.  That is what it means to enter into 
trade agreements.  However the rules that are contained in the 
trade agreements that we sign need to be rules that protect the 
rights and advance the interests of our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason there is a growing mobilization of civil society in 
this country, and in many other countries around the world 
against the model of free trade that is being advanced by the 
Government of Canada and many other governments, is that the 
principles underlying those trade deals and the details contained 
in them are not about advancing and strengthening the rights and 
improving the prospects of citizens.  They are about responding 
to the dictates and the demands of corporations in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern that is growing goes beyond that.  It is a struggle 
to get our governments to address the genuine and legitimate 
concerns that exist regarding the trade deals to which we are now 
a party, concerns that have been documented and that have arisen 
out of decisions that were made out of the implications which 
have flowed directly from trade deals.  The government is 
completely ignoring these concerns.  In a very real sense, a lot 
of our citizens see that it is more than a struggle for a 
particular kind of trade agreement.  It has become a struggle for 
democracy itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing under negotiation regarding the trade agreement, which 
is of enormous concern, is the extraordinary powers that will be 
awarded to corporations.  It is absolutely unprecedented.  It is 
literally true that the FTAA will be the most extensive trade 
deal negotiated in the history of the world.  It is not an 
exaggeration to say that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would the trade deal do?  We would be very happy to hear 
that we are dead wrong about this, but that trade deal would 
take some of the elements of NAFTA that already are a concern and 
clearly need to be addressed and remedied.  It rolls them 
together with some of the very elements of the MAI, that 
undemocratic multilateral agreement on investment that caused 
people to mobilize around the globe.  It wraps them in a bow and 
says that this trade deal will literally reinforce the right of 
corporations to sue democratically elected governments that dare 
or have the audacity to stand in the way of their maximizing 
profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it has taken on the aura of a struggle for democracy 
itself.  It is not just because of what is in the proposed NAFTA. 
It is also because of how the government refuses to react, to 
respond, to engage with civil society in any meaningful way, and 
to allow for citizens to have some real input into the FTAA 
agreement which is so extensive in its scope and in its detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the minister ask what we are talking about.  He 
said that the government is letting citizens have a say, but we 
should look at what is shaping up with respect to the Quebec 
summit scheduled for mid-April.  People are genuinely dismayed at 
the extent to which the government is preoccupied with the 
protection of visiting politicians, decision makers and 
bureaucrats who will be coming together in Quebec.  They are 
being protected from having to even know about, let alone take 
into account, the genuine concerns of citizens who will be there 
to protest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fundamental democratic right of citizens to have the 
opportunity to engage in meaningful peaceful protest.  It is a 
right that has been practised with important effect in the world. 
Democracy itself depends upon it.  It has been through meaningful 
peaceful protest that some of the most important progressive 
gains around the world have been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons the New Democratic Party caucus has made a 
decision to be in Quebec during the FTAA summit is that we intend 
to stand shoulder to shoulder with citizens who are coming 
together by the tens of thousands to say that we do not want to 
have our world transformed in the image of corporate demand and 
dictates.  We want to ensure that we have a say in what is 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people are very concerned, as we are, at the 
extraordinary attempts that have gone into trying to discredit 
and dismiss the concerns of protesters.  That is why my 
colleagues and I have been participating in community meetings 
across the country. There is an unprecedented mobilization of 
citizens who are saying they want to inform themselves.  The 
government is not interested in informing them so they are 
informing themselves.  They are coming together in teach-ins, 
forums, debates and discussions to talk about what a citizen 
based, citizen centred free trade deal would look like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would a fair trade deal be?  How could we ensure that we do 
not embrace a corporate model of trade that drives a race to the 
bottom, a model that says we would do nothing to protect labour 
standards that have been hard fought and won, nothing to protect 
environmental standards and nothing to protect cultural 
diversity?  How could we ensure that human rights are absolutely 
at the centre of trade deals and do not get sacrificed?

a people's summit.  A people's summit is a coming together of 
people who say that they understand the importance of trade but 
insist that trade deals should address the real needs of people 
and are not just crafted to respond to the dictates of 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be at that people's summit.  We will have the

say.  I hope government members will take the opportunity to be 
there to listen to those people.

exclusively young people.  I was in Halifax last week and in 
Fredericton last night, where literally over 150 people came 
together to say that they want to talk about what kind of trade 
deals they want the government to negotiate on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We insist on registering our protest over the extent to which 
the government seems intent on walling off democracy by putting 
up a three metre fence and cordoning off where the discussions 
will be taking place so that the leaders who are coming together 
do not even have to be aware of the kind of protest that will be 
expressed in Quebec.  People are concerned about what it means 
when there is a kind of criminalization of dissent taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so ironic to have heard the trade minister and the foreign 
affairs minister say that the FTAA was about enhancing democracy. 
This is being said while the government virtually ignores the 
democratic demands of citizens to have their concerns addressed 
in Canada, in many other parts of the world and throughout the 
Americas with respect to this hemispheric agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud of the fact that I represent a political party which 
when it met in early February talked about the issue of the FTAA 
being one of the top priorities for the parliamentary agenda.  I 
wish to make reference to the resolution that was adopted by the 
New Democratic Party federal council.  I will not read it in its 
entirety, but the resolution reiterated its support for an 
alternative approach to globalization to achieve a stable rules 
based global economy which promotes and protects the rights of 
workers and the environment, provides for cultural diversity and 
ensures the ability of government to act in the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of all the concerns that are widely shared by citizens who have 
informed themselves, and they are doing so in increasing numbers, 
the concern that is most profound is that it appears the 
government is intent on entering into another trade agreement 
which basically erodes the capability and the powers of 
government itself to serve the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government seems absolutely intent on the notion that we 
should commercialize, commodify or treat as a commodity to be 
traded, bought and sold everything that is important to people in 
their daily lives.  This is a concern with respect to the FTAA 
despite the government's insistence that our concerns are not 
well founded.  It is also a major concern with the GATS round of 
negotiations that are under discussion.  It is the notion that 
things as fundamental and valued by citizens as our health care, 
education, environmental apparatus, and other things as basic as 
our water and sewer services should be treated as commodities, 
not understood to be part of the public good, to be traded, 
bought and sold.

chapter 11 of NAFTA is a very major concern.  It has placed 
Canada in the position that when it acts in the public interest, 
when it insists upon protecting our environment or health care, 
it could be sued by corporations which demand compensation 
because it interfered with their profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that we have had the opportunity this evening for 
all members to participate in this important debate.  I look 
forward to the government beginning to address some of these 
questions now that it has engaged in the usual rhetoric about how 
all of society's ills will be solved by the trade deal that it is 
intent on signing on to in the form of the FTAA.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
referred to rhetoric from the government side.  That is 
interesting, given her speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear her thoughts on the fact that a former 
colleague of hers, Nelson Riis, is saying that the NDP has no 
place being in the streets in Quebec City as an elected party, 
that it has a duty to participate in the democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like her views on the speech that Mr. Tony Blair 
made in the House when he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time I think that we started to argue vigorously and 
clearly as to why free trade is right. It is the key to jobs for 
our people, to prosperity and actually to development in the 
poorest parts of the world. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the UN, Kofi Annan, made similar comments recently 
where he put a figure of $100 billion that could go to the poorer 
nations of the world through a liberalized globalized trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member drop her comments about government 
rhetoric and address the comments of her former colleague, Mr. 
Riis; the labour prime minister of the U.K., Mr. Blair; and the 
secretary general of the United Nations, Mr. Annan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know the 
details of the comments made by my former colleague from 
Kamloops.  It is not just the right of elected officials, 
parliamentarians, to participate in extra-parliamentary activity 
in solidarity with ordinary citizens.  It is an absolute 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, most of the major struggles that have taken place 
in our lifetime which resulted in important human progress came 
about in exactly that way: through an active, creative 
partnership between progressive parliamentarians or legislators 
together with citizens engaging in direct political action.  That 
is how we brought an end to the apartheid system.  Universal 
suffrage is another example.  I could go on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was profoundly disappointed with respect to the comments made 
a few weeks ago by Prime Minister Tony Blair.  I guess out of 
ignorance or out of an agenda that had to do with the fact that 
he was making this a stop on the way to meet George Bush, he 
absolutely and erroneously talked of the FTAA as if it were the 
same as the European model for free trade.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to say to Mr. Blair very directly that I 
was very disappointed about that, and that it was very important 
that he keep in mind there was no way in the world that he 
or any other European leader would get away with signing on to an 
agreement like the FTAA.  The European model is based on a 
fundamentally different concept.  It is based on raising 
standards, not lowering them.  It is based on improving, not 
eroding, working conditions, environmental protections or human 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The European model may not be an approach that is perfect, but 
if the government wants to bring forward a fair trade agreement 
based on the principles of the European Union, it will have our 
support for doing so.  However until it does that, we will stand 
up and put forward an alternate model and try to persuade the 
government that a citizens based model and one not based on the 
corporate demands for how trade should take place, is the model 
we will be advancing and the one which increasing numbers of 
Canadians are willing to stand up and be counted on to fight 
for.

Speaker, I listened with great interest as the hon. member 
mentioned that her party supports engaging society and that 
citizens should have real input into this issue, but that it 
reserved the right to protest in a meaningful and peaceful 
manner.  This is in direct contrast to her colleague, the hon. 
member for Burnaby—Douglas, who in the foreign affairs committee 
the other day was advocating and outlining a plan to participate 
in civil disobedience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The witness at the time was Warren Allmand.  The hon. member was 
even trying to get the former member of parliament to support him 
in advocating civil disobedience during the summit of the 
Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member if she could clarify this 
contradiction.  Does her party advocate civil disobedience in any 
way, shape or form? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will reiterate what I 
already said.  I said that it was absolutely fundamental for 
citizens to have the right in a free and democratic society to 
engage in peaceful, meaningful, legitimate protest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said before and I will say again that it is my view that 
the overwhelming majority of citizens who will be going to 
demonstrate in Quebec, including the NDP caucus, will be there to 
engage in peaceful, meaningful protest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to be in Windsor and that was the case in 
Windsor.  My colleague for Winnipeg—Transcona was in Seattle. In 
a phone conversation I had with him he told me about the tragedy 
in Seattle of 30,000 to 40,000 citizens who came together in an 
earnest search for an alternative, progressive, global vision, a 
progressive model for international fair trade deals, and that 
the world was not even hearing about it because a tiny group of 
people had a different agenda and were prepared to use violent 
tactics to put forward their point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make it clear that the New Democratic Party caucus in its 
entirety will be in Quebec to participate in peaceful protest. 
Let me also say that peaceful, non-violent civil disobedience has 
also been a time honoured tactic that has often been an element 
of winning important struggles for justice and democracy in the 
world. 
The NDP caucus is not going to Quebec to engage in civil 
disobedience or to break the law, but let us not try to mobilize 
public opinion against the thousands and thousands of—

question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to address a couple of the substantive 
issues that the leader of the New Democratic Party raised in the 
debate tonight, which seems to have been lost in the paranoia of 
the parliamentary secretary and even the Conservatives, about the 
New Democratic Party engaging in peaceful protest in Quebec City 
around the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me focus in on a couple of issues that are critical to the 
debate at hand in one minute or less.  They have to do with the 
very future of our public health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the parliamentary secretary is fully aware of the number 
of learned articles and academic publications that have pointed 
directly to the problems that we face in terms of preserving 
medicare if we proceed down this path of NAFTA, followed by FTAA, 
followed by GATS, followed by even further liberalization on the 
trade front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we asked the question in the House before, the minister 
responsible for international trade said that we should not 
worry.  He said that everything was protected and that everything 
was okay, but he had no specifics.  All the academics and all 
the people who are well versed in this issue suggest otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is my caucus leader's understanding of the minister's words 
in giving those assurances?  Furthermore, would she have any idea 
what the minister means when he said that Canada will protect the 
margin of manoeuvre of our government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly share the 
concerns expressed by my colleague.  I think there is a concern. 
I do not know whether they are weasel words or a way of evading 
the topic altogether when the minister says that we are not 
putting public health or education on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that they are all on the table.  The fact is that 
all these matters are on the table for commercial trade purposes. 
We need to hear from the minister and from the government that 
they are not prepared under any circumstances to sign on to a 
trade deal, for example, that has, in any way, shape or form, a 
clause or a chapter comparable to chapter 11 in the NAFTA 
agreement.  That would deal a death blow to our system of 
public health and public education.  We need to hear from the 
minister and the government tonight that under no circumstances 
will they enter into any such trade deal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my colleagues will be joining in the debate discussing the wide 
range of important and complex issues that are involved in both 
the trade question and the summit of the Americas generally, 
ranging from means by which we ensure we are able to preserve 
unique Canadian systems, such as our supply management system, 
through to the importance of generating the growth which is the 
basis of any society's ability to afford social and economic 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the unique qualities of Canada is how much we are 
connected to all the world.  One of the challenges of policy is 
to build on those connections.  For too long as a country we did 
not engage enough in our hemisphere.  That was due in part to 
earlier Liberal governments wanting to avoid conflict with the 
United States over issues in the Americas.  That was why we 
waited so very long before we joined the Organization of American 
States.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to have been part of a government that put that fear 
aside and brought Canada fully into the family of the Americas. 
As foreign minister, I was privileged to be the first Canadian 
minister to occupy the seat of Canada at the Organization of 
American States and to participate in the meeting of heads of 
government in Costa Rica at which the idea of a summit of the 
Americas first appeared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a multitude of interests in common.  Many of them we 
have pursued through the Commonwealth and la Francophonie in the 
Caribbean, but there is much more to do in the Americas on issues 
ranging from fighting poverty, to encouraging trade, to ensuring 
fair labour practices, to dealing with the threat of drugs, to 
encouraging gender equality, to other human rights issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However most public attention in these next days will be on 
trade issues, so let me begin my intervention in this debate by 
expressing my very strong support and that of my party for more 
open, freer rules based trade in the hemisphere and in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be the leader today of the political party that 
had the vision and the courage to break Canada out of a 
protectionist mould and to prepare us to face and to lead the 
inevitable transformations that occur to any society in a 
globalizing economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends in the New Democratic Party have a different view of 
that decision than I do.  To their credit, their view today is 
the same as their view was when we initiated the free trade 
agreement.  That same honour and consistency cannot be claimed by 
the Liberal Party, which did everything it could to stop the 
changes it celebrates today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister for International Trade noted last year, and I 
quote, “Most of the two million new jobs created since 1993 are 
related to our growth in trade”, yet the Liberal Party fought 
that agreement, fought that growth and fought those jobs with 
every resource it could muster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word hypocritical is unparliamentary so I will not use it 
even though it applies precisely to the Liberal Party's position 
on trade. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards this debate, I still remember how, barely 15 years 
ago, the top guns of the Liberal Party argued that regional 
trade agreements would jeopardize the signing of broader 
international trade agreements. That argument was not valid back 
then and is still not valid today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By continuing to push for the regulation of liberalized trade in 
our hemisphere, we will get closer to our objective at the world 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be mentioned that, for years, Liberal governments 
did not want Canada to fully participate in our hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The symbol of these years of Liberal government remains Canada's 
unoccupied seat at the Organization of American States. The OAS 
always reserved that seat for us, in the hope of benefiting from 
our balanced position and our leadership. That opportunity and 
that responsibility were ignored until a Progressive 
Conservative government decided that Canada should take on its 
responsibilities as member of the Organization of American 
States. It was then that our country strengthened its reputation 
as a leader in the world community and in the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an altogether different issue, but I believe that the 
progress we have made toward regulating liberalized trade must 
absolutely be part of any serious commitment to reducing 
poverty, misery and despair in the world. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most damning charges against the government, a 
government formed by the party of Lester Pearson, is how cruelly 
it has cut Canada's contribution to official development 
assistance and let languish Canada's reputation as a leader in 
international development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to lead a party today which was committed to both 
international development and a freer trade.  I hope the present 
government will follow both those examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have learned lessons at home that we can apply 
internationally in these discussions and in others, lessons about 
the difficulties that can be created for certain members of any 
society by freer trade arrangements and certainly the 
difficulties that can be caused to sectors of our society by the 
forces of globalization.

<A HREF="#LINKT129"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is foolish for a parliament or a government to ignore those 
problems.  It is foolish to pretend we can turn our backs on the 
world.  We must recognize that when we deal with globalizing 
forces and trends problems are created for groups of citizens 
within Canada and throughout the Americas that must be addressed. 
They must be addressed by social, educational and other policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context I will speak tonight about rules in 
international trade.  We should seek reforms that not only bring 
down barriers but build up standards, practices and rules that 
are strong enough and respected enough to acquire authority. 
Obviously the question of who sets those rules is critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the broad popular concern about globalization is the 
sense that powerful countries or corporations either write the 
rules in their own interests or have the power or skill to ignore 
or circumvent rules that apply to others.  Those fears are real. 
Some are based on the hard experience of abuse of power while 
others are rooted in a simple fear of size and sense of 
powerlessness.  Both can be addressed by an effective system of 
rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, I would argue, is the only way they can be addressed 
because superpowers will not suddenly, magically become more 
sensitive to their neighbours or their competitors.  The 
efficiencies of size and scale will not disappear in this 
respect.  The world community is like any local community.  We 
need rules that are fair, effective and accepted.  That reality 
has a double meaning for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, we are not a superpower.  We cannot cast a 
threatening shadow like the United States or China.  We are 
innovative, educated, enterprising and lucky.  However we need 
rules as much as any other nation that is not a superpower. More 
than that, the distinguishing advantage of Canada is that we are 
a nation that other nations trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me back to the question of who will write the rules. 
If any nation in the world has an unusual authority to set rules 
and standards which others will reflect and accept, that nation 
is Canada.  That is no small distinction.  It is an asset which, 
among other things, should make Canadians much more confident 
about our ability to shape the forces of a global society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others in the House will raise or have raised legitimate 
concerns about the lengths to which the Liberal government has 
carried the commercialization of public business.  The issue is 
about much more than sponsorship and the names of companies on 
napkins, delegate bags, tea cozies or whatever is for sale. It 
raises a more serious issue.  It is about access to public 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ordinary Canadians, including members of parliament, are shut 
out but the rich can buy their way in.  Under the Liberal 
government access is for sale, whether one owns the Auberge 
Grand-Mère or wants to make a direct commercial pitch to a 
visiting head of state.  That is a new kind of corruption of the 
public policy process and it is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The controversies over sponsorship also highlight a fundamental 
attitude of the present government which in my judgment puts 
Canada's international interests at risk.  I am speaking of the 
government's pugilistic attitude toward the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That attitude was made clear again in the deliberate double 
standard applied to the premier of the host province of Quebec. 
Any business willing to spend half a million dollars is offered 
an opportunity to speak to the heads of government gathering in 
Quebec.  However the premier of that province, who represents not 
half a million dollars but seven million people, is not allowed a 
speaking opportunity in his own capital.  That only makes Canada 
look foolish in a world that knows we are a federation and that 
respects us because we respect diversity and freedom of speech. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another consequence that is just as serious is that, in 
practical terms, this fuels the accusatory atmosphere here in 
Canada and it could undermine our ability to act in the world 
that surrounds us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International trade is of course a federal jurisdiction, but 
while the federal government can sign treaties, their 
implementation requires the co-operation of the provinces. This 
is a lesson that we learned with the free trade agreement 
initially signed with the United States.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall very well the arguments advanced by the hard line 
constitutionalists of Ottawa that the provinces did not have 
the right to negotiate in matters of international trade and 
thus should not be at the negotiation table.  We rejected these 
arguments, because we rejected the vision of Canada based on 
confrontation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We knew moreover that if the provinces were excluded from the 
negotiations, they would invoke their own constitutional powers 
in order to prevent the agreement from taking effect.  Our 
negotiations succeeded because we treated the provinces as 
partners. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not this government: the government does not believe in much, 
but among its articles of faith is that on any given issue the 
provinces are wrong and should be resisted.  That is not an 
antagonism it reserves for Quebec.  Ask Premier Klein.  Ask 
Premier Harris.  Ask any Atlantic premier interested in changing 
the equalization system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of this summit the Canadian government could have 
found a way to give the premier of the host province a place and 
a voice in the program.  On the contrary, the government went out 
of its way to be offensive to the elected government of the host 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the predictable response?  The government of Quebec is 
contemplating legislation which will make it even more difficult 
for Canada to honour and give effect to the FTAA agreements we 
might sign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fundamental conflict in the government's own 
purposes.  While it is looking for agreement in the Americas it 
is looking for a fight at home.  It will get that fight.  That 
will put at risk Canada's ability to advance our interests and 
exercise leadership in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A major factor on the trade side is that the United States of 
America is not coming to Quebec summit with fast track authority. 
That means that any agreement it might sign is subject to the 
nitpicking, changes and evocation of special interests that occur 
in its congress.  As a practical matter, because the U.S. is not 
there with fast track authority, no other country will make 
significant concessions that the United States congress may pick 
apart and undercut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is particularly so for countries where there is so much 
distrust of the U.S.A.  Issues that are boutiquish or simply of 
special interest to the congress are life and death to the other 
countries involved.  That would be a problem in any event. It is 
aggravated by the position of Brazil, a natural leader and 
superpower of the south which harbours deep suspicions of the 
United States and, these days, deep suspicions of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than build on the North American model of NAFTA, Brazil 
would prefer to build on Mercosur which among other things is a 
much less open model.  Those are realities which will not 
dissolve in a weekend in Quebec.  Canada, as host and given our 
traditional reputation as a trusted conciliator and innovator, 
can use the conference to build agreement that might find 
acceptance.  We should have in mind a NAFTA model, but we should 
certainly not seek to impose a replica of NAFTA.  If any 
hemisphere wide agreement is to be struck, it will need to 
reflect the concerns of the giants in Mercosur and the quite 
different interests of the multitude of smaller states in the 
hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we seek that consensus we should also continue our 
attempts to negotiate bilateral arrangements such as with Chile 
and Costa Rica.  It is my strong view that those bilateral 
arrangements help the process of breaking down barriers.  They 
can create a confidence in moving beyond the status quo, a status 
quo which in many countries in the hemisphere is a guarantor of 
poverty, abuse and reliance on harmful practices including the 
drug trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned official development assistance earlier.  There is a 
reality to face.  Trade can be at least as powerful an instrument 
of progress as international development policies have been. 
Canada's role at Quebec and beyond should be to find ways in 
which the wide range of countries in the Americas can feel their 
fundamental interests are advanced by trade agreements and not 
threatened by them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that process Canada and other North American countries must 
resist the temptation to impose our models on other countries. 
That is true with respect to instruments in NAFTA which allow 
companies to take states to court.  It is also true in terms of 
environmental and other issues where common progress must be made 
in a common interest.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of human rights is in a special category, 
particularly for Canada.  We have a reputation for respecting 
human rights, a reputation which must constantly be renewed.  We 
have proven that Canada can encourage trade and respect for human 
rights at the same time.  We are one of the few countries in the 
world which can do that, certainly the only country north of the 
Rio Grande. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On questions of human rights, we must always ask: If Canada will 
not step forward to defend those rights, who in the world will? 
There are other nations in the hemisphere who share our concerns. 
We have learned that even in the defence of human rights account 
must be taken of particular circumstances. Quite simply, we have 
an obligation here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This summit represents a great opportunity for Canada to 
continue the leadership in the hemisphere that was pioneered by 
the first free trade agreement and the decision to take an active 
place in the Organization of American States.  It will not 
resolve the problems or meet all the challenges of the hemisphere 
in one stroke, but it is an important step forward.  We in this 
party look forward to supporting the initiatives Canada might 
take at the summit and to hearing responses from the government 
when the summit is over.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Sudbury, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, is the 
member for Calgary Centre trying to tell the people of Canada 
that the premier of Quebec will not have the same access to the 
leaders of the countries that the business people will?  That is 
utter and absolute nonsense.   The leader of Quebec will be able 
to meet them at cocktail parties and dinners, as will the 
business people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member for Calgary Centre playing the same game Brian 
Mulroney played, playing to the nationalists of Quebec to get 
their vote?  Is that what the hon. member is doing?  We all know 
what that brought us.  That brought us the Bloc Quebecois.  It 
brought us many problems.  I wonder where his head is at that he 
would think such things.  When he was the minister responsible 
for trade he followed the same protocol we are following now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the activities of the 
Progressive Conservative government, of which I was a part, 
brought us the free trade agreement which was primarily a 
coalition between western Canadians and Quebecers.  The agreement 
would not have occurred had we not been able to appeal to the 
nationalist pride of Quebec and turn it into a pride in Canada, 
instead of responding so negatively and in such a critical 
fashion to every expression of pride by the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me come to the direct question asked by my hon. friend.  She 
asks if the premier of Quebec will not have the same 
opportunities.  He will not, according to the advertising of the 
member's own government.  The member's own government offered to 
business leaders who could pony up $500,000 not just an 
opportunity to ride in an elevator with a head of state, but a 
speaking opportunity.  The premier of Quebec, the host province, 
does not have that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issue here is whether it is possible in a system like 
ours to take account of the real interests of provincial 
governments.  We proved in the free trade agreement that it is 
not only possible but essential.  We do not make progress without 
it.  Would it have been possible for the Government of Canada to 
find a place and a voice for the premier of the host province of 
Quebec if it had wanted to?  Of course it would have been 
possible, if it had wanted to.  The point is it did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government seeks agreement in the hemisphere but seeks a 
fight at home.  So long as it seeks that fight at home it puts at 
risk Canada's opportunity to give effect to whatever agreements 
it might sign exercising the undisputed federal responsibility 
for international trade.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to make one very short comment.  We must give 
credit where it is deserved.  If it had not been for the right 
hon. member's party when he was in government, we would not have 
free trade today.  I applaud him for that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Very clearly the Liberal Party campaigned vigorously against 
free trade and it is through the leadership of the Progressive 
Conservatives of the day that we have free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member's comments specifically with respect to 
the people's summit.  The minister just mentioned a good 
opportunity but we will not go there right now.  We will save 
that discussion for another day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member's comments specifically with respect to 
the people's summit and the $300,000 funding for it from the 
federal government.  Of course I believe everybody should have a 
right to be heard as long as it is in a legal way, but I have a 
problem with groups that are advocating civil disobedience and 
being funded by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think that kind of 
support by the Government of Canada, whether the sum is right, is 
appropriate.  There is no question that in many issues of public 
debate access to groups and to interests that have legitimate 
things to say is limited, and there have to be ways to overcome 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly if we can charge corporations $500,000 for a speaking 
opportunity at a conference, it is not out of line for the 
Government of Canada to provide a lesser amount for groups who 
have things to say and would not otherwise be heard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to ask the Conservative leader about the pride and satisfaction 
he has expressed in regard to the free trade agreement his 
government negotiated.  I wonder if he would he be able to 
suggest whether there are any aspects of the free trade 
agreement, for which his government was responsible, and of its 
successor, NAFTA, that he would see as inadequate or in need of 
improvement in order to ensure that Canadian citizens' concerns 
are protected and, for that matter, to ensure that citizens in 
other countries of nations with whom we are entering into 
agreements have their interests and rights protected and 
enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would there be changes in the FTAA based on the experience we 
have had under the two previous extensive trade agreements? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that 
there would be changes in the way we should approach some of 
these issues and there are lessons we can learn.  I agree with 
the leader of the New Democratic Party with respect to her 
concern about the application in any larger hemispheric agreement 
of the chapter 11 provisions in the NAFTA.  Not only would it be 
counterproductive, but we would resist it.  It would be a 
non-starter.  It would not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I have a great regret about the free trade agreement into 
which we entered, it was that we did not do enough in a companion 
way with that agreement to deal with groups in Canada who were 
disadvantaged.  There is no question that whenever one takes 
major initiatives, initiatives that literally change history, 
there will be people who are helped and there will be people who 
are hurt.  There were people who were hurt by the free trade 
agreement.  We had undertaken as a government that we would be 
more active in social policies and policies related to education 
than we were.  In hindsight, that was a mistake and we have to 
take account of that in future agreements into which Canada might 
enter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very difficult question that deserves serious debate 
in the House and it is about the degree to which we try to impose 
internationally standards to which we adhere at home.  My own 
view would be that on human rights issues we have to impose 
internationally the high standard we try to respect at home, 
partly because if we do not, no one else in the world will and 
those issues will fall off the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, on some other questions, including some environmental 
issues and others, we have to recognize that countries in states 
of development different from ours have a set of circumstances 
different from ours and they must be taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the question is whether there are there aspects of those 
negotiations that we might have changed with the benefit of 
hindsight, of course there are.  If the question is whether it 
was right to take those initiatives, the answer is of course it 
was right to take those initiatives.  We have to get ahead of the 
future, not be at its mercy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to the leader of the Conservative Party. 
I must say I think a number of us in the House might want to 
reread the economic policies of the party that the hon. member 
leads and of the party I am a member of.  I recall prime 
ministers by the name of Macdonald and Diefenbaker who were 
hardly great free traders.  Even my colleague opposite in the 
Alliance might benefit by a little rereading of Canadian history 
with respect to the positions of the two parties.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party 
is this.  When his government was in power and la Francophonie 
summit was held in Quebec City and then the G-7 meeting in 
Toronto, were the premiers of those two provinces invited to have 
the full blown participation he is advocating now for the 
separatist premier of Quebec, Mr. Landry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I assumed the hon. 
member had read our economic policies since he and his government 
adopted so many of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His second question is almost too easy, but I will accept the 
invitation.  On the question of the economic summit in Toronto, 
my recollection, and I stand to be corrected but I think it is 
correct, is that there was no interest expressed by the premier 
of Ontario, the host province, in being present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I can fairly say on behalf of my colleagues in the then 
government that had there been an interest we would have found 
some way to reflect the presence of the host province.  We are a 
federation.  The world knows we are a federation.  Let us not try 
to pretend that we are not.  Let us reflect the reality of Canada 
abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me come to la Francophonie.  Let me say in passing that 
there would never have been an association of la Francophonie had 
Canada continued to follow the rigid anti-provincial policies 
followed by the Trudeau government.  It was only because a 
Progressive Conservative government was able to find a way to 
accommodate the legitimate interests of Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also found a way to accommodate the legitimate interests of 
New Brunswick and the other provinces with a francophone 
population so we were even more successful with the issue of the 
francophone community. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was welcomed by the world because other francophone countries 
were very apprehensive that with the absence of Canada too much 
would be run by France.  Under the rigid rules of the Liberal 
government preceding ours, that was impossible.  Under our more 
open attitude toward Canada and its reality, we achieved la 
Francophonie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the premier of Quebec take part?  He chaired some of the 
sessions.  Did the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs take 
part?  He chaired some of the sessions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now it is not fair to compare la Francophonie with the summit of 
the Americas.  It is a question from the hon. member and I am 
responding to that.  However, it certainly would have been 
possible in this context, had the government had the will, to 
have found a place and a voice for the premier of Quebec.  The 
government did not because it did not want to.  The repercussions 
are clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already in the national assembly of Quebec, legislation is being 
prepared to get in the way of giving effect to agreements that 
Canada might sign exercising our undisputed competence in 
international trade.  It is cutting off our nose to spite our 
face.  It is dangerous and divisive in Canada.  It should stop.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate this evening. 
I am splitting my time with the member for Vancouver Quadra. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by saying that in my riding of Etobicoke—Lakeshore 
there are many who have expressed concerns about this agreement 
and this summit and I hope these concerns will be addressed in 
the discussion tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the Prime Minister and other heads of state will be 
discussing the FTAA at this very important summit.  The FTAA is 
indeed a good news story.  I think this is a good news story that 
we hear tonight from the members on this side of the House and 
others:  the expanding of trade and investment and those 
advantages which will allow Canadian companies to grow, to 
innovate and to create better jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, much has also been said about the FTAA and the 
knowledge that the Canadian public has about the agreement and 
its potential impact on communities, and especially for some of 
my constituents, and smaller states.  The discussion this evening 
is one which I hope all those who have expressed their concerns 
to me are watching and participating in with us.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of the free trade area of the Americas was brought to 
the fore at the first modern-day summit of the Americas, held in 
Miami in 1994.  At that summit, all countries, including Canada, 
agreed to conclude an agreement by 2005.  At the Quebec summit, 
Canada will engage in negotiations with over 30 heads of state 
and government to bring this to fruition.  The free trade 
agreement of the Americas will build upon and strengthen existing 
bilateral and subregional free trade agreements with countries in 
the hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, democracy and the expansion of free markets around 
the world are transforming the Americas.  Canada has been playing 
a leading role in responding to the challenges of economic and 
social change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At home, the government is committed to creating opportunities 
for Canadians in global markets and will work to foster 
favourable environments in which Canadians can take advantage of 
opportunities.  Canada has a vested interest in the economic 
development of the hemisphere and will demonstrate leadership 
where it can to strengthen and integrate relations in the 
Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from our Minister for International Trade that the 
small economies will be given assistance to participate not only 
in the summit but in regard to further participation in the 
discussions, which will go on until 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's economy depends on trade, which constitutes 40% of our 
gross domestic product and creates or sustains one Canadian job 
in three.  The people of Etobicoke—Lakeshore should know that on 
a daily basis more than $2.5 billion worth of business occurs in 
two way trade with the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today over 90% of Canada's trade is with the Americas, including 
the United States.  Canada's foreign direct investment in the 
Americas reached $182 billion in 1999.  Over the last 10 years, 
the value of trade has increased more than 170%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are advantages for us, but again we pose the question, 
what about the small economies?  The summit of the Americas is 
about more than just free trade.  It will be a forum where heads 
of states and ministers will engage in discussions around three 
broad themes:  strengthening democracy, creating prosperity, and 
realizing human potential.  Those three broad theme areas are 
where the small economies can see themselves moving forward and 
benefiting from whatever agreements are made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's position on strengthening democracy in the hemisphere 
is based on the premise of consolidating democracy, protecting 
and promoting human rights and enhancing human security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any trade liberalization agreement, democratic development 
has a place.  It allows economies to become more open and 
countries to prosper, and it compels nations to create rules and 
institutions needed for global governance.  The small economies 
need help in that specific area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Creating prosperity for Canadians and the citizens of the 
hemisphere entails addressing issues such as poverty and 
promoting equality of opportunity.  This principle is emphasized 
in the summit plan of action on key social initiatives that would 
support education and the acquisition of needed skills, improve 
the health of people, advance gender equality, promote cultural 
diversity and expand access to new technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am putting emphasis on those areas because I think of the 
islands of the Caribbean and the other states to which some 
improvements and some advantages could be given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These initiatives will help the citizens of the Americas to live 
with dignity, realize their full potential and contribute to the 
economic and social development of their communities. 
These three themes are juxtaposed against several issues of 
concerns as raised by civil society and the small nations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade deliberations, my colleagues and I had the opportunity to 
hear the sentiments of Canadians on the implications of the FTAA 
on such matters as environment, labour standards and income 
disparity.  Many witnesses appeared before us and spoke to those 
issues.  From these hearings was a growing consensus that the 
FTAA could not ignore environmental and labour standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are concerned about economic disparities and the 
competition will make worse already poor environmental and labour 
standards among smaller countries in the hemisphere.  The 
majority of these countries are at a disadvantage since they do 
not have the capacity to develop sustainable development 
strategies on the environment or improve upon standards of 
labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can think of instances in Mexico where the results of NAFTA 
have come under intense scrutiny for problems relating to the 
environment and declining labour standards.  I know we have 
benefited from those experiences and it is the hope that whatever 
negative was done will not be repeated here.  Careful 
consideration must be given to these issues so that we will not 
repeat some of the challenges that NAFTA created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada and other countries in the hemisphere must work to ensure 
that these issues are reconciled and that they are incorporated 
into the FTAA.  I am encouraged to hear that the summit will 
provide an opportunity for environment and labour ministers to 
address these very important issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to turn to the issue of income disparity.  There is 
no doubt that the FTAA will have to raise the standard of living 
in the hemisphere.  However, large income disparities between 
countries will make it difficult for small ones to implement the 
FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be conscious about how the benefits will be distributed. 
There are over 800 million people in the hemisphere, the majority 
in smaller states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of tariffs is of importance when we talk about income 
disparities.  Economies of smaller states rely on tariffs as 
their main source of revenue.  Social programs and debts are paid 
from tariffs.  The elimination of tariffs as proposed by the FTAA 
could force small nations to introduce income tax systems in 
order for them to participate in the agreement.  Many simply do 
not have the technical expertise to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small countries must have some kind of assurance that they too 
will benefit from the elimination of trade barriers and should be 
provided with the necessary assistance to help them to deal with 
the challenges of tariff elimination.  I know that technology and 
connectivity are very important to those states and the Canadian 
minister has assured us that some assistance will be given to 
those small states. 
<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Sudbury, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
address a critically important theme of the upcoming summit of 
the Americas, namely democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy has been at the very core of the summit of the 
Americas process since the beginning.  Indeed it was the 
transformation of our hemisphere in the 1980s and early 1990s 
toward democracy that in the most substantial sense made the 
summit of the Americas possible.  The commitment of countries of 
the hemisphere to democracy was a major reason why Canada joined 
the Organization of American States in 1990.  It is the reason 
why, as a result of a Canadian initiative, the unit for the 
promotion of democracy was established in the OAS to help 
countries strengthen their democratic institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This transformation to democratic governments resulted in a 
generation of political leaders in the Americas ready to embrace 
a collective commitment to strengthening shared values and the 
pursuit of common goals. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the 2001 summit provides the hemisphere with an 
opportunity to vigorously affirm its commitment to democracy and 
to move forward a coherent and balanced political, economic and 
social action plan.

<A HREF="#LINKT136"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been a key consideration for Canada and its hemispheric 
partners since the preparations for the summit were launched 
last June in Windsor, in the form of a dialogue by foreign 
ministers at the OAS general assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foreign ministers agreed on a approach whose point of 
departure was an emphasis on populations and the need to obtain 
real benefits for the citizens of the Americas, through 
collective action structured around three major themes: 
strengthening democracy, creating prosperity and realizing human 
potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach was also important because it was a clear and 
convincing demonstration of the fact that OAS member states are 
united in their commitment to the values and institutions 
underlying democracy and human rights. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summit of the Americas in Quebec City will be the third 
gathering of leaders since 1994.  Since we all know that 
commitment is one thing but taking action is quite another, what 
has the summit's process achieved?  What tangible results can we 
hold up to Canadians as examples of how conciliation and 
consensus building have been placed ahead of confrontation and 
condemnation?  We need look no further than the OAS general 
assembly last year in Windsor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision to send a high level mission to Peru, led by the 
OAS secretary general and Canada's foreign minister, reflected a 
broad, open and transparent effort by the OAS to establish a 
clear responsibility for supporting the evolution and development 
of democracy in Peru.  With that one act, the OAS took ownership 
of democracy in the hemisphere.  Strengthening democracy is about 
more than free and fair elections.  It is about addressing 
threats to our societies which can undermine the institutions 
that are fundamental to guaranteeing that democratic values 
remain strong. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governments of the hemisphere have taken the lead in the 
area of drugs and crime. Through the summit process, countries 
have developed new programs to fight drug trafficking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has culminated in the creation of a multilateral evaluation 
mechanism, or MEM, the first multilateral drug initiative in the 
world, which was ordered by the leaders gathered at the last 
summit in Santiago, Chile. Reports from individual countries and 
an overall report for the hemisphere detailing achievements and 
making recommendations for the future are to be presented in 
Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of the Justice Studies Centre, which was also 
requested in Santiago, is another example. The goal of the 
centre is to help modernize the justice systems and institutions 
through training programs and the sharing of information. The 
board of directors of the Centre has approved a vast working 
program for its first year of operation with as a top priority 
the reform of criminal justice. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example took place a few short weeks ago.  At the Miami 
summit in 1994 leaders underscored that changes among legislators 
were essential to strengthen democratic traditions in our 
hemisphere and were fundamental as countries in this hemisphere 
interacted to an increasing degree in more and more sectors.  As 
a result of the inspiration, leadership and hard work of members 
of this parliament, the interparliamentary forum of the 
Americas, FIPA, was created in Ottawa earlier this month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The inaugural meeting, under Canada's chairmanship, focused on 
finding solutions to the challenges of drugs and crime, 
corruption, economic integration, protection of the environment, 
poverty alleviation and debt relief.  The forum will meet once a 
year in different countries throughout the hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one final example, I point to the inclusion of Canadians and 
citizens throughout the hemisphere in the summit process. 
Ministers and officials have engaged in regular consultations 
with members of civil society in Canada and the hemisphere to 
ensure an open dialogue on the objectives of the summit and to 
factor their views into the planning process.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of these achievements has at its core a clear demonstration 
of the commitment by leaders to the promotion of democracy, 
protection of human rights and respect for the rule of law, which 
brings us to this year's summit of the Americas.  What, in real 
terms, will leaders be discussing that will strengthen and 
consolidate democratic reform in the hemisphere? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summit will be an opportunity for leaders to discuss ways of 
making democracy work better.  The democratically elected leaders 
of the hemisphere will examine, for example, how to improve the 
way elections are held through improved citizen participation, 
media access, rules for political party registration and finance. 
They will look at promoting human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, for example, and examine ways that new information and 
communication technologies could be harnessed to improve and 
strengthen human rights institutions throughout the Americas. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the summit of the Americas is the forum and the 
fundamental vehicle to make good on our vision of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The development of a strong democracy must be based on the 
acknowledgement of the fact that we must try to be more 
inclusive, that the setting up of a forum for reasoned debates 
must and should lead to greater understanding and serve as a 
foundation for a constructive dialogue and fruitful co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This commitment to individual rights, transparency and openness 
in government and the involvement of citizens is of paramount 
importance if we want our democratic institutions to remain 
dynamic and vitally important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is honoured to have been chosen to host the 2001 summit 
of the Americas in Quebec City. I am convinced that our area is 
on the verge of an era of great achievements and that it is 
essential that we now make the commitment to work patiently, 
indefatigably and reasonably in order to assure for our 
hemisphere a future which has indeed always been and remains 
full of promises.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the hon. member for her remarks and her 
very clear enthusiasm for this upcoming summit.  It is 
interesting to note that that same enthusiasm for trade issues 
and the vigour with which Liberals are promoting this particular 
summit is the type of vigour that we saw in opposition to free 
trade not that many years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However more to the point, my question, with particular emphasis 
on trade, with this upcoming summit looming in the near future is 
this.  Would it not have put Canada in a better position to have 
addressed some of the very serious trade issues that are looming 
as we approach this summit in Quebec City?  For example, we have 
the expiration of the softwood lumber accord which will happen 
this weekend.  The way Canada handled the Brazilian beef issue 
caused severe harm to our trade relations with that country.  Of 
equal importance is the ongoing challenge for Prince Edward 
Island potato farmers because of the government's lack of 
leadership on that issue and its paltry attempts to compensate 
them for their losses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These issues are all still outstanding.  The borders for Prince 
Edward Island potato farmers are still closed.  With the upcoming 
expiration of the softwood lumber accord, this is going to throw 
softwood lumber producers around the country into complete 
disarray.  We have not even resolved a common position between 
provinces, let alone how we are going to approach this with our 
American trading partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not true that we are somewhat lacking in moral credibility 
when we go into this summit and start to approach some of these 
larger equally important issues?  Would it not have been in 
Canadians' interest for her government to try to resolve some of 
these issues before we went to this summit?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Diane Marleau:</B>  Mr. Speaker, all agendas have to move 
forward.  If we do not move forward on one because there might be 
problems on the other we would never go anywhere.  We will 
continue to address these major challenges, the softwood lumber 
one being a very important case in point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, we have gone to the world court three times and won, 
but the United States continues to bring action against Canada. 
The reality is that we have a very competitive softwood industry 
and unfortunately some of the northern states, the northwestern 
states in particular, continue to want to fight us because they 
cannot compete with us.  That will be a problem, as it has been 
for some time.  We are very hopeful, because we do believe in 
free trade and we want to have free trade with the U.S., 
especially on softwood lumber.  We will continue to fight on that 
one and I am convinced that once again our good industry with its 
good practices will prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the summit of the Americas, this is but one 
step.  There will be many more, I am sure, before there is any 
kind of an agreement.  We really have to start from somewhere. We 
are speaking of democracy.  We have a number of countries in the 
Americas that have become much more democratic.  It is important 
to work with them.  Canada can play a major role and is expected 
to play that role.  We have values that we want to project to 
other countries in the Americas.  We want to be there when the 
rules are put together so that those countries can take our 
values into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely essential for us to be at that table, to 
encourage the dialogue with parliamentarians, as we are doing 
tonight, to encourage the dialogue with civil society, and to 
tell the people of Canada that we are concerned in the same ways 
they are and that is why we are at that table.  We want to 
protect those values that are so important to us as Canadians. If 
we are not there, the rules will be made without us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that we are a large country with a small 
population.  It is better to deal with rules.  That is what this 
is about.  It is better to deal with rules that take into 
consideration what we value than to have other rules imposed upon 
us about which we have absolutely no say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really believe that we must continue to work on all fronts to 
ensure the best deal for Canadian citizens. 
<P><A NAME="LINK270"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise and speak in the debate.  I 
will be sharing my time with the member from Dewdney—Alouette. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk for a minute about what the debate is all about. 
Sometimes we get caught up in all the legalese, but basically the 
debate is about the Quebec summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a lot made of the free trade area of the Americas 
that is coming up.  In reality, that free trade agreement, of 
which I am very supportive, is not going to come to fruition 
until 2006 at the earliest.  We hear about the draft text, which 
is really the negotiating position of the 34 member countries 
participating at the Quebec summit.  However, there are a lot of 
other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to speak a little about free trade, about why I think 
it is so important and about why I think the government has put 
us in a somewhat compromised position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we go into the very preliminary stages of these discussions, 
with the heads of state there to discuss a free trade agreement 
for the hemisphere, our government, only months before with 
respect to Brazilian beef, took a very political position and 
banned beef when it had no grounds to do so.  Yet we will be 
arguing with the Americans over the softwood lumber agreement, 
which could cost the Canadian softwood lumber industry $2 billion 
a year.  We will be arguing that they should follow the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only months ago in regard to the aerospace industry, the 
Canadians very clearly had a right to impose trade sanctions 
against Brazil.  The government could have imposed sanctions at 
that time, but then hid behind this veil of safety in regard to 
Brazilian beef without any scientific evidence.  Of course that 
is arguable, but when the government sent our scientists down 
there they very clearly could not find any grounds for the ban.

<A HREF="#LINKT139"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I greatly regret that.  As well, leadership has not been shown 
on the issue of the P.E.I. potatoes.  Clearly there are some 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go specifically to the summit that is ahead of us.  I 
will state a few of the concerns of the Canadian Alliance.  One 
of them is in regard to the people's summit.  There should be an 
opportunity for all people to put their views before the 
subcommittee on international trade, where some of those groups 
are coming forward, and they should also have an opportunity to 
protest very peacefully and, quote, legally at the Quebec summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find very frustrating is that the government has given 
funding of $300,000 to these groups that have very openly and 
blatantly said they will break the law.  In fact, they are 
holding workshops right now and training people in civil 
disobedience.  A number of groups are participating.  The NDP 
caucus right here in the House of Commons has said it will 
participate.  The Council of Canadians said in the media very 
openly that it is holding workshops in civil disobedience.  As 
well, there are the Canadian Labour Congress, the Canadian auto 
workers and many other groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the former member from Kamloops, Nelson 
Riis, said yesterday that the NDP is abandoning parliament and 
dangerously risking its reputation by deciding to “lock arms” 
with protesters at the summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have very grave concerns about the government choosing to fund 
the people's summit with $300,000.  I think these people should 
be given an opportunity to have their voices heard, but not at 
the table and not at the plenary sessions because obviously that 
is a place for the heads of state.  We are a very open, free and 
democratic country and I believe there are opportunities for them 
to have their voices heard.  Again, I think there are some 
concerns in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The flip side of it, as we heard in the debate earlier, is the 
corporate sponsorship.  There is a cloud of uncertainty when the 
government allows different corporations to sponsor coffee breaks 
for $75,000 or to supply a vehicle for $500,000 or to have a 
speaking opportunity for $500,000.  People who are influential in 
the business community should be invited, I think, but I do not 
believe that they should be paying for a service.  As a country 
we are hosting the 34 heads of state.  I do not think we want to 
turn this into a three-ring circus by having people who can 
afford to pay.  We know who the leaders are from both sides. It 
is the government's responsibility to take the input from the 
NGOs, from the business community and from members of parliament 
to ensure that there is real and meaningful dialogue as we 
proceed in these negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to the process.  If there is one very legitimate 
group of people that has an absolute right to have meaningful 
dialogue it is members of parliament.  Yes, we can do it through 
committees, but the government will argue that it is not allowed 
to release the text of the document.  I am not saying it has to 
release the absolute text, but let us face it, there are 34 
member states and their negotiators and they know exactly what 
the other countries' positions are.  There are no secrets.  The 
government's suggestion that it cannot reveal exactly what is on 
the table and what is being discussed is not right.  The other 
countries Canada is negotiating with know our position, as we 
know theirs.  That is what is done in negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Michael Hart from Carleton University talked about openness and 
transparency.  I am paraphrasing, but he said that we do not need 
to be under any illusions, that all the countries know the 
positions, so we should make this information available.  Members 
of parliament should have full participation and access.  We can 
speculate as to what is in there.  We can go back to the Uruguay 
rounds or we can go back to the NAFTA agreements.  There are 
texts out there. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2140"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT140"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is speculation on our part about what there is in 
the text.  The government could provide more information without 
releasing the text.  It could say “Here are the issues on the 
table, this is exactly what is being discussed and this is what 
needs to happen”.  Most important is that absolutely nothing be 
ratified or signed on to until there is an opportunity for a full 
and open public debate in the House of Commons and a vote by 
members of parliament.  Members of parliament are the ones who 
are democratically elected and they should have the final say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say again that the Canadian Alliance is very 
supportive of free trade.  We believe that free trade will 
benefit all Canadians.  As well, it will benefit people from some 
of the poorer countries who want access to these larger markets 
in the United States and Canada.  The poorer countries want to 
see free trade opened up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the same breath, we are about to embark on a very 
difficult time.  I will summarize this with respect to the 
softwood lumber agreement.  The agreement will expire this 
Sunday.  I have to admit that we are trying to stay united.  The 
government is stating its position.  The government wants the 
agreement to expire and wants free trade, which we in the 
Canadian Alliance do as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest argument of the Americans has been that they allege 
we subsidize our stumpage, which is absolutely false.  In fact, 
stumpage in British Columbia has gone up significantly.  It was 
the government's responsibility to make sure that the American 
administration and the American industry were fully aware of 
that.  The government has failed.  The Americans have made it 
very clear that the American industry will be launching a 
countervail duty case and possibly an anti-dumping case, which 
will cost our industry billions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the responsibility of the government to ensure that the 
Americans knew the facts.  The government has had almost five 
years to do that and has failed miserably.  The Americans just 
believe that we are providing all these subsidies, which is 
absolutely false.  Now, at the 24th hour as the agreement is 
about to expire, the government is scrambling.  It will have to 
deal with this.  The government is looking at how it will deal 
with the CVDs, the countervail duty cases, that will be brought 
forward.  That could be very damaging.  It would be very damaging 
for our industry.  I believe the government has failed the 
industry in preparing as we come to the expiration.  Some would 
argue that the softwood lumber agreement was in fact the bridging 
agreement to reach free trade.  Now that we are in the 24th hour, 
very clearly the Americans would seem to be back at ground zero 
after over $100 million in legal fees in the last 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance supports the free trade agreement of the 
Americas.  We hope the government shows leadership and makes 
wiser decisions than it has in the past. 
<P><A NAME="LINK271"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that 
the official opposition, for the most part, is supportive of our 
efforts in the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to take up my colleague's last point about 
softwood lumber.  The hon. member says the government has not 
done enough to make the Americans aware.  With all due respect, I 
think that is wrong.  Surely my colleague is aware that the Prime 
Minister of Canada raised this personally with the President of 
the United States.  It was one of the first issues they 
discussed.  Surely my colleague is aware that the Minister for 
International Trade raised this issue with U.S. trade 
representative Robert Zoellick at their very first meeting. 
Surely my colleague is aware that American consumer groups, 
American senators and American congressmen are calling on their 
government not to do what it has done three times and launch a 
countervail action against Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada simply does not control what the Americans do.  With all 
due respect to my colleague, it is incorrect to say that the 
Americans are not aware of the facts.  The Americans know the 
facts.  Some choose to ignore those facts even when the courts 
rule them to be offside on the issue.  Frankly, I do not know 
what else the government could have done to make Americans aware.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do acknowledge that.  I was 
with the minister in Washington and I met privately with the 
chairman of the industry, trade and commerce committee and a 
number of U.S. officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am making is that this has only happened within the 
last four to six weeks, after the Prime Minister and the Minister 
for International Trade went to the United States to present 
their case, when they have had five years to do so.  They should 
have informed the industry in the United States that we do not 
subsidize our lumber and that we are competitive. The United 
States wants free trade and it is advocating for free trade.  We 
should be telling the Americans that if they want free trade they 
should honour previous rulings.  We want to and should provide 
co-operation in other sectors but we should tell them that we 
will take them to the wall if they start imposing $1 billion to 
$2 billion in duties against the Canadian softwood lumber 
industry of which 45% is from my home province of British 
Columbia.  This would cripple the economies of the many one 
industry towns.  That is just not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary was absolutely right when he said 
that the Prime Minister raised this issue with the president and 
that the international trade minister has been in Washington. 
However it has only been in the last four to six weeks that we 
have seen any activity at all.  We have had five years of 
stability with the softwood lumber agreement.  During that time 
we could have been raising this issue because of its importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all want to see free trade.  We will work with the government 
and do everything in our power to ensure that we have free trade. 
We will use all the powers within our means to go after the 
United States administration if it brings in a countervail duty 
or an anti-dumping case.  The Americans must respect the 
decisions of the world court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will work with the government but the government needs to 
provide stronger leadership.  What we have seen with the 
Brazilian beef and P.E.I. potatoes has given us cause for 
concern.  The government did not provided the leadership that was 
required on those files. 
<P><A NAME="LINK272"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to join in the debate tonight on a 
very important issue.  I commend my colleagues for bringing the 
issue forward.  I hope we can work together in a reasoned way to 
talk about the free trade agreement of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me state unequivocally that the Alliance is in support of 
free trade.  We have heard that throughout this evening and we 
are four square behind the principle of free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to focus my comments on a few areas.  I want to speak 
first to the way free trade agreements are arrived at and how the 
process has at times given rise to some of the current concerns 
that individuals have had with regard to free trade, such as the 
groups my colleague from Saanich—Gulf Islands mentioned which 
are going to protest.  All citizens have the right to do so and 
should do so in a peaceful way.  Many people are concerned about 
this issue, as are many of my own constituents who have consulted 
me on this topic.  They are concerned about the environment, 
health care, natural resources, water and culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When free trade agreements are entered into, people become 
concerned when information on very important topics is not 
forthcoming.  The government should be providing Canadians as 
much information as possible on these kinds of agreements.  It 
should communicate to Canadians that they will have the 
opportunity to voice their concerns on important issues like 
this. If the government would, through reasoned debate, explain 
why free trade would be good, it could then win the hearts and 
minds of Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Liberal government many years ago fought an 
election against free trade.  Things can change.  I know most of 
my colleagues on the Liberal side would support notions such as 
free trade, although there are ministers of the crown who we have 
questions about in terms of their sincere commitment to the 
principle of free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was refreshing in the debate earlier tonight to hear the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for International 
Trade speak in a sincere way from their hearts as to why they 
believe free trade is a good thing.  That was encouraging.  I 
think those two ministers will have to contend with their 
colleagues in cabinet who in many ways have demonstrated in the 
past that they do not believe in the principles of free trade as 
strongly as they do.  I think of the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, the Minister of Industry, and several other members of 
cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that voices, words and beliefs uttered by those 
ministers carry the day in the cabinet because this is a very 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on some of the words said earlier in debate 
about how trade can help to develop economic prosperity and how 
it can be a key to helping people, not only here in our country 
but in other nations where we enter into these kinds of trade 
agreements.  It can be the engine of prosperity.  It can help to 
develop better economies in countries where there is not a 
strong, stable economy through the free trade of goods and 
services, and even ideas and intellectual property, where 
individuals can be rewarded for ideas and initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that is a good thing.  We believe that is a way for 
individuals to grow in their prosperity, to get ahead and to have 
better lives for themselves and their families no matter what 
nation they are in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we need to clearly establish our sovereignty in any 
deals in areas such as health and culture.  We need to make sure 
that natural resources are taken care of.  Water is a big issue 
that we need to be very clear on in any agreement we enter into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote a world leader who was visiting here in our 
Chamber in February.  Tony Blair, the prime minister of Great 
Britain said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally on trade I just want to say this last point. It is time I 
think that we started to argue vigorously and clearly as to why 
free trade is right. It is the key to jobs for our people, to 
prosperity and actually to development in the poorest parts of 
the world. The case against it is misguided and, worse, unfair. 
However sincere the protests, they cannot be allowed to stand in 
the way of rational argument. We should start to make this case 
with force and determination. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly agree with the prime minister.  We would hope that 
our colleagues from all parties would look seriously at the 
implications of arguing against freer trade and what the end 
result of that would be, because for the people who we say we 
want to help who are at the lower end of the economic scale, when 
we take free trade out of the equation, what is the alternative 
answer by those who would advocate for a tariff based economy or 
a protectionist approach to our economy and our trading 
relationship?  What is the answer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answers I have heard coming back are ones that are not 
strong.  They are not steeped in logic.  In many ways they have 
become red herring arguments, such as the argument that we cannot 
enter into free trade agreements because it will attack our own 
sovereignty, our own democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that by informing people on the topic, we can build in 
to that process answers to the concerns that individuals would 
have in a particular area. 
We can do that when we work together and when we give people 
information and the opportunity to openly look at all the 
possible solutions.  We believe that is the best way to go when 
there are concerns.

to go and that where we end up will be a better place for our 
citizens, our trading partners and the citizens of other nations 
with which we deal, will it be worth it to get there?  Will it be 
worth it to put in the work?  Will it be worth it to negotiate 
and spend hours putting together a rules based method of trade or 
will it not?  Those are fundamental questions that our citizens 
need to debate.  In the past the majority have accepted moving 
forward on those issues but they have also wanted other 
solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Free trade has been a positive economic reality for our country 
and for our trading partners.  It has provided an opportunity for 
people who need help.  If we demonstrate and lead through our 
actions on these issues, taking into consideration the concerns 
of the people and move forward, we will end up going to a better 
place.  It will lead to prosperity for many people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A worthwhile goal is for us to work together and to put aside 
our differences.  Obviously we will not agree on everything but 
we can move together toward a bigger vision and because where we 
end will be a better place than we were when we started.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I really appreciated my colleague's well stated comments 
in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that members of the New Democratic Party have 
talked about winners and loser in these trade deals. They fear 
that Canada will be the loser and have sided with the 
protesters, which is a sad commentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we think back to the pre-1988 years, we remember that several 
members of this government opposed the free trade agreement that 
the Conservatives brought forth.  Members, including the Prime 
Minister, the industry minister and the heritage minister, sided 
with the protesters against that agreement.  They protested 
against a free trade agreement that has brought much wealth and 
prosperity to our country.  It is an agreement that has allowed 
our cattle industry to more than double in Alberta, the high tech 
industry to develop in Ottawa and the financial and service 
industries to develop in Toronto and Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All those things brought prosperity right across the country. 
However, many members of the government spoke out against that 
agreement and protested side by side with protesters in 1988.  Is 
it not funny what a few years have done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does my colleague think there has apparently been a change 
in heart from those cabinet ministers and other members of the 
government on this fundamental and very important issue of free 
trade? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would submit that there 
are probably many cabinet ministers who are still not 
wholeheartedly behind the notion of free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem that within cabinet, within the leadership of the 
governing party, that at this particular point those who are 
committed to the principle of free trade, must be outweighing, 
within the internal divisions that are a part of any group, those 
who are not free traders at heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would balance those comments by saying that when we have a 
group like that moving forward on this kind of issue, there is 
always a possibility, if changes occur within the party, that the 
balance could be tipped in favour of going back to a 
protectionist type of attitude when it comes to the economy, and 
that would be a negative.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Alliance has supported the notion of free trade 
for so long.  We can do even better with government policy that 
encourages freer trade in all sectors of the economy, taking into 
consideration the concerns which I mentioned earlier.  I would 
hope that the current governing group for the short period of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join 
in this important debate where elected members of parliament from 
all parties have the opportunity to share their thoughts and 
concerns about this important process and to reflect the concerns 
and feelings of their constituents.  This is the place for 
elected members of parliament to make their views known, and I am 
pleased to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americas is one of the world's most dynamic regions.  Though 
its 800 million people are not even one-sixth of the world's 
population, they account for more than one-third of the world's 
economic activity.  At about $17 trillion dollars, the combined 
gross domestic product of the Americas is greater than that of 
the European Union.  It is no wonder then that the leaders of the 
western hemisphere believe in the potential of the Americas. They 
knew that their countries could work together more efficiently on 
every front, social, political and economic, to promote 
democracy, development and growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Miami summit of the Americas in 1994 leaders endorsed a 
declaration and plan of action that expressed their common 
commitment to strengthening democracy and creating greater 
prosperity.  They also committed themselves to practical measures 
to improve health care, to increase access to quality education, 
to protect biodiversity, to take collective action against the 
scourge of drugs and corruption, and to expand and deepen the 
dialogue with civil society on regional priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the second summit in Santiago in 1998 this co-operation was 
carried forward and deepened.  Once again leaders endorsed action 
to support the development of democratic institutions, protect 
human rights, and enhance transparency and respect for the rule 
of law.  They gave specific instructions to begin the process of 
negotiating the free trade area of the Americas.  Once it is 
complete the FTAA will be the world's largest free trade area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summit of the Americas process offers numerous opportunities 
to further enhance Canada's openness to the western hemisphere. 
The FTAA is one of the most tangible opportunities on the 
economic front with its potential for enhanced market access for 
Canadian exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one sector where new access could lead to 
significant benefits for Canada and Canadian business, it is 
services.  The services sector is a key engine of Canada's 
economy.  It is responsible for more than two-thirds of Canada's 
GDP, almost three-quarters of employment, 10.5 million jobs and 
nearly 90% of new job creation in Canada.  It is leading the 
transformation of the Canadian economy into a knowledge based 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many employees in the services sector are highly educated and 
enjoy weekly earnings well above average.  Services are at the 
heart of Canada's innovative society.  For example, 
telecommunications, financial services and technical business 
services are among the most innovative industries in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a leading trading nation Canada counts on its services 
exports to strengthen its prosperity.  Not counting Canada's 
direct investments abroad in services companies, Canada is the 
12th largest exporter of services in the world, exporting some 
$51.8 billion worth of services in 1999 alone.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian companies like SNC Lavalin, Teleglobe, Enbridge and 
Hydro-Québec are among the world's leaders in their fields. Their 
expertise is sought across the hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those services exports only account for 12% of total Canadian 
exports.  Canada's trade in services is increasing at a much 
faster pace than our trade in goods.  Given the importance of 
trade for our economy we can say without fear of exaggeration 
that improving market access abroad for our services providers is 
vital to sustaining our prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument for supporting Canada's services exports is 
particularly strong when it comes to the Americas.  Canada's 
commercial services exports to FTAA countries, excluding the 
United States and Mexico, were worth $1.9 billion in 1998, up 
from $787 million in 1993 and growing at an average annual rate 
of 19% during that time.  Countries such as Argentina, Chile, 
Costa Rica, Venezuela, Colombia and Brazil are all key existing or 
potential export markets for Canadian services providers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three sectors are particularly noteworthy: telecommunications, 
financial services and engineering services.  The Canadian 
telecommunications sector is enjoying tremendous success, 
exporting services valued at over $2 billion per year and 
employing some 104,000 people.  As a consequence, since 1993 the 
sector has been growing by over 9% per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian exporters of telecommunications services face market 
access and regulatory restrictions in some countries of the 
hemisphere in part due to the presence of telecommunications 
monopolies in addition to a lack of transparency, predictability 
and timeliness in the process for awarding operating permits and 
licences or prohibitive fees for licensing or interconnections. 
Reducing such barriers would significantly increase export 
opportunities for Canada's telecommunications companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years Canada's financial institutions have been very 
active in Central and Latin America.  One leading example is 
Scotiabank which is active in Argentina; Chile, where its 
subsidiary is the seventh largest bank in the country; Brazil; 
Costa Rica; Belize; El Salvador, with 33 branches in that country 
alone; Guyana; Panama; Peru; Uruguay; and Venezuela. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another good example is the National Bank which recently teamed 
up with three U.S. venture capital companies and a local Chilean 
partner to form the Corp Banca Consortium to purchase banking 
institutions in South American countries.  The same is true for 
the insurance sector.  Our insurance companies have in fact 
identified Latin America as a growth market for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another sector where Canadian expertise is renowned around the 
world is engineering and other related services.  Canada is 
currently the world's third largest exporter of engineering 
services.  The very high calibre of Canadian engineers is 
internationally recognized.  Business opportunities are 
significant, especially in Central and Latin America where 
Canadian engineer expertise in resource based, energy related and 
infrastructure projects is in high demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard Hydro-Québec's recent acquisition of Chile's 
Transelect, which owns 50% of Chilean power transmission lines, 
is a good example of the type of business opportunities the 
countries of the western hemisphere have to offer.  This is why 
Canada is actively participating in services negotiations under 
the free trade area of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has much to gain from the establishment of a 
comprehensive set of rules on trade and services under the FTAA. 
Canada's general objective in the services negotiations is to 
seek improved market access for Canadian services providers under 
a transparent and predictable rules based system.  In the 
elaboration of FTAA rules on services Canada will be guided by 
its existing rights and obligations in the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, the Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement and the 
WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services, more commonly known 
as GATS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These objectives can be achieved without putting at risk the 
values all Canadians cherish.  The FTAA services chapter will 
allow countries to file exceptions for those measures they wish 
to maintain.  In addition, and I wish this to be very clear, 
nothing in these negotiations will jeopardize our health and 
public education systems.  They are not negotiable.

our public health system and our education system are on the 
table.  They are not negotiable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have shown how much services and service exports contribute to 
the dynamism of the Canadian economy.  I have shown how world 
competitive Canadian telecommunications, financial services and 
engineering services, to name only three sectors, look to the 
Americas for their market growth.  I have tried to show how we 
will shape the rules of the game to achieve our objectives 
without imperilling the things we hold dear.

ourselves and in our region.  We now have the stability, the 
transparency and the economic growth record that allows trade to 
increase and thrive.  The countries of the region are good 
economic partners for Canada and for each other.  For all of us, 
the FTAA is a vote of confidence in our common future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the debate.  I 
can tell the House that the Minister for International Trade, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and I are taking very careful note of 
what hon. colleagues raise this evening. 
<P><A NAME="LINK275"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
concerned about cultural diversity and the safeguarding of 
Canadian culture within the FTAA and also within the larger WTO 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Americans have put their negotiating position 
forward and it includes putting culture on the table.  It also 
includes full coverage of the cultural sector and the extensive 
application of the most favoured nation status and the national 
treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great deal of enthusiasm right now amongst cultural 
coalitions in Canada and around the world for a new international 
cultural instrument which is separate all together from the trade 
agreements.  We also know that any separate cultural agreement 
would mean nothing if the government locks itself into certain 
clauses in the FTAA, such as the most favoured nation status and 
national treatment.  Our ability to subsidize our cultural 
industries, to safeguard Canadian content, to protect our public 
broadcaster, all of those things would be in jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government guarantee that our negotiators will not sell 
Canadian culture down the drain by allowing the most favoured 
nation rule to be applied across the board in all services? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the question from 
the member with whom I served for a time on the Canadian heritage 
committee.  With all due respect to her question, I think she 
knows full well that the government has stood up for Canadian 
cultural industries time and again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Important institutions, such as the CBC, the magazine industry, 
and many of the examples where we have stood up for the cultural 
industries of the country, answer very eloquently the member's 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an important discussion about an international cultural 
instrument and the government is fully participating in that. The 
government will stand very strongly for the preservation of our 
culture.  It understands very clearly just how threatened our 
culture can be living beside the behemoth that we live beside. We 
cannot change that.  The government has always stood for Canadian 
culture and it will continue to do so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK276"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to ask the hon. member questions in two areas.  One 
of the most serious concerns that many of us who are critics of 
the proposed FTAA have voiced is with respect to the extension of 
the investor state provisions, the chapter 11 provisions of 
NAFTA, throughout the entire hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that these provisions have been profoundly undemocratic. 
They have been used by corporations to attack policies which have 
been democratically determined by governments at the local, 
provincial, state or national level in areas such as the 
environment and health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member who just spoke why is it that Canada apparently 
has no position whatsoever before the FTAA on this fundamentally 
important issue of investor state provisions in chapter 11 of 
NAFTA?  We have been told by the minister on many occasions that 
if we want to know Canada's position on these issues we should go 
to the government's website.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a printout of the government's website in front of me. On 
the issue of investment, this is what it says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Summary of Canada's position—To date, Canada has made no 
submissions to the Negotiating Group on Investment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is so concerned about chapter 11 of the 
investor state provisions, why has it made no submissions on that 
fundamentally important issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a second very brief question.  The member indicated that 
at the summit in 1994 the government leaders made a commitment to 
do whatever they could to promote biodiversity within the 
hemisphere.  What steps have been taken to promote biodiversity 
in the context of the FTAA? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat O'Brien:</B>  Mr. Speaker, regarding the member's 
first question on chapter 11 of NAFTA, the member has been in the 
House on several occasions, as I have, when the Minister for 
International Trade expressed the same reservations and concerns 
about chapter 11, though certainly not to the degree of those who 
do not think we even need to be involved in this international 
trade discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has expressed reservations about the way the 
chapter 11 clause under NAFTA has been expanded by some of the 
rulings that have come out of that dispute.  The minister has 
expressed serious reservations about signing any deal which would 
include a chapter 11-like NAFTA clause.  He has made that clear. 
I am not sure if the member was present for those comments but 
they are very easy to see and I can make sure he gets— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I regret to interrupt, but a large 
number of colleagues still want to participate in the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK277"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stephen Owen (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to take part tonight in this important 
debate.  The objectives of the upcoming third summit of the 
Americas in Quebec City include increased prosperity throughout 
the Americas by increased free trade and, also, most important, 
the spreading of democracy throughout the hemisphere and the 
opportunity for every person in the hemisphere to reach their 
full potential.  When we consider the importance of the summit we 
must keep in mind those broad objectives and ensure that Canada 
as a government represents us all in pursuing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak on a few aspects that have not been fully touched 
on in tonight's debate, starting with the issue of process. 
Having been a bit of a process and public participation junkie in 
a previous career, I am extremely interested by the degree of 
transparency and public participation in our move toward free 
trade of the Americas.  I will give the House my observations of 
what has taken place to date and what I think must continue and 
perhaps be enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my experience in dealing with public issues in Canada and 
internationally, I have never seen such a transparent and 
participatory process through the leadership of a government. The 
executive branch of Government of Canada has, and we must 
acknowledge it, sole responsibility to negotiate international 
treaties of this type. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for federal and provincial legislatures to debate and pass 
laws required to implement any treaty.  That is where their 
obligation lies.  However in spite of the lead role of the 
executive branch, the Government of Canada has provided 
unparalleled transparency and opportunities to participate in the 
process, including full federal, provincial and territorial 
ministerial meetings, consultations and public forums across the 
country, and the website which includes all of Canada's 
negotiating positions to date.  The website has been up for a 
year and we will continue to try to post everything the 
Government of Canada puts forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hosted, this month in Ottawa, the interparliamentary forum of 
the Americas with parliamentarians from throughout the hemisphere 
talking about issues for the upcoming summit.  We are having the 
debate tonight.  The Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister 
for International Trade appeared before a standing parliamentary 
committee to answer questions and provide perspective on the 
Canadian proposals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even before getting to Quebec City we have had broad public 
participation and disclosure of negotiating positions.  When we 
get to Quebec City we will have, and Canada has been the leader 
in encouraging, the full participation of a civil society 
committee in all the free trade of the Americas talks.  That will 
be enhanced in Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we heard tonight, the second people's summit of the Americas 
will take place parallel to the meetings of the heads of 
government and heads of state in Quebec City.  The Government of 
Canada is financially supporting that to the tune of $300,000 
with a further $200,000 from the government of Quebec.  These are 
important opportunities and are not to be made light of.  In 
international trade agreements they are unparalleled in their 
scope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me deal with one substantive complaint by Canadians about 
the process:  The full negotiating positions and texts of the 
other countries are not yet public.  Canada has taken the lead in 
making its positions public and has been followed by the United 
States, Mexico and Costa Rica.  At the planning meeting in Buenos 
Aires in two weeks, Canada will argue that other countries should 
make their positions, as well as the full text of their 
negotiating framework, fully public.  Canada will continue to be 
a leader and a model in that practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not doing this simply out of altruism and 
farsightedness.  Modern governance goes far beyond any one 
government or country.  It includes civil society and the market. 
The best information will not be accumulated and the best 
decisions will not be made or implemented unless we have broad 
participation and transparency in the development and 
implementation of public policy.  This is a good example of such 
leadership by Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn briefly to the question of security and freedom. 
Canadians cherish their political and civil rights and freedoms 
perhaps above anything else in our society.  We take them 
seriously and demand they be respected.  However we also enjoy, 
appreciate and demand that we live in a secure and protected 
society.  For that we entrust to our police the heavy and onerous 
duty of ensuring that all our rights are respected, and our 
behaviour is appropriate to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now turn to Quebec City.  Security is a challenge and a 
matter of complexity and concern for police authorities in Quebec 
City.  Thirty-four heads of government and heads of state will be 
attending the summit.  There is a topographical situation in the 
old town of Quebec, as was pointed out yesterday by the mayor of 
Quebec City.  Because of the narrow streets and the hills, people 
gathering in large numbers could be injured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mayor of Quebec City stressed that security must be 
maintained by police so the summit does not descend into the 
debacle we saw in Seattle during the WTO meetings.  The greatest 
threat to those who wished to publicly exercise their right to 
protest and free speech in Seattle was the few who disrupted and 
discredited the many.  We entrust to our police the duty of 
maintaining order.   However, that is a major challenge and we 
must have perimeters.  I do not know whether the fences are too 
high or the area too large, but we must trust the police to make 
the difficult operational decisions given their responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn finally to the issue of trade and democracy.  We 
have heard a lot from both sides of the House tonight about the 
importance of trade to Canada and the prosperity it has brought 
us.  The freer the trade the more prosperity we seem to enjoy. 
That is in context.  The Government of Canada has been forthright 
and must be held accountable to ensure that as we engage in free 
trade agreements we do not sacrifice our health, our educational 
or social services or our cultural integrity.

<A HREF="#LINKT149"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes beyond our internal interests.  Trade is about balance. 
It is about taking advantage of economic opportunities globally 
through freer trade, but it also means meeting our global 
responsibilities.  That is why the Government of Canada has 
pledged to link freer trade to issues of environmental integrity, 
human rights, democratic development and education.  The 
government's objective is to ensure everyone in the hemisphere 
has, as an example to the world, the opportunity to reach their 
full potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us come together, as parliamentarians and as Canadians, to 
make sure the Government of Canada meets its obligations to 
ensure that human potential is realized beyond our borders as 
well as inside them.

and it reminded me of election night on November 27. Throughout 
the election campaign, I never imagined myself telling my 
constituents: “You know, if ever a free trade area of the 
Americas is established, we are going to leave everything in the 
hands of the government, and all Parliament will have to do is 
rubber stamp any decisions that are made”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as the premier of Quebec undertook to do in the Quebec 
national assembly, before the treaty takes effect and the 
Government of Canada is bound by its provisions, would the 
member not like to see adopted in parliament an accord that 
would be the end result of discussions and debate among 
members of the House? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stephen Owen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we must respect the 
opportunity we have this evening to debate these issues.  We must 
make our views and the views of our constituents known in terms 
of what should be contained in the treaty.  We should debate what 
is fundamentally important to both this treaty and any parallel 
treaty that may address issues linked to our relations with other 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians we have this opportunity.  We have had the 
opportunity in standing committees to question the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs and the Minister for International Trade.  We 
have had the opportunity to meet with parliamentarians of other 
countries throughout the hemisphere to discuss the issues of the 
upcoming summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians, let alone as general members of society, we 
can take advantage of the opportunities for discussion and the 
information that is available.  This is a fulsome opportunity for 
engagement not only of parliamentarians but, more important 
perhaps, of Canadians to negotiate and provide information and 
advice to the executive of government which is responsible for 
negotiating international treaties. 
<P><A NAME="LINK279"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra has spoken about democracy, 
transparency and the unprecedented extent to which his government 
has been reaching out and consulting Canadians on the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member care to comment on the issue of corporate 
sponsorship at the upcoming summit of the Americas?  Does he not 
agree there is something obscene about major corporations being 
able to buy their way into the inner sanctum of the summit?  For 
$500,000 they can make a speech at the opening reception.  If 
they pony up about $75,000 they can choose which leader to sit 
beside at a lunch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not a perversion of democracy?  How can the hon. member 
talk about the great triumph of transparency and democracy when 
wealthy corporations are able to buy their way into the summit 
and civil society is kept outside a perimeter four kilometres 
long?  How can the member call that democracy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stephen Owen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not believe my ears 
in hearing the hon. member challenge the issue of democracy in 
Canada in such strident terms.  It is a gross overstatement.  It 
is an insult to the House, to the freedoms we enjoy and to the 
democratic privileges we exercise.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the question, the member mentions buying privileged 
access.  We have talked in the House tonight and before about the 
civil society committee that will be assisting and that will have 
access to the negotiators in the free trade of the Americas 
process.  We know this is a long process.  It is going to unfold 
over the next three years.  It is not a matter of simply one 
meeting with one access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is also an economic interest of cost recovery. It 
has become commonplace in international gatherings around the 
world for both the large public expense to be recognized and for 
some attempts to be made at cost recovery.  Whether this crosses 
the line of propriety in any way, I am not sure.  Perhaps the 
public discussion we are having and raising the issue as to 
whether it should be appropriate in future is a good thing.  That 
illuminates the opportunity in this debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me begin by 
saying that I will split the time I have been allocated with the 
hon. member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In less than a month, from April 20 to 22 next, 34 heads of 
states and democratically elected governments from North 
America, South America, Central America, and the Caribbean, with 
the exception of Cuba, will meet in Quebec City for the third 
summit of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the themes addressed during this meeting will include, 
among others, the strengthening of democracy, where it will be a 
question of promoting peace and the protection of societies. 
Another theme that will be discussed is the realization of human 
potential. This topic will include the alleviation of poverty 
and the promotion of education and training; social rights will 
also be discussed.  Another theme will be community 
connectivity. These discussions will involve the Internet and 
new technologies. Lastly, the theme that will undoubtedly be 
discussed at greatest length is the theme referred to as 
creating prosperity.  This is where we will find the 
negotiations on the free trade area of the Americas, the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FTAA represents an extraordinary challenge. This free trade 
zone will, of course, provide us with new economic 
opportunities; it will also provide opportunities for people. 
It represents an openness toward the Americas, toward new 
cultures; it means becoming acquainted with new peoples and new 
economic, social and political practices.  It is a pool of 
800 million people with a combined gross domestic product of some 
ten trillion, ten thousand billion, American dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This said, the economic practice of free trade is by no means a 
panacea, a cure for all that ails us. Let us look back. Let us 
go back to the time of the North American Free Trade Agreement, 
NAFTA, which covered an economic zone including the nation of 
Quebec, Canada, the United States and Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the agreement has had some positive impact, the 
creation of this free trade area has not prevented certain 
calamities, such as the collapse of the Mexican peso, a decline 
in living standards, the growth of social disparities, an 
increase in human misery, and an increase in the number of 
workers earning minimum wage with few if any benefits or 
favourable conditions. Yet NAFTA was supposed to bring about the 
opposite of what we are witnessing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we going to follow NAFTA's example? Do we want to expand 
and increase human misery? Of course not. We have to do 
everything we can to avoid such an outcome. If this were the 
case, it would be out of the question for the Bloc Quebecois to 
support the establishment of such a free trade area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question we must ask ourselves is this: is the Liberal 
government really and sincerely prepared to do absolutely 
everything—even it means leaving the negotiating table—to avoid 
the impoverishment brought about by NAFTA? It is highly 
doubtful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is doubtful because the federal government is concealing far 
too many things, in particular the working documents used to 
negotiate the FTAA. Let there be no mistake about it: these 
documents represent Canada's main negotiating position.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These texts may well change our lives, and the only thing the 
minister can say to us is, “Trust me, no questions asked”, as 
if members of parliament and civil society were incapable of 
judging the validity and content of these texts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do you expect parliamentarians and civil society to trust a 
government that negotiates an agreement, on our behalf and in 
secret, that may very well change our lives? How can we 
determine whether these negotiations were justified or properly 
carried out? The answer is simple: by being handed a done deal. 
That is absolutely unacceptable in a democracy. The people in 
the Laurentides riding have a right to know what is happening 
behind the curtains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now fair to say that the Liberal government does not want 
to take the initiative and show leadership, as the United States 
has done, by making public the FTAA negotiating texts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the social front, there is reason to doubt the Minister for 
International Trade's willingness to give priority to social 
issues in these negotiations. When I see the position and views 
of the minister on these issues, the situation is far from 
clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer to the testimony of the Minister for 
International Trade when he appeared before the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade on June 14, 
2000. The minister stated, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it's very important to separate the progress on trade 
matters and not link it inextricably to all environmental and 
labour standard issues. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's thinking is becoming clearer and clearer. Not 
only does he not want to take any action regarding social and 
environmental rights, but he goes even further and affirms that 
trade does not necessarily have any connection to workers' 
rights and environmental issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an absolutely irresponsible statement and it reveals, 
beyond a doubt, the minister's intentions. I say to the people 
of Quebec and Canada, as well as to workers: This is the man who 
will be negotiating on your behalf. He is the one who will be 
defending your rights, who will be putting them on the 
negotiating table. 
Does this inspire confidence? Personally, I do not feel 
confident and my point of view is shared by all members of the 
general public except, obviously, the members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not the slightest leadership is being shown by the government 
and its international trade minister on social and environmental 
issues. What he is really saying is that they will go with the 
crowd. The government is not demonstrating any initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is one last quote from the same committee hearing. This one 
provides very clear information to the House and to the people 
of Quebec and Canada as to the intentions of the government and 
its minister in charge of negotiating the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Charlesbourg, was asking the 
Minister for International Trade if he was prepared to include 
the basic rights recognized by the International Labour 
Organization in the FTAA.  Here are the contents of those seven 
conventions.  It is important that I mention them to the 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conventions number 29 and 105 concern the abolition of forced 
labour.  Conventions number 87 and 98 deal with union rights, 
collective bargaining and labour organization, including the 
right to elect union representatives without the interference of 
employers or of government authorities, as well as the right to 
strike.  Conventions number 100 and 111 deal with equal pay for 
work of equal value and the elimination of discrimination in the 
workplace.  Convention number 138 concerns the minimum age for 
admission to employment, that is the complete elimination of 
child labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the minister's response to my colleague, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that trade must remain as open as possible, and that 
for some countries to reach the point of being able to comply 
with some of the conventions you have mentioned, what they need 
is precisely more open economies than those they now have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that through involvement in a given society, 
particularly though trade, we ultimately have a greater 
influence because we allow them to become aware of our values 
and to experience the economic development that will allow them 
to achieve this. 
That is what we are advocating. We do not want to close the door 
on a country that is not following a particular course of 
action. We believe that by practising isolation or adopting 
exclusionary policies toward a particular nation, we are merely 
encouraging it to harden its position on the social values which 
we hold dear, values which we would like to see this country 
embrace.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now crystal clear, in light of the response given by the 
Minister for International Trade, that the federal government 
does not intend to defend with vigour and leadership fundamental 
social rights in the FTAA agreement. This is unacceptable, and 
even a blatant step backward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the opinion of the Bloc Quebecois, this position is 
inconceivable. I would like the minister to demonstrate some 
good faith and leadership in this matter and to put on the table 
for all to see those documents which will serve as a basis for 
negotiating the FTAA. Without these documents, how is it 
possible for parliamentarians like us and for members of civil 
society to form a real opinion and to bring some added value to 
this debate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister for International Trade undertake to defend 
fully and without any reservations the fundamental social rights 
which Quebecers and Canadians hold so dear? The start of the 
summit of the Americas is only a few days away and we are still 
awaiting an answer to this question. The public is right to be 
concerned. 
<P><A NAME="LINK281"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib):</B> Mr. Speaker, in her speech, 
my colleague referred to problems. I just want to ask her a 
question and hear what she has to say. I want to know if she 
agrees that the only problem we face is the problem of isolation. 
Isolation is the enemy of progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, free trade is an irreversible phenomenon. At the end of 
the day, we have to open new borders to our products, whether 
these products are from Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, or another 
province of Canada. We must open borders for these products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An individual who works in Quebec City or Montreal will enjoy 
direct benefits once we are able to sell products from  Quebec 
City or Montreal in Mexico or Chile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are concerned about defending the rights of workers, be 
they in Quebec or another province of Canada, we must realize 
that we will be able to defend them much more effectively in a 
North American context, where there are more than two, three or 
four countries, than in isolation, whether in Quebec or in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to hear my colleague's reply and her comments on the 
following: that free trade in the end means freedom for workers 
in Quebec and the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Monique Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find nearly insolent what I 
have just been told by a member of the Liberal Party, the party 
that voted against free trade, that was against any possibility 
of free trade, that had no free trade vision, whereas we in 
Quebec pushed for free trade and ended up winning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Free trade cannot be achieved at just any cost. Agreements like 
the FTAA cannot be reached in a sneaky, secretive fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a malaise all around right now, especially in 
parliament, which is made up of people representing all the 
regions. The Bloc Quebecois are not the only unhappy ones. There 
are other parties and other members here in the House that are 
unhappy. I am sure that there are even Liberals who are unhappy 
because they do not have access to the documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the way to negotiate an agreement as important as 
the FTAA, which may bring enormous progress throughout the 
Americas.  It has to be done properly. It requires a concerted 
approach. And the provinces, which are included in this 
agreement, need to be consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec, like some other places, has clean drinking water. We 
have large quantities of clean water. The Government of Canada 
must not make decisions that go against our environmental 
positions in Quebec. It does not have the right to do that. It 
does not have the right to make decisions and then tell us: “The 
decision has been made and you are going to have to live with 
it.” That is out of the question, and we will fight it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why Quebec must become a country, because Quebec is 
capable of taking care of its interests. Quebec should have a 
seat at the FTAA. 
What is more, the summit is happening in the very heart of 
Quebec. How very brazen of the federal government to come and do 
this here, and not even show us the documents. It is shameful.

<A HREF="#LINKT153"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not worry, we are used to that in Quebec. We can fight back 
and we will continue to do so. I can guarantee that, if the 
decisions contained in this agreement go against the laws of 
Quebec, things will heat up. The government will have to be much 
more democratic than it is at the present time, it will have to 
sit with all levels of government, it will have to be able to 
negotiate, and these decisions must not be detrimental to the 
environment and the social programs that we have and that we all 
hold dear, both in Canada and in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that what is needed here is clarity; there must be a 
vision of the future and there must also be a lot of democracy. 
That is not the case at present. 
I hope that tonight's debate will be of use to the government, 
that it will listen to all of us, and that the Minister for 
International Trade will use the ideas we will have proposed to 
make a decision and open the door to democracy by tabling his 
documents if they contain nothing that will put anything at 
risk.  Let him put them on the table, let us sit down, let us 
look at them, and let us do this with all the wisdom and 
knowledge we possess. 
<P><A NAME="LINK282"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to take part tonight in this 
take note debate on the impact of the summit of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the purpose of this debate is ultimately to send a 
message to the international trade minister, to give him an idea 
of what this parliament expects from these negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that the reason we are here today is 
that we were given a mandate by the people in November of last 
year. These are the individuals who, regardless of whether they 
are listening to this debate or not, entrust us with defending 
their views regarding certain matters on which each party had 
made its position known, as well as regarding other matters 
which had not necessarily been discussed in detail at the time 
of the elections. The people placed their trust in us and, at 
the end of the day, we must be able to act on this trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the FTAA negotiations are concerned, what people want 
is for us, as parliamentarians, to monitor the negotiations 
effectively, in other words, to know where they are heading, how 
we are progressing toward an agreement, so that we will not be 
hit with something unexpected, as we were in the case of the 
negotiations for the MIA, the multilateral investment agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement collapsed at the last minute because, all of a 
sudden, people realized that it would put states at the service 
of multinationals, rather than ensure the opposite, that is, 
allow states to exercise real control over the circumstances in 
which free trade will take place in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the condition imposed by the men and women who elected 
us so that we would end up with agreements that provide better 
access to markets. That is definitely the case. 
With the North American Free Trade Agreement, we saw proof of 
the advantages of developing free trade.  In my region, for 
example, there are interesting aspects regarding exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, this experience has taught us that we must 
ensure that the framework for the new free trade negotiations 
regarding working conditions and social and environmental 
conditions is well defined.  Otherwise, we risk aggravating the 
situation, creating situations in which we end up making poverty 
worse.  Even if growth increases, we must at the same time 
ensure—it is our duty as members of parliament—that there is 
an adequate distribution of wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give you an example, I say as human resources development critic 
that there was a reform of employment insurance approximately five 
years ago that was lauded by international organizations such as 
the OECD, but we saw the implications in real terms of the Canadian 
government's choosing to go along with international demands. 
There was some kind of tacit understanding that the unemployment 
insurance plans should, for example, pay out an average of 50% 
of the average wage in benefits. Although here in Canada the 
percentage is higher, we passed legislation in order to comply 
with this international demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decisions taken in the FTAA will apply for decades to come. 
Our children will have to live within this framework.  It is 
important that we be able to participate in order that there be 
a truly democratic debate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What you hear everywhere today about people who want to 
demonstrate peacefully, or even more aggressively, is that they 
are determined to hang on to this train to make sure that it 
gets to where the people, collectively, want it to go. They do 
not want to end up with an agreement that will be great for, let 
us say, the multinationals and the big commercial interests but 
that will result in the general public becoming poorer down the 
road. That is the kind of message we want to send to the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that free trade aims at improving commercial dealings 
between countries. In the past, it has been possible, and we have 
examples of this, to carve out exceptions. 
The free trade agreement needs to leave enough room for small 
economies as well as big ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take the case of softwood lumber. Under NAFTA, it became 
apparent that even if there was a free trade agreement in place, 
the more powerful partner, the United States, forced Canada to 
come to an agreement, which is about to expire, that is not in 
the overall interests of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be important to ensure that the upcoming FTAA 
agreement has a defensible balance between the strong and the 
weak? I believe that this is the very principle behind the 
desire to encumber international trade. Yes, we need to 
facilitate international trade and free trade. 
Moreover, even the smallest countries that are 
represented—unfortunately, Quebec will not be there—need to have 
the power to intervene before the decision making bodies that are 
created so that they can obtain rulings based on law and not 
just on economic strength. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want is an agreement that meets the expectations of the 
workers in my riding of Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, who depend on exports for their living. I want the 
employees at the Bombardier plant in La Pocatière to have a 
framework within the FTAA that enables them to work and to sell 
what they make throughout the Americas. 
Hopefully, these workers will not wake up one morning to 
discover that their factory is about to be relocated to a 
country in South America as a cost cutting measure and because 
clear game rules were not established in advance in so far as 
working conditions are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These workers need assurances that the development framework 
will respect their rights as workers. High tech firms must also 
be at ease with this situation. Our farmers, perhaps the group 
that could be placed in the most tenuous situation of all as a 
result of future free trade agreements, need assurances as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean that the discussions in Quebec City will 
result in any real changes. However, groups that have developed 
systems such as, for example, supply management for dairy 
products will be assured of having their say before any system 
changes in fact take place. 
They need to know that their elected representatives can express 
their views and intervene in the debate in a relevant way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I made a reference to softwood lumber. What I said 
holds true for all forestry companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to see an accord that allows the government of 
Quebec the opportunity to continue to intervene whenever it 
feels the need to do so to avoid situations where, once the 
accord has taken effect, the use of certain development tools 
such as the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, 
Investissement Québec, and so forth, would be prohibited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirty years ago, there were sound reasons for wanting Quebec 
sovereignty, specifically a desire to better control Quebec's 
own universe and destiny. 
We felt that we were losing many of our powers because the 
federal government was exercising its rights in areas outside 
its jurisdiction. What is more, it continues to do so, 
regularly. Because of its vast financial power, it also proposes 
programs that are not necessarily in harmony with Quebec 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, when I speak to my children, especially my 17 year old 
daughter, what she wants to be certain of—and the reason why she 
is a sovereignist—is rather that Quebec will have a place in all 
the international agreements that will be concluded in the years 
to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the FTAA is teaching us a valuable lesson. 
We know that countries like Costa Rica and Panama will be 
present at the negotiating table and will make their points of 
view known, while Quebec—land of the only French-speaking people 
in North America, with a culture unique in the Americas—must beg 
in order to have its point of view considered by the government 
of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is a fundamental argument we can use to tell 
Quebecers: “Yes, when you ultimately have to decide whether you 
want a sovereign Quebec in the next few years and in the next 
few decades, whom do you want to speak on behalf of Quebec, 
someone who was elected 75% by people from outside Quebec or 
someone who was elected 100% by Quebecers, people who have 
chosen to live in Quebec?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is obvious, and in the years to come, it will not be 
enough just to have control over domestic issues in Quebec and 
in Canada. 
We need to have some influence over the decisions made at the 
international level, something we do not have during the current 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a sovereignist and an elected representative here in Ottawa, 
I think it is important to express our viewpoint and give 
Quebecers the opportunity to express their opinions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this debate will help the Minister for International 
Trade understand the mandate he is given and I hope that, 
following the various negotiations, he will assure the House 
that he was able to defend our positions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK283"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am quite 
frankly surprised by what my colleague has just said here in 
this House. I have to remind him that the talks currently being 
held do not run counter to what we have. At the present time, we 
are members of the World Trade Organization. The majority of 
countries belong to it. This agreement that the countries of the 
Americas, including Canada, the United States and Mexico, are in 
the process of negotiating, is in keeping with the World Trade 
Organization, in the final analysis. It is not out of line with 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this arrangement will in the end give workers, in Quebec and 
elsewhere, is the opportunity to do even better, to have a better 
quality of life. It has nothing to do with sovereignty. My 
colleague knows that full well. 
In Europe, we now have over 12, 14 or 15 countries with 
different languages, cultures and histories, that are discussing 
not just political union, but also economic union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here in the House of Commons, there is still a small minority, 
in Quebec and in Canada, that continues to talk about the issue 
of sovereignty, even though the majority of Quebecers have 
already said, more than once—two, three and four times—that the 
only things they are interested in are a good quality of life and 
a good justice system, as well as jobs and education for their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have said this several times, but my colleague 
here is talking as though Quebecers had already voted for their 
own country. The answer is no. 
They have already voted no several times.  They want to continue 
to live <I>chez eux</I>, in the place they call home, which is Canada. 
The place they call home is Quebec, it is Ontario, it is North 
America, it is the whole world. We are all members of the same 
family. I am sure that my colleague agrees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he give us his opinion on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to my colleague's 
comment, and it makes me smile.  I will ask him to consider the 
following:  would he agree to the Americans representing him in 
the negotiations for the free trade agreement of the Americas? 
Would that be par for the course for him?  Eighty-five percent of 
our trade is with the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he says that the issue of sovereignty is not important, 
would he in fact be prepared to say “Go ahead, Americans, and 
represent Canadians, you would be capable of doing this for us. 
We will leave you to it”.  I do not think this is the case. 
Canada aspires to having a distinct personality, and Quebec 
aspires to the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that, as far as culture is concerned, we are in a 
unique situation in the Americas. It is the only place in America 
where the majority of people speak French, that has a francophone 
culture in America and that represents an entire people that 
lives a different lifestyle, a distinct society that is not 
Canada, that organizes itself in a particular way.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind him that it is the third election in a row 
Quebecers have sent the federal government a message: we elect a 
majority of sovereignist members to parliament.  This means 
there is a certain unease, a fundamental problem, and when the 
federal government wants to ignore the situation, it only 
confirms that something has to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that Quebecers have refused to become a country 
several times.  I will remind him of the facts.  In 1980, we got 
40% of the vote and in 1995, we got 49% of the vote. 
The lesson we are getting today on the FTAA negotiations 
will probably be the main reason that, next time, we will be 
over 50%.  We will become a country, and we will be able to 
speak for Quebec throughout the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to 
participate in the debate on the summit of the Americas as a 
former chair on the Subcommittee on International Trade, Trade 
Disputes and Investment in the last parliament and also as the 
current Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be splitting my time, Mr. Speaker, with the member for 
Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to use the time I have been allocated, not only to 
speak about the free trade area of the Americas but also to speak 
about the themes of the 2001 summit, the history of the summit, 
and what we hope as a government to accomplish at the summit, 
especially in the area of cultural diversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe that it is very important to stress to the people 
who are listening to us this evening that the summit will not 
just be about the free trade area of the Americas.  In fact the 
ministers of international trade will be meeting in Buenos Aires 
on April 6 and 7 to pursue the negotiations of the FTAA prior to 
the summit.  While economic integration will be on the summit's 
agenda, the summit is much more than a vehicle to promote 
economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From April 20 to April 22, 2001, this will be the third occasion 
on which the presidents and the prime ministers of the 
hemisphere's 34 nations will come together to consider the most 
important issues affecting the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leaders of the hemisphere's 34 democratically elected 
governments met for the first time in December, 1994 in Miami 
with the belief that strong hemispheric partnerships would 
encourage mutual interests which included peace, democracy, 
economic integration and social justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the first summit the leaders released a declaration of 
principles which focused on four major themes: first, preserving 
and strengthening the community of democracy of the Americas; 
second, promoting prosperity through economic integration and 
free trade; third, eradicating poverty and discrimination in our 
hemisphere; and fourth, guaranteeing sustainable development and 
conserving our natural environment for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summit's resulting plan of action contained 23 initiatives 
covering the four theme areas.  Then on April 18 and 19, 1998, 
four years later, the leaders of the 34 countries which had 
participated in Miami met for a second time at the summit of the 
Americas in Santiago, Chile to continue the dialogue and 
strengthen the co-operation that began in 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In preparing for Santiago, Canada identified a number of 
priorities and carefully considered the views expressed by 
Canadians during civil society consultations which took place in 
six Canadian cities in October of 1997.  The human rights and 
democracy theme continue to be a priority for Canada and in the 
summit process.  Our country presented the civic proposals to 
improve key aspects of the administration of justice in the 
Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also pleased to report it was Canada that placed indigenous 
issues on the agenda as a separate item and placed importance on 
ensuring that women and people with disabilities be given 
particular attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada participated actively in all areas of discussion at the 
summit of Americas in Santiago.  Among the issues addressed was 
how to combat the elicit drug trade in the hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this second summit of the Americas, and I stress it was 
only the second summit, the FTAA negotiations were initiated with 
the understanding that they be concluded by the year 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in Santiago, Canada's leadership role in trade 
liberalization was recognized when it was announced that Canada 
would chair negotiations for the FTAA for the first 18 months and 
host the fifth meeting of the hemisphere's trade ministers in 
1999. 
It was and remains Canada's position and belief that the creation 
of the free trade area of the Americas is important to the 
economic prosperity of the hemisphere and, in turn, to the 
consolidation of democracy in the Americas.  At the conclusion of 
the summit in Santiago, Canada was chosen to host the next summit 
of the Americas in 2001.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1998, the hon. Sergio Marchi, the former minister 
for international trade, asked the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade to report to him on positions 
Canada should take in negotiating an agreement that would create 
a free trade area of the Americas.  The minister's request was 
then referred to the Subcommittee on International Trade, Trade 
Disputes and Investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From March to June 1999, the subcommittee structured its 
hearings in a way that would enable it to hear from as many 
Canadians as possible, covering a wide range of public concerns 
from many and diverse perspectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee also held joint meetings of the Standing Committee 
on Foreign Affairs and International Trade when travelling across 
the country in undertaking its study of the WTO in the millennium 
round of negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from hearing from the public at large, the subcommittee 
organized round table meetings of experts to address and debate 
principal stakes of an FTAA for Canada and to comment on key 
issues such as its opportunities and challenges, social and 
economic development of smaller economies of the Americas and the 
preservation of Canadian culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end 48 witnesses appeared before the subcommittee and 35 
briefs and submissions were received.  In addition, of the 394 
witnesses who appeared before the joint meetings of the standing 
committee, many chose to address the question of the free trade 
area of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1999 the subcommittee tabled its report along with 29 
recommendations to assist our trade officials in achieving a 
result that serves Canada's best interests.  The committee also 
specifically stated that it wished to make known that the report 
was not a final report.  It was a first report in what was 
expected to be an ongoing parliamentary review on an FTAA until 
the final deadline for concluding such an agreement in 2005 is 
reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 2000 the current Minister for International Trade 
presented to parliament Canada's priorities and objectives for 
negotiating the free trade areas of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Thursday, officials from the Department of International 
Trade and the Department of Canadian Heritage appeared before the 
Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage to address the issue of 
culture within the framework of the FTAA.   Claude Carrière, 
Canada's chief negotiator for the FTAA, confirmed Canada's 
position that Canada would not make any commitment which would 
limit our cultural objective and cultural policy, while at the 
same time we would work with other countries to develop a new 
international instrument on cultural diversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time Mr. Carrière tabled a proposal for the language on 
cultural diversity in the preamble to the declaration of the FTAA 
which I would like to share with the members here in the House of 
Commons and with Canadians.  The proposed wording is as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing that countries must maintain the ability to preserve, 
develop and implement their cultural policies for the purpose of 
strengthening cultural diversity, given the essential role that 
cultural goods and services play in the identity and diversity of 
society and the lives of individuals. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of a new international instrument on cultural 
diversity was recommended in a report by the cultural industries 
sectoral advisory group on international trade, known as SAGIT, 
in February 1999.  The SAGIT report recommended the new cultural 
instrument on cultural diversity should:  recognize the 
importance of cultural diversity; acknowledge that cultural goods 
and services are basically different from other products; 
acknowledge that domestic measures and policies intended to 
ensure access to a variety of indigenous cultural products are 
significantly different from other policy measures; set out rules 
on the kinds of domestic regulatory and other measures that 
countries cannot use to enhance cultural and linguistic diversity 
and; and establish how trade disciplines would apply or not apply 
to cultural measures that meet the agreed upon rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999, the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage and the 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
both endorsed the SAGIT report.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne in October 1999 the government 
committed to developing a new approach internationally to support 
the diversity of cultural expression in countries around the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 the Minister of Canadian Heritage invited the ministers 
of culture of many countries to attend an international meeting 
to discuss a strategic approach to the pressures of globalization 
on the expression of cultural and national identity.  The end 
result was the launching of the international network for 
cultural policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it was first established there were 19 members.  Today 
there are 45 and even more countries want to join.  Every region 
of the world is represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This international network on cultural policy has strongly 
endorsed the instrument approach and has mandated that the Department 
of Canadian Heritage chair a working group to develop the scope 
and framework of an instrument for the 2001 annual meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summit of the Americas is about much more than just trade. 
We hope this will be an opportunity for the new international 
instrument on cultural diversity to be taken forward.  I would 
also like to remind everyone that there are three themes: 
strengthening democracy, creating prosperity and realizing human 
potential. 
<P><A NAME="LINK285"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was also 
at the heritage meetings the member was at recently where the 
chief negotiator for the FTAA was present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that meeting I asked if he could tell me where the 
interconnection between culture and commerce met, given the fact 
that we now see Nike International, Michael Jordan, Benneton and 
all sorts of multinational corporations involved in what they 
would say are cultural enterprises, and how would they would fit 
into Canadian culture.  The chairman also asked the same 
question.  The negotiator said that he had to beg 
“incompetence” on that question.  That response did not give me 
a very strong feeling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continues to say that culture is not on the table 
and the idea of a stand alone international instrument is one 
that many groups globally support and I support as well.  The 
coalition for cultural diversity supports that.  I want to quote 
one comment about its concerns and I would like the member to 
address these concerns.  It said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—that Canada continue to resist the U.S. pressure that is 
certain to escalate as these negotiations unfold.  What also 
remains is that Canada show proof of extreme vigilance in these 
meetings as the United States undoubtedly attempts to push 
through the adoption of certain general principles that apply to 
all sectors across the board, principles that could seriously 
reduce the ability of the other countries to refuse specific 
trade liberalization commitments in the cultural sector when the 
time comes. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member address that because it is a major fear that I 
and many people in cultural communities across the country feel? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. member is 
committed to preserving cultural diversity in Canada as she knows 
I am as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Thursday when I was returning to my riding I ran into one 
of Canada's foremost actors, R. H. Thomson.  He had recently been 
summoned to a meeting in Ottawa.  There are other groups meeting 
on this issue besides the coalition of diversity which is headed 
by Robert Pilon.  I asked Robert Thomson what was the purpose of 
his trip to Ottawa.  He told me that he was part of a discussion 
on the new cultural instrument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know Robert Thomson's position and I am sure the member knows it as 
well.  He was against the multilateral agreement on investment. 
However, he told me how wonderful it was that the minister was 
bringing together different groups to discuss this new 
instrument.  He assured me that one of the first things we had to 
do as a government, as individuals, as organizations and as 
artists was to bring together all the different countries to 
encompass the whole idea of a new cultural instrument.

<A HREF="#LINKT159"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He felt that we were doing this little by little.  We have gone 
from 19 countries to 45 countries.  Not just governments but NGOs 
as well will be at the meeting and will be talking about cultural 
diversity.  I hope the coalition will be there as well.  We must 
get more people to buy into this idea.  The more countries we can 
convince and bring to our side in understanding how important 
this is, the better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We speak about the United States.  I know that our minister, 
quite frankly, if I may say so, is not afraid of the roar of the 
United States.   One of the great things I always like to use as 
an example is people saying “The United States said we could not 
do it”.  Do members know what the United States said we could 
not do?  The United States said we could not have a convention on 
the anti-personnel landmines because the United States was 
against it.  The United States was against it because it was 
worried about North Korea and said to forget it, that we would 
not get consensus anywhere in the world.  Not only did we get 
consensus to sign the Ottawa convention, but we have also since 
then ratified the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we heard the Minister of Foreign Affairs say today, the 
Ukraine, which was not one of the original signatories, has now 
come together with the Minister of Foreign Affairs to discuss how 
it is going to destroy all the landmines it has there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we should be afraid of the Americans.  Let us 
take heart from what we did with the Ottawa convention and the 
anti-personnel landmines treaty as a way to show that we do not 
need the Americans to make our point known and to have other 
countries come onside and ratify the things that are important to 
all of us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK286"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the summit 
of the Americas to be held next month follows the first summit, 
held in Miami in 1994, and the second, held in Santiago, Chile in 
1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The summit, which is being hosted by the Prime Minister of 
Canada, will bring together the heads of state of 34 
democratically elected governments in the western hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to repeat what the previous speaker mentioned because it 
is important.  The summit will deal with three themes: 
strengthening democracy, including human rights, justice, local 
governments, the illegal drug trade, security and civil society; 
creating prosperity, including the free trade area of the 
Americas, infrastructure, labour, environment and the issue of 
inequalities; and realizing human potential, including education, 
health, gender equality, indigenous peoples, cultural diversity 
and children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I heard that we were going to debate the issue in the 
House, I wanted to try to speak on an area which I felt might be 
downplayed.  It is an area about which I feel very strongly.  It 
is the role that our children play in allowing us to achieve 
stronger democracies, to improve prosperity and to realize human 
potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the leaders coming to the summit of the Americas 
must advance the principles and values that underpin the essence 
of a democracy, such as fairness and equity, respect for human 
rights, caring for those unable to care for themselves, and 
representing the interests of those without a voice, particularly 
the generations of children to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to talk about children and about the need to strengthen 
the family in the context of poverty.  I believe the conditions 
we have in Canada are somewhat reflective of the conditions we 
would find in other countries in the Americas.  The only 
difference is the degree to which those conditions may present 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that poverty is one of the least understood issues in 
the Americas.  Advocacy groups call it child poverty and it tugs 
at the heartstrings of every caring person.  They have invoked 
the images of children starving in the streets and report that 
the problem has increased more than 50% over the last decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who could possibly be against eliminating child poverty?  The 
bold reality is that the poverty in Canada and in the Americas is 
more a matter of social poverty rather than economic poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that in November 1989 parliament passed a resolution to 
seek to achieve the elimination of poverty by the year 2000. That 
actually was our first millennium project.  Over the last 10 
years, it has been the raison d'être for virtually every 
anti-poverty voice in Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT160"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one will dispute the nobility of the gesture, but it was 
hollow and without substance.  I say this because if the root 
causes of poverty were understood, we would come to the 
conclusion that to seek to achieve the elimination of poverty is 
in fact not possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anti-poverty groups are growing in size and influence.  They 
report annually on the growing level of poverty in our country 
and fiercely lobby governments to act.  More jobs, more social 
assistance, more social housing, more tax benefits for families 
with children, more money for health and early childhood 
development, more employment insurance benefits and subsidized 
day care are but a few of the demands of these advocates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They universally accept the low income cutoff known as LICO as 
the measure of poverty, for one simple reason.  It is an economic 
measure which calls for economic solutions.  If they had to 
address the root causes of poverty, it would open up a Pandora's 
box which I believe most fear to face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Homelessness has also become one of the latest focuses for the 
poverty groups.  As an example, in January 1999 a task force 
headed up by Anne Golden issued a report on homelessness in the 
city of Toronto.  Declaring that there were workable solutions, 
the task force engaged all levels of government to step up to 
their responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if hon. members look very closely at the conclusions of 
the report they will find some interesting statistics.  Of the 
homeless identified, 35% suffered from mental illness, 15% were 
aboriginals off reserve, 10% were abused women and, 
significantly, 28% were youths who had been alienated from their 
families, of which 70% had experienced physical or sexual abuse. 
In addition, they found that 47% of the homeless in Toronto did 
not even come from Toronto.  In fact they have been migrating to 
urban centres from all across Canada.  Sadly people who live in 
squalor on the streets of our country represent those who no one 
loves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lone parents now represent about 15% of all families in Canada 
but, sadly, account for about 54% of all children or families 
living in poverty.  The rate of family breakdown is almost 50% 
when we include the breakdown of common law relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The incidence of domestic violence continues at record levels. 
Alcohol and drug abuse in our schools and our communities has 
escalated with tragic consequences.  Unwanted teen pregnancies 
continue to rise.  Close to 30% of students are dropping out of 
our high schools and are becoming Canada's poor in waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada and Health Canada have concluded that 25% of 
children in Canada are entering adult life with significant 
mental, social or behavioural problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These represent the social poverty of our society and they are 
the root causes of the vast majority of the economic poverty in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If poverty in Canada is a horror and a national disgrace, then 
the breakdown of the family is the principal cause of that 
disgrace.  Those who express outrage at poverty but who do not 
express the same outrage at the breakdown of the family are truly 
in denial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in these days of political correctness, the family and 
its structure and condition represent a minefield through which 
few are prepared to tread.  Anti-poverty groups have meekly 
sidestepped the social poverty dimension.  However, if we are not 
prepared to address social poverty in our country, then we 
effectively choose to tolerate— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I hesitate to interrupt the hon. member and am listening 
with rapt attention to his speech, but I wonder if he might in 
some way relate it to the subject of the FTAA, which is currently 
being debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am sure the hon. member realizes the 
importance of relevance and will of course make his remarks 
entirely relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is nothing more 
relevant to strengthening our democracies, to improving 
prosperity, which involves trade, and to realizing human 
potential than the health and well-being of children.  It is a 
precondition and that is the relevance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude.  I believe that if we could raise one healthy, 
well adjusted generation of children, poverty as we know it 
throughout the Americas would be a condition of the past. 
In that context, I mean that it should be physical, mental and 
social health that we are looking at for our children.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It also contemplates that our social, moral and family values 
and those of our families, educators and legislators promote, 
protect and defend those values.  Our children are a function of 
the society in which they live.  Those who become our future poor 
do so because of our failure to put their interests ahead of our 
own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Collectively we are responsible for the poverty that exists in 
Canada today and it is therefore our collective responsibility to 
resolve both its social and its economic causes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I quote from Dr. Paul Steinhauer of Voices for 
Children, in a perfect point of relevance, particularly with 
regard to the FTAA.  He stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With one in four children entering adult life significantly 
handicapped, we can look forward to a society that will be less 
able to generate the economic base required to supply the social 
supports and services needed by one in four adults unable to 
carry their own weight. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context, investing in children, particularly in the 
early years, is an imperative, not an option.  My humble message 
for the leaders of the democracies, the 34 countries coming to 
meet at the summit of the Americas, is to put the interests of 
our children ahead of all other interests because I truly believe 
that it is a precondition to strengthening our democracies, to 
achieving greater prosperity and to realizing human potential.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the member for his comments about child poverty and 
ask him a question on the idea of strengthening democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week a Quebec man went into a Quebec superior court to ask 
if his constitutional right to peaceful assembly is going to be 
denied by police security in Quebec City at the summit of the 
Americas.  His question is a very good one.  The police will be 
sealing off the heart of Quebec City for the summit, with a 3.8 
kilometre security perimeter.  Mr. Tremblay is a solid citizen. 
He is a 41 year old Montreal bankruptcy lawyer and he believes, 
as he says, that “I am no protester but I know that why this 
country of ours is so beautiful is because of its democracy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He wants to argue that the essence of democracy depends upon the 
free market of ideas.  He will argue that his right of entrance 
to the marketplace is being excessively limited by the distance 
police are keeping him from the venue where the 34 western 
hemisphere heads of government will be meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member feel that Canadians' right to democracy 
will be compromised by the 3.8 kilometre security perimeter and 
that their rights to open debate are being compromised and 
jeopardized? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has pretty 
well answered her own question because she referred to 
constitutional rights to legal assembly.  It is a constitutional 
right and it will be protected and defended by the laws of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member referred to security issues with regard to the 
fencing and other security measures.  It is about protection of 
large delegations of visitors to our country.  We have the 
statistics. A great many people are going to be there and their 
protection is extremely important.  It is a serious 
responsibility for Canada as the host of the summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that the member should ever suggest that 
somehow in Canada the views of Canadians from coast to coast to 
coast can be stifled by a fence.  Our words, actions and beliefs 
and our accessibility, freedom and democracy in Canada allow all 
Canadians to express themselves in whatever ways they wish. 
<P><A NAME="LINK288"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I too want to thank the hon. member for his comments with respect 
to the issue of child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, to bring this debate back to the question of the 
upcoming summit of the Americas and in particular the proposed 
free trade of the Americas agreement, I wonder if the hon. member 
is aware of the fact that the hemisphere which is the site of the 
FTAA in fact has the most unequal distribution of wealth on the 
entire planet.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing whatsoever in the proposed FTAA that would in 
any way reduce the gap between rich and poor.   On January 1, 
1994, the date that NAFTA came into force, the indigenous people 
of Chiapas rose up because of their concern that this would lead 
to greater poverty as they were pushed off their subsistence 
farming lands so that cash export crops could be grown by giant 
corporate agribusinesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know as well that as a result of social dumping the number of 
Canadian families who are unemployed, who are now eligible for 
employment insurance, has risen dramatically.  It is now about 
35%, which means more children living in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member how he can defend a proposed 
agreement, the FTAA, that would lead to greater poverty and even 
more attacks on families throughout the hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, globalization undoubtedly is 
a fear.  To some it represents fear of the unknown.  The member 
is quite right when he says that we have examples of where 
globalization efforts can lead and have led for adverse consequences 
for a broad spectrum of humankind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the challenges of the leaders at the summit of the 
Americas is to not be in denial of the realities that we have 
seen.  However, the member asked if this would help us.  It is 
the position of the Government of Canada, and from the last two 
summits, that the leaders collectively have agreed that these 
summits and the FTAA will provide us in part, along with other 
initiatives, the tools we need to deal with some of the 
conditions that the member just mentioned. 
<P><A NAME="LINK289"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is good to get up and debate this important issue. I 
will start by going over a little bit of how we got to this 
point, what this free trade area of the Americas and the summit 
of the Americas is proposing to do in Quebec City in April.  If I 
have time, I would like to finish off with some of the local 
issues that I am concerned about that will be coming up, or 
already have, in this negotiation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of a free trade area of the Americas started in 1990 
with George Bush, the then president of the United States.  At 
that time it was enterprised from the Americas initiative.  It 
came on the heels of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and in 
the beginning of the negotiations for what would become the North 
American Free Trade Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequently the idea was revived as a free trade of the 
Americas at the first modern day summit of the Americas held in 
Miami in 1994.  Like the upcoming summit, the heads of state and 
government of 34 countries of the western hemisphere discussed 
the advancement of economic prosperity, democracy and security of 
the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the summit in 1994, all countries agreed to conclude an FTAA 
by 2005.  This was a very ambitious schedule but it was one they 
agreed to try to work toward.  Canada and Chile, the most 
enthusiastic supporters of the FTAA, later proposed that it be 
moved up to 2003, but there are some concerns that this deadline 
will not be reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now speak on the relationship to the summit of the 
Americas.  The FTAA is only one of the items, albeit an important 
one,  that will be on the agenda at the summit of the Americas in 
Quebec City.  The summit is organized through the Organization of 
American States.  It was originally guided by four principles: 
first, preserve and strengthen the community of democracies of 
the Americas; second, promote prosperity through economic 
integration of free trade; third, eradicate poverty and 
discrimination in our hemisphere; and fourth, guarantee 
sustainable development and conserve our natural environment for 
future generations.  I would suggest that those are four worthy 
goals to reach in any agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Quebec City summit, issues have been divided into three 
interconnected baskets.  They have described them as 
strengthening democracy, creating prosperity and realizing human 
potential. 
It is the potential of the FTAA that has gained the most 
attention both from people who support it and those who do not.

<A HREF="#LINKT163"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak about the economic background.  How big is 
the free trade area of the Americas that we are talking about? It 
would cover 800 million people in the western hemisphere.  We 
have slightly less than 15% of the total world's population, but 
we produce 35% of the world's measured economic activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The combined gross domestic product of all the countries is $11 
trillion U.S.  The Americas is by far the largest and most 
productive economic region of the world.  It surpasses even the 
European Union, which is the second leading region, by $3 
trillion U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's main trading partner is the United States which takes 
over 86% of our exports.  The countries with which Canada has a 
free trade agreement, the United States, Mexico and Chile, 
account for 97% of our hemispheric trade.  Even without the FTAA, 
a full 94% of goods from FTAA countries already enter Canada duty 
free.  It is no big change for Canada because we are almost 
already there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are some of the potential benefits?  Canada's economy is 
highly trade dependent with about one in three jobs depending 
directly on trade.  About 80% of jobs created since 1993 have 
come from trade.  The reasons for all free trade agreements is to 
increase the size of our economic pie and to improve our 
prosperity and well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian priorities in the FTAA are threefold: zero tariff rates 
with our trading partners, the removal of wasteful custom 
procedures as barriers to trade, and strong investment protection 
measures through the Americas region.  In my riding there is a 
big port into the U.S.  To streamline the procedures to 
allow the trade to flow back and forth more freely is something 
the people who use it on a regular basis would really like to 
see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A successful FTAA should not have a large structural impact on 
Canada's economy because we are almost already there.  Canada is 
already a relatively open market.  Some 94% of goods from FTAA 
countries already enter Canada duty free.  The big adjustment for 
Canada came with the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement which 
currently covers 86% of our exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important benefit of an FTAA for Canada is to open and secure 
market access for Canadian exporters through the elimination of 
tariffs.  Some sectors face significant tariffs on paper products, 
technology products, auto parts and potash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a recent committee meeting on international trade one witness 
representing the Alliance of Manufacturers and Exporters of 
Canada said that 79% of its members favour this issue and only 6% 
see the FTAA as a threat to their businesses.  These are the 
people who are in business and who are working to improve markets 
and market share for their products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary earlier this evening indicated that 
the government would be listening to all the comments brought 
forward tonight by all parties.  He also indicated that the 
government would be taking heed of some of the issues and would 
look into them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One that I want to raise and I have raised before is the issue 
regarding sugar refining.  I am speaking of raw sugar 
imports, exports and refined sugar.  My riding has the only 
sugar beets grown in Canada.  They are refined in the neighbouring 
constituency in Taber.  A deal has been partially struck with 
Costa Rica and the concern is that the deal will be used as a 
pattern to extend it to other Latin American countries that have 
large sugar producing capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tariff in Costa Rica on refined sugar is 50% whereas 
Canada's is 8%.  The idea is to reduce both those tariffs to zero 
but over the same period of time.  If both tariffs are reduced to 
zero within a year of each other, it will place our producers and 
our refiners at a definite disadvantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something the government needs to be aware of.  If it 
does offer up sugar, the government should deal with it as an 
individual commodity and not trade it off against other issues as 
has been done in the past, because there is potential for growth 
in this industry in Canada.  If we handled this trade situation 
properly, particularly through the FTAA, then we will have 
potential to solidify the industry and maybe even grow it to some 
degree.

<A HREF="#LINKT164"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the issues that have been talked about earlier have to 
do with the site and what is happening in Quebec City to prepare 
for the summit.  I support the issue that the laws must be obeyed 
but people's right to be heard or the right to have peaceful 
demonstrations should not be interfered with.  The full force of 
the law needs to be brought to bear should anybody step over that 
line and get out of hand because this is an important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is far more to be gained by being in on the discussions 
than being outside the room causing a disturbance. If people are 
serious about wanting change and having input, they should take 
part in the discussions.  I am hopeful it will all go off without 
too much trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreign subsidies which distort production, as we have seen in 
our grain and oilseed sector, are something that we need to be 
aware of.  Such things do exist.  If the trade agreements can 
reduce those subsidies to get everybody on a level playing field 
we would be far better off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that is very important is water.  We want to make 
sure that Canada retains sovereignty over its water.  I want the 
government to hear that.  We have to make sure that absolute 
control of that precious resource is maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day one witness in committee said that a free trade 
agreement would bring absolute free and fair trade on all 
commodities.  Then we would have 3,000 pages of exemptions.  I am 
hopeful that this agreement will not go that way and that we will 
be able to come to a solid agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support free trade and the process that it is going through. 
However we would like to see any agreement that is reached come 
back to the House for debate, for Canadians to have a look at and 
for parliament to ultimately have a say in. 
<P><A NAME="LINK290"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak to 
the free trade area of the Americas.  Canada has an absolutely 
unique opportunity next month to deal with a number of challenges 
to our hemisphere.  Being the host, we have the opportunity to 
introduce and put forth creative solutions to deal with a number 
of the challenges.  I will get to them a little later on in my 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why pursue the free trade agreement?  It is because free trade 
is good for everybody if it is fair trade.  The challenge of this 
meeting is to ensure and convince the Canadian public, and indeed 
people throughout our hemisphere, that we are pursuing a fair and 
transparent free trade agreement: one that considers all parties 
and one that is prepared to work with members from across society 
so that we will have a trade agreement that will benefit 
absolutely everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about a couple of the challenges in our 
hemisphere.  One of those is the issue of illicit drugs and the 
war on drugs.  President Vicente Fox recently said that the war 
on drugs had been lost.  We are losing it across our hemisphere 
and the countries that are really paying a price are those that 
are producing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of Colombia, Andres Pastrana, whom I met with last 
month, as well as the heads of state of Mexico, Uruguay and many 
others, is giving the same message: the war on drugs hurts 
everyone, but it hurts them more, not only the drugs but the ways 
to combat them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must decrease consumption if we are to deal with the war.  We 
must look at our own homes if we are to deal with the problem. 
We could try to do what we have done before when we took the war 
to Colombia, buttressed up the armaments, supported the army, 
built up the forces and tried to cut the head off the cartels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did that successfully but all that happened was like a hydra: 
they came up in other areas.  That is indeed what is happening 
now in Colombia where 140,000 hectares of land has been 
destroyed.  FARC guerrillas, the ELN, the paramilitary and other 
drugs lords have come into the picture to produce these drugs. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT165"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are producing them cheaper and better, such as heroin which 
costs $2 a gram.  The war on drugs is being lost.  It is almost 
universally accepted that we are not going to win it unless we 
decrease consumption at home.  For the first time the Americans 
have admitted to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we do that?  First, we have to decrease consumption by 
dealing with new European models that focus not only on detox and 
treatment but also use new medical models in ensuring that people 
who are drug addicted develop skills training, have jobs and live 
in a secure environment away from their drug environments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking personally from my professional experience, we cannot 
get people off drugs if they are living in an environment where 
drugs are abundant.  We have to take them out of that.  We have 
to give them the skills training so they will be employable in 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we have to talk about prevention.  The headstart program 
that was passed in the House in 1998 deals with children in the 
first six to eight years of life to ensure they live in a secure 
environment and strengthens the parent-child bond.  It has been 
proven to decrease consumption and drug use later on in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the trade issue, we have to remove both tariff and non-tariff 
barriers to trade as well as double taxation regimes.  One of the 
things that Kofi Annan, the secretary general of the UN, has 
said, as well as countries in South and Central America where the 
drugs are being produced, is that these poor people who are 
forced to produce the drugs need something else to grow if we are 
going to remove the poppies and the coca.  The only way to do 
that is to give them a chance to compete with other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House may be interested to know that the major obstacle to 
removing tariff barriers to enable the poor and developing 
countries to progress is the west.  We are the ones who obstruct 
the ability of these developing countries to get their houses in 
order and improve their economies.  In short, these countries do 
not need aid, they primarily need trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the judicial issue, we need to implement RICO amendments 
as they have done in the United States.  Seventy-five per cent of 
revenues from organized bike gangs come from drugs.  The way to 
hit them is to go after the money by implementing the RICO 
amendments.  If the government does that, we will be able to hit 
them where it counts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need heavier and stronger penalties for those individuals who 
are trafficking in drugs, but we need to treat the users from a 
medical model.  We need to hit the producers and the organized 
crime gangs hard, use the RICO amendments and chase after the 
money.  Then we will go a long way toward addressing the 
organized crime epidemic that the Canadian Police Association 
said we are losing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to deal with import and export controls over 
chemicals used in the precursors for drugs.  We were nailed by 
the United Nations, as were other western countries, for allowing 
chemicals used in the development of illicit drugs to be freely 
sent in amounts far in excess of what these countries could 
possibly use.  We are allowing that and we turn a blind eye.  We 
pretend we are lily white but we are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Import and export controls over the chemicals used in the 
production and removal of coca paste, cocaine and the production 
of other illicit drugs would prevent these companies and 
countries from using them illegally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third issue is environmental protection.  Acid raid, air 
pollution and water pollution know no boundaries.  We have to 
take a collective view and collective action against these 
challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding environmental security, in 1998 hurricane Mitch 
devastated Central America.  There were 19,000 people killed and 
there was $5 billion in damage.  The world has been unable to 
deal with the humanitarian and natural disasters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I propose is to build a rapid response centre somewhere, 
preferably in the Central America region.  The centre would have 
non-perishable food, tenting, blankets and heavy lift 
capabilities as well as DART response teams and medical teams. 
They could be rapidly accessed using a rapid response model and 
brought to an area where there is a natural disaster.  Time is of 
the essence in these disasters.  If we constructed one of these 
areas somewhere in the Central American region, we would be able 
to save a lot of lives and a lot of money when these natural 
disasters occur.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of human security, in issues of conflict the 
international community has been absolutely unable to deal with 
conflict in a preventive way.  In order to do this it requires a 
multilateral effort.  I suggest using the international financial 
institutions, particularly the World Bank and the IMF as well as 
the Inter-American Development Bank, to press economic levers to 
the precursors of conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is cutting edge foreign policy.  I believe our country, and 
indeed the House, could take a leadership role on this issue.  If 
we present this policy on the floor of the free trade of the 
Americas at the end of April in Quebec City, we will start the 
ball rolling.  We will be able to address conflict before it 
happens, instead of expensively trying to patch up the problems 
after the fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my colleague from the NDP I would say this.  The member's 
efforts to try to destroy and obstruct the meeting are nothing but 
destructive.  The member should use the ideas and questions which 
are very legitimate and for which all people want answers. The 
member's efforts should be put toward building constructive 
solutions to address them.  The member should talk about 
transparency and work with us to make sure that all agreements be 
brought to the House to be debated on the floor before they are 
passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of trade liberalization make sure it is fair trade, 
not only free trade.  On the issue of transparency let us work 
towards that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of globalization is a way for all of us to work on 
good labour and environmental laws.  Collectively we can work 
together to elevate the standard of living for all people. Surely 
the NDP and others will listen to the secretary general of the 
U.N. who said that developing countries and the poorest of the 
poor need free and fair trade.

member believe this is true? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is an excellent 
question and it is often asked by the NDP and other members. That 
is why the free trade area of the agreement is going to be 
pursued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to develop a rules base to improve the horrible 
situation in the maquiladoras in Mexico, where there are no 
labour or environmental standards whatsoever.  We have the 
opportunity today and will have it in April to develop a rules 
based system to ensure that we have fair labour standards. 
Workers in the maquiladoras will then be able to say that the 
company must adhere to the standards because it was signed in the 
free trade agreement of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have good environmental standards so that mines will not 
be able to dump tailings and poison the rivers in South America 
and Central America.  We will have standards of democracy and 
human rights that will be respected across this hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the agreement is about.  This is what the challenge 
is about.  I am sure members from the NDP would like to ask 
questions along the same line.  I hope they put their efforts 
into working toward solutions to these challenges.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to ask the hon. member a question about his comments on 
Colombia to try to determine what the position of the Canadian 
Alliance is with respect to one of the most serious issues and 
concerns that has been raised.  That is the quite misguided 
proposal called Plan Colombia, in particular the military 
component of that plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca was in Colombia 
last month.  I myself was in Colombia in January and had the 
opportunity to meet with elected representatives, senators, 
members of the house of representatives, as well as many human 
rights defenders and others. 
The very strong message that I received from them was strong 
opposition to the military component of Plan Colombia.  They 
pleaded that instead there be a recognition that it is social and 
economic concerns that must be addressed and in particular land 
reform. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2355"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT167"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the position of the Canadian Alliance?  Is it like the 
Liberal government, which refuses to condemn the military 
component of Plan Colombia, or is it prepared to very clearly 
speak out in opposition to the military component of that plan 
and call for an approach that recognizes the importance of 
tackling poverty, land reform and dealing with the massive human 
rights violations in Colombia? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is correct 
that Colombia needs land reform.  It needs a better economy.  It 
needs to address the human rights abuses.  Plan Colombia 
deals with two aspects; a military component and a social 
development component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unfortunate thing in the real politik of Colombia is that 
the vast majority of the land area is controlled by guerrillas 
from the FARC and the ELN as well as paramilitaries and drug lords. 
Part of the problem is that, with the lack of control the 
government has from a military perspective, these guerrillas, 
paramilitaries, narcoterrorists and cartels are allowed to 
massacre civilian populations in the surrounding area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the Bogota government in Colombia does not have the 
military capability to do that.  My personal view, not that of 
the Alliance, is to support Plan Colombia, including the military 
component, for the simple reason that the military component has 
to get control over the country.  It has to defeat the 
paramilitaries that are basically thugs with weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that national verifiers go along with the 
Colombian army to ensure that it is not engaging in human rights 
abuses and in collusion with the paramilitaries.  They are doing 
that in some areas, which is completely unacceptable.  If we 
verify this and allow the Colombian government to get control 
over its area in a multifactorial approach with other trade 
issues, then we will be able to ensure that Colombia secures 
peace.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa—Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am splitting my time with the member for Oak Ridges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by thanking the Minister for International Trade, 
who, it will be recalled, in response to a question I asked of 
him in the House during question period some time ago, agreed, on 
behalf of the government, to hold a take note debate, the debate 
we are having tonight, on the question of the free trade zone 
of the Americas, before the Quebec summit takes place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to see that, even at midnight, there are still 
a number of members who wish to take the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not an expert in international trade.  I am not a lawyer, 
and I have not had a chance to really explore the international 
trade aspect. Like all of us here, I have had several 
constituents speak to me and, in some cases, voice concerns and 
encouraging words. I agreed to share these comments with the 
House.  That is why I am here tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of people who spoke to me or wrote to me seemed to be 
concerned about the preponderant, or at least growing, role of 
the private sector in international trade.  They would like to 
see the introduction of mechanisms to balance what some perceive 
to be a growing influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I base myself on our Canadian economy, which is essentially a 
capitalist regime in which we encourage the creation of wealth, 
but a system that still has strong socialist leanings, which 
taxes this wealth and has established a mechanism to 
redistribute it, we end up with a country that is nonetheless 
very interesting and very welcoming and which, all told, is a 
model from several points of view. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2400"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT168"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if we compare ourselves to our neighbours to the 
south, we see that income polarization is not increasing in 
Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the income gap in Canada, after taking into account 
redistribution, such as social programs and so on, has not grown, 
whereas in the United States it has.  On the wealth side, 
unfortunately, we will have to do something because we have not 
measured that since 1984.  Statistics Canada measured it recently 
and we had a report a couple of weeks ago showing that the wealth 
gap, as opposed to the income gap, is increasing.  I think it 
behooves us all to find ways to make sure that gap does not widen 
but becomes narrower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we take our approach on social programs, human 
rights and environmental standards, there is room for improvement 
in many of those fields, but as a rule we are doing very well by 
international comparison.  If we take this and move it onto the 
international scene it would perhaps be Canada's greatest 
contribution. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to state my position on this international issue. I am 
one of those who believe in free trade. I think that history has 
shown that more wealth is created wherever there is free trade. 
If sovereign countries can then find ways to share this 
wealth, their people will end up better off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am basically in favour of free trade. However, Canada's 
position embraces other elements in addition to free trade; it 
includes considerations such as human rights, democratic 
principles and environmental standards. I am delighted to see 
that the holding of this summit in Canada is giving rise to 
these debates and that our government is encouraging them, 
because they will be feeding into the summit itself. 
In this sense, I believe that the trend is an encouraging one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We receive reams of documentation from all kinds of places. Last 
week, I was sent a little folder from the Export Development 
Corporation. I would like to quote a passage from it, from a 
letter from the president and CEO. These are words that we would 
perhaps not have found in this type of literature a few years 
ago. It reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, EDC operates as a successful business and an 
integral part of society. As such, we are working alongside 
other leading businesses that are increasingly committed to 
socially responsible corporate practices. 
These practices include policies and measures aimed at 
establishing a business code of ethics, making improvements at 
the social and environmental levels, public accountability and 
community participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, it is becoming increasingly obvious that, by adopting 
these socially responsible corporate practices, corporations are 
achieving reciprocal successes for themselves and for their 
communities. 
According to a recent study, the Dow Jones Sustainability Group 
Index surpassed the Dow Jones Global Index by 15% between 1994 
and 1999. In other words, it pays to do good. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that this type of comment would have been found 
in the literature of the Export Development Corporation some ten 
years ago. This is encouraging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote another statement, which appeared in the 
lead editorial in <I>La Presse</I> yesterday. I am citing the paragraph 
at the end of Mario Roy's editorial: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a matter of seeing nothing but the good in people, 
and believing that it is possible to change overnight a problem 
of civilization that has persisted for centuries. Nonetheless, 
the opportunity is there. Elected officials, whose mandate in 
their respective countries is not only economic but also 
political and social, will be sitting at the Summit of the 
Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, which, as has been said, very much enjoys giving 
lessons, can certainly take advantage of its role as host to 
place the question of human rights at the heart of this round of 
negotiations, which will continue until 2005.  We can do it in 
such a way that it cannot be ignored, so that it is clearly 
understood that a free trade agreement will be inconceivable 
unless a certain level of normality is achieved in the countries 
that are the most negligent with respect to rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a strict obligation for Canada's political elite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And there is no doubt that in the public mind the Summit in general, 
and Canada's performance in particular, will be judged from this 
point of view, as much as from the point of view of the advances 
that will be made with respect to trade.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we see reflected here in this newspaper, which is after 
all well regarded, the desire to emphasize these values. That is 
why I am encouraged by this evening's debate on the summit of 
the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening, as MPs, we have an opportunity to take a hand in 
the phenomenon of globalization, to be part of this trend, which 
one day may be reversed, but which nonetheless is currently very 
strong. 
Most countries in the world are moving toward free trade 
agreements, whether bilateral or multilateral in nature. The 
trend is toward the creation of free trade zones. This reflects 
clearly the will to create much greater wealth and it is on this 
front that we have a role to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, it will become very important in the years ahead to 
create new mechanisms for sharing wealth on a global scale. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have created a means of encouraging free trade.  It behooves 
all of us as parliamentarians and as people who have the public 
good at heart, to bring forward ideas and create mechanisms that 
will allow us to share some of the wealth among nations that 
international trade and free trade helps to create. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand this is an extremely complex situation but the 
complexity of a problem does not negate the necessity to address 
it.  The one wish I would like to leave with the government, as 
it is taking note tonight, is that we must put in gear efforts 
and thinking to create such mechanisms so that the living 
standards for citizens around the world will be improved. 
<P><A NAME="LINK294"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
could the hon. member perhaps share his views with the House with 
respect to the importance of ensuring environmental standards 
within the framework of trade agreements? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall that at the first summit of the Americas in Miami in 
1994 one of the commitments made was to strengthen the protection 
of biodiversity within the hemisphere.  That was seven years ago 
and I am not aware of any steps that have been taken within the 
context of the summit of the Americas, free trade of the Americas 
negotiations or anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member indicate to us what there is within the 
context of the current negotiations on the FTAA that would in any 
way strengthen the protection of the environment throughout the 
hemisphere, an objective which I know he shares? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will try to pick up 
on the question asked by the member for Yukon and try to address 
both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were able to reach an agreement on environmental 
standards, that might mean that a country such as ours and all of 
the countries participating in such an agreement would have to 
give up some of their sovereignty.  As people live as neighbours 
in a society they give up some of their sovereignty by virtue of 
having to respect their neighbours and the environment they live 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot predict, nor would I pretend to be able to predict, the 
outcome of negotiations and how environmental considerations 
might be included in any FTAA.  I would hope that we could arrive 
at that, just as I would hope that we would cover in any 
international agreement, matters of cultural diversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that biodiversity is as important as cultural 
diversity. My  colleague for Parkdale—High Park addressed that 
issue earlier this evening and I share her views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the hon. member that is not to say that things are 
perfect.  I would hope that he would keep at it and try to 
improve it as he has over the years.  I applaud him for that.  As 
we do so collectively, things will improve.  Unfortunately, 
reality being what it is, we take too long to get where we want 
to be but we will not get there by giving up.

we have to increase our efforts to make it happen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK295"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, before I 
ask my question, last week when we went past midnight there was a 
motion proposed and passed unanimously that we would let most of 
the pages leave.  I would ask for unanimous consent that those 
who need to leave be allowed to do so. 
My question has been partly answered but I will pose it in case 
the hon. member would like to add anything. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my constituents believes that a free trade agreement of 
the Americas would affect our sovereignty and the ability of 
governments to maintain our social and environmental standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this true? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, what I was saying earlier is 
that when people agree to live in a community, in the same 
village, on the same street, or in the same city, they have to 
agree to limit their own rights to make room for their 
neighbours' rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to live in society, we have to agree that our rights 
are fundamentally, basically and necessarily limited.  I think 
it is the same thing for countries that by mutual consent enter 
into international agreements on behaviour, free trade, respect 
for the environment and certain environmental standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a country wants to promote respect for the environment and it 
does so by becoming a signatory to international agreements, it 
is very likely that it will give up some portion of its 
sovereignty for the international common good. 
The same holds true for the members of the United Nations.  We 
agree to be a member of a group like the United Nations; we 
accept its rules, we agree to submit to them.  By doing so, we 
essentially limit our own sovereignty, but we do so for the 
common good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though my time has expired, I hope this was helpful to my 
colleague from the Yukon. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Before we go any 
further, I am advised by the table that there was an agreement 
among the House leaders that no unanimous consent would be passed 
during the whole length of the debate.  Therefore I have to deny 
the hon. member's request. 
<P><A NAME="LINK296"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to talk, in particular, to the service sector, but I will first 
highlight the fact that issues regarding trade and democracy are 
critical in this discussion and Canada's national interest must 
be the overwhelming issue for Canadians.  Whether the issue is 
health care, the environment or culture, we must protect it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are potentials in terms of the free trade agreement of the 
Americas.  However, we must move, in my view, slowly and 
cautiously, keeping in mind that issues are being raised and 
being raised in a very thoughtful and lucid manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americas is one of the most dynamic regions in the world. 
There are 800 million people, not even one-sixth of the world's 
population, and they account for more than one-third of the 
world's economic activity.  The combined gross domestic products 
of the Americas, about $17 trillion, is greater than that of the 
European Union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leaders of the western hemisphere believed that the Americas 
had tremendous potential and that the countries of the Americas 
could work more effectively, particularly in areas to promote 
democracy, development and growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen great changes in the Americas over the last 10 or 
15 years in terms of democratic growth in the hemispheres.  We 
have moved from military juntas to fledgling democracies, which 
Canada has a very important role to help promote and protect. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2415"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT172"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT172"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2415

<A HREF="#LINKT171"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leaders also committed to strengthening not only democracy 
but greater prosperity.  They also committed themselves to 
practical measures to improve such things as health care, to 
increase access to quality education and to protection of 
biodiversity, to collective action against the scourge of drugs 
and corruption, to expanding the deepening dialogue with civil 
society and regional priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity a few weeks ago to participate in a forum 
of parliamentarians from the Americas which was held here in this 
very Chamber.  Issues such as democracy, drugs and trade were 
discussed.  It is very important to bring parliamentarians from 
this hemisphere together to talk about these key issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the second summit, held in Santiago in 1998, issues were 
talked about and moved forward.  Once again leaders endorsed 
action to support the development of democratic institutions, to 
protect human rights, to enhance transparency and to respect the 
rule of law.  I believe these are critical issues for all 
Canadians.  The leaders gave specific instructions to begin the 
process of negotiating the free trade agreement of the Americas. 
If the free trade agreement of the Americas is eventually signed, 
it will create the largest free trade area in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the summit of the Americas process may offer numerous 
opportunities to further enhance Canadian openness to the western 
hemisphere.  The FTAA is one of the most tangible opportunities 
on the economic front.  It certainly does have potential for 
enhanced market access for Canadian exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one sector where new access could lead to 
significant benefits for Canada, and particularly for Canadian 
business, it is obviously the service sector.  This is a key 
sector.  It is the engine of the Canadian economy.  It is 
responsible for more than two-thirds of Canada's gross domestic 
product, almost three-quarters of employment with 10.5 million 
jobs, and nearly 90% of new job creation in the country.  It is 
leading the transformation of the Canadian economy into a 
knowledge based economy.  Many employees in the service sector 
are highly educated and enjoy earnings well above average. 
Services are the heart of Canada's innovative society.  For 
example, telecommunications, financial services and technical 
business services are among the most innovative industries in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a trading nation and it counts on its service exports 
to strengthen its prosperity.  Not counting Canada's direct 
investments abroad in the service companies, Canada is the 12th 
largest exporter of services in the world, exporting $51.8 
billion worth of services in 1998 alone.  Canadian companies such 
as SNC-Lavalin, Teleglobe, Enbridge and Hydro-Québec are among 
the world leaders in their fields and their expertise is sought 
across the hemisphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Though service exports account for only 12% of Canadian exports, 
Canadian trade in services is increasing at a much faster pace 
than our trade in goods.  Given the importance of trade in our 
economy, we can say without fear or exaggeration that improving 
market access abroad for our services provides an opportunity for 
sustaining our prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument for supporting Canada's service exports is 
particularly strong when it comes to the Americas.  In Canada's 
commercial services, exports to FTAA countries, excluding the 
United States and Mexico, were worth about $1.9 billion in 1998 
and $787 million in 1993.  Clearly this is a growing market, with 
an annual rate of approximately 19% growth during that period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Countries such as Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Venezuela, 
Colombia and Brazil are all existing or potential export markets 
for Canadian service providers.  There are three sectors of 
particular note:  telecommunications, financial services and 
engineering services.  Many of these are in my own community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian telecommunications sector is enjoying tremendous 
success, exporting services valued at over $2 billion a year and 
employing over 104,000 people.  As a consequence, since 1993 the 
sector has been growing by an average of 9%.

<A HREF="#LINKT172"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, Canadian exports of telecommunications services face 
market access and regulatory restrictions in some countries in 
this hemisphere, in part due to the presence of 
telecommunications monopolies and, in addition, a lack of 
transparency, predictability and timeliness in the process of 
awarding operating permits and licences or prohibitive fees for 
licensing or interconnection.  Reducing such barriers would 
significantly increase export opportunities for Canadian 
telecommunications companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years Canadian financial institutions have been very 
active in Central and Latin America.  One leading example is 
Scotiabank, which is active in Argentina and in Chile, where its 
subsidiary is the seventh largest bank in that country, as well 
as in Brazil, Costa Rica, Belize, El Salvador, where it has 33 
branches in that country alone, Guyana, Panama, Peru, Uruguay and 
Venezuela.  Another example is the National Bank, which recently 
teamed up with three U.S. venture capital companies and a local 
Chilean partner to form Corp Banca Consortium in order to 
purchase banking institutions in South American countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had an opportunity, along with other colleagues in the House, 
to be in Chile for the Asia-Pacific parliamentary forum in 
January.  I had an opportunity to talk to representatives of 
Chilean congress with regard to not only the FTAA issues but 
issues in the financial services sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another sector where Canadian expertise is renowned around the 
world is the engineering sector.  Canada is currently the world's 
third largest exporter of engineering services and the high 
calibre of Canadian engineers is internationally recognized. 
Business opportunities are significant, especially in Central and 
Latin America where Canadian engineering expertise in resource 
based energy related infrastructure projects is in high demand. I 
would refer hon. members to such companies as Hydro-Québec and 
its recent acquisition of Chile's Transelec, which owns 50% of 
Chilean power transmission lines.  This is a good example of the 
type of business opportunities the countries in the western 
hemisphere have to offer.  That is why Canada is actively 
participating in the service negotiations under FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has much to gain from the establishment of a 
comprehensive set of rules on trade services in the FTAA. 
However, again I caution members that we must proceed cautiously. 
We have to make sure the interests of this country are protected. 
As we know, sometimes some of the biggest free traders are the 
Americans but often in name only.  We have to be careful and we 
have to be aware that the negotiations are going to be difficult, 
but I certainly support a transparent and open process.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the hon. member a question about the upcoming 
agreement of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been living under NAFTA and the Canada-United States 
Free Trade Agreement for over decade now.  These have been years 
during which we have been forced to give up access to affordable 
generic drugs, to support for Canadian magazine publishing, to 
standards for toxic fuel additives and to the right to ban bulk 
water and PCB exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In return for giving up democratic sovereignty, those deals were 
supposed to give us free access to the American market for our 
goods.  However, as recent disputes over P.E.I. potatoes and 
softwood lumber demonstrate, things have not worked out that way. 
When their economic interests are threatened, the Americans 
ignore trade deals or insist on exemptions to protect their own 
producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of dealing with these problems, our federal government 
is taking the lead in promoting, through the FTAA, the expansion 
of a trade deal that further weakens democratically elected 
governments while strengthening the power of global corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the hon. member seems to be promoting the fact that this 
is a good deal for Canadians and Canadian industries, I would ask 
him this:  with the examples I have just given, how is this deal 
going to strengthen our position as a country and our position as 
a trading partner? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, clearly the member 
opposite was not listening quite as attentively as she could have 
been. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2425"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT174"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT174"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2425
<A HREF="#LINKT175"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT173"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I said that we have to move cautiously.  I talked 
about a particular sector, the service sector. In looking at the 
service sector, I said there were opportunities.  We are looking 
at opportunities.  I made the comment that the Americans are 
often the biggest free traders, but when it comes to having their 
own interests at heart they often put up barriers.   The member 
mentioned P.E.I. potatoes as an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting and have never suggested in my comments this 
evening that we simply go straight ahead without being cautious 
and without making sure that our interests are protected.  I 
presume the member understands the fact that the national 
interest is paramount.  Therefore, if in fact under free trade or 
under NAFTA there are issues we feel are not serving our 
interests, there are, as there have been, mechanisms to address 
those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would think that under the FTAA we have to make sure 
that the right mechanisms are there, whether they are tribunals 
or whatever they happen to be, in order to make sure we are 
protected.  Not to do so would not be in the national interest. 
Therefore I have highlighted only one area in which I feel that 
there may be enhanced opportunity for Canadian companies. 
However, I did say as well that we have to make sure we protect 
and have control of our health care, culture and environment.  If 
in fact at the end of the day we are not able to do that, then I 
would not support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members are listening to what I am saying, they have to be 
very careful.  I am looking at one area in which I do see an 
opportunity, but again we must go slowly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK298"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be very brief.  The hon. member is a former president of 
the Federation of Canadian Municipalities.  I wonder if he would 
like to comment on a motion adopted by the city council of 
Vancouver expressing very grave concern about the implications of 
the FTAA for the rights of cities to make decisions about their 
own future, about their environment and about the health care of 
their citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The city of Vancouver unanimously passed a motion urging the 
federal government not to sign any trade deal, such as the 
proposed expansion of NAFTA being negotiated in the FTAA, which 
includes investor state provisions similar to those included in 
NAFTA.  Does the hon. member agree with the motion that has been 
passed by the city of Vancouver? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to read the 
motion of the city of Vancouver.  I have not read it.  However, 
again, clearly anything that does not protect interests, whether 
they are of cities or Canada as a whole, obviously I could not 
support.  Again, I believe that any treaty that would be proposed 
should come back to the House for full and honest debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson:</B>  It is a done deal by then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  You do exactly what you're told.  You 
might as well be unconscious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Order, please. 
<P><A NAME="LINK299"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to participate in this take note debate with some sense of 
sadness and almost despair about what the ultimate outcome of 
this debate will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have participated in many debates in the House.  We have 
debated motions and we have debated bills, but let us be clear 
about what is being debated here today.  We, as members of 
parliament, are being told that we have to debate, in a take note 
debate, a fundamentally important subject about the future of 
this country and the future of this hemisphere and this planet. 
Yet we are being denied the very essence of what it is that we 
are supposed to be debating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Where's the text? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson:</B>  We are being denied the text that is 
being negotiated by the 34 countries involved in this hemispheric 
deal, the free trade of the Americas agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes a mockery of democracy when we are being told that we 
are able to pronounce ourselves on the implications of the FTAA, 
the summit of the Americas, and yet we do not have the text 
itself.  That is the first point I want to make. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2430"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT175"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT175"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2430

<A HREF="#LINKT174"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a perversion of democracy to suggest that somehow we could 
have a serious debate or a serious dialogue on the issue when in 
fact we have no opportunity to view the text itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might just add that I will be splitting my time with my 
colleague, the member for Winnipeg—Transcona.  I should have 
mentioned that at the outset of my comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only are we denied access to the text that is being 
negotiated behind closed doors, but the government says that it 
has been totally transparent and that all we have to do is go to 
its website to see its position on the key issues that are being 
negotiated in the framework of the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of us have actually gone to that website.  What are some of 
the most critical issues?  They include things like the dispute 
settlement mechanism, intellectual property, investment and 
services.  Here is what the Government of Canada has to say on 
its official website about its position on investment: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date, Canada has made no submissions to the Negotiating Group 
on Investment.  Any submission made by Canada will be made 
available on the website. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much for transparency: it has nothing to say about 
investment.  In response to a question from my colleague, the 
member for Winnipeg—Transcona, this same government said that it 
was very concerned about the implications of chapter 11 of NAFTA. 
It was to make sure that no similar provision was being 
negotiated in the FTAA.  What a fraud when, by its own admission, 
it has not bothered to make any submissions at all on the issue 
of investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means quite clearly that the government does not care.  It 
certainly does not care enough to make submissions about what 
this investor state provision might mean for Canada's 
sovereignty, for our ability at all levels of government to make 
decisions in the best interest of the citizens that we have the 
honour of representing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at what the FTAA is really about, or what NAFTA and 
the WTO are really about, more and more they are about taking 
power away from democratically elected governments and putting it 
in the hands of corporate elites that are unaccountable to 
anybody but their shareholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House does not have to take my word for it.  I will quote 
from a couple of people who have made very clear that this is the 
agenda.  One is Renato Ruggiero, former director general of the 
World Trade Organization.  Here is what he had to say: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—there is a surplus of democracy in the world that is 
interfering with the free movement of investment and capital. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>God forbid, a surplus of democracy.  We have to build up trade 
deals like the free trade of the Americas and NAFTA which will 
prevent democracy from actually influencing corporate power at 
all.   Michael Walker from the Fraser Institute said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A trade deal simply limits the ability to which any statutory 
government may respond to pressure from its citizens. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ain't that the truth?  God forbid that citizens should be in a 
position to actually influence their government over things like 
the future of health care, education, culture, social programs or 
the environment.  We know that all these areas are at grave risk 
in the so-called trade negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just yesterday, for example, the common front on the World Trade 
Organization released a document voicing its deep concern about 
the implications of the current negotiations on the General 
Agreement on Trade in Services, the so-called GATS.  It has made 
very clear that the sole purpose of the current GATS negotiations 
is to open up public services to privatization and international 
competition.  In other words, it would replace services which are 
now delivered in the public interest through the public sector 
with private for profit companies.  That would destroy many of 
the social programs we have come to take for granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a totally undemocratic process.  I want to point out as 
well with respect to the process that we are witnessing in the 
context of the summit of the Americas an increasing 
criminalization of dissent. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2435"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT176"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT176"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2435

<A HREF="#LINKT175"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that Quebec City itself is being turned into an armed 
fortress and that any dissent, and I am speaking of non-violent, 
peaceful protest, people marching in the streets voicing their 
concerns about what these deals will mean not only for the people 
of Canada but for the people of the hemisphere, is being 
criminalized in many areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the obscene spectacle of the corporate elite buying its 
way into the corridors of power.  Half a million dollars gets the 
opportunity to say a few words at the opening reception.  If they 
can only afford $75,000, all they can do is decide which of the 
leaders they want to cozy up to and lobby in the context of the 
free trade of the Americas agreement.  What a contempt for civil 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Civil society outside that four kilometre parameter, with the 
friends of the government and the corporate elite inside wining 
and dining, having paid the necessary fees to have access to the 
process, is an appalling spectacle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a word about another element that troubles us as 
New Democrats.  This is not a process that includes all 35 
countries in the hemisphere.  Indeed one country has been left 
out because the United States made very clear that it is its rule 
about the summit.  That is Cuba.  It is totally unacceptable that 
Cuba should be isolated because of American pressure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not that long ago that the Prime Minister said Cuba 
should be a member of la grande famille, should be invited to be 
at the table, but now we have seen in a profound reversal of 
Canada's policy the new foreign affairs minister saying no, 
Canada does not support Cuba's presence at the table.  It is 
clearly unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a process that is totally undemocratic: denial of access 
to the documents being negotiated and criminalization of dissent 
by people who object not only to the process but to the 
substance.  There are concerns around the participation at the 
table and about corporate influence in the whole process, but the 
substance of the WTO, NAFTA and now the FTAA is of deep concern 
to us as New Democrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the member for Winnipeg—Transcona will elaborate on some 
of these concerns, particularly around the impact of chapter 11, 
the so-called investor state provisions.  We have seen the impact 
of corporate power in the so-called intellectual property area 
with pharmaceutical companies trying to stop Brazil and South 
Africa under the WTO from making cheap generic drugs available to 
aid in the fight against AIDS and HIV.  That is what we have seen 
as a direct result of the so-called trade deals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I again say that these trade deals are not about 
trade.  They are about corporate power.  We as New Democrats say 
that it is time we had a government that negotiated a fair trade 
deal.  We believe in a rules based economy and rules based trade, 
but rules that put ecological sustainability, worker rights, 
human rights and the environment ahead of corporate profit and 
the bottom line. 
<P><A NAME="LINK300"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the 
member for Burnaby—Douglas.  He speaks passionately against the 
concept of free trade but speaks in favour of fair trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was some talk a while ago, and Canadians might want some 
clarification, of the federal NDP perhaps changing its opinion on 
free trade and becoming more proactive in terms of free trade, 
actually believing that the concept of competitive and 
comparative advantage is good and should be embraced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP premiers of Saskatchewan, British Columbia and Manitoba 
were all part of the most recent team Canada trade mission to the 
Asia-Pacific region.  Has the member for Burnaby—Douglas 
informed the three premiers of those provinces of his distaste 
for the concept of free trade?  Has he brought as much scorn on 
them as he has brought on the government for its pursuit of free 
trade? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, quite clearly as New 
Democrats we have said, as I indicated in my closing comments, 
that we reject the model in NAFTA.  We reject the model in the 
proposed free trade of the Americas agreement.  We have certainly 
voiced deep concerns about the model in APEC. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2440"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT177"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT177"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2440

<A HREF="#LINKT176"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke out strongly, as did my colleagues, on that model.  We 
voiced those concerns in the context of APEC.  We have certainly 
raised serious concerns about human rights and respect for the 
environment, issues like the sale of Candu reactors to China, 
concerns around the Three Gorges Dam and a number of other 
similar grave concerns about human rights violations in the 
context of religious freedom, whether it be Falun Dafa or other 
serious abuses of human rights.  Certainly we have spoken out on 
those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might say that we are waiting for members of the Canadian 
Alliance to take a strong and forceful stand with respect to 
grave human rights violations in this hemisphere.  I was 
astonished to hear the member for the riding of Esquimalt—Juan 
de Fuca speaking of Colombia and defending the United States Plan 
Colombia, saying that as a member of parliament he supports the 
military component of Plan Colombia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to talk about human rights, I suggest to the hon. 
member from Coquitlam that he speak with his colleague for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca and remind him of the concern about 
respect for human rights in this hemisphere, which is what is 
being debated in this take note debate this evening. 
<P><A NAME="LINK301"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have two 
points.  Maybe it was the phrasing of the member's words when he 
was talking about the private sector doing some things the 
government is doing, but to me it seemed to cast aspersion on 
business workers.  I think all workers in both business and 
government in Canada by and large work very hard for whoever is 
providing a particular service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is related to services.  The hon. member was 
suggesting that health, public education and social services 
might be at risk.  Last week the Minister for International Trade 
made his announcement of Canada's position on the GATT.  He made 
quite clear that those things would not be at risk in the GATT or 
in the free trade agreement of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have to ask why we 
should believe anything the minister says in light of the track 
record of the Liberal Party on trade issues.  I remember the 1993 
election when the Liberals campaigned vigorously against NAFTA. 
They were to have nothing whatsoever to do with NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the previous parliament when the now industry 
minister campaigned strongly with all his colleagues against the 
pharmaceutical drug legislation, that gift to multinational drug 
corporations.  In the interim we have seen one of the most 
disgraceful flip-flops.  In fact the Minister of Industry gave a 
grovelling apology to Brian Mulroney at Davos, Switzerland: “You 
were right, Brian.  We were wrong in the Liberal Party”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last week in front of the Senate committee the minister 
apologized for the Liberal position on pharmaceutical drugs when 
he said in 1987 that the pharmaceutical drug bill would suck the 
lifeblood out of Canada's poorest citizens.  That is what he said 
then.  He has said the opposite now.  Why should we believe 
anything that the trade minister tells parliament or the country? 
<P><A NAME="LINK302"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to follow my colleague, the hon. member for 
Burnaby—Douglas, in putting on the record the very real concerns 
of the NDP about the FTAA.  We have concerns not just about the 
FTAA but also about various other trade agreements which contain 
the same elements as the government would like to see included in 
the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our opposition to the free trade of the Americas is consistent 
with our opposition to the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, the 
North American Free Trade Agreement, the multilateral agreement 
on investment and the World Trade Organization.  All these 
agreements, some in place like NAFTA, some historical like the 
Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, some defeated like the 
multilateral agreement on investment and some in process, 
like the WTO, all these agreements have in common the fact that they are 
agreements which were conceived in the first place to restrict 
the ability of democratically elected governments to act in the 
public interest, to act on behalf of the common good. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2445"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT177"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague referred to earlier when he was quoting Renato 
Ruggiero, the former director of the WTO, it has been the view of 
the corporate elite both nationally and globally for some time 
basically since the early mid-seventies that there has been a 
surplus of democracy in the western world.  Things were getting 
out of hand.  The economy was regulated in a way that did not 
permit the maximization of profit in the way that corporations 
would like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There began a corporate backlash in the 1970s, which by the late 
1980s took the form of free trade agreements.  It took the old 
concept of free trade and protectionism, which sometimes had been 
supported by various elements of the political spectrum and which 
basically had to do with the elimination of tariffs, et cetera, 
and applied it toward an entirely new phenomenon that included 
not just what free trade used to include but entirely new sectors 
with respect to energy, investment and now services, the latter 
being the latest addition to what the corporate elite would like 
to see brought under the authority of these agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Burnaby—Douglas said that he was sad to see that 
we were debating the free trade agreement of the Americas without 
the text.  It is not a coincidence that we do not have the text. 
The one time that we did have the text before there was an 
agreement it was defeated.  Somehow the text of the MAI, 
multilateral agreement on investment, was put on the Internet and 
everybody had a copy of it.  That agreement did not survive 
because people could actually point to what it was that their 
governments were planning to do to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe the minister of trade when he says that he 
would really love to release the text of the draft agreement but 
he cannot get the other countries to agree.  It is clear to me 
that there is an agreement among all the countries not to release 
the text.  If they release the text they know there would be a 
lot more people protesting in Quebec City, more than those 
already planning to protest what it is that their governments are 
planning to do to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just what the governments are planning to do to their 
citizens in terms of taking away their rights and their ability 
through their governments to act in the public interest.  The 
real question is:  Why do governments want to do this to 
themselves? 
It is the most pathetic element of what we have seen 
in the last decade of the 20th century and what we are seeing 
more of in the beginning of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the history of western liberal democracy is written 100 
years from now, it will be about the decline of liberal 
democracy.  It will be similar to the books we now read about the 
decline of Athenian democracy, the decline of the ideals of the 
Roman republic, or various other historical epochs that started 
out with an idea which flourished, reached its zenith at some 
point and then for some reason began to deteriorate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the late 1980s we have seen through the free trade 
agreements the relentless but willing advocation of power by 
elected representatives, both by parliamentarians individually 
and collectively, by democratically elected governments with 
power vested in them by their citizenry and electorate, to 
corporations, either to corporations directly or to international 
or regional trade agreements which embody the values and the 
interests of those corporations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The really interesting point for historians 100 years from now 
will be to try to understand what went on in the 1990s and in the 
early part of the 21st century, if we survive, if we can breathe 
the air and drink the water that a deregulated global market 
economy will bring us.  However, if we survive, somebody will be 
asking what possessed these people to surrender the control of 
the economy, the trust that had been placed in them by the 
citizens who voted them into power.  What possessed them to give 
up that power? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what people in Quebec City will be protesting.  That is 
what they protested in Seattle and Windsor.  They will be 
protesting at the next meeting of the WTO in Qatar, those who can 
get there.  I will put on the record now that the next summit of 
the Americas will probably be in the Falkland Islands.  These 
things will have to go beyond being held in artificially created 
gated compounds.  They will have to be held on islands that can 
be defended by various navies because more and more people are 
seeing that this is an attack on democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real shame is that the people who should be in the forefront 
of defending democracy, the people who are actually elected, are 
the ones who are being sucked in royally by it.  We have heard a 
lot of that tonight, people getting up and singing the praises of 
free trade without seeing that they are singing the praises of 
their own continuing demise as parliamentarians both individually 
and collectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this all done in the name of?  As I said before, it is 
done in the name of constraining the power of government. However 
it is also done from a Canadian perspective, as a Liberal member 
said earlier, in the name of enhanced market access.  The Liberal 
member who was talking about enhanced market access was talking 
about enhanced market access for Canadian service corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being asked to trade away the mechanisms and the public 
policy instruments through which we have built up a different 
kind of society and through which we have regulated the economy 
in a way that accrued to the public interest rather than the 
private interest and corporations.  We are being asked to give 
all that up so that our Canadian corporations will not run into 
similar public policy instruments in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interest of their corporate profits and their profit 
strategies we are being asked to give up our way of life.  That 
is what it amounts to.   We are told that this leads to jobs.  It 
may well do so.  If at the same time we have to give up our way 
of life and give up the possibility of being a distinct country 
having distinct social and economic values, it will be a classic 
case of having sown the wind and reaped the whirlwind.  It will

Mr. Speaker, the member will know that I have only the highest 
regard for him as an individual and for his history in 
parliament.  I have been very impressed in the last few weeks 
with some of his sage wisdom that he has given to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not debate him on the issue that he has just put forward. 
I have a fundamental disagreement with his thesis. I would like 
to give him and perhaps the New Democratic Party an opportunity 
to go on record about a related issue.  I sincerely respect the 
New Democratic Party, particularly this member, and the fact that 
they have a particular perspective. 
They want to go to Quebec to make those statements.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also sincerely respect other thoughtful Canadians who hold to 
that perspective.  I would like to give him the opportunity to 
make some comment about those who take the credibility of 
thoughtful people like him and others who want to protest and 
take it to the anarchistic extreme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that the government has had to put up barriers 
and walls and take other security measures.  I would like to give 
the member and his party the opportunity to say that they want to 
have the right to democratically attack this summit, that they 
want the right to demonstrate peacefully and that they want the 
right to make their statement as forcefully as they possibly can, 
but that they resent and reject the anarchistic tendencies of 
some who will be coming with the avowed intention to get up to 
anarchy and public mischief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I say to the hon. member 
that there has never been any doubt in any of the statements that 
have been made by the member for Burnaby—Douglas on behalf of 
the NDP as trade critic; by myself, formerly the trade critic; or 
by our leader that we are going to Quebec City to be in 
solidarity with the people who want to peacefully protest against 
the free trade area of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in Seattle representing the NDP.  This was not 
inconsistent with what we will be doing in Quebec.  It was not 
inconsistent with what had been done before.  Tens of thousands 
of people in Seattle were demonstrating against the World Trade 
Organization who had nothing to do with the planning, the 
executing or the approving of the actions of a minority of 
protesters who had a different philosophy that chose to break 
windows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people who are against any kind of world governance. 
We have already said we are not against a multilateral rules 
based economy.  We want one that is designed not in the interests 
of multinational corporations but in the interests of the 
well-being of all peoples.  That means we have to include core 
labour standards and environmental standards, et cetera, all the 
things that the corporations do not want included in these 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for the question, but the answer is 
something that has been given many times by myself and other New 
Democrats. 
<P><A NAME="LINK304"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will ask a brief question.  It is a complex issue, but I do 
want to give the member an opportunity to comment briefly on one 
of the most dangerous provisions in the existing NAFTA which is 
being proposed as quite possibly extending into the FTAA.  It is 
chapter 11 dealing with the investor state provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen challenges by UPS of our public postal service, by 
S.D. Myers on banning PCB exports and by Sun Belt Water regarding 
bulkwater exports.  Could the hon. member comment briefly on his 
concerns with respect to this very dangerous provision? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I had more time to 
elaborate on how these agreements affect democracy and how they 
threaten democracy, I would have turned to chapter 11, the 
investor state dispute settlement mechanism, as a prime example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The things the member for Burnaby—Douglas listed, and one can 
list others, are basically a list of public policy options or 
public policy decisions that democratically elected governments 
have made in the past or could make in the future which could now 
be challenged through this investor state dispute settlement 
mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do those decisions then become challenged, but we have 
this chill effect whereby governments never make other 
possible decisions because they are afraid of this mechanism. 
<P><A NAME="LINK305"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Moore (Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time 
with the hon. member for Skeena.  From April 20 to April 22, 
2001, 34 democratically elected heads of government representing 
a territory that spans from Iqaluit to Tierra del Fuego, with a 
combined population of some 800 million people, will gather in 
Quebec City for the summit of the Americas.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the agenda are such topics as economic integration, improved 
access to education, alleviation of poverty, enhanced respect for 
human rights and democratic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal is to take a collective step forward toward 
implementing a free trade area of the Americas, a hemispheric 
free trade zone which would offer increased economic integration, 
increased economic growth and broad development that would 
benefit all concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us who accept and encourage the dynamic competitive and 
comparative advantage hope the talks will be frank and 
productive.  However the talks might pale in comparison with the 
vigorous and shrill anti-summit disruptions that will occur 
throughout Quebec City.  The press, always seeking to sell a racy 
story, will have to choose between dry stories predicting 
increased Canada-Costa Rica trade or explicit, loud and 
disruptive images of anti-summit protesters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end protesters may succeed in selling their trade is bad, 
anti-capitalist message to an apathetic public, as they partially 
did in Seattle.  However the average Canadian, using common 
sense, will know that just the opposite is true.  Not only is 
trade good, but fair rules based trade is a goal we should pursue 
with vigour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A mere look into the average Canadian kitchen, where Latin 
American fruits and coffee sit side by side with Mexican beer, 
Chilean wines and Canadian cheese, confirms the very obvious 
benefits of trade for all, benefits we often take them for 
granted.  At its heart, the Quebec City summit of the Americas 
seeks to define rules that will ensure free trade of the Americas 
benefits all concerned.  Unfortunately the popular focus has 
fallen victim to anti-free trade propaganda, propaganda that, 
frankly, is devoid of truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal with some of the more often uttered objections to 
free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard a minute ago from the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona and, before him, the hon. member for 
Burnaby—Douglas.  They claim, as does the Canadian Union of 
Public Employees, that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under NAFTA Chapter 11, virtually any action by a government that 
limits the current or future value of assets held by a foreign 
corporation is subject to a claim for compensation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While that statement is true, CUPE conveniently forgets to 
mention, as do opponents of NAFTA, that in Canada citizens and 
corporations alike, both foreign and domestic, have long had the 
right to sue the government for compensation for actions of the 
government that unjustly and unfairly damage them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians will probably remember the famous Pearson airport 
privatization scandal.  It resulted from the sale, during the 
dying days of the Mulroney administration, of Pearson airport 
terminals 1 and 2 to a consortium that included some political 
allies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1993 election campaign the Liberals campaigned on a 
promise to scrap the deal and re-examine the contract.  They won 
the election and cancelled the deal.  The consortium sued.  When 
the Liberals responded that a government could not be sued for 
keeping an election promise, the Ontario Court of Appeal 
disagreed.  It ruled in 1995 that one could sue a government for 
breaking a contract and claim lost profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with that reality, the government settled out of court 
with the consortium and paid it $265 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians and Canadian companies and foreigners and foreign 
companies can sue the Canadian government.  Not more than two 
blocks from this Chamber is the Federal Court of Canada which has 
jurisdiction “in all cases where relief is claimed against the 
Crown”.  It recognizes the right of individuals and companies to 
sue the federal government.  Naturally, that right includes the 
right to sue the government for lost profits or for compensation 
for loss of property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our trade agreements have not granted new rights to foreign 
companies in Canada.  What they do is export Canada's standards 
of legal and political rights to other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second myth, often propagated by the detractors of expanded 
trade, is the belief that global trade is an evil which only 
benefits large corporations and must be fought at all costs.  We 
heard that in the previous two presentations.  This view is 
simply devoid of facts and serious economic reasoning.  We have 
seen a dramatic increase in prosperity and growth as a result of 
the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement and NAFTA.  We have seen 
firsthand the tremendous benefits of structured, rules based 
trade with a like minded democracy to the south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the expansion of the proven principles of NAFTA to a 
Canada-Chile free trade agreement and to a now proposed 
Canada-Costa Rica free trade agreement, we have sought to 
diversify Canada's export market, in part to make Canada slightly 
less dependent on trade with the United States.  That is a step 
in the right direction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today Canada conducts more than 80% of its trade with the United 
States and we trade more with Japan, our number two trading 
partner, than with all of Latin America and the Caribbean 
combined.  If trade is good then multilateral trade, trading with 
many partners, is even better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FTAA seeks to create a regime of rules based trade that will 
serve the interests of everyone.  Think back to October of 1999, 
when the WTO, acting on a complaint from Japan, struck down the 
longstanding Canada-U.S. auto pact.  By striking down the access 
of Canadian car plants to U.S. markets, the decision could have 
meant disaster and the loss of thousands of jobs in Ontario and 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, the open trade rule of the Canada-United States Free 
Trade Agreement kicked in.  Since then Canadian exports to the 
U.S. have increased by more than 15% in that sector.  That 
benefits auto workers, especially members of the Canadian Auto 
Workers union at plants in Ontario and Quebec which now build 
cars for export to such distant markets as Chile and Saudi 
Arabia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Canadian Union of Public Employees, CUPE, denounces 
free trade, exports are paying the bills for Canadian Auto Worker 
union members.  Perhaps CUPE's leaders should listen to their CAW 
brothers and sisters who would tell them that rules based free 
trade is good and that their jobs are proof of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That argument has not been lost in the sovereignty plans of the 
Bloc Quebecois and Parti Quebecois.  They have always been 
careful to suggest separation would not remove Quebec from either 
the FTA or NAFTA.  Whether such a status would persist is a 
debate for another time, but the fact is that free trade is good 
for Quebec's economy, and its representatives in Ottawa and 
Quebec City recognize and are actively reflecting that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An argument can be made that the recent election in Mexico, 
which has rightly been hailed as the first open and honest 
election in Mexican history, was due in part to Mexico's 
involvement in NAFTA and to the commitment of democracy expressed 
in that agreement by Canada and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, it would seem that in South America a genuine 
commitment to democracy and all that it entails is seen as a 
necessary requirement to participation in the free trade area of 
the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Burnaby—Douglas asked earlier and at committee 
why Cuba will not be at the FTAA summit.  I told him at 
committee, and I will tell him again today, that Cuba will not be 
in Quebec City because there is no consensus among the 34 nations 
for it to be there.  That is, I might suggest to the member for 
Burnaby—Douglas, because since 1959 the Castro regime has driven 
out, incarcerated or murdered a fifth of its population.  That 
might have something to do with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of those protesting the summit are union activists who are 
staunch defenders of the collective bargaining process. 
Canadians have long respected that process, and they accept the 
need to conduct union-management negotiations behind closed doors 
as long as the rank and file are consulted before negotiations 
start and have a chance to ratify the final agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those principles must apply to the Quebec summit.  Anyone who 
says otherwise is not truly interested in greater transparency 
but is using the plea for greater openness as a Trojan Horse to 
scuttle the FTAA process.  We must recognize that behaviour for 
what it is: anti-democratic and contradictory to their own 
practices and self-interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, they selectively use closed door bargaining when it is 
in their best interests but not when it is in the best interests 
of those with whom they disagree.  True democrats recognize this 
inconsistency as a lack of courage for an assumed, unassailable 
principle of collective negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end by quoting one of Europe's leading socialists, the 
Right Hon. Tony Blair, prime minister of the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  He said in this House: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time, I think, that we started to argue vigorously and 
clearly as to why free trade is right.  It is the key to jobs for 
our people, to prosperity and actually to development in the 
poorest parts of the world.  The case against it is misguided 
and, worse, unfair. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the official opposition, I say amen to Prime 
Minister Blair.  Greater truth has not been spoken by a prime 
minister in this place for a very long time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andy Burton (Skeena, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise today to speak on the matter of the upcoming 
summit of the Americas in Quebec City on April 20 of this year. I 
will address my remarks to the issue of trade and, more 
specifically, trade in softwood lumber between the U.S.A. and 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem the Liberal government is not taking the matter 
seriously.  We on the Alliance benches want to see the current 
agreement end and free trade instituted, as was supposed to be 
the case when NAFTA was signed.   We do not feel enough is being 
done to ensure that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade in softwood lumber will revert to NAFTA rules in the 
absence of a softwood lumber agreement.  On June 7, 2000 the 
Canadian Alliance posted on the Internet its position to return 
to free trade in lumber.  During the November election we could 
not smoke out the Liberals on their free trade position, and only 
in dribs and drabs since January has it been clarified somewhat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After signing a misguided agreement in 1996 that placed all 
kinds of restrictions on Canadian lumber producers, Canada is now 
staring down the barrel of the U.S. trade gun.  The Liberal 
government let down Canadian lumber producers by not staking out 
its ground a long time ago in favour of free trade in lumber. One 
wonders what it has been up to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give some background as to why the matter is important to 
me and to my riding of Skeena, British Columbia.  B.C. accounts 
for more than 50% of Canada's softwood lumber exports to the 
U.S.A.  Those exports have an approximate value of more than $5 
billion annually.  With the end of the Canada-U.S.A. softwood 
lumber agreement and no free trade agreement in place, my riding, 
as well as many others in B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, will 
suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding the major producer, Skeena Cellulose Inc., has no 
U.S. quota as it has focused their exports on the Asian market. 
However now that those markets have gone cold, SCI is looking to 
the U.S. as a potential market.  The problem is that the softwood 
lumber agreement is based on trade history.  What one has shipped 
into the U.S. in the past determines what one is allowed to ship 
now.  SCI, a major producer of lumber, has no history of shipping 
to the U.S.  The potential for shutdowns and layoffs is imminent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past five years, the four provinces that signed the 
1996 agreement have struggled to meet and not exceed their quota 
to the U.S. while the six exempt provinces have seen an increase 
in market share of up to 130%.  B.C. alone has seen its share 
reduced by 20%.  Quebec's share has seen a modest increase of 
2.8%.  The four covered provinces combined have seen a total 
reduction in U.S. market share of up to 14.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government needs to set things straight with the U.S.A. 
before the argument costs Canada billions in countervailing and 
anti-dumping duties.  The ministers on the government benches do 
not even have their stories straight.  The Minister of Industry 
has been quoted as saying that a renewal of the existing 
agreement will be part of the negotiations, while the Minister 
for International Trade said there would be no renewal at all. 
Which is it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can Canadian lumber producers have any faith in what the 
government is willing to do for them when it does not know what 
it is doing?  It does not instil a great deal of faith in my 
heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, 50 U.S. senators from both sides of the political 
spectrum have sent a letter to the president saying they need 
action to keep Canada from flooding lumber into the United 
States.  What course of action will they be taking?  According to 
the letter, they are calling for Ottawa to voluntarily impose a 
20% export tax on Canadian lumber.  That is a measure we had in 
the 1980s.  Are we so far advanced that we must go back in time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. is also looking into launching an anti-dumping and 
subsidy investigation under a rarely used trade law to make sure 
Canada pays when the current agreement is over at the end of the 
month.  The critical circumstance law is used only when a flood 
of cheap imports threatens to enter the country.  Under normal 
U.S. trade laws, import duties cannot be imposed for at least 90 
days from the end of a trade agreement.  Should the investigation 
find in favour of the subsidy claim by the U.S.A., the critical 
circumstance law will then allow the U.S. government to impose 
punitive duties retroactively for those 90 days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean?  It means that even though we will have 
some form of free trade for three months, when that time is up 
Canadian producers will be hit with duties for that month as well 
as for the months prior that were supposed to be open to free 
trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make matters worse, Canadian producers have no idea what the 
duty amount may be.  It could be anywhere from 15% to 45%.  That 
could cost Canadian producers tens of millions of dollars. 
According to the Byrd Amendment enacted last fall, that would be 
paid to United States lumber producers.  Not only would Canadian 
producers be unable to ship lumber into the U.S. without paying 
heavy duties, the payments would go to their U.S. competitors.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a subsidy there, Mr. Speaker, but it is too bad it is 
the Canadian producers subsidizing the U.S. producers.  The real 
victims are American consumers and Canadian jobs and the 
recipient is a noisy U.S. lumber coalition.  This could turn into 
a national crisis, but we would never know that by the way the 
government is handling the situation.  Is it prepared to meet 
with its U.S. counterparts during this summit to ensure free 
trade in softwood lumber?  Or, when the ministers meet later on 
in Buenos Aires to discuss the new free trade area of the 
Americas, the government should be prepared to ensure free trade 
in softwood lumber with the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment President Bush is prepared to fast track the 
approval of the FTAA.  This is the time for the Liberal 
government to take control and look out for the interests of the 
Canadian lumber producers and their tens of thousands of 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If under NAFTA the Canadian government cannot guarantee that the 
softwood lumber industry will ever have free trade with the U.S., 
then how can we be certain that, with the FTAA, when a U.S. 
industry feels threatened by a counterpart from Canada it will 
not go into protectionist mode like it has done with our softwood 
lumber? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is just one of the major industrialized countries that is 
dependent upon trade.  The trade sector accounts for one out of 
every three jobs in Canada.  This nation has been a strong 
advocate of the FTAA as an opportunity to promote regional 
prosperity, increased business activity and jobs in Canada.  It 
would stand to reason that part of this opportunity would come 
from the lumber industry, yet it would seem that the Canadian 
government would rather see trade centre on what is termed the 
new economy, the high tech industries.  Do not get me wrong. 
There is always a need to improve our technology.  However, 
should it be done at the expense of the other more traditional 
industries?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every industry in Canada should be afforded the same opportunity 
to grow and prosper.  It would be interesting to see, for 
example, if there had been a five year trade agreement with the 
U.S. in fibre optics that was to run out in three days whether 
the government would be sitting around on its hands or working 
toward a resolution of that situation to keep the industry from 
losing millions of dollars at the hands of their American 
counterparts.  Would the government not try to work out a free 
trade agreement in that industry?  Why then does it leave the 
softwood lumber industry to fend for itself when it comes to 
trade interests? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We get the strange feeling that the government does not realize 
that the country, as it grows, depends on these industries as 
much, if not more, than it did in its fledgling days.  These 
so-called old economy industries are what drive the high tech 
industry into research and development.  They are one of the 
biggest consumers of high tech advancements.  Why would the 
government not fight for free trade in the lumber industry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing this country does need is consensus.  We need to join 
together as a country and face the American lumber industry as a 
whole, with all provinces in agreement, not the west versus the 
east as we are seeing at the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all in this for the same reason.  We must see that we do 
indeed have allies in the U.S., such as the group called American 
Consumers for Affordable Homes, which has much in common with the 
Canadian Free Trade Lumber Council.  This group also enjoys 
support from 49 members of the House of Representatives, members 
who introduced a resolution at the beginning of March to simply 
allow the softwood lumber agreement to lapse.  Why would they do 
that?  It is because the homebuilders' coalition has said that 
restrictions placed on Canadian lumber add approximately $1,000 
U.S. to the end cost of each new home built in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter came out in support of 
Canadian lumber in an editorial on March 24.  He calls for an end 
to the current softwood lumber agreement and a permanent free 
trade agreement to be used to give both countries equal footing 
in the softwood lumber market.  If members of the House of 
Representatives, U.S. citizens and even former presidents are 
willing to fight their own American government for Canadian 
lumber, why then will our government not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need action on this issue now, not later.  I am calling on 
the Liberal Government of Canada to take a stand and save the 
Canadian lumber industry.  Do not leave Canadian lumber producers 
out in the cold.

equal and open access to the market for all Canadian producers. I 
firmly believe that the industry across Canada has the ability to 
compete very effectively with its U.S. counterpart.  It is a 
matter of having free access to that market on a equal basis 
across the country.  Until we achieve that, there will be no 
satisfaction or consensus from the producers across Canada.  They 
all require equal access to the U.S. market on an equal footing 
and on a free and open basis.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from the constituency of 
Skeena who has done an excellent job here in consistently 
defending the interests of his constituents with respect to the 
pending economic disaster of potential softwood lumber tariffs 
being imposed by our American friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important debate on a major trade accord. Indeed, 
this take note debate was brought forward to this place in the 
form of a motion by the government, which holds, if I am not 
mistaken, 172 seats in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It's 171 and Lynn Myers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  That would make 171, less the member 
for Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are about 130 opposition members.  I just wondered if my 
colleague would care to reflect on the fact that in this very 
important government motion on which he just spoke at 1.20 a.m. 
eastern time, there are eight times more members of the 
opposition in this place right now than members of the 
government— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  The hon. member for 
Calgary Southeast knows full well that he cannot allude to the 
absence of any members here.  I would ask him to please listen to 
what I have to say, at least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andy Burton:</B>  Mr. Speaker, obviously my colleague has 
a very valid concern.  It is very obvious.  I recognize the 
member for Yukon over in the corner there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very strange that there is not more interest in this 
extremely important debate.  Looking around the House, my 
colleague is quite correct.  There are, I believe, nine of us 
here now compared to one across the floor.  It is not 
particularly— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  The 
hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK309"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
seems to me that at this hour of the morning we have reached a 
consensus about something I heard earlier from my colleagues. We 
seem to agree that this is indeed an important debate. This day 
is a happy one, because we have an opportunity to debate the 
issue in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit to the members that my happiness decreases sharply 
when I see what time it is: it is 1.25 a.m. It does not bother 
me to be debating at 1.25 a.m. The public seems to be saying to 
us that it is important. 
Yet we are having it in the evening. We are having it at night, 
and the impression is that we are trying to get rid of it, that 
it will be swept under the carpet and that what is said will not 
be given much weight, or something like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very sad to see the context in which this debate is taking 
place. It does not bother me one bit to get up in the middle of 
the night in order to come to debate something as important as 
this. I have wanted us to debate issues such as this one—economic 
integration—for a long time. I am not against it, far from it. 
However, I am suggesting that we do our job and really debate 
the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we talking about today? We are talking about the summit 
of the Americas, the discussions on the free trade area of the 
Americas which will take place on April 20. For me, this is a 
very, very important date. 
In addition to being the date of the summit, it is the 
anniversary of a date on which I once took an enormous risk by 
trying to launch a public discussion of the potential impact of 
globalization and economic integration on society and democracy. 
Indeed, I took this chair that belongs to my fellow citizens of 
Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay, I brought it to them and I told them, 
“Listen, after two years in politics, I wonder about the power 
of this chair to reduce the disparity between rich and poor in 
the context of globalization”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2525"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT185"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially, we had difficulty finding documentation on 
globalization. I do not claim to be the one who sparked the 
debate, but I think I became involved in a popular movement from 
which emerged a degree of concern that is still present and that 
will continue to be present on April 20 and 21. Unfortunately or 
fortunately, many people will descend on the streets of Quebec 
City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say unfortunately because of the potential for violence. I 
deplore any kind of violence that may erupt in connection with 
the demonstrations and other public gatherings that will be 
held. Violence is completely unacceptable and a threat to 
democracy. 
I will be joining the people who plan to take to the streets to 
voice their concerns or protest the lack of debate. I agree with 
them that there is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I carried out my chair, I was hoping to generate some kind 
of debate. Moreover, 50,000 people signed a petition calling on 
members of parliament to examine these issues. It is the least 
we could have done, in my view. However, given the absence of 
debate and the presence of lack of communication, this is what 
happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the proposed FTAA was a positive initiative, the average 
person in the street would not know if indeed it would benefit 
him or her because there has not been any kind of debate. Some 
discussions may have taken place, but there has been no societal 
debate. Thus it is extremely relevant that we debate this matter 
here this evening. 
As I said, I find it very regrettable that this debate must 
unfold in the wee hours of the morning, when the public and 
parliamentarians may not necessarily be listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that I oppose everything that is happening. That 
is not at all the case. However, as I said, if we had had an 
opportunity to set eyes on the FTAA texts during the course of 
our discussions, and I am certain many people would like to get 
their hands on these documents, then people would have been able 
to give an informed opinion. This was not to be. All we have to 
go on are snippets of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During a recent visit to Chile, I had an opportunity to meet 
with the minister of international co-operation who informed me 
that he was doing a great deal of work parallel to this accord 
to ensure that the FTAA agreement would have positive spin-offs 
for the other countries of the Americas. So much the better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As that issue is not a subject of debate, and we are not 
really sure what is being done around us, it is hard for me to 
go out and meet with the people of my riding and tell them not 
to worry, that everything is all right, that I think it is a 
good agreement. I do not know if I can go to the businesses in 
my riding and tell them it will be good for them. I do not know. 
This is what I criticize and this is why I will march 
peacefully in the street on April 21. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next Sunday, there will be a teach-in on the free trade 
agreement of the Americas here in parliament.  A people's 
committee is coming here, into parliament, to debate these 
issues.  These people are so worried that they are prepared to 
practise civil disobedience.  I do not want to say that I 
support them, but a member of the NDP and I opened parliament up 
because I believe these people deserve to be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have things to say and they are prepared to be run 
over in order to say what they have to say.  It must be serious. 
There are all kinds of things we could discuss in this free 
trade agreement, in particular something like chapter 11.  If I 
could see the texts I could perhaps say whether I think mistakes 
were made in the framework of the NAFTA text that should perhaps 
not be made again in the text of the FTAA, but I do not know. 
Therefore how can I judge?  When in doubt, what is one to do? 
Go down and protest in the streets because we feel the process 
is undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are things that can be done.  We, as members 
of parliament in this House, can act.  Several people are 
sleeping, as it is more normal not to be in the House at this 
hour. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2530"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT186"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, as a parliamentarian, I think there are some interesting 
things being done. Some of the world's parliamentarians are 
saying: “Our role, as the people's representatives, is to do our 
job. We do not agree with what is happening. We have to express 
our views.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, that is what led to the establishment of 
the Parliamentary Conference of the Americas, COPA, an 
inter-parliamentary association founded in Quebec City 
recently—one and a half years ago—when parliamentarians from 
throughout the Americas came together to discuss our problems, 
our issues and our shared concerns. It is a very good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that parliamentarism should go beyond borders and debate 
these questions more fully. It is urgent. 
Naturally, Canada answered the call of the COPA because, through 
it, it has a place among the countries that make up federations, 
and parliamentarians from the provinces are included. Recently, 
we had the inaugural meeting of the interparliamentary forum of 
the Americas here in Ottawa, which was attended by 
parliamentarians from every country. The provinces were 
excluded, but we will not dwell on that, that is not what 
matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians from throughout the Americas met in this House, 
and it was very rewarding to have the opportunity to dialogue 
with a parliamentarian from Honduras, with one from Chile, from 
Mexico, and from the United States. The participation of the 
United States was perhaps somewhat lacking, but after all we 
should focus on the end goal, not the current results. 
In any case, if there is one thing, I think, that must be done 
in the House, given the reality of continentalization and 
globalization, it is to leave this parliament to speak with 
fellow parliamentarians from the Americas and around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of parliament will tell me, “Yes, but it is not that 
easy to travel, to meet, to get parliamentarians to move”. I 
came back from Chile last week. Travelling in the southern 
hemisphere requires a lot of energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I proposed at the interparliamentary forum of the Americas 
pertained to technology, which is advancing at such a hellish 
pace.  It is for this reason that I suggested that the technical 
secretariat of FIPA support the development of a virtual 
telecommunications mechanism that will allow parliamentarians to 
meet more frequently, by means of virtual meetings. 
I am being serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say frequently; perhaps once a week, 
like a national parliamentary committee of this parliament, 
which meets once a week in order to pursue debates, study issues 
and listen to the people. I think that we will now have to do 
this kind of work as parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the earth is a sphere and it is difficult to meet with a 
parliamentarian or groups on the other side of the world, I 
recommend that we adopt these instruments which would allow us, 
for example—I know that it is perhaps futuristic, but I have no 
trouble looking ahead to the future—to sit in a committee room 
here in parliament in Ottawa, where I would have the 
impression, not only the impression, it would be a reality, 
that my colleagues, parliamentarians from across the country, 
the continent and even the world, were present and that I could 
debate. 
We parliamentarians could work together and present a common 
front in the case of such matters as the Tobin tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a parliamentarian who favours a tax such as the Tobin tax. 
Of course, such a measure requires concerted action by all 
countries. Groups of parliamentarians could push for action 
simultaneously on the same issues, the environment, for example. 
In short, all cross-border issues could be debated seriously and 
frequently through such a process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we have the technology do this now? Perhaps it is not quite 
perfected at this time, but I think that in five or ten years it 
will be there and we will be able to conduct what I call a 
virtual parliament that will have no borders and that will be 
able to meet frequently. That is something concrete for which we 
as parliamentarians must prepare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are experiencing a revolution in more ways than one. 
I think that the work of a parliamentarian must also go through 
a revolution and follow this path that opens onto the rest of 
the world. As I said just now, I am absolutely not against this 
type of globalization.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I think we should aim for is globalization with a 
democratic face, in which wealth will be distributed and every 
human being will be able to achieve his or her potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, if we want to set up a free trade area—and I want to 
stress that I do not oppose trade between countries—I have a 
small problem with the word free, because free trade in my 
opinion means a total absence of rules. If the economy is not 
bound by any rules, it is not, I am sorry to say, going to work. If 
we let the market alone dictate the political agenda of our 
societies, I have a problem with that. I believe that the 
economy should be subject to a minimum of controls—no, controls 
pure and simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need environmental and social rules. We need to think about 
those who do not have ready access to the new economy. A number 
of challenges lie ahead. Of course, we can get discouraged and 
lament that the situation makes no sense. However, we can also 
roll up our sleeves, look for solutions and fight for a world or 
continent in keeping with our vision and values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, this is the message that I want to convey to you 
today and it comes from the heart. Over the course of the next 
month, things are likely to get rather intense. I am pleased 
that the summit is taking place in our backyard because it has 
generated a great deal of debate, notably among CEGEP and 
university students. Unfortunately, one phenomenon appears to 
pose a threat to democracy, namely the public's waning interest 
in politics. I am not trying to scare anyone. I am certain that 
members have observed the situation firsthand in their ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conversely, another phenomenon is emerging, namely a growing 
interest in all questions of this nature. We saw it in Seattle, 
in Prague, in Nice, in Washington and elsewhere. Concerns have 
been expressed and it is our job, not to reassure people, but 
rather to encourage and promote debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increased trade and broader economic ties between nations may 
well result in a redistribution of wealth and I have no problem 
with this. If, after thoroughly analysing and debating the 
situation, we conclude that a particular course of action is 
warranted, then I do not have a problem with that either. I am 
quite receptive, provided of course that I am able to go to my 
constituents and explain to them how matters stand. However, I 
cannot do this now because I do not know how matters stand. Some 
discussion has of course been taking place here and there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the minister for international co-operation said to 
me: “Stéphan, these negotiations cover 
more than just economic aspects; there is also the aspect of 
international co-operation, there are social, environmental and 
educational considerations.” The minister's approach is 
appropriate in some respects, in terms of access to education, 
which is the engine of development. There is worthwhile work 
being done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, she told me that the media, unfortunately, do not 
cover these things. Unfortunately, the media are attracted to 
what is sensational. This is perhaps a little sad. There is 
worthwhile work being done, I agree. However, if a person is not 
participating in the debate, or closely involved in all these 
things, it is difficult to be for or against. That is basically 
my point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recently learned that Quebec, which is hosting the summit, 
will not be able to address the participants unless it sponsors 
cocktail receptions, unless it is a summit sponsor. In that 
case, it is the people's elected representatives who have to pay 
for an admission ticket. In any event, as the Prime Minister 
said, this has absolutely no influence; let us hope not. 
However, if it does, I believe this is deplorable, especially 
when a nation like Quebec, which would like to be present at the 
negotiations, has to contemplate paying for access to all these 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same applies to me. I am an elected representative, and I 
would like to be able to tell my fellow citizens what is 
happening, tell them not to worry, that everything is fine, or 
that if something does go wrong I will be there to defend them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My only option is to come here to express my views at 1.30 a.m. 
Will they be heard by the government party? Obviously, I may not 
allude to the number of members present in this House, and so I 
will not do so. Suffice it to say that I am certain my comments 
will not be heard by as many as I had hoped. That is all right, 
we will continue to do our work. We will continue to hold 
conferences, to encourage debate and to ensure that there is 
greater transparency and democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will continue to do my research on how we can adopt 
telecommunications instruments because I believe that, as 
parliamentarians, we have a job to do. Despite my criticism of 
this socioeconomic and political reality, I find it exciting to 
be involved in politics because of these challenges.  It is very 
exciting:  we are facing major challenges and it happens that we 
are among the parliamentarians of this era who will have to 
adapt to this new reality and play a greater role in these 
matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless the leaders of government continue to sweep us under the 
rug and tell us, “Get yourselves elected and come make nice 
little 1.30 speeches in the morning. You will be able to let 
off some steam and you will feel better”. But no, this does not 
help me to unwind; I will be going back to bed. 
Nonetheless, I will tell my fellow citizens, “We were able to 
debate the FTAA, but we debated it at 1.30 a.m.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I don't want to seem disdainful of those who work nights; I 
raise my hat to them. I think we all need people who work at 
night. However, I do not think it will have the same impact at 
this time of night. Fortunately, there will be <I>Hansard</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff of the 
House, who always work at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This basically concludes my comments. I would be pleased to 
answer any questions from colleagues who are still present and 
feel strongly about this issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK310"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have two 
quick comments.  First, the hon. member mentioned many times that 
people were not here.  All people in Canada are distinct. There 
are distinct time lines in the west.  It is only 10.45 p.m. in 
British Columbia and Yukon, and people are still awake. We 
have another Yukoner in the House, which is great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second point is about Quebec not being there.  All Quebecers 
who are part of the Canadian delegation will have as much access 
as anyone from the other provinces.  In fact I think the leader 
of the Canadian delegation happens to be a Quebecer, so Quebec is 
going to have more access than any other Canadian. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is indeed a time 
difference. I would like to send greetings to the people of 
British Columbia and the Yukon who may be getting ready for bed. 
However, the residents of the maritimes probably went to bed a 
long time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Quebec's role, the Prime Minister is of course a 
Quebecer, as is the Minister for International Trade. However, 
their perspective on things is totally Canadian, and while I am 
not saying that this is a bad thing, it seems to me that when 
you pay a visit to someone, it is normal that that they be 
allowed to greet their guests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the premier of Quebec and leader of all 
Quebecers—and I am not indulging in partisan politics, in fact 
I am making a real effort not to during this debate—could have 
been invited to address some welcoming remarks to the delegates. 
At the very least, he should have been extended this courtesy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though we are part of a federation—one that is becoming 
increasingly centralized perhaps—under the constitution, Quebec 
has jurisdiction over such areas as health and education. 
Therefore, if issues that concern Quebec arise, then I feel it 
should, at the very least, be more involved in the discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could debate this issue at some length, but I am convinced 
that where Quebec's role is concerned, there has been negligence.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for the hon. 
member for Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay.  He is still a very young 
member of the House but was able to claim a third term as a 
member of parliament.  That is quite a record to achieve.  He 
obviously has great respect from his constituents.  I wish that 
he would speak more often in the House as it would be very 
enlightening for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I have noticed in his speeches throughout the years is 
his approach toward young people in universities.  Could he 
elaborate more on his perspective about university students in 
Quebec and what their approach or attitude is toward the FTAA and 
the upcoming talks in Quebec City? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a very relevant 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke earlier about young people's involvement in politics. 
When I refer to young people, I include those at university who 
are more and more overwhelmed by their studies and work.  I 
think there is a lack of involvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At my college in Alma, I try to hold mini-debates.  I meet with 
students.  I tell them that what is going on concerns us all and 
that there will be consequences of this for the rest of their 
lives, so it is important to deal with it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the foundation of my political commitment. When I was 
first elected, I was 22 years old. 
I told myself that the decisions taken today would have 
consequences throughout our lives.   That is why it is important 
to have a balance between youth and experience in the House.  I 
think that unfortunately, whether it is through lack of time or 
because they have too many responsibilities, young people do not 
participate enough in the debate.  That is what I think:  they 
are not sufficiently involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you tell me that they participate as much as they did 20 
years ago, it is not enough.  We are facing challenges on a 
scale never seen before.  We need creativity and imagination in 
order to face up to these challenges; we need everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one university I was told “Look, Stéphan, university is no 
place for politics”.  If university is no place for 
politics, where can we be political other than in the House of 
Commons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is a serious problem, perhaps because the media do a 
poor job of covering politics, or because they only cover the 
bickering that goes on during question period; whatever the 
reason, there is a malaise in the democratic process. I feel 
that this issue is highly pertinent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to tell you what is happening in Quebec. 
Surveys conducted during the Quebec youth summit revealed that 
globalization issues are of the highest priority for young 
people 19 to 24 years of age. This is something new. The day 
before yesterday I celebrated my fifth anniversary in politics, 
and I know that when I started there was not this degree of 
interest.  Interest in such issues has therefore grown, and I 
think this is a very good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, our role as parliamentarians is to see the 
students and listen to their points of view. 
When I refer to chapter 11 of NAFTA, who knows what I am talking 
about? I can tell the public that, under chapter 11 of NAFTA and 
perhaps even under the free trade agreement of the Americas, a 
corporation unhappy with the legislation passed by a government 
will be able to take legal action against that government. This 
has already happened and is still happening. I believe one of 
the most recent cases involved a municipality in Mexico taken to 
court because it was establishing environmental rules. When I 
see that companies can now take legal action against countries, 
I have to ask myself some serious questions. It is my role to 
meet with students and the general public and to explain to them 
what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had debates, we could talk about these issues. We are 
having a debate now, but with all due respect to my colleagues 
who are here tonight it is really only a semblance of a debate. 
In any event, there is an enormous amount of work to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us hope that young people show an interest in these issues. 
Moreover, there was a reason why I carried my chair out of the 
House. I was trying to make a point in a way people would 
remember. I was trying to tell young people that here was an 
issue that threatened democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If in fact parliamentarians have fewer powers in an era of 
globalization, then should we address this problem? All of 
democracy is threatened in the process. I am not saying that 
democracy has disappeared. We need only travel to certain Latin 
American nations where democracy is seriously undermined to see 
that our problems are quite different. 
However, does this mean that I should disregard what is 
happening here at home and pretend that everything is fine? No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder about the kind of society I will be living in twenty 
years from now. When I look at what is going on, I am concerned 
and I have a duty to convey my concerns to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I felt it was important to launch a debate involving 
the whole society. Three years later, I find myself again at 
1.30 in the morning demanding greater transparency and 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still have quite a way to go. That is why I will continue to 
make the rounds of CEGEPs and universities and to debate these 
issues. I encourage young people to follow the debate, to become 
politicized and to criticize the system in a constructive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next April 20, there will be protesters in the streets. I have 
talked to people my own age who have told me “Listen, Stéphan, 
if these kinds of things are going to happen, then I prefer to 
be run over”. This is what informed young people have been 
telling me. I have talked with them and they are well informed. 
They are prepared to get arrested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact remains that there is a problem. Either they are wrong, 
or there is a communications problem, with the public not 
understanding the government's decisions. Unquestionably, 
there is a problem.

order.  It is almost 2 a.m. and we do not need the pages in the 
House.  They have to go to study.  I ask for unanimous consent to 
allow the pages to go home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am made aware that in the debate at 
this time there is no unanimous consent, but we can look after 
that matter in another fashion.  I will intervene on everyone's 
behalf. 
<P><A NAME="LINK312"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank many of the other speakers we heard tonight for some very 
interesting debate and points of view.  I also wish to inform 
you, Mr. Speaker, that I will be splitting my time with the 
member for Winnipeg North Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin my remarks by restating something that was said by the 
member for Burnaby—Douglas.  He started his speech with a quote 
from the head of the former head of the WTO, Renato Ruggiero, who 
said that these trade agreements were necessary because: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a surplus of democracy in the world which is interfering 
with the free movement of capital and investment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That more than anything, perhaps, sums up the NDP's objections 
and apprehension about trade agreements like those we are 
entering into.  There is a significant group of people in the 
world today who honestly believe that there is a surplus of 
democracy in the world that is interfering with the movement of 
capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those same people would have us believe that the globalization 
of capital is a fait accompli, just a matter of fact that cannot 
be changed.  Yet when we come to them with the question of why we 
cannot have the globalization of human rights, labour standards 
and environmental standards, suddenly these are impossible.  They 
cannot even be debated.  There is no room for them at the 
negotiating table.  Those issues are not issues of any substance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Lac-Saint-Jean, in one of the most visionary 
things I heard tonight, asked if it would not be wonderful if the 
world's leaders would come together in some kind of virtual 
global assembly and actually talk about those issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would not be as apprehensive about these international 
agreements if we were comfortable that those things were being 
dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason it took the European Union 20 years to negotiate the 
EU agreement was that it dealt with those substantive issues.  It 
dealt with the issue of raising up the lowest common denominators 
to a harmonious average instead of gravitating to the lowest 
common denominator, as is contemplated in the virtually unchecked 
free trade agreements that we have now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am proud to say the NDP caucus will be in Quebec 
City.  We will be there in solidarity with those who have similar 
fears and apprehensions.  We will be involved in peaceful 
protest.  We were at APEC in Vancouver.  I was there, along with 
the members for Burnaby—Douglas, Yukon, and Vancouver East.  We 
were also in Windsor and Seattle.  We have been a part of this 
growing movement around the apprehension that more and more young 
Canadians feel about our democracy being diminished and that 
these trade agreements do constitute a legitimate threat to 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need no further evidence than the quote I gave, but another 
world leader, a former member of parliament, Donald Johnston, 
said “Free trade agreements by their very nature are designed to 
force adjustments on our societies”.  In other words, they 
dismantle the public policy instruments that we have laboriously 
put in place in the post-war era to take care of our personal 
needs and to grow independently with some autonomy.  Now we are 
told we must harmonize, at least when it comes to those public 
policy instruments, and dismantle them so that we do not 
interfere with the movement of capital by corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg—Transcona made a brilliant point.  He 
pointed out the bizarre spectacle of watching us willingly 
dismantle the nation state of Canada and our own economic 
sovereignty in order to accommodate a foreign corporate interest. 
Why would we do that?  When somebody does write the history of 
this era they are going to look at it as if we were crazy.  We 
are taking something as precious as true free democracy and we 
are knowingly and willingly weakening our ability to have our own 
domestic economic sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we need a graphic example, these spiralling out of control 
energy costs that most Canadians have been reeling with all 
winter are a good example.  Natural gas is a resource that we all 
own which is part of our birthright and part of our common 
wealth.  Yet we are not allowed any preferential pricing to 
Canadians because of NAFTA.  When we ask why it costs so much for 
something that we have in abundance underneath our own feet, the 
answer is that we cannot sell our natural gas any cheaper than we 
sell it to our export customers because of NAFTA.  We traded that 
away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder Canadians are apprehensive about what is in the actual 
text of the FTAA.  Every time we raise it we are assured that the 
government would not do anything foolish to jeopardize our health 
care system or our education system.  When NAFTA was negotiated, 
it was like <I>Jack and the Beanstalk</I> taking his cow and 
trading it for three beans with no guarantee that any of them 
would sprout. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will not tell us what it will be talking about or 
what it will be negotiating at the FTAA.  Members of parliament 
in the federal House of Commons do not have a right to know what 
the government is negotiating on our behalf around the table.  It 
is absolutely scandalous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know why we are not allowed to see that text.  It was pointed 
out in earlier speeches.  We found out the text of the MAI 
because somebody posted it on the Internet.  Within days every 
college kid in the country was reading this negotiated MAI text. 
They saw what was being given away.  They also saw a charter 
of rights for corporations at the expense of freely elected 
governments.  They recoiled with horror, took to the streets and 
they stopped it.  When we see the text we have a fighting chance 
to put an end to it or at least have our opinion known and be 
part of that debate.

<A HREF="#LINKT192"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I think it is an international conspiracy to keep 
this text secret.  If the government were serious about how it 
would never do anything to jeopardize the legitimate right of 
nations to dictate their own social policy instruments and that 
nothing it would do would interfere with social policy, then let 
us see the text.  We could put this whole thing to bed.  We would 
be in bed instead of being up in the middle of the night right 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other graphic illustrations.  How do we know that we 
are not going to get sucked into the worst properties of NAFTA 
with this FTAA.  It really is a super NAFTA that we are 
witnessing being created here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 11 of NAFTA, which was raised earlier, gives the 
investor state status whereby a foreign corporation can sue the 
Government of Canada if the government interferes with what the 
corporation perceives to be its right to make a living, and 
suffers some lost opportunity by something the government did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent example of this was when Canada wanted to ban MMT as a 
gasoline additive because it did not think it was healthy.  In 
fact, we think it is poisonous.  Ethyl Corporation that made MMT 
said that we could not interfere with its right to sell its 
product in our country and successfully sued us for many millions 
of dollars because of lost opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what I mean about how we are losing our ability to take 
care of our own domestic interests because of trade agreements we 
have signed.  It is not just radicalism.  It is not anti-anything 
to be apprehensive about the free trade agreement. If anything, 
the NDP caucus is for free trade.  We are free traders.  We agree 
we are a trading nation and that it is absolutely necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old definition of free trade used to be eliminating tariffs 
and barriers so that we could trade openly with other countries 
without barriers being imposed.  The new definition of free trade 
agreements goes very far beyond anything that was ever 
contemplated before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have a good reason to believe that even the services that 
we offer, because some of those services have been privatized or 
commercialized per se, are now subject to challenge under free 
trade agreements, things like education.  The more we flirt with 
the privatization of our public school system or our health care 
system, it could be that we will be subject to challenge by some 
American or international corporation that feels that they should 
be able to make a profit on offering that service in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are our fears, which we believe are legitimate.  We are 
proud to go to Quebec City and make those fears known.  We 
condemn the government for doing everything it can to stifle 
legitimate peaceful protest. 
<P><A NAME="LINK313"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the rest of the country had just 
listened to my hon. colleague for Winnipeg Centre, they would 
truly understand the apprehension that we in this party have 
toward the upcoming trade talks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreign corporations can sue Canadian crown corporations for 
legitimate services, as in the case of UPS suing Canada Post. 
Could the member elaborate a bit on what exactly happens when a 
foreign corporation sues a Canadian crown corporation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity 
to elaborate on that particular case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>UPS is the largest postal courier service in the world today. 
Canada Post offers a very good service to its customers with its 
Priority Post courier service.  Since that goes beyond basic 
ground letter mail service, UPS felt that it should be allowed to 
bid on that work.  In fact, UPS is suing the Government of Canada 
for $160 million U.S. in lost opportunities because it believes 
it could do the job better.  It believes it has a right to bid on 
that work.  It does not believe that the Government of Canada has 
a right to withhold that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine the impact of this.  It is not just somebody else 
providing that service.  Canada Post offsets the cost of 
providing regular ground and household mail through the profits 
it makes in its courier service.  If somebody picks the low 
hanging fruit as we say, or in other words cherry picks the most 
profitable part of the corporation and takes that away from 
Canada Post, it will seriously impact its ability to offer ground 
mail service at the 46 cents or 47 cents that we enjoy today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity, however late the 
hour, to participate in this debate on the upcoming summit of the 
Americas in Quebec City where, as we have all noted tonight, 34 
heads of state will gather to discuss creating the free trade 
agreement of the Americas and where thousands of concerned 
Canadians will gather to express their dreams and aspirations 
about the country and about our responsibility as a nation on the 
global front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very fitting that we are having this parliamentary debate 
at the same time and in the same week an extra-parliamentary 
organization came together to press for a moratorium on expanding 
worldwide talks to liberalize trade.  I am referring to a 
coalition of non-government organizations that believes, quite 
legitimately so, that the expansion of trade talks opens the door 
to the privatization of essential public services and, as many of 
my colleagues have said tonight, erodes the authority of 
democracies over such vital programs as health care, education 
and a vast array of public service sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is really the issue of the hour.  That is at the heart of 
the concerns being raised by my colleagues in the NDP.  Certainly 
it is at the heart of the matter being addressed by concerned 
Canadians everywhere.  After all, what we are talking about is 
our identity as a nation, our sense of who we are as Canadians, 
the ties that bind and the values that we bring to the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, we are talking about our ability as a nation to control 
our own destiny and the ability of our own government to shape 
the future, to set the agenda, not to leave it to multinational 
corporations that these days seem to be determining every aspect 
of our day to day living.  We are talking about national programs 
that serve the public good, as my leader the member for Halifax 
said, now being reduced to commodities to be bought, sold and 
traded on the market for private gain.  This possibility is 
really at the heart of this debate, and I think it is that which 
motivates so many Canadians to get involved, to rise up and to 
speak out about the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the questions for us today is this.  Are health, 
education and other public services actually protected under 
FTAA?  I do not think we can answer that because there is so much 
secrecy, such lack of transparency and so many barricades around 
this issue that it is impossible to really know.  Just as the 
government refuses to share the draft agreement with all 
Canadians, it has not released its proposals for services being 
negotiated under FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think it is probably reasonable, based on past 
practice of the government, to assume that the approach by the 
government will be consistent with its approach to the WTO 
negotiations on GATS, or the General Agreement on Trades in 
Services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole point of those talks is increased liberalization of 
trade in services.  That is the essence of the whole exercise. 
So it is reasonable to assume that we are talking about opening 
up trade opportunities in such lucrative areas as health, 
education, energy, water and the list goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem to us that the Canadian government has actually 
taken no steps in those negotiations and has made no commitment 
to fix the flaws in the proposed the GATS and in the wording of 
the GATS that make all public services, including Canadian 
medicare, vulnerable to a challenge.  Any exclusion being 
contemplated is being done on the most narrow of terms, only 
covering services and sectors which are completely within the 
public sector.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the degree to which privatization is occurring all around 
us and given the government's passive response to such 
developments as Alberta's private for profit hospital 
legislation, the situation really does look bleak.  It is really 
a double whammy of trade liberalization and passive privatization 
which is so deathly and so worrisome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a threat.  It exists now under NAFTA.  We have heard all 
kinds of opinion on that.  It looms even larger under GATS and is 
no doubt perpetuated, based on everything we know about the 
government, under FTAA.  It flows from the notion of equal 
access, and my colleague from Winnipeg Centre referenced it, to 
foreign opportunity and treatment that is no less favourable than 
that given to domestic interests.  It means allowing 
international trade tribunals to intrude into our own domestic 
health policies and other domestic policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I referenced in a question last week in the House, the 
Canadian Medical Association journal had an article that stated 
“There is reasonable certainty that a trade tribunal will be 
asked to rule on issues that are germane to the Canadian hospital 
sector”.  In other words, the exclusion of health services 
totally within the public domain no longer applies.  Hospitals 
become fair game for foreign investment and private competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same opinion was given in another reputable medical journal, 
<I>The Lancet</I> which said last December that public health is 
being traded for private wealth.  It referenced Canada's 
predicament because of bill 11 and how it will have an impact on 
all of this country's ability to govern our health care sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same conclusion we heard from a major study done by 
the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, authored by Matt 
Sanger, whose report was entitled, “Reckless Abandon: Canada, 
the GATS and the Future of Health Care”.  It concluded that 
whenever any part of health care is operated by a mix of 
government and private organizations, foreign corporations are 
thus entitled to join the competition on an equal footing with 
local ones.  It means that any new programs or any innovative 
health care reforms would be restricted.  We would lose control 
over the cost drivers while maintaining responsibility for paying 
the cost.  That is ridiculous.  Non-profit endeavours slip away, 
we are left to pay and foreign corporations are laughing all the 
way to the banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While talking about cost drivers, I want to look very briefly at 
drug prices because that gives us a good insight into how much we have 
already catered to multinational corporations.  Look at the fact 
that we are dealing with enormously escalating drug prices and 
yet the government feels compelled to cave in to multinational 
drug companies to protect their patent protection.  It broke its 
promise to rescind Bill C-91.  Now it has slipped through the 
back door Bill S-17 which would extend patent protection even 
more for brand name drug companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anything points to how captive we have become to this global 
international corporate agenda, this is probably the best 
example.  We can apply this as well to the situation we have all 
been hearing about in terms of South Africa.  It is being sued by 
some 40 pharmaceutical companies because it is trying to provide 
cheaper generic drugs to deal with the millions of people who are 
infected with HIV and AIDS.  I think that shows just how much of 
a problem this whole free trade agenda has become.  I could go on 
with many other examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that we are not opposed to global 
actions and treaties.  We know that there are discussions going 
on with respect to a global treaty on tobacco control.  That 
could be a good thing.  It might be one way we can stop the kind 
of massive control that tobacco companies have over the world, 
never mind just in this country.

<P><A NAME="LINK315"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member from Winnipeg eloquently 
stated the fact that drug companies are asking for further 
protection.  After their 20 year protection laws, now they are 
asking for 23 to 25 years, if I am not mistaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that since that protection law came 
into effect under the Conservative government, drug prices have 
risen almost fivefold.  We now spend more on drugs in the country 
than we do on doctors' fees.  That is an incredible problem the 
country has to face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was wondering if the member from Winnipeg could elaborate a 
bit more on that.  If this trade deal goes ahead as it is, does 
she see more escalating prices on drugs and a lowering of the 
effect that doctors have in the country as well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my 
colleague for that question and for all of the questions he has 
been asking throughout the debate.  He has played a very 
important role in ensuring that we have a thorough vetting of the 
discussion on the free trade agreement of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that in fact one of the critical issues at stake under 
FTAA is Canada's public health care system.  We all know we have 
big challenges ahead.  One of those challenges is escalating drug 
prices.  In fact, we know that drug prices are now the fastest 
rising element in our health care system.  Costs in terms of 
drugs have now surpassed costs associated with physicians and 
services provided by doctors.  That tells us a lot about the dire 
situation we are facing.  It demands action on the part of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are hearing from the government of the day that in fact its 
hands are tied because of trade agreements.  That has been the 
excuse for not following through on a promise to rescind Bill 
C-91, which was the patent protection legislation brought in by 
the Mulroney Conservatives.  We are now hearing, through new 
legislation introduced in the Senate, that the government has to 
comply with more WTO rulings and in fact extend patent protection 
even more for drug companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That will mean drug prices will rise considerably.  It will mean 
that the burden is placed on governments and on individuals to 
pay for drugs that are desperately needed for medical conditions. 
That is an untenable situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there are things we can do domestically and actions the 
government can still take, in the end if we do not find a way on 
the trade front to loosen the ties that are restricting us from 
acting, we are going to be in very serious difficulty.  That 
applies not only here in Canada but in countries like South 
Africa and Brazil, where there are huge problems and a desperate 
need for generic drugs and access to cheap alternatives.  It is a 
serious situation globally.  I think we have to play our role 
through every avenue we can, which means through FTAA, GATS, and 
any other trade negotiations underway.

hearing over the last couple of hours.  I will approach it from

</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, a couple of years ago in Seattle we saw bullies, 
goons and anarchists who wanted to shut down debate and 
discussion.  They used thoughtful people.  They used protesters 
who were sincerely and deeply concerned about the issue of free 
trade and related globalization issues.  They used those people 
as shields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore we have seen elaborate arrangements for security, in 
Calgary recently at the petroleum conference and now again for 
Quebec.  It is something that I personally have a lot of 
difficulty with.  I think that in Canada we have a unique 
situation.  For example, in the House of Commons we have one or 
two RCMP vehicles which are the only visible security on the 
Hill.  We know there is more security behind the scenes, but 
basically we are doing everything we possibly can to maintain 
civility and maintain a civil society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say that I have already mentioned in the House that I 
have some aggressive fundamental differences of opinion with the 
members of the NDP who have just spoken.  I do not see eye to eye 
with their concerns at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that is a right I have and that is a right they have 
within a civil society.  This is what democracy is all about.  We 
have a right to disagree.  There are, within the confines of 
Canada, tens of thousands and perhaps hundreds of thousands of 
people who share their perspective, who have the right to 
disagree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest, with respect, that an awful lot of the 
information they have is built on misunderstanding or 
misinformation.  Certainly the kinds of things that have been 
talked about do unfortunately breed fear, but I believe what it 
really comes down to is the fact that there is a fundamental lack 
of faith on the part of many citizens, not only in Canada but 
indeed within the hemisphere and perhaps within the world, in the 
presidents and the prime ministers who are negotiating these 
agreements.  There is a lack of faith in the governments that are 
negotiating these agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We come to acronyms, which of course are simply abbreviated 
letters that stand for things.  For example, the World Trade 
Organization is shortened to WTO.  The International Monetary 
Fund is shortened to IMF.  We have the FTA, NAFTA and now we have 
the FTAA, and of course we have the World Bank.  We have many of 
these things, and many Canadians who are concerned about these 
issues are asking what all these letters stand for, what these 
acronyms are all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw their attention, and with respect to my 
socialist friends at the other end of the House, I would like to 
draw their attention as well, to what Tony Blair, who is a 
leading socialist in Europe and the Prime Minister of the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, said in the House 
not 25 feet away from me.  I heard him say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time, I think, that we started to argue vigorously and 
clearly as to why free trade is right.  It is the key to jobs for 
our people, to prosperity and actually to development in the 
poorest parts of the world.  The case against it is misguided 
and, worse, unfair.  However sincere the protests, they cannot be 
allowed to stand in the way of rational argument.  We should 
start to make this case with force and determination. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not change the fact that there are tens of thousands 
of people in Canada who have a deep and abiding concern about 
these kinds of negotiations.  What is the answer?  I would like 
to humbly propose a solution to the government through the debate 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that one of the ways in which we could overcome this 
fear, this mistrust, would be to, as part of the trade 
negotiations, actually set up parliamentary associations that 
would represent parliamentarians from all parties, not only in 
the House but between the Republicans and the Democrats in the 
United States, and in all of the countries that are part of this 
agreement and have government and opposition.  Thus, 
parliamentarians would have an opportunity to be part of an 
ongoing oversight of the IMF, WTO, NAFTA, World Bank and any of 
these organizations about which Canadians are concerned.

<A HREF="#LINKT197"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would I be suggesting that?  As parliamentarians, we are not 
in the security bubble that our Prime Minister finds himself in. 
Unfortunately, because of the malevolent forces that there are in 
the world, he is by necessity in a security bubble.  As a 
parliamentarian I am in and out of coffee shops, schools and 
shopping centres.  I conduct town hall meetings.  I speak in 
rotary clubs.  I meet people on the street.  People come by my 
yard when I am at home on a Saturday and say hi.  I am reachable, 
I am touchable, by the people in my constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through a parliamentary association, we would have the 
opportunity to have input.  We would have the opportunity to have 
insight.  I suggest we would have the opportunity to build 
confidence on the part of people who are concerned about these 
organizations because we would be there and would have part of 
the oversight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happened to be in Valparaiso, Chile in January for the 
Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum, which is a forum much along the 
lines of what I am talking about here.  There were 26 nations 
around Asia-Pacific involved in that meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person in the House, in Canada, who is perhaps noted as 
being quite outspoken, to put it mildly, would be the member for 
Burnaby—Douglas.  He also was a member of the Asia-Pacific 
Parliamentary Forum.  He had the opportunity at that forum to go 
around to the various parliamentary delegations and bring forward 
a point of view.  He received a resolution on the floor that 
would not have happened had he not been there.  That is the kind 
of access I am suggesting we want to have as parliamentary 
associations, as ordinary parliamentarians, so parliamentarians 
would be able to oversee outfits like the World Bank, IMF, NAFTA 
and the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must have accountability.  I believe we have to build trust. 
We must have the ability to afford Canadians the opportunity to 
make their views known.  In regard to those concerns, those 
people who want to make those views known have a responsibility 
to denounce the bullies, the goons and the anarchists who take 
advantage of them and those demonstrations.  However, I also 
recognize that the thoughtful Canadians who do want to go and who 
do want to speak out must have a feeling of comfort, therefore my 
recommendation for a parliamentary association that has an 
oversight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that all thoughtful Canadians must be confident in the 
process.  Therefore, I humbly suggest that the idea of 
parliamentary associations, as part of the ongoing process, to 
oversee the process would go an awfully long way in taking the 
steam out of the fear and concern of thoughtful Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK317"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the views of the 
member from Kootenay when he speaks of getting together with a 
group of parliamentarians, not necessarily from the House but 
maybe from provincial legislatures and from other democracies 
around the world as well, to discuss these issues on a continuous 
basis to see where they can be changed.  Nothing is written in 
stone.  We need to alter, reflect, review and renew exactly what 
is going on.  I respect his views and it is something I believe 
the House could seriously look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, he discussed Mr. Blair, the prime minister of England, 
and his views.  I remember the speech very well.  Our party was 
the only party that did not clap when Mr. Blair spoke of the 
nuances in terms of free trade.  Our point is that Mr. Blair had 
a woeful ignorance toward the NAFTA deal when he tried to portray 
free trade or NAFTA as being similar to the European economic 
union deal.  That was simply nonsense.  They are simply two 
different things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. member from Kootenay and the Alliance 
Party is this:  does he not believe that the environment, human 
rights, labour standards and the ability of municipal, provincial 
and federal governments to enact laws to protect their citizens 
as they see fit should be paramount in any trade deals that are 
discussed in the near future?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a very good question, 
and again, we would have a fundamental difference of opinion on 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must have trade rules because trade constitutes 50% of 
Canada's $900 billion a year gross domestic product. 
Interestingly, NAFTA covers 80% of that 50%.  In other words, we 
are talking about almost $400 billion a year in gross domestic 
product which is generated by Canadian workers and industry. 
Therefore because we have NAFTA, we have been able, going back 
about five years, to dig our way out of the deep recession in 
which we found ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difference of opinion that I have with my friend in the NDP 
is that on balance, although there are exceptions, I believe that 
with the trade rules we presently have, NAFTA has been a net 
benefit to Canada in all of the areas the hon. member is talking 
about.  I am not inclined to believe that we are any poorer in 
environmental standards, labour standards or in any other area. 
On balance, I believe we are ahead of the game as a result of the 
negotiation of NAFTA. 
<P><A NAME="LINK318"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, thank you for your forbearance and that of the House 
officers and servants of the House in making it possible for 
myself and colleagues to continue this important debate on the 
upcoming summit on the free trade agreement of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out at the outset that this is an important matter, so 
important that indeed the government itself placed the issue 
before the House in the form of a take note debate.  Yet I am 
discouraged to report that it appears evident that far more 
members of the opposition parties, which represent 40% of the 
seats in the House, will have participated in the debate than 
members of the very government that brought it forward.  That 
reflects in part, I think, the esteem in which members of the 
government, with the very notable exception of the member for 
Yukon, hold this place as a chamber of democratic deliberation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian Alliance members have been very active in articulating 
their views about the positive elements of free trade and the 
impact it has on democracy.  I make special note of the very 
committed participation in this debate of the small but spirited 
and thoughtful contributions from the members of the New 
Democratic Party caucus, with whom I disagree for reasons of 
principle.  However, one cannot question their willingness to use 
this opportunity to express their very genuine concerns about 
this upcoming summit and the agreement which it will conclude in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members of my party have outlined our general support for 
the principle of free trade and the objectives of the upcoming 
summit.  However, let me just say as a matter of first principle 
that we often take for granted the incredible wealth of our 
society.  We hear Liberal politicians say, almost as a truism, 
that Canada is the finest country in the world in which to live 
and I concur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the principal reasons it is such a great country in which 
to live is the high degree of economic development that has 
resulted largely from a system of free markets.  As well, as a 
country that is an enormous exporter of goods and services, we 
benefit enormously and are enriched as a nation by trade across 
the world, particularly with nations within this hemisphere and 
in particular the United States of America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do take for granted this level of development.  We ought to 
occasionally reflect on the fact that today an average Canadian 
middle class family enjoys a standard of living that is virtually 
inconceivable for most of the world's population, most of the 
population of the western hemisphere and certainly most of the 
people who have ever lived throughout history.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Middle class Canadians, people of relatively modest means, enjoy 
goods and services, comforts and security, life expectancy and 
health, a level of education, disposable income and political 
freedom which is in the long context of human history almost 
unparalleled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be fair to say that a middle class family today enjoys 
greater economic benefits, in many respects more luxuries, than a 
Tudor king would have 500 years ago or a Roman emperor 2,000 
years ago.  We should think how tremendously we benefit from the 
advanced standards established by the free market system and the 
free trade system upon which it is predicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past couple of centuries the countries of the west, 
particularly northern Europe and North America, have seen by far 
the fastest rate of growth in the standard of living, increases 
in life expectancy, human health and wellness of any time in 
history.  That again is because of the system of trade which has 
allowed for efficiencies in national economies by exchanging the 
value of the goods which they produce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the leading contemporary political theorists, Michael Novak, 
wrote a brilliant book entitled <I>The Spirit of Democratic 
Capitalism</I> in which he attempted a theory to explain this 
tremendous political and economic freedom from which we benefit 
in this and other similar western societies.  He said that 
democratic capitalism stood on a three-legged stool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those three legs consist of first, a free market system 
predicated on private property and its entrenchment, and on the 
principle that people has a right to possess and retain the 
fruits of their labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it is predicated on a political system which itself is 
based on a conception of the human person which see the human 
person as possessing an inviolable dignity created in the image 
and likeness of God and, because of this inviolable dignity, 
entitled to self-government and a free democratic political 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third basic foundation of democratic capitalism according to 
Michael Novak is a moral culture based on virtue where the 
tendency of human nature to pursue one's best interests in the 
marketplace or in the political sphere is tempered by the moral 
impulse to try to be virtuous.  He said that these three things 
together were what have created a society with unparalleled 
wealth, prosperity and health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of principle, and as the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition said earlier today in his remarks on the motion, it is 
important that we make the moral case for free trade.  There are 
some 800 million people in this hemisphere, roughly 300 million 
of whom are participants in this cycle of prosperity.  However 
the vast majority of them live beneath what we in Canada would 
consider the poverty line and live with limited economic 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be generous and bring those people into the cycle of 
prosperity through trade, allowing them to sell to us the goods 
that they produce, the services which they provide and similarly 
to benefit from the additional economic choices and efficiencies 
from goods and services which we can export to them.  That is 
what the free trade agreement of the Americas is all about.  It 
is about expanding the cycle of productivity and hence prosperity 
to all 800 million inhabitants of this hemisphere.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there are many hysterical voices suggesting that this 
represents some hidden agenda to undermine democracy.  Many 
people with this point of view will be gathering in Quebec City 
engaging deliberately in campaigns of civil disobedience to 
disrupt the summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How dare these advocates of civil disobedience claim to 
represent the people and the civil societies of their respective 
countries and of Canada in particular?  Canadians who will be 
attending the summit in protest and who have been funded, 
shockingly, to the tune of $300,000 by the government in the 
so-called people's summit, represent a point of view so marginal 
that it obtains virtually no meaningful political support in the 
democratic elections of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to my colleagues in the NDP, their party received 
8% or 9% of the popular vote in the last general election, I 
believe, meaning that over 90% of Canadians rejected their 
message of protectionism vis-à-vis trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say in closing that those opponents of the agreement have no 
legitimate right to claim to be the champions of democracy.  Each 
of these national governments is accountable to its electorate. 
As we continue to increase economic prosperity we will create a 
middle class in these societies which will increase the stability 
of democratic institutions and democratic accountability.  That 
is the virtuous cycle into which we should invite all of the 
nations in the western hemisphere. 
<P><A NAME="LINK319"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I could not help but notice that 
the hon. member from Alberta, who I have a great respect for, 
mentioned the Mexican economy and the uplifting of that economy 
because of free trade.  The reality is that post-NAFTA in Mexico 
free trade has created one new billionaire and 100 new 
millionaires, but the average Mexican income since NAFTA has 
declined.  That is the reality.  That is the truth.  Also, the 
environmental concerns in Mexico have declined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. member is similar to a question that I 
had for the member for Skeena about the softwood lumber 
agreement.  The member for Skeena said, if I am not mistaken, 
that the Alliance Party supports equal access to the U.S. markets 
for our country's softwood lumber.  The reality is that in the 
maritime region 80% of the harvested lumber comes from private 
lands, whereas 80% to 90% of the harvested lumber in British 
Columbia comes from crown land.  Already there is a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to maintain the economic well-being of those lumber 
industries within Atlantic Canada, would the hon. member not 
support the maintaining of the maritime accord, which is in place 
and has been very beneficial for the people of Atlantic Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will do something a 
politician does not often do, which is to admit my ignorance with 
respect to the maritime element of the softwood export industry 
with regard to the United States.  I cannot intelligently comment 
or respond to his questions and I will not attempt to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say, however, that we are four-square for free trade in 
lumber generally because the countervailing measures the 
Americans are about to impose would be very detrimental to tens 
of thousands of working Canadians, including many members of 
unions who no doubt support my hon. colleague's party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding his assertions with respect to Mexico, my 
understanding is that living standards and incomes have risen as 
a result of the free trade regime.  Indeed, Mexicans recently 
elected, in the first really vibrant democratic election in their 
history at the national level, President Vicente Fox, a strong 
champion of free trade, who will be at the FTAA summit in Quebec 
City and will later travel to my own home city of Calgary. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2645"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT201"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>President Fox was elected in part by the Mexican people because 
they saw his advocacy of freer trade, less protection, less 
regulation, better multilateral relations within the hemisphere 
and bilateral relations with the United States as an integral 
part of paving the way to prosperity for that country.  Mexicans 
had a choice in their election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member's colleagues talk a lot about democracy and 
suggest that the FTAA somehow undermines it.  When it comes to 
the Mexican people making a sovereign, democratic decision, and 
the most significant democratic decision in their modern history, 
they chose a free trader.  They chose an advocate of the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not suggest the member for Sackville—Musquodoboit 
Valley—Eastern Shore is guilty of this, but I do believe there 
are some in this place, and in the country, who are guilty of a 
paternalistic attitude toward people in the developing world, 
that they do not know what is best for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mexican people spoke pretty clearly about what they thought 
was in their best interests in a democratic election when they 
endorsed President Fox's agenda for free trade and economic 
growth.  If we are truly committed to democracy, rather than 
throwing Molotov cocktails at police in Quebec City, we should 
listen to the citizens and the electorates in the developing 
world who are choosing democracy, free markets, free trade and 
rejecting closed economic systems that have failed them for too 
many decades. 
<P><A NAME="LINK320"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with my colleague from 
Acadie—Bathurst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rose at this time in particular because I sensed the debate is 
nearing an end.  I want to spend a few minutes speaking about the 
impact that the trade agreements, NAFTA in particular, have had 
on the environmental position in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout this debate there have been various references made 
to some of the cases that have arisen.  The one I want to 
mention, because I do not think it has been touched upon other 
than in passing, is the S.D. Myers v Canada case.  The company 
was suing Canada, as it was allowed to do under the NAFTA 
agreement, because we would not export hazardous waste to the 
United States.  We closed our borders to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the sovereign country of Canada taking a very 
environmentally sound position, one in fact that we were required 
to take under the Basel convention which deals with transboundary 
movement of hazardous waste.  We were required under that 
convention to deal with our own hazardous waste.  S.D. Myers 
wanted to treat our hazardous waste in the United States.  When 
we closed our borders to that, the company sued us and won the 
decision. 
Canada ended up being punished for being a good international 
citizen, if I could put it that way.  We followed the convention 
that we entered into in good faith with a number of other global 
partners but were then confronted under NAFTA to breach that 
convention. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2650"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT202"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the lawyers looked at this and speaking of the S.D. 
Myers v Canada decision said “It offers an interpretation of 
NAFTA rules that is so vague and confusing that it is tantamount 
to saying Canada is in breach of its NAFTA obligations because we 
say so”.  I will come back to this later because one of the 
points I want to make is about the impact of NAFTA and trade 
agreements on our sovereignty, and more important on our 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other case I want to deal with is the Metalclad case to 
which other speakers have referred.  From the environmentalist 
standpoint, it shows the essential lack of integrity that is part 
of the whole trade arrangement.  I mean integrity in terms of 
protecting the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This case involved a relatively impoverished municipality being 
faced with a claim that it had to accept toxic waste.  Anyone 
would say that a municipality could not be forced to accept the 
waste.  There is no arrangement in the world that should make a 
municipality take into its relatively impoverished municipal 
structure, by international standards, a huge toxic waste.  Lo 
and behold to its surprise and shock it was told that it had to 
accept the dump.  As we all know, that case is under appeal. 
Given the past practises of interpretations under NAFTA, one has 
to wonder about the possibility or even hope of success on that 
appeal.  There are also a number of other cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A resolution was passed a week or so ago in the House and was 
supported by all parties I believe, except the NDP.  It was moved 
by our friends in the Bloc.  We voted against it out of concern 
for the environment.  The resolution dealt with the softwood 
lumber issue.  If we continue to go into these types of trading 
arrangements, we continue to expose ourselves to the types of 
rulings I just mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are really talking about in a trading arrangement, 
whether it be with the United States, Mexico or the rest of the 
hemisphere, is one that recognizes the sovereignty of Canada, 
recognizes democracy and recognizes our rights as a country to 
protect our environment, human rights and labour standards.  We 
hear these themes on a continuous basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak briefly about democracy.  I made a list of 
the abrogation of democracy that we see and have seen since the 
free trade agreement which came in in the late eighties.  At the 
top of that list is our loss of sovereignty.  Faceless 
bureaucrats sit someplace making decisions that affect us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the comments from my friend from Alberta, we have a 
situation where our youth feel that the only way they can express 
their opposition to these agreements is by taking to the streets, 
not as he suggested with violence in mind but simply exercising 
their democratic right to say this is their country, they live 
here and they have a right in terms of freedom of expression to 
say what the country is doing is wrong. 
What will they be faced with?  Barricades and what, in effect, 
will amount to a police state in Quebec City in the latter part 
of April.  This is something I can attest to very strongly.  We 
faced the same thing in my home riding last June.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would ask my hon. colleague for 
Windsor—St. Clair this question.  The auto pact, which 
served Canada extremely well since 1965 if I am not mistaken, is 
now gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member please tell the House exactly what fears those 
auto plant workers and their families have now that the auto pact 
is gone? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Windsor-Essex county 
community was a major beneficiary of the auto pact.  The term we 
always heard about the auto pact was managed trade and fair 
trade.  We did not hear the same for free trade.  The auto pact 
allowed Windsor-Essex county to develop, what was in fact 
historically a huge development, the auto industry in our area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my friend pointed out, we lost that agreement last month, 
again because of a trading arrangement ruling.  Our residents are 
very concerned about the consequences.  We no longer have a fair 
trading arrangement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me use one example.  The Mexican jurisdiction, that economy, 
is building cars in significant numbers now.  To compare the 
arrangements, on average a worker in Windsor in one of the large 
auto plants is earning in excess of $20 an hour.  With benefits 
and all the rest it is roughly $30 an hour.  The same auto worker 
in Mexico, building the same type of vehicle, is being paid on 
average $1 an hour.  That is not fair trade.  It may be, by some 
of the other definitions we have heard of trade, free trade. 
However, it is not fair trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mexican economy seriously undermines the position of labour 
in Canada and does little, if anything, to advance the cause of 
labour in Mexico.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This meeting, the summit of the Americas, follows on meetings in 
Prague, Seattle and Washington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party is squarely opposed to such an 
exercise. It believes that civil society should be able to 
participate in the negotiation of international trade agreements 
and discuss the adoption of fair trade practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Giving the green light to the free trade area of the Americas at 
this summit will seriously compromise citizen-based democracy and 
the principle of fair trade practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a country based on trade.  International trade is an 
important part of our economy. 
Since Canada's approval of the free trade agreement, we have 
negotiated a series of trade agreements that put the interests 
of multinational corporations and international investors ahead 
of the interests of workers, the environment and democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that a number of Canada's public policies 
have fallen victim to international trade agreements. For 
example, the conservation of fish stocks, support for Canadian 
publishers, standards for toxic gasoline additives, generic 
drugs legislation, funding for research and development in 
Canada's high tech sectors, and the auto pact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not so long ago, we had the negotiations of the MAI, where we 
tried to reproduce the NAFTA rules for investment with 
industrialized countries, and use the NAFTA as a model for trade 
agreements with the rest of the world.  The New Democratic Party 
has always been against the MAI negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988, public protests managed to put an end to the MAI 
project.  Even France and Australia rejected it as a threat to 
their democracy, whereas our government, incredibly, was in 
favour.  We were lucky enough to get hold of the documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been said time and time again in the House this evening, 
the document was posted on the Internet and people around the 
world were able to see it, and were able to talk about the 
changes that were to take place and that would hurt society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party is not against trade. 
Quite the contrary, we support fair trade, managed in a social 
context of respect for social development, the environment, and 
the rights of workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These negotiations are far from being rooted in this context. 
The federal government is constantly telling us that these 
negotiations are being held with all respect for Canadians and 
in the best interests of Canada.  Then why not make the 
negotiating documents of these trade agreements public? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the Liberal government has a serious lack of 
transparency.  If we look at the Grand-Mère issue and now the 
summit of the Americas, this is becoming a daily problem for the 
Liberal government.  The New Democratic Party firmly believes 
that trade agreements should be tabled in the House of Commons 
and debated in depth by members of the House and the public 
before being signed by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government hiding in this agreement? Why hide an 
agreement from Canadians? Why should we trust cabinet? Why 
should we trust a head of state? Why should we trust heads of 
state who are incapable of presenting it to the public? What are 
they hiding? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the word democracy is used, one very quickly realizes 
that in the context of the summit of the Americas this word no 
longer has the usual meaning. On the contrary, values and 
interests are reduced to commercial and economic ones, to the 
advantage of private, selected corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has a duty to look after the interests of 
all its citizens, including the public services that make Canada 
a model country as regards its social policies: health 
insurance, health care, health protection regulations, public 
education, social service programs, water programs and 
environmental services.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Previous negotiations have had a direct impact here in Canada, 
resulting, for example, in an increase in child poverty. The 
number of children living in poverty in Canada has risen by 60% 
since 1990, even though parliament committed itself to 
eliminating child poverty.  In our view this is unjustifiable 
and unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec alone, there has been a marked increase in social 
assistance recipients, from 595,000 in 1991 to 793,000 in 1997. 
It is fine to say that the unemployment rate has fallen, but you 
have to remember that the welfare rolls have grown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, Canadian are working harder to maintain the same wage 
levels they had 20 years ago, because they work longer hours. 
It is hard to imagine they will improve their lot in life this 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks before the Seattle negotiations in 1999, the Minister 
for International Trade clearly confirmed that he favoured the 
freeing of health and education services as a priority for the 
discussions of WTO negotiations.  The NDP believes that this 
approach will lead to a two tier health system, as well as an 
education system for the poor and another for the rich, which is 
unacceptable.

which people care about one another, work together and help one 
another out; our dream of families and children who look to the

that last week the Minister for International Trade, 
stated categorically when he was talking about the 
GATT and FTAA positions, that public education was not at risk.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of NDP members talk very positively about trade now, 
which they did not do a few years back.  I am not taking issue 
with that.  People change as the world changes.  The member's 
argument was a weak one.  I would like to address some of their 
other admirable points they have on things where the position is 
not on the table and things might be in jeopardy, but it has been 
made categorically clear that this other one is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I heard the point right, it was that we have less disposable 
income now than we did 20 years ago.  Is not at least part of 
that because of the increased social programs we have now? Health 
care is much more efficient.  More drugs have been invented and 
we have to pay for them.  We have higher levels of international 
aid than we did 20 years ago.  There are a lot more environmental 
controls than there were.  All these have costs, but I think 
these are all things that the NDP generally agree with.  Are they 
not part of the reason that disposable income is less? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is not because of that. 
We agreed to fair trade not free trade.  The NDP was very clear 
about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we have people with less income?  We have them because in 
1989, 1990 and 1992, when the Conservatives were cutting the 
employment insurance, for example, the Liberals promoted the 
idea that if they were ever to come to power they would not make 
those cuts but would restore employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, they cut employment insurance to the point where only 
35% of Canadians who pay into it can collect employment 
insurance.  We now have poor that we have never seen before, with 
800,000 people who do not qualify for employment insurance.  The 
Liberals did that.  Approximately 1.4 million children are hungry 
in our country.  The Liberals did that during their term from 
1993 to now.  They should be ashamed of themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the reason they made the cuts was free trade.  They 
had to answer to the Americans and to the Mexican people.  That 
is what they did to free trade.  The free trade we were supposed 
to get was supposed to bring up the standard of living of those 
people, not bring down the standards for Canadians.  That is what 
the Liberals have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we do not trust what the minister says:  because 
what the Liberals say is not what they do.  We cannot trust them. 
If they want us to trust them, they have to give us the document 
to read.  We are not stupid.  We have a responsibility as 
parliamentarians and we should be able to have the document.  It 
does not belong only to the Minister of Industry or the Minister 
for International Trade.  It belongs not to them but to 
parliamentarians and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be able to make our decisions, not just put our faith 
in the Liberals, who have hurt the country very badly.  They have 
very badly hurt the working people in Canada.  That is why we do 
not trust the Liberals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give some background facts on the free trade area of the 
Americas, commonly called the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a political and economic transformation taking place in 
this trading bloc.  Today there are no military dictatorships, 
while in 1995 there were 14.  In 1950 Canada and Argentina held 
similar developmental levels but there is a disparity today. 
Canada has invested $12 billion in Chile, three times more than 
we have in Japan.  Canada invested $42 billion in the Americas 
outside the U.S.A.  Over 90% of goods from Latin and Central 
America and the Caribbean come to Canada duty free these days. 
Canada exports about 45% of our GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go over the enormous benefits of free trade.  It will 
broaden our trading rights.  It is mutually beneficial to 
participating countries.  It gives consumers better choice of 
goods and services, and at a cheaper price too, as compared to 
tariff protected economies.  It helps us get value added 
products.  It brings about prosperity, development, job creation 
and economic developments.  It enhances freedom of enterprise, 
democracy and good governance as well as the voluntary exchange 
of goods, services and money.  It protects intellectual property 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 11 of NAFTA gives protection to Canadian investors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance supports free trade and, in principle, we 
support FTAA initiatives.  The liberal Prime Minister of the 
U.K., Tony Blair, emphasized in this House the importance of free 
trade.  I will politely remind our NDP colleagues of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also remember that it was the Liberal Party of Canada 
that fought hard against free trade between Canada and the U.S. 
The Liberals lost the 1988 election based on that policy plank. 
The Right Hon. John Turner led the members opposite to a crushing 
defeat because he opposed expanding trade with our largest 
trading partner.  At that time the Liberals said that Canada 
would cease to exist as a country and we would lose our 
sovereignty if the FTA was passed.  Canadians did not fall for 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have made a 180 degree turn.  We all know what we 
call that in politics.  Today we are wary of the Liberal 
government's trade policy.  We have seen failed team Canada 
missions.  In the majority of them, our exports to those 
countries dropped significantly and our trade declined after the 
team Canada visit.  That is a matter of record.  The facts and 
figures speak for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some people who say that Canada should be 
investigating this kind of summit with western Europe.  East-west 
trade may also be beneficial to Canada in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also notable that trade barriers within Canada remain in 
place.  There are more barriers to trade between British Columbia 
and New Brunswick or other provinces than there are between B.C. 
and Washington state.  That issue is not on the thin soup agenda 
of the House because the Liberals are not serious about it. 
There has never been a serious dialogue for federal and 
provincial co-operation.  The government has always had a 
confrontational approach with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have a number of questions to which the government has 
failed to provide clear answers.  What exactly would be Canada's 
role in the FTAA?  How exactly does Canada benefit from the 
summit?  I am afraid Canada will go to the summit with poorly 
done homework and with its usual weak position.  It is difficult 
to debate the issue because so little has been made public by the 
government.  What criteria should the government be using to 
promote trade relations in the FTAA? 
Will the Liberal government expand its aid for trade policy? That 
scenario plays out with the Liberal government using Canada's 
foreign aid like a carrot and then invoking trade policies with a 
stick on underdeveloped and disadvantaged nations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Liberals measure the benefits of the FTAA against the 
cost of dealing with countries that do not follow good governance 
practices?  Will the government hold those nations accountable 
for their human rights records?  What about democratic values and 
how will they be defined?  What about trade sanctions?  The 
government is all over the map when it comes to applying trade 
sanctions against rogue states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could say that there is a double standard, but it may be a 
triple standard or even worse.  There is no method to the madness 
that the government uses when deciding about trade sanctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not listen to Canadians.  The Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade recommended 
separating into two categories the sanctions we have against 
Iraq.  The committee recommended that military and humanitarian 
sanctions be separated and that humanitarian sanctions be 
discontinued.  What has happened since that unanimous 1999 
committee report?  Absolutely nothing has been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The weak, arrogant Liberal government negotiated the MAI in 
secrecy for over a year before Canadians found out.  If the 
Liberal government had been listening to Canadians, there would 
have been no need for the people's summit that is running 
parallel to the Quebec summit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about Canada's disputes with other nations when it comes to 
agriculture, softwood lumber or fisheries?  Are any of these 
issues in the briefcase that our government is bringing to the 
summit?  Canadians do not know because the Liberals are not 
telling us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the Liberals doing about the low Canadian dollar and 
high taxes?  These issues are barriers to Canada's abilities to 
negotiate free trade agreements and attract investors.  The 
Liberals have to drag our low value dollar with them around the 
world, which does not help us in negotiations with other nations. 
Are trade subsidies on the table?  Is our dispute with Brazil on 
the table? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most notably, Canadians are wondering about international crime 
and organized crime.  Will we be expanding our trade with nations 
that are affecting our country as a result of the drug trade, 
human smuggling, money laundering or bank and computer fraud? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also carefully assess whether all countries 
participating in the summit are abiding by existing international 
trade agreements.  Unfortunately, parliament has had no role in 
helping to set the parameters of Canada's negotiation position in 
the talks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we in our party believe that it is essential to 
allow parliamentarians in on the process, including a full debate 
and a free vote on any agreement.  We believe it is important to 
foster a healthy economic environment for the benefit of 
consumers by pursuing free and open trade at home and abroad.  We 
support securing access to international markets through the 
negotiation of trade agreements, but we must proceed carefully.

from British Columbia is simply this:  does he or does he not 
believe that subjects like health care, education, and water and 
sewer systems in major centres should be part of the negotiation 
process in the FTAA?  A yes or no answer would suffice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the short answer is yes. 
In the second summit, the main theme was education.  It would be 
very healthy to promote other social services agendas as well, 
for example, health care or other services that are offered to 
the 800 million people in this trade bloc.  It would be a very 
good idea.

couple of comments.  The hon. member talked about the provinces. 
One of the things I could never countenance in the Alliance

</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been numerous federal-provincial agreements this

fair to say that the provinces and the federal government do not 
work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talking about the high tax regime, the largest tax cut in 
Canadian history has just come into effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is related to the hon. member's comment on the level

would he do about the jobs that would be lost in the Canadian 
export industries if the dollar was artificially raised? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. 
member's interest in this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the provinces.  The Canadian Alliance strongly 
believes that there should be a co-operative approach in dealing 
with the provinces, not the confrontational approach which his 
party is practising at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has an absolutely confrontational 
approach with the provinces.  That is why many issues are not 
being resolved, particularly the trade barriers which continue. 
That is why the confederation is not working.  It could work 
better if the provinces and the federal government shared 
responsibilities and if they had dialogue and co-operation on 
various issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding high taxes, he alleges that the highest tax cuts in 
Canadian history have recently taken place.  That is nonsense. It 
is not true.  The highest tax hike since the Liberals took power 
in 1993, was in the CPP.  I remember it was the first bill we 
debated in the House.  It implemented a 73% tax increase.  That 
was the largest tax increase in Canadian history and it took 
place under this regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member spoke about lost jobs.  When the Canadian dollar is 
strong we do not lose jobs.  It helps to restore credibility and 
trust in our economy.  I would appreciate it if the hon. member 
would go over these issues in detail.  I probably answered his 
questions contrary to his opinion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK327"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House 
to speak on this particular issue.  It is maybe on account of the 
hour of the day but there is an incredible level of peace in this 
place, peace that I am not used to on a normal basis.  It makes 
it somewhat exciting to be able to speak under those conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking in this particular debate is like déjà vu when I 
reflect on the last parliament and the issue of the MAI.  The 
official opposition, by way of a motion on opposition day, raised 
the issue of being able to debate what the government's position 
was going into the negotiations on the MAI.  Here we are again 
having somewhat of an emergency debate to try to find out what 
the government's position will be in this particular round of 
negotiations on the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the MAI, the official opposition put its cards 
on the table.  We said we were in favour of free trade, as we had 
always been, however we wanted to know exactly what the 
government's position would be going into the negotiations.  We 
did not get the type of transparency we would have liked at that 
point in time.  Ironically enough we are not getting it now as we 
enter into this particular round of negotiations on the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other ironic thing is that this particular government, prior 
to 1993, was adamantly against free trade.  Now it is a great 
defender of it.  However, once again it is under the table and is 
not as transparent as Canadians would like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the agenda planned for the Quebec round of meetings, 
the three areas of discussion are very honourable.  We have 
strengthening democracy, creating prosperity and realizing human 
potential. 
All those topics are of great interest to Canadians and to the 
different countries involved in the negotiations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition is, as I say, in favour of free trade, 
but clearly we are concerned about issues of sovereignty that 
pertain to all topics on the agenda.  If the government were 
forthcoming about its negotiating position and allowed public 
consultation and debate, we would not have the unfortunate 
violent demonstrations we have seen in the past.  Instead it 
could encourage a constructive agenda for managed globalization 
that is consistent with the rule of international law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a large part of the global economy at stake, the FTAA 
agenda and issues are enormous.  The meetings are a tremendous 
opportunity to further the interests of Canadian consumers and of 
our agriculture, manufacturing and service sectors.  They are 
also an ideal forum for promoting human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the world's political and business leaders have a 
responsibility to take seriously issues of democratic freedom, 
sustainable use and development of the environment, and the 
preservation of national and cultural identities within a global 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However as Canadians we also must take seriously the challenge 
to be provocative, rather than reactive, agents of change within 
the global economy.  I am convinced that is the greatest thing we 
can do to protect and advance our unique national interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would especially like to say a few words to younger Canadians. 
Young people know the forces of change at work today.  We are 
being ushered into a revolutionary digital age.  Information 
technology has already begun to transform the way we live, work, 
do business and communicate.  During our lifetimes we will 
witness another revolution yet unknown to humankind.  The 
challenge is to take our place within the revolution of change 
and globalization, not to resist it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The future for innovators in business, job creation and policy 
making will be a delicate dance of balancing interests.  We must 
seek to balance economic interests with the environment and to 
balance national interests, identities and cultures with 
international ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians we have much to protect but just as much, if not 
more, to offer the rest of the world.  Not only do we have goods 
and services to trade, we can offer energy and hope.  We are a 
young country brimming with potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can offer a quality of leadership formed from centuries of 
pioneering a new frontier in the face of adversity.  At meetings 
like the FTAA, Canada has a much better chance of creating a 
level trading field globally and ensuring member rights are 
protected and national interests are balanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without such meetings there is much less hope for balance and 
for just societies within the emerging global economy.  We should 
seek to use our position of influence as a world leader to set 
the agenda at the FTAA and future WTO meetings.  We must find our 
voice among the nations of the world and demonstrate leadership 
and courage as we embrace globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Global change is inevitable.  We can only determine how we will 
respond to it and where and how, as leaders, we can make 
globalization something to be celebrated rather than feared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we cannot emphasize enough the importance of a 
transparent and open process.  We need to engage Canadians and 
make them feel they are part of the democratic process.  That is 
why many of my colleagues, and I think many Canadians, continue 
to insist we have a full and open debate on the issue and even, 
to some extent, public consultation.  Hopefully we can move it to 
a free vote in the House of Commons so that Canadians truly feel 
the government has their interests at hand before it signs any 
form of international trade agreements.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I asked the hon. member for Surrey 
Central if he believed health, education, water and sewer and 
public services should be part of an FTAA agreement, and his 
answer was yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member for Edmonton—Strathcona would agree 
that health, education and public services such as water and 
sewer should be on the FTAA negotiating table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to answer 
that question with a yes or no.  However to qualify my answer it 
is important to note that, yes, those things should be discussed, 
but only in the context of protecting our sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in my speech, it is important that we not cover our 
eyes on issues that I think are of great concern to Canadians.  I 
think many countries have an interest in what we have to offer on 
these issues.  However we need to put it in the context of the 
negotiations.  We need to have the attitude that we can protect 
those things Canadians feel are so important.  In the process of 
trying to make them better we need to make sure that we do not 
lose the balance we have been able to create in protecting those 
public institutions that are so sacred. 
<P><A NAME="LINK329"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, you have been very patient with me 
so far today and I appreciate it.  I will say, as probably the 
last speaker in the House today, that we in the NDP and many 
others throughout the country and around the world, believe 
democracy itself is threatened by the FTAA.  We need go no 
further than the Metalclad decision, the one that should be 
coming up in the appeals, or the UPS decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>UPS is now suing Canada Post because Canada Post had the 
audacity to have a courier system, which, by the way, supplements 
other postal services in the country.  UPS, an American firm, is 
saying Canada Post cannot do that and that it will sue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of British Columbia is being sued because it had 
the audacity to try to protect its bulk water.  Across the 
country, we believe, environmental concerns such as water, lumber 
and everything else are at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was absolutely shocking in the House to hear, once and for 
all, a member of the Alliance Party tell it like it is and say 
that, yes indeed, health, education and other public services 
should be on the table when we negotiate the FTAA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We knew all along that was the Alliance's position.  We knew all 
along it was the Conservative position.  We had a sneaking 
suspicion all along that it was the government's position.  It is 
amazing what happens at this hour of the morning.  The truth 
eventually does come out.  It is shocking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member for Surrey Central has told the 
people in his riding that health, education and other public 
services should be on the table.  I do not think he would 
represent the riding for long if he were forthright enough to 
tell them that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Conservatives negotiated free trade they forgot to 
include a shipbuilding policy.  The United States protected 
itself with what is called the Jones Act, which says a ship 
carrying freight between New York and Miami must be American 
built, American crewed, American registered, everything American. 
Canada forgot to protect its own shipbuilding industry, and it 
will now be virtually impossible to institute a shipbuilding 
policy in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would encourage the Minister of Industry to include one and 
to do everything in his power to rebuild the industry so that 
thousands of people can go back to work in shipyards in Saint 
John, Marystown or Halifax.  However, I suspect that with talks 
continuing the way they are it will be virtually impossible for 
him to do so unless he takes a stand and says no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard the member from Calgary say in the House that 
there will be Molotov cocktails, violence and everything else 
like that. 
No one in the NDP has said that.  We have said only that we have 
the democratic right to attend a people's conference, a citizens' 
initiative from a broad section of society in Canada and around 
the world, to register our protest to people on the other side of 
the fence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To suggest we would disrupt the proceedings in the buildings 
behind the fence is to suggest we would be going over the fence. 
That is simple nonsense.  More than 5,000 police officers will be 
there to make sure we do not.  I was planning to wear a scarf in 
case it got cold, but I understand there will be a bylaw in 
Quebec that if people wear scarves they could be arrested. 
Imagine that.  The member wants to know why we are nervous about 
the talks going on behind the fence when the municipal government 
enacts a bylaw to prevent people from wearing scarves.  It is 
simply incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance, the Liberals, the Conservatives and the Bloc are 
concerned about the NDP attending the people's conference.  I 
attended a civil disobedience event in my own riding.  A few 
years ago the Volvo plant was to leave Halifax and move to 
Mexico.  It was to leave without looking after the workers.  What 
did the workers do?  They occupied the plant, but in a very 
peaceful way.  That was civil disobedience.  They occupied a 
private piece of property and just sat there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who attended the rally to support them?  That great dissident of 
all time, the current premier of Nova Scotia, John Hamm, was 
there to support the workers of the Volvo plant.  Guess who else 
was there?  Another great dissident of democracy, former Halifax 
mayor Walter Fitzgerald, was there to support the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin:</B>  Anarchists, that is what they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Yes, anarchists.  How dare they, a 
Conservative premier of Nova Scotia and a self-professed Liberal 
mayor of Halifax, support working people in the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guess who else was there?  Lo and behold, yours truly.  Imagine 
that.  We had a Conservative, a Liberal and a New Democrat 
standing together outside the plant to listen to speeches in 
support of the workers and to support their quest for fair 
compensation for the years of service they had dedicated to 
Volvo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guess what?  Not one light bulb was broken.  The plant was 
cleaner after the protest than when we went in.  The workers got 
what they deserved.  They did not maintain their jobs, but they 
kept their dignity and respect and received better pensions. That 
is civil disobedience 101.  That is how it is done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lo and behold, the premier of Nova Scotia was there, the mayor 
of Halifax was there, and I was there:  the great anarchists of 
our society.  Imagine a member of parliament, the premier of Nova 
Scotia and the mayor of Halifax, great dissidents of democracy. 
It is absolutely incredible that those three anarchists could be 
there supporting working people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the Alliance, the Liberals, the Bloc and the 
Conservatives be so nervous about the NDP going there?  I think 
there is an underlying tone to what they are saying.  I believe 
that in their heart of hearts they know the FTAA will be a very 
frightening proposition for Canada.  Municipal, provincial and 
federal governments in the future will lose the ability to enact 
laws or bylaws to protect the citizens of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen?  All of a sudden we will hear that they cannot 
do something because of the trade agreements, or that they cannot 
enact protective laws because of the trade agreements.

this country have seniors found life harder.  If we really want 
to see the inadequacies of this trade deal, we can look at what 
it has done to our seniors, one of the most vulnerable groups of 
people in the country.  Ask the seniors in my riding and across 
the country.  The choices they have to make now are among food, 
home heating fuel and prescription drugs.

anything about energy prices.  Because of these trade deals we 
cannot do anything about drug prices.  Because of these trade 
deals we cannot support and protect our farmers.  Our seniors are 
saying that they elected us to do something about it and are 
asking us why we have not done anything.  However, we hide behind 
the cloak of the trade deals.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, to close 
this debate at 10 minutes to 4 o'clock in the morning, I would 
like to make one point related to loss of freedom.  Loss of 
sovereignty has recently been mentioned by a few members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people join a family they give up some freedom, some 
sovereignty.  For example, they cannot choose the same holidays. 
However, there is a larger benefit.  When I chose to live in a 
subdivision I could not drive as fast as I wanted.  I had to give 
up some freedoms, some sovereignty, but it was for something 
better in my life.  When I decided to live in the city of 
Whitehorse, one of the great cities of Canada, I was not allowed 
to light firecrackers indiscriminately and I could not make noise 
late at night.  However, it is a great city to live in and what I 
have gained is more than what I gave up.  It is all part of the 
great social contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I chose to be part of the Yukon territory I gave up certain 
things.  I cannot drive at certain speeds.  I cannot take my boat 
to go fishing down Teslin Lake from Yukon territory into B.C. 
without another fishing licence.  However, the Yukon territory is 
a great place to live and there is a great co-operation among 
Yukoners.  They are wonderful people.  What I have gained is 
greater than what I gave up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I decided to live in Canada, I accepted laws and rules that 
I have to follow as part of the great social contract.  For 
example, I must have a passport to leave Canada and to get back 
in.  However, I chose that because what I have gave up is less 
than what I have achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When countries joined the United Nations after the second world 
war, they gave up some of their sovereignty so that such horrific 
things as the two world wars would never happen again.  They gave 
up sovereignty for something better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same applies to world treaties on landmines and to 
anti-nuclear treaties.  With the FTA we gave up tariffs between 
Canada and the United States so that companies could not hide 
behind tariff barriers, stay uncompetitive and not create as many 
jobs as they could otherwise.  They could have high prices 
because of the tariff barriers, thus affecting poor people in 
both countries.  We gave something up, but I believe it was for 
the better.  As the member from Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca said 
earlier tonight, we gave up some international control so we 
could have better social programs and a better environment in 
some of the countries abusing these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From my perspective, we gave up our sovereignty to join the 
United Nations and rid ourselves of the dictatorships in the 
world and rid ourselves of the autocratic governments that were 
abusing people, as well as to prevent the possibility of such 
things happening in the future.  To me, it was worth it to give 
up that sovereignty and join the larger sovereignty of humanity, 
the greatest democracy of all humankind.  To me, that was worth 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have no question, just a comment.
