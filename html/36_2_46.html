and entitled “Chrétien and Dion, names that history will not 
remember”. I seek the unanimous consent of the House to table

order.  The government has just closed off debate for the 59th 
time.  Before we proceed any further, the public needs to know 
what the government is doing to its opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to our new procedural book, which I thank the clerks for 
putting together as I think it is truly a masterpiece, I draw 
your attention, Mr. Speaker, to page 563 by Marleau and Montpetit

</I></B></P><P align=left>While the term “time allocation” connotes ideas of time 
management more than it does closure, a motion to allocate time 
may be used as a guillotine by the government.

fair amount of time for the member for Athabasca to make his 
point of order because he had the wisdom to introduce his point

masterpiece.  How could I interfere?

table and the authors of this new book, which will, I am sure, 
give all members of the House and all Canadians a greater

just seen the debate slammed shut.  This legislation is supposed 
to be so important to the country that the Prime Minister seeks 
to foist it on the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just debated legislation over the past number of hours 
and on one previous occasion in the House that was, in essence, 
changed by a recent amendment by the Bloc.  We all know the 
Bloc's intention is to remove the legislation for a separatist 
cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been no opportunity to debate an amendment brought 
forward by a federalist party, the Progressive Conservative 
Party.  I seek unanimous consent to move an amendment from a 
federalist party so that we can debate this in a way that 
Canadians will understand that this legislation has nothing to do 
with clarity.  It is about furthering the separatist cause.

would like to draw to your attention two points of order.  I 
refer you to Erskine May, 22nd edition—on the same point as the 
other day, but never mind that—page 498. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially, this deals with the title of a bill and the 
corollary that should be found in the contents of the bill.  I 
will read it, and please excuse my accent, because it is in English. 
There is no French edition. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The title of the bill must correspond with the notice of 
presentation, or the order of leave, and the bill itself must be 
prepared pursuant to the order of leave or resolution and in 
proper form.  If it should appear that these rules have not been 
observed, the bill cannot be proceeded with, if the irregularity 
is in any way substantial.  Where the title of the bill as 
presented to the House refers to purposes which are found not to 
be mentioned in the clauses of the bill submitted for 
publication, the proper course is to withdraw the original bill 
and present a new one with an appropriate long title. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The title of the bill refers to the secession of Quebec, but the 
word “Quebec” does not appear in the body of the bill.  There is 
reference to clarity, but according to the Supreme Court, there 
is no element of clarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out, also in Erskine May, 22nd 
edition, on page 46, under “Form of a bill”, something that is 
important and ought to be taken into consideration.  It is very 
important. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

the existing legislation of Canada nor in the Canadian 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would ask, through you, that this bill be 
withdrawn.  It is contrary to the rules established by this 
House, the statutes of this country and the Constitution of this 
country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will respond to both 
points raised by the hon. member.  On his first point, he said 
that he wants to introduce a reasoned amendment to amend the 
bill.   An amendment to be introduced while we are at second 
reading is a reasoned amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having settled that and to prove my point, someone no less than 
a former prime minister, the Right Hon. Joe Clark, otherwise 
known as the member for opposition gallery southeast, has written 
to the Prime Minister on this very topic referring to this as a 
reasoned amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot, by way of a reasoned amendment, amend a bill.  A 
reasoned amendment does not amend anything except the motion of a 
bill not the bill itself.  That has to be done either in 
committee or at report stage.  Therefore, the amendment that the 
hon. member is referring to is impossible under the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will cite our new procedural manual, which is now being 
referred to as the M and M.  It states that a reasoned amendment, 
another type of amendment that may be moved at second reading, 
allows a member to state the reasons why he or she opposes the 
second reading of the bill.  In other words, we cannot amend a 
bill by doing this, we can only oppose it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that disposes of the first issue because we cannot amend 
a bill by way of an amendment at second reading.  An amendment at 
second reading is a reasoned amendment, the effect of which is 
only to oppose a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of the title of Bill C-20 in reference to Erskine 
May, the hon. member across refers to page 461.  The citation 
states “A public bill is in the form of a draft statute, and 
when first printed—”.  It only becomes a statute once it has 
received royal assent and then it needs proclamation by His 
Excellency pursuant to an order in council, unless it is in the 
bill, in order to become law. It goes on to say it should “be 
consistent with existing law or contain such amendments—as are 
necessary—”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reference here is that if we have a bill that amends an 
existing law it must state in it which existing law it amends. 
Therefore, if we did not have that, there would be no way of 
reconciling the bill with the statute to which it will be later 
appended.  As it pertains to a bill creating new law as opposed 
to amending existing list, this of course does not apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reference to how the title itself works, this is an act to 
give effect to the requirement for clarity, which is 
self-evident, and the reference to Quebec secession is the 
reference of the supreme court.  This is to give effect to a 
supreme court issue and this is the greater explanation of what 
the supreme court reference is about.  That is the reason why it 
is stated that way.  I submit that this bill is perfectly in 
order.

for unanimous consent, which was not forthcoming.

amended at the pleasure of the committee, so that would be dealt 
with in committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 10, 1999 the member for Roberval spoke on this bill. 
I would like to devote a few minutes to some of his arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Roberval evoked 1982, he made reference to the 
so-called night of the long knives, and he evoked events about 
which very few are actually qualified to speak with credibility. 
One who is qualified is former Prime Minister Trudeau, who writes 
in “Against The Current”, a book edited by Gérard Pelletier, 
apropos of the night of the long knives: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1980-82 constitutional exercise, the federal 
government proposed to cut the Gordian knot by arguing that the 
sovereignty of Canada ultimately resided neither in the provinces 
nor in the federal government, but in the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial governments collectively rejected that view, even 
objecting to the use of the words “the people of Canada” in a 
preamble to the constitution, and proposing instead a description 
of Canada as a country made up of “provinces...freely united”, 
thus returning to the selfsame concept that had prevented 
patriation in 1927.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech the member for Roberval went on to invoke 
democracy.  He spoke of the sword of Damocles hanging over the 
heads of Quebecers.  Evidently he does not see democracy as an 
inclusive word for all citizens affected within the entire nation 
where a separation is being proposed.  In fact, the sword of 
Damocles of which he spoke hangs over everybody's head:  his, 
mine and everyone else's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech the member for Roberval also announced that the 
responsibility for the clarity of the question rests with Quebec. 
Such a responsibility was not famously discharged the last time, 
was it?  Actually, it was so badly done that the supreme court, 
whose declaration was welcomed even by the present premier of 
Quebec, found it necessary to explicitly stress the importance 
that such a question in the future be put clearly.  Evidently the 
supreme court was not impressed with the clarity of the question 
in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The level of indignation of the member for Roberval, who is 
otherwise a very likeable fellow, reached stratospheric heights 
when he said that never again would the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois allow the federal government to try to take away 
responsibility from the National Assembly of Quebec.  What 
nonsense.  No responsibility has been taken away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Carefully read the first line of the bill.  It states: “An act 
to give effect to the requirements for clarity as set out in the 
opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada”.  Yes, the Quebec 
national assembly is referred to in the first paragraph of the 
preamble, where we find a very important democratic point.  It 
says that there is no right under international law or under the 
constitution of Canada for the national assembly, legislature or 
Government of Quebec to effect the secession of Quebec from 
Canada unilaterally.  Why is the word unilateral so important? 
Because any proposal to break up Canada is a matter of the utmost 
gravity and is of fundamental importance to all of its citizens. 
Hence the importance that the question when asked be free of 
ambiguity and the answer be supported by a clear majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to cause the member for Roberval a heart attack by 
saying what in the view of many a clear majority should be, but 
because the matter is of grave importance to all Canadians a 
truly democratic approach would be to consult all Canadians from 
coast to coast.  The same should apply to British Columbia, 
should one day the spectre of separation appear there, or any 
other province for that matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Roberval accuses the federal government of 
wanting to make sure Quebec cannot “democratically” overcome 
certain obstacles.  I respectfully submit that it is the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois that are actually acting in an 
anti-democratic fashion.  I say so for two reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, in their view the Quebec nationalists see the referendum 
question as a provincial matter only, but it is not.  It affects 
the entire nation because it means the amputation of a very 
important and significant part of the national body.  Before an 
amputation takes place we must consult all parts affected, not 
just the part to be amputated.  This elementary democratic 
principle has not yet penetrated the collective brains of the 
Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Canada is a country which consists of aboriginal people, 
immigrants and their descendants.  Let us take one group, the 
immigrants.  I belong to that group.  At least five million 
post-war immigrants have come to this country.  Have they come to 
Ontario?  No.  Have they come to Quebec?  No.  Have they come to 
British Columbia?  No.  They and I have come to Canada.  We have 
chosen Canada as a whole. 
We have settled in Canada because we were attracted to Canada, 
its spaces, mountains, forests, oceans and rolling hills.  We 
became Canadian citizens not by accident of birth but by choice. 
We can see why it is unconvincing, for a party which claims to be 
democratic, to become indignant, as in the case of the member for 
Roberval.

times of Duplessis.  Today's Quebec is highly educated, modern, 
with tremendous cultural, technical and industrial strength, and 
of course economic potential.  Quebecers understand the 
advantages of a bilingual Canada which is capable of speaking to 
the world in two major trading and cultural languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the member for Roberval and his colleagues 
are underestimating Quebecers, their intelligence and their 
vision of Canada and the world.  If Quebecers are still being 
victimized it is by the Bloc and the Parti Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pierre Elliott Trudeau wrote these words, which I mentioned 
earlier, and they still apply today: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So it goes that, with myths and delusions, the Quebec nationalist 
elites falsify history to prove that all Quebec's political 
failures are someone else's fault:  the conquest, the 
obscurantism of Duplessis' times, slowness to enter the modern 
age, illiteracy, and all the rest.  It is never our leader's 
fault; it has to be blamed on some ominous plot against us. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a message here for the member for Roberval and his 
colleagues.  I urge them to get with it, to enter the 21st 
century, to take their families to see the Rocky Mountains, the 
Pacific coast, the Arctic Ocean and the beautiful maritimes. 
These regions belong to them, the members of the Bloc Quebecois, 
every square centimetre, in the same way as every square 
centimetre of Quebec belongs to the other 29,999,000 Canadians.

I will try to contain my reaction somewhat. However, the Liberal

accusing us of allegedly not wanting to debate the bill.

when he just voted in favor of time allocation? Incidentally, 
his party is the only one to have done so. This is undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides, we in the Bloc Quebecois wish that a parliamentary 
committee would travel to Quebec and elsewhere to hear what 
Canadians and Quebecers have to say on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like his opinion, as one who seems to think of himself as 
a great democrat. It is time for him to prove it by saying “Yes, 
I agree that a committee should travel to hear people on this. 
This is highly democratic.” He who spoke in favour of debate 
should be all for it, since debate is so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also react to hearing over and over speeches like the ones 
Trudeau used to make. He would say things like “Ours is such 
a beautiful country, with the Rockies and Atlantic salmon. 
Why would you want to leave?”

dozens of requests for unanimous consent of this House to table 
documents. They even rejected a proposal by a government member 
to debate Bill C-20 into the evening, all night if necessary. 
This is on record in the <I>House of Commons Debates</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois members clearly gave me and all those who

</I></B></P><P align=left>In its advisory opinion, the supreme court stated that all 
political actors in Canada should be involved in the process: 
the Senate, provincial legislatures, the national assembly

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since all these partners in the Canadian federation should be 
asked for their views both on the question and on the majority, 
how are we going to reconcile potential diverging views? The

the bill on this.

debated Bill C-20 on Monday, the Bloc Quebecois resorted to the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to speak to Bill C-20, which 
has become known thus far as the clarity act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I believe that many aspects of this bill are important and 
even sound, I intend to show that referring to any clarity in 
this bill, as the government has tried to do in recent months, is 
a profound misnomer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The central purpose for Bill C-20 is to give effect to the 
requirement for clarity, as set out in the 1998 opinion of the 
Supreme Court of Canada in the Quebec secession reference.   As 
well, this enactment provides for the House of Commons to 
determine the clarity of a referendum question on the secession 
of a province and sets out some of the factors to be considered 
in making this determination.  This has become an important part 
of this debate, which I will address later in my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further on that point, this bill prohibits the Government of 
Canada from entering into negotiations on the terms on which a 
province might cease to be a part of Canada if the House of 
Commons determines that the referendum question is not clear.  As 
well, Bill C-20 allows parliament to determine, following the 
referendum on secession in a province, if a clear majority of the 
population of the province has clearly expressed a will to cease 
to be a part of Canada, and sets out the factors to be considered 
in making its determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would enable the Government of Canada to enter into 
any negotiations with the province in the event that a clear 
majority of the province's citizens clearly expressed a 
province's will to secede.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the event that all the above conditions were satisfied in a 
yes referendum vote on secession, the bill recognizes that the 
secession of a province from Canada requires an amendment to the 
Constitution of Canada, which in turn would require negotiations 
involving all provincial governments and the Government of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill recognizes that there is no current provision in the 
constitution to effect the secession of a province from Canada 
unilaterally and that an amendment to the constitution would be 
required, which in turn would require negotiations involving at 
least all the governments of all provinces and the Government of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize, the goal of the so-called clarity act so far is 
supposedly to provide a clear question in a referendum on a 
province's secession from Canada and to identify a clear majority 
in such a referendum.  Yet neither of these issues have been 
clarified by the government in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond these questions the official opposition, along with 
Canadians, is wondering why the government has not focused more 
constructively on plan A, that is to say why the Liberals are 
stubbornly refusing to make effective changes to the federal 
system.  Canadians really have no idea where the government is 
coming from nor where it is going within the so-called clarity 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is clear to anyone who has witnessed the history of the 
last five to ten years of this debate is that the Reform Party is 
the only party that has offered a constructive and a consistent 
position on how Canada's federation could be renewed.  It is 
unfortunate that this cannot be said about the federal Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go any further to address the bill in particular, I 
think it would be instructive for the House to revisit the recent 
history of this debate.  I am sure the House remembers the advice 
of the Prime Minister leading up to the 1995 referendum on 
sovereignty.  “Don't worry, be happy”, was his favourite 
slogan.  At the same time the official opposition stepped up to 
the plate trying to advance serious debate about what Canadians 
should be aware of in the event of a yes side majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, back in 1995 the Reform Party was criticized by many 
for showing leadership and courage on the issue, and mostly by 
the members of the current government.  Lo and behold it was this 
government which, in the Prime Minister's own words, has decided 
to get tough with the separatists.  Instead of getting tough the 
Prime Minister should get smart and start offering real solutions 
to real problems facing the provinces.  Does he not see that his 
get tough approach in Quebec is only fanning the flames of a 
dying fire? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the 1995 referendum it was the Reform Party that 
led the debate.  While we were trying to enlighten the government 
on the growing malaise in Quebec, the Prime Minister was 
repeating his don't worry, be happy mantra.  As we all know, his 
inexplicable inaction almost produced a devastating result in 
that referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the referendum it was again the official opposition 
which led the debate, turning the focus of the debate away from 
the negative results from secession into positive nation building 
efforts by trying to reconstruct the federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We introduced the new Canada act which I had the pleasure of 
debating in Quebec last year with my dear friend from 
Témiscamingue.  The new Canada act offers many solutions that 
would end the problems of regional alienation within this great 
nation.  I am sure that it will be a matter of time, or at least 
another five years, until the Liberals decide to adopt our 
position once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank goodness Canadians will not have to wait five years.  With 
the creation of the Canadian alliance a few weekends ago it will 
not be long until the government will be brought to its knees by 
a government with integrity, a government committed to lower 
taxes, democratic reform and reforming the federation. The 
official opposition through the Leader of the Opposition and our 
critic on intergovernmental affairs, the member for Macleod, has 
made our position crystal clear on the two parts of the proposed 
legislation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First off, what is a clear majority?  The official opposition 
recognizes the rule of 50% plus one and has done so since the 
process started.  It would be shameful and certainly 
questionable if the government were to change a universally 
recognized rule at this point.  The rules cannot be changed in 
the middle of the game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's poor administration has dissatisfied Quebecers 
to the point that they felt they had no choice but to separate 
from Canada.  Since the start of this upheaval the government 
has caused, the rule of 50% plus one has never been questioned.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be a huge mistake and irresponsible if the government 
were to change its position now.  I have also heard the argument 
that 50% plus one would not be enough to break up the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of members opposite have also said repeatedly that, 
within the Reform Party, it takes a two-thirds majority of all 
members to make significant changes.  So they wonder how the 
Reformers can support the concept of 50% plus one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government wants to follow the Reformers—and I know it 
does because it is constantly doing it—then it should submit the 
issue of a clear majority to all Canadians through a national 
referendum. Why? In the case of our party, it is the grassroots 
that decided that a two-thirds majority would be required. Unless 
this government is prepared to ask Canadians whether they want 
to change the foundation of democracy, a 50% plus one majority 
must be the rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back to what constitutes a clear question. There 
are two important issues here. The first one concerns the 
procedure for drafting the question. The second one has to do 
with the very substance of that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before discussing these two points, I want to refer to an aspect 
of the supreme court opinion on this issue. As I mentioned 
earlier, the supreme court ruled that Canada would have an 
obligation to negotiate if there were a clear majority on a 
clear question. 
Should the yes side win, this bill provides the House of Commons 
with the necessary basis to debate the question and determine if 
that question and the outcome of any future referendum on the 
secession of a province reflects the legitimate and democratic 
will of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that I wonder if the government can debate openly 
and in good faith in this House. Such an exercise would probably 
prove to be yet another masquerade, another scheme of the sort 
that the Liberals have become experts at over the past seven 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This then begs another question. If the Liberals are— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
If the debates are so important for the future of Quebec and of 
Canada, there should at least be a quorum in the House.  I note 
that there are few members across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I will check for quorum 
immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I see that we now have a 
quorum. The hon. member for Edmonton—Strathcona. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will go through some 
more points, especially when they refer to the question.  This 
brings me to the important point of the clear question.  The 
official opposition believes that if we get the process right we 
will also arrive at the right questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the process to a clear question?  I believe there is a 
common sense approach to getting the process right.  I believe 
that true clarity in a question can only be achieved through a 
consensus drive approach, which would see the federal government 
co-operate with the province to write a question.  A question 
cannot and should not in fairness be unilaterally written by 
either the federal government or a province.  Only through a 
consensus approach will there be a clear question to the 
satisfaction of both the federal government and the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the government take note of the importance 
of getting the process right.  The government must make the 
connection between the process and the question.  It is in the 
best interest of both parties to have some consensus on a clear 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I believe this?  Suppose for a moment that the yes side 
were to win a referendum.  In order for this result to be 
respected, I believe it would be critically important for the 
rest of the country to have seen the process in both asking and 
answering the question being carried out in good faith.

</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I>

quorum. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, there are 
a number of reasons I wished to take part in this debate on the 
bill to give effect to the requirement for clarity as set out in 
the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Quebec 
secession reference.  The possible secession of a province is 
something to which we cannot remain indifferent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government believes that it must ensure that there are clear 
procedures in place for the conduct of any referendum having to 
do with the separation of a province.  Our determination in this 
regard is justified by the very importance of what is at stake. 
Our government's position is based on the opinion released by 
the Supreme Court of Canada on August 20, 1998.  This opinion 
urged us, as politicians, to assume our responsibilities.  That 
is what our government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principal points in the opinion were as follows: neither 
international nor Canadian law gives Quebec the right to secede 
unilaterally. 
Secession of Quebec from the rest of Canada cannot be achieved 
unilaterally, that is to say, without negotiations according to 
the Canadian constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In international law there can be no right to secession by 
virtue of the principle of self-determination of a people except 
in the case of a people that is governed as part of a colonial 
empire, subject to foreign subjugation and domination. 
According to the court, “such exceptional circumstances are 
manifestly inapplicable to Quebec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other political stakeholders would not be obliged to 
negotiate except if a clear majority in Quebec were to clearly 
express its desire to no longer be part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is up to all of the political stakeholders to determine what 
is a clear question and what is a clear majority in a vote on 
secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the court opinion was not to contest the 
legitimacy of a referendum consultation, nor to prevent 
Quebecers from speaking out on their political future.  Nor did 
it in any way question the right of Quebecers to decide their 
future.  Its purpose was, instead, to obtain clarifications on 
certain matters of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not wish to deny Quebecers the right to make the choice to 
leave Canada.  We do, however, believe that the process should 
be clear and should allow Quebecers to express their wishes in 
total clarity.  The supreme court opinion contributes to this. 
The important element of the court's opinion concerns the 
requirement of a clear question and a clear majority.  The 
expression clear question comes up no fewer than 18 times in the 
opinion, and clear majority 19 times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court makes the obligation to negotiate conditional on a 
clear majority having voted in the affirmative in response to 
a clear question on secession.  It is the job of the political 
actors to determine the clarity required.  This is why the 
federal government has a role to play in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clarity of the question is essential to the functioning of a 
democratic referendum.  Public consultation in the independence 
process elsewhere in the world has always involved a simple and 
clear question.  There is in fact no example of successful 
secession based on a small majority in a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The potential consequences of Quebec's secession are such that 
they require the clearest possible referendum process. 
Quebecers must not lose their country on a misunderstanding, 
through ambiguity. 
We cannot ask them to sign a blank cheque.  This is in fact what 
nearly happened in the last referendum campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must avoid this in the future.  Quebecers are entitled to 
know the scope of the decision they will have to take in a 
future referendum.  And it is the responsibility of the 
political actors, including the Government of Canada, to see to 
that.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court confirmed that all political actors have the 
obligation to negotiate in good faith the terms of Quebec's 
secession, in the event of a clear question and a clear 
majority.  This is in paragraph 88.  But it is also very 
specific in paragraph 96 about the difficulties that such a 
scenario would create.  I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, secession would give rise to many issues of great 
complexity and difficulty. These would have to be resolved 
within the overall framework of the rule of law, thereby 
assuring Canadians resident in Quebec and elsewhere a measure of 
stability in what would likely be a period of considerable 
upheaval and uncertainty. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is paragraph 96. The court mentions that the negotiations 
that would follow a clear majority vote in favour of secession 
“would address the potential act of secession as well as its 
possible terms should in fact secession proceed”. This can be 
found in paragraph 151. These negotiations would therefore be on 
the process leading to secession, not on a hypothetical project 
of association, as claimed by some secessionist leaders. The 
reference makes no mention of association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rightly so, the court says there is no “assumption that an 
agreement reconciling all relevant rights and obligations would 
actually be reached”. This is paragraph 97. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court's opinion suggests that everything would be on the 
table should there be negotiations on secession, including the 
division of the national debt, the protection of linguistic and 
cultural minorities, aboriginal peoples, et cetera. The bill confirms 
that view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opinion also alludes to territorial integrity, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody seriously suggests that our national existence, seamless 
in so many aspects, could be effortlessly separated along what 
are now the provincial boundaries of Quebec. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, a secession would have major and multiple 
consequences. To go that route by relying on ambiguity would be 
extremely irresponsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court opinion protects the legal and democratic 
rights of Canadians for the future. It defines the legal 
framework within which democratic decisions must be made. 
It clearly states the principles under which Canada has evolved 
and prospered, namely, federalism, democracy, constitutionalism, 
the rule of law and respect for minorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We care too much about our country to lose it because of a 
misunderstanding. The supreme court opinion has clarified 
certain points of law, but it cannot in and of itself create a 
framework for the responsibilities of the Government of Canada, 
should it have to, unfortunately, begin negotiations which could 
lead to the separation of a province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Separatists criticize us for doing our duty. Yet, those who 
elected us are asking us to do our duty. This is what we are 
doing by introducing this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, this 
bill is too important to let pass some of the observations made 
here since the debate first began. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill referred to so casually by the members opposite as the 
clarity bill is in fact a bill whose requirement is the docility 
of Quebecers, docility because the question in the next 
referendum will no longer be decided upon freely and 
democratically by representatives of Quebecers in the national 
assembly, but will be submitted under the terms of clause 1 to 
the House of Commons 30 days after it is decided upon in the 
national assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go by what happened in 1995, this means that right in the 
middle of a referendum campaign, when Quebecers have agreed, 
through the national assembly, on a referendum question, and 
have begun to debate that question and what it means, the House 
of Commons, the majority of whose members represent the rest of 
Canada, and not Quebec, the English Canadian majority, will have 
decided that this question is not valid.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers are not being taken seriously.  Their intelligence is 
being questioned.  That too is the result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill introduced by the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs, a Quebecer, tells us that Quebecers are not intelligent 
enough to decide whether or not a question is clear or to make 
an informed choice in any referendum debate concerning this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the worst blows inflicted on Quebecers in the 
history of Canadian federalism and one of the worst threats to 
Quebec's freedom to decide its own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under clause 2, the Quebecers' decision would have to be 
approved by the Canadian House of Commons, with an English 
Canadian majority. After the national assembly has adopted a 
question that it considered clear, and after Quebecers have had 
a clear debate on a clear issue, the House of Commons could 
determine, under clause 2, whether the majority in a positive 
referendum on sovereignty, according to particular criteria, is 
acceptable or not for the majority in the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is also another blow for freedom and democracy in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all kinds of cloudy criteria. They call this a bill on 
clarity. It could be called a bill on variable cloudiness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about the size of the majority, the percentage of 
eligible voters voting for the referendum, and any other factor 
considered relevant. 
It is another way of saying that no majority of any size will 
ever be acceptable for parliament, for Liberals and for all 
other federalists in the House. For these people, the democratic 
rule of 50% plus one is not valid any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, the clause says that various views will be 
considered both on the clarity of the question and the results 
of the referendum. They will take into account views of 
political parties in the national assembly, of provincial and 
territorial governments throughout Canada, and of the Senate. 
Many people find this last point revolting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They would ask the views of the Senate, an archaic institution 
which is undemocratic and even antidemocratic, on a fundamental 
issue of democracy concerning Quebecers and their freedom of 
choice. We have never seen the like in the short history of the 
Canadian parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an all out attack against the national assembly. 
Bill C-20 is also an attack on the quality, the honesty and the 
intelligence of Quebec voters. It is a serious infringement of 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me set out a scenario that could have happened in an 
imaginary world. If the Quebec National Assembly, under a Parti 
Quebecois government, had wanted to pass similar legislation to 
set the parameters for the federalist vote—as Bill C-20 is setting 
parameters for the sovereignist vote, but not for the federalist 
vote—to provide that the small majority of 50,000 federalist 
votes in Quebec that defeated the sovereignist proposal in 1995 
had to be reviewed and monitored to be found acceptable, that 
would have been called racist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would have been outraged headlines everywhere in the 
media, first in the anglophone media and then in the others. 
Most of them, except for <I>Le Devoir</I>, have federalist owners and 
their columnists are often federalist too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the national assembly had decided to set parameters for the 
federalist vote and to question the majority vote of 50,000 
against sovereignty in 1995, if it had reviewed the majority 
votes to see whether there was a clear enough opposition to the 
creation of the new country that Quebec would have become and if 
it had questioned the results and rejected them, I bet it would 
have made the front page and that the Bloc Quebecois and the 
Parti Quebecois would have been called racists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that is what Bill C-20 does, through a token Quebecer, 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, and 25 other 
accomplices. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To present things this way is unacceptable. This bill is almost 
racist. It tells us that Quebecers are not intelligent enough to 
choose a question and to make decisions on the future of Quebec 
on their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the same definition of democracy does not apply to 
Quebecers and the rest of Canadians, because only the 
sovereignist vote, the vote on the future of the Quebec 
province, is being limited in such a way, not the federalist 
vote, and not a vote taken outside Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate because, throughout history, officials, 
members of conquered people, hastened to do the dirty work of 
the conquerors or their descendants. Here in the House of 
Commons, we have 26 Liberal members from Quebec, two of whom, 
the Prime Minister and the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs, are doing the dirty work of the majority of English 
Canada against Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It pays to spit on Quebec. It pays to stomp on Quebecers. During 
the last referendum campaign, when did the Reform Party start to 
gain popularity? When it began to stomp on Quebecers.  And now, 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, opposite, is turning 
into a hero in English Canada. 
Why? Because he stomps on Quebecers. He is a Quebecer, just like 
the Prime Minister of Canada. He does the dirty work against 
Quebec, stomps on Quebecers and he once said that to be forced 
to stay in Canada Quebecers had to be hurt economically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, no Liberal member from Quebec has spoken in the House 
against such practices, against such an affront to Quebec 
democracy and such a breach to Canadian democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not think that foreign observers have not done the same 
analysis I just did by reversing roles and saying “The national 
assembly is setting parameters for the federalist vote”, and 
this brings us back to the House of Commons. 
How is it that it is more acceptable in Canada, through the 
media, which are controlled mainly by federalist interests, to 
have a bill against Quebec, Quebec democracy and Quebecers' 
freedom of choice rather than the other way around? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do people not believe that this sort of bill goes against the 
tradition of democracy in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, since he is 
here—even if he does not seem to be listening because he is 
better off to do so—why does he not respond favourably to the 
request made by the Bloc Quebecois? If he will not withdraw this 
bill immediately—which we all wish he would, because it is an 
objectionable bill—at least will the legislative committee that 
will be struck to study the bill be allowed to begin its work by 
hearing from everybody in Quebec and in Canada who wants to 
address this issue? 
There are Canadians who do not agree and who came to tell us so, 
including a group of 90 intellectuals, and representatives from 
lobby groups. They said they do not agree with this undemocratic 
breach by the federal government. The Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs should allow this committee to hear 
from all witnesses across Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, this committee should travel across Quebec and Canada 
and, third, all these hearings should be televised to really 
inform the public about this breach of Canadian democracy and 
Quebecers' freedom of choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister tells us, with his Prime Minister, that Quebec 
is behind him, he should stop being afraid and he should travel 
with us. 
We will then see if, at the end of the process, he will still be 
self-confident and as arrogant as he was this week, calling 
women's groups, unions, teachers' groups and writers' groups 
“mothball groups”.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are gripped by a fear of non-conformity.  We are overcome by a 
desperate desire to present ourselves as a natural and completed 
experiment, monolithic, normal, just another one of the standard 
nation-states.  It is as if we were Siamese twins, with one body, 
two heads and two separate but interrelated personalities. 
Together they are very interesting.  But in some way most people 
want them to be separated or deny the importance of one or the 
other.  They want us to be normalized.  Banalized.  We are unable 
to accept the remarkable originality of the Canadian 
experiment—to accept that Canada's central characteristic—its 
greatest strength—is its complexity. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therein summarizes some of the frustrations that make Canada 
what it is today.  It is a unique country in that it has two 
founding races, two founding cultures and two founding languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also take the opportunity to quote from the minister in his 
introduction of the bill: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is reasonable, and is in everybody's interest, 
including that of my fellow Quebecers who desire Quebec 
independence.  They can and must acknowledge that their plan for 
political independence can only be realized in clarity and 
legality.  To act otherwise, to reach independence through 
ambiguity, with no legal safety net, is to show disrespect for 
Quebecers and to doom the independence initiative to failure, to 
an impasse that would be disappointing and costly for everyone.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I always find it useful to read the bill, a strange concept I 
realize, and review the preamble as it provides guidance to those 
of us who wish to debate it and to try to understand what is in 
the mind of the mover and ultimately of parliament. I refer to 
three of the whereas clauses: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Supreme Court of Canada has confirmed that there is 
no right, under international law or under the Constitution of 
Canada, for the National Assembly, legislature or government of 
Quebec to effect the secession of Quebec from Canada 
unilaterally; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas any proposal relating to the break-up of a democratic 
state is a matter of the utmost gravity and is of fundamental 
importance to all of its citizens; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would emphasize all of its citizens and as I represent the 
riding of Scarborough East, the people of Scarborough East, 
because any breakup of our country would have a significant 
impact on all of Canada and its citizens. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Supreme Court of Canada has determined that the 
result of a referendum on the secession of a province from Canada 
must be free of ambiguity both in terms of the question asked and 
in terms of the support it achieves if that result is to be taken 
as an expression of the democratic will that would give rise to 
an obligation to enter into negotiations that might lead to 
secession;

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the problem?  Can anyone really be against clarity? 
Apparently they can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, the bill is profoundly democratic.  It sets out a 
process without predetermining a result.  It allows for the 
constituent assemblies to express themselves.  By the constituent 
assemblies I mean all of the democratic institutions that we have 
in this country.  We have had 150 years of democratic government. 
If we decide we are going to break up, then all of its 
constituent assemblies need to decide that.  It avoids the 
limitations of referenda which are necessarily simple questions 
and simple answers.  It recognizes that breaking up a country is 
a very serious business.  It gives all Canadians a voice in the 
process through their members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it is heresy among some members opposite that other 
Canadians should have an opinion, that they should have a say, 
that they should have a vote in the breakup of their country 
which they and their ancestors worked so hard to make work and 
built together as a unique country, one well worth saving.  In 
our own strange way if we choose to break up, surely the process 
should be clear and free of ambiguity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I find myself in support of the bill and have a great 
deal of support from the constituents of my riding. I 
congratulate the minister for bringing forth this bill. Hopefully 
it will bring us one step closer to a resolution on this issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
rise today on behalf of the constituents of Calgary East to 
participate in the debate on Bill C-20, the clarity act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I believe that the vast majority of Canadians would 
like to see a resolution of the unity debate one way or another. 
Since I arrived in this country, like thousands of other 
immigrants who now call Canada home, I have been mesmerized by 
this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many ways the debate on separation is unique to Canada.  In 
other countries of the world, when a group of people threaten to 
separate, they are labelled as traitors.  Many countries have the 
death penalty for that, but in Canada the debate has been held in 
a civil manner and the issues are on the table for discussion. 
This is a credit to the Canadian people and to this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is impossible to deny the seriousness of the potential 
breakup of our country.  That is precisely why it is absolutely 
necessary to have clarity on this issue, to have the pros and 
cons clearly set out so that Canadians and Quebecers both know 
the result of their decisions and that it is seen as a fair and 
equitable process.  If in the end it is not seen as a fair and 
just process, it will not be viewed as legitimate and will lead 
to a negative and confrontational attitude which will further 
divide the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been no doubt in the minds of most Canadians that the 
last referendum question had a double meaning and did not 
adequately define what separation from Canada would mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party said that there was a need for a clear question 
for legitimacy and a plan B approach should Quebecers express 
their will to separate from Canada.  This was attacked by 
advocates of the soft approach to federalism.  The PC Party and 
its leader Joe Clark are advocates of this soft approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians view the soft approach as the main reason the 1995 
referendum was as close as it was.  The 1995 referendum was a 
wake-up call to the Prime Minister and to the Liberal government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that night.  As most Canadians did, I watched the 
results at home with my family.  I watched with tremendous 
apprehension not fully understanding what it would mean if 
Quebecers voted to leave Canada. I think pride in our country won 
that night but it was a dangerous point in our country's history 
and a wake-up call for the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot deny the tremendous contributions Quebecers have made 
to this country since Confederation.  We cannot deny that French 
Canadians are the proud builders of this nation.  Their cultural 
and language diversity have enriched our nation and I hope they 
will continue to do so.  But it is the belief of the official 
opposition that this can best be achieved by expanding provincial 
powers and not through federal government handouts and 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has the right to constantly challenge the federal 
government on areas of jurisdiction but in the case of the 
clarity bill, I believe Canadians through parliament have the 
right to ask Quebecers for a clear question and to define what it 
means to have a clear majority should another referendum be held. 
The clarity bill does improve the chances that a referendum on 
secession by any province will be conducted fairly.  That is why 
my colleagues and I have agreed to support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition has suggested what a possible question 
could be.  I believe it is a reasonable question and that it 
should be inserted into the bill as an example.  The question 
simply states:  Should, insert the name of the province, separate 
from Canada and become an independent country with no special 
legal ties to Canada, yes or no? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of what constitutes a clear majority, the 
government owes Canadians an answer.  The Prime Minister and the 
intergovernmental affairs minister are quick to say that a clear 
majority is a number greater than 50% plus one but they are not 
prepared to say what that number is.  Again the official 
opposition is prepared to be clear on this issue and to put the 
number at 50% plus one of the ballots cast.  Of course the flip 
side of this is simply that if 50% plus one of the vote can split 
the country, then 50% plus one could split the province as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers' aspirations must be met as must the aspirations of 
other provinces and the first nations.  It is important for there 
to be measures in the bill to improve the federation.  The 
official opposition and specifically the Leader of the 
Opposition, the member for Calgary Southwest, have done a 
tremendous amount of work on developing ideas on reforming the 
federation. These ideas are at the core of the Reform Party and 
of the new Canadian alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan for renewing the federation is contained in part A of 
the new Canada act.  The fundamentals of the new Canada act are 
designed to treat all Canadians with fairness and equality, to 
promote equality of opportunity for all Canadians, to respect the 
equality rights and the dignity of all Canadians as well as their 
various needs, and to recognize that all provinces despite their 
differences have the same legal standing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Canada act contains provisions for a better sharing of 
powers under the constitution; reduced federal spending powers in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction; a dispute settlement mechanism; 
a change in policies and programs for the aboriginal people; and 
democratic reform of federal institutions, especially the House 
of Commons, the Senate and the supreme court to make these 
institutions more accountable to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe along with my colleagues in the official opposition 
that these changes are required to improve the federation and to 
create conditions in this country that are not limited to 
separation or the status quo.  They are changes that would 
improve the federation by placing more power in the hands of the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally think the federal government can do a great deal 
more to promote the benefits of remaining in Canada to Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the economic benefits of being in Canada are already 
having a positive impact on the province of Quebec.  Montreal is 
sharing in the economic boom of North America.  Jobs are being 
created, investment dollars are pouring in and real estate prices 
are climbing. 
These are positive signs for federalism and working together to 
ensure a strong Canada for the future of our children and 
grandchildren.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I with my colleagues will support Bill C-20 because 
it sets out clear and fair rules for a referendum. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil—Soulanges, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, we 
have just set foot into the 21st century, and I would like to 
take this opportunity to speak to Bill C-20, which deals with the 
requirement of clarity in the event of a referendum on the 
secession of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, moreover, invite all my colleagues here in the House to 
reflect seriously on this matter and to bring their reason and 
good judgment to bear in understanding the legitimacy of this 
bill and in putting an end to the troubling ambiguity of the 
sovereignist project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 is a call for clarity, clarity in our individual and 
collective choices, clarity in our feelings, and clarity above 
all in the expression of our will to all Canadians, to remain 
united in order to face the economic, social and cultural 
challenges facing us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind all members of the House of Commons that, 
in bringing in this bill, the Government of Canada is acting 
responsibly and with the greatest respect for Canada's political 
institutions.  This bill does not in any way represent a threat 
to the integrity of either the national assembly of Quebec or 
any other legislative assembly in the other provinces and the 
territories of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its opinion on the secession of Quebec, the Supreme Court of 
Canada stated, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it will be for the political actors to determine what 
constitutes “a clear majority on a clear question” in the 
circumstances under which a future referendum vote may be taken. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada being one of those actors, it therefore 
has a responsibility to ensure that the integrity of our country 
is neither threatened nor, indeed, made to disintegrate as a 
result of political manipulation and semantics concealing the 
true intent and scope of the referendum choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech of last October 12, our government 
reaffirmed its commitment to all Canadians in Quebec and all 
other Canadians to ensure that the principle of clarity set out 
by the Supreme Court of Canada is respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For our government, there is no doubt that the most sensible and 
reasonable way to meet its commitment is to include in an act of 
parliament the requirement for clarity set out by the Supreme 
Court of Canada with regard to both the referendum question and 
the result of the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the Government of Canada is just doing its duty to 
the people of Quebec and other Canadian provinces and 
territories by making sure that the spirit of the supreme 
court's decision is reflected in legislation designed to remove 
any ambiguity as to the choice that could be made by the people 
of part of its territory in a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legitimacy of Canada's decision to embark on this path 
cannot be challenged. 
Need I remind the House that the court's task was to clarify the 
legal framework within which political decisions must be made 
under the constitution and not, as some would have us believe, 
to usurp the prerogatives of the political forces acting within 
that framework? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government's approach does not threaten the 
integrity of provincial institutions, including the National 
Assembly of Quebec. On the contrary, it is aimed at preserving 
the integrity of the parliament and the government of all 
Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order.  The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, who

bill that concerns Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that the Liberal Party members are not interested in the 
minister's bill.  They are absent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> The hon. member knows very 
well we do not comment on— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Order, please.  That is 
enough.  The hon. member who rose on a point of order knows full 
well that we do not comment in the House of Commons on the 
absence or presence of members.  So we shall resume debate with 
the hon. member for Vaudreuil—Soulanges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola:</B> I will continue with my remarks, Madam 
Speaker.  Such a statement in support of clarity in a law voted 
on by the representatives of the people of Canada, who are all 
democratically elected and who, therefore, speak for the people, 
cannot but serve democracy and the rights and freedoms of all 
the citizens of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its opinion, the supreme court reminds us of the issues of a 
decision on the secession of a province or a territory of 
Canada, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 131 years since Confederation, the people of the 
provinces and territories have created close ties of 
interdependence (economically, socially, politically and 
culturally) based on shared values that include federalism, 
democracy, constitutionalism and the rule of law, and respect 
for minorities. A democratic decision of Quebecers in favour of 
secession would put those relationships at risk. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This statement reflects the true impact of a secession, which 
would affect not only the social, political, economic and 
cultural fabric of Quebec, but of all of Canada. It would be an 
irreversible decision which could not, for all intents and 
purposes, be reconsidered in any way, in spite of what the Bloc 
Quebecois leader may have said about this in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a portion of a country's population decides to separate 
from the rest of the population, it is because that group 
believes, rightly or wrongly, that it is impossible to continue 
to live in that country, that its living conditions and the full 
enjoyment of its rights and freedoms are in jeopardy. Is this 
currently the case in Quebec? I doubt it very much. Are the 
talents, skills and pride of Quebecers not drawn on, and are 
they not, as they should be, a fundamental component of our 
country's success and of its recognition around the world? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our entry into the 21st century is marked by an economic, social 
and cultural interdependence that is essential to the 
development of our resources and to our quality of life. Is the 
success of each region of Canada, which are all so unique and 
distinctive, not a guarantee of our country's economic, social 
and cultural success? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our country is a whole in which all the parts contribute to its 
identity and to the promotion of its values. Bill C-20 ensures 
that it will only be possible to alter our country's integrity 
if one of its regions were to decide unambiguously, through the 
expression of the will of a clear majority of its population on 
a clear question, to separate from the rest of the country and 
to assume the economic, social, cultural, political and 
financial responsibilities resulting from such a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we would call a clear choice, void of any 
ambiguity. It would be a choice based on reason, good judgement 
and intelligence. 
It would not be a choice made as a result of manipulation to get 
the public all confused about its deep convictions and its 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada sincerely believes that we must claim 
the right to preserve the integrity of all the institutions on 
our territory. We must also, and I say it again because this is 
critical, preserve the integrity of the rights and freedoms of 
all those who live in our country, regardless of their origin 
and beliefs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All political actors agree that clarity is essential in a 
referendum about secession.  A clear question is one which 
leaves no room for doubt in the mind of the person who must 
answer it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All political actors also agree with the supreme court's opinion 
that the principle of clarity also applies to the result of a 
referendum vote on secession.  A clear majority is the 
expression of a will that leaves politicians and all citizens in 
no doubt as to how results are to be interpreted and what the 
vote means.  One does not half leave a country.  One leaves it 
completely, forever, irrevocably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One leaves because the decision taken by a large majority of the 
population prevails on any legitimate opposition to secession 
and because the government is accordingly justified in giving 
effect to that will, without irreducibly threatening social 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any negotiations that would end this union, that would destroy 
the links uniting us all, would certainly not be easy and would 
leave their share of wounds and bitterness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-20, however, our government wants to ensure that, in 
the event of secession, both the public and the so-called 
political actors will base their actions on reason, good 
judgment and common understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today our country is a world leader in its efforts to build a 
new economic order that will benefit us all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us stop wallowing around in the murkiness of the Parti 
Quebecois' political project and unite forces to take up the 
major education, health and economic development challenges

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to take the floor, even on such a very sad day.  In 
fact, to be perfectly honest, it is not so much the day that is 
very sad as the parliamentary record of the government over 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would never have believed I would be rising to speak to a bill 
like Bill C-20, boldly titled an act to give effect to the 
requirement for clarity as set out in the opinion of the Supreme 
Court of Canada in the Quebec Secession Reference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contents of this bill are despotic in themselves, and its 
principle alone is sufficient to justify our vehement 
opposition.  If the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs wants 
to talk of clarity, yes his bill is clear.  There is not even 
any subtlety in it.  The federal government wants to prevent the 
Quebec people from freely deciding its future.  In my opinion, 
what is clear is that the bill is nothing less than a coup 
d'état aimed at Quebec democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill questions the basic rules of democracy.  In 
introducing Bill C-20, the Canadian government is trying to 
impose a veto on the decisions Quebecers will be taking 
democratically on their political future.  Such a thing has 
never been seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada struts about on the international scene loudly 
proclaiming its democratic principles, while not even bothering 
to respect them at home.  What a fine example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just about three years ago now, when I chose to get into 
politics, my purpose was of course to promote sovereignty, but 
also to come here to Ottawa in order to defend Quebec's 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can remember how hopeful I was at that time.  Yes, hopeful 
that we would manage, as people motivated by democratic 
principles, to exchange views and reach agreement that Quebecers 
had to be allowed to decide their own future according to their 
own will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democratically elected, a legitimate mandate in my hands, I 
never thought I would be participating one day in this sham of 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I remind the House that, as John F. Kennedy put it so well, 
the true politician hangs on to his ideals as he loses his 
illusions.  Thanks to the government opposite, I have lost my 
illusions.  However, I am keeping my ideal, which is 
independence for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, I still thought that words like right, equality, 
respect and justice meant something to the people of Canada and 
their representatives.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought, naively perhaps, that these principles were worth 
something.  Well, today, with Bill C-20, the government across 
from us is proving the opposite:  in any case, certainly the 
Prime Minister and the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 constitutes a serious and unprecedented attack against 
the democratic principles Quebecers have set for themselves and 
against the institutions they have created.  It is an attack 
against Quebec's freedom of choice.  And yet, for the past 30 
years the political debate over the future of Quebec has been 
marked by a profound respect of the rules of democracy.  Today 
the Liberal government is denying this democratic tradition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But really, what else can we expect from a party governing with 
arrogance and disdain for so many years?  What can we expect 
from a government that has no sense of justice?  Should we 
really be surprised by the tactics of the Liberal government, 
since the current Prime Minister is behind all the attacks 
against Quebec and was more importantly one of the artisans of 
the night of the long knives?  Can we expect anything else? 
This is a government that has proven its lack of any sense of 
democracy, preferring to manage the country's business without 
consultation, without transparency and without concern for the 
opinion of others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is trying to make political gains in the rest of 
Canada on the backs of the people of Quebec and to the detriment 
of the most basic respect for democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that the sovereignist movement has great 
respect for democracy and for the state of law.  There is a 
broad consensus in Quebec in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, would 
it be possible to ask the good member for Vaudreuil—Soulanges to 
be quiet, to listen and to learn something? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> As always, I call on all 
members on both sides of the House to listen respectfully, along 
with me, to the member speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire:</B> Madam Speaker, not only do they wish 
to gag us but they are all but preventing us from speaking in 
this institution, which is very disagreeable.  I continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No interest is more important than freedom, including freedom of 
speech.  This freedom is the ability of Quebecers to decide 
their collective future, the freedom to elect a responsible 
government in Quebec—even if it is sovereignist—the freedom to 
have the Government of Quebec considered responsible and 
legitimate, the freedom to decide on the referendum question 
that suits us, the freedom not to be confined by an untenable 
status quo, the freedom to choose a country.  These are the 
values to which I and my country, Quebec, subscribe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No obstacle to this freedom can be accepted or imposed by 
anyone, particularly not by the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs. 
The Bloc Quebecois, all its members, all its supporters and all 
democrats in Quebec, intend to rise up against this assault on 
Quebec.  There is no question of the people of Quebec agreeing 
to bow down to the shameless and disrespectful tactics of the 
Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agreeing to Bill C-20 would be agreeing to sell one's soul, to 
turn one's back on democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am deeply convinced that no one in Quebec wants to remain in a 
country that bears more of a resemblance to a dictatorship than 
a country that respects democratically elected institutions and 
the will of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The true meaning of democracy for the young people of my 
generation, and what I wish for Quebec, what I wish for my 
country, Quebec, is different from what the people over there 
are proposing.  Seeing just how far the federal government is 
prepared to go to deny the legitimate right of Quebec to decide 
on its own future and to deny the most basic rules of democracy, 
I am convinced that the Quebec people, with pride in their 
values, will soon choose—clarity law or no clarity law—to have 
their own country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than ever, I am convinced that sovereignty can truly change 
and improve things, for the foundations of our project are built 
on an affirmation of the democratic principle, although the same 
cannot be said about the people across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To see how the federal government is acting, can my generation, 
or the population in general, really be faulted for no longer 
believing in the world of politics and its present institutions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In referring this issue to the supreme court, in presenting Bill 
C-20, a bill that is against all international precedent, the 
federal government is merely making many members of my 
generation even more cynical about politics. Shame on the 
federal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Shame on the government for its refusal to listen to reason, for 
its refusal to respect democracy, for its rejection of the right 
of the Quebec people and its worthy representatives to be 
listened to and respected.  By systematically denying the 
existence of the Quebec people, the federal government is 
denying the vital democratic principle of the right of peoples 
to decide their own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy is meaningless without true representation and true 
debates.  Democracy must not simply be a principle to which lip 
service is given.  It must also be a principle which is 
respected.  It must be present in actions as well.  The federal 
government has no right to ignore democracy with impunity 
whenever it suits it to do so. 
And this is what it is doing with Bill C-20. In so doing, the 
government is giving the rest of Canada a new form of veto on 
the political and constitutional future of Quebec. Never. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-20, the federal government is on the wrong track and 
there will be no turning back. What will there be left to do 
after Bill C-20? What is the next step for the Liberal 
government? To lock the doors of the national assembly to 
prevent Quebecers from being represented? To flood the whole 
province with Canadian flags carrying the message “Thou shalt 
honour Canada”? While the federal government is at it, why not 
ask members of the national assembly to sing O Canada at the 
beginning of their proceedings? No way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen after this show of force? The public can expect 
the worst from the government opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We Quebecers still believe that democracy is what binds our 
society. If Canada no longer believes in democracy, it is its 
own business, but it is also a good reason for us Quebecers to 
become sovereign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now clear that the federal framework is keeping us from 
truly thriving. To me, democracy is not a technical issue that 
only concerns a small elite, but the affirmation of a common 
will to live. It seems clear that if there is such a common 
will, it is in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's sovereignty is above all an act of freedom. To long for 
sovereignty is to want Quebecers to have full control over their 
destiny through transparent institutions where their officials 
will debate the real issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the federal government is on the wrong track with Bill 
C-20. 
There will be no turning back but, above all, the government is 
admitting that it has nothing to propose to Quebecers and that 
it is unable to meet their fundamental aspirations.

project.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
begin with a statement made by a well-known politician, who said 
in 1992 that for a win by the yes side to be legitimate it must 
have at least 58% of the votes to take into account the votes of 
anglophones and allophones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before our friends opposite start criticizing this statement, I 
will tell them that it was made by none other than the present 
Deputy Premier of Quebec, Bernard Landry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This statement should surprise no one in this House. In 1992 
the referendum campaign on the Charlottetown accord was in full 
swing. The separatists were on the no side at that time and told 
anyone who would listen that a 50% plus one majority would not 
be enough. Why? Because, as Mr. Landry said, the votes of 
anglophones and allophones, which he already considered lost, 
had to be taken into account. 
According to him, a win by the yes side would have been 
justified in this case only if such a level of support was to be 
found among the francophone population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first time we have the opportunity to ponder 
such statements which, members will admit, are somewhat cynical. 
To all intents and purposes, taking into account the votes of 
anglophones and allophones is tantamount to weighing the votes, 
meaning that the vote of a francophone is worth more than the 
vote of a Quebecer from a different cultural community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I always believed that, from the moment they are 
granted Canadian citizenship, voters are all subject to the same 
rules and their votes all have the same political weight. To 
consider people according to their race, their language or their 
religion is to play a dangerous game with feelings that lead to 
intolerance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of statement says a lot about the PQ's idea of 
democracy.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the eyes of separatists, there will always be two kinds of 
Quebecers: the real ones, who are for the independence option, 
and the imposters, who consist, on the one hand, of the 
francophone group which rejects separation and, on the other, of 
Quebecers from all corners of the international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why they cannot identify with the independence project 
and refuse to listen to the siren call sent out with each 
passing referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us, as its name indicates, seeks to clarify the 
rules that would guide the Government of Canada in its actions 
if a province proposed a secession project to its citizens. 
This bill is a necessity and that is why we are so determined to 
have it passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statements such as those by Bernard Landry, which I have already 
cited, cannot fail to move those for whom democracy is truly 
important.  In our view, it is unacceptable to say that 50% plus 
one is enough to separate, when a constitutional reform project 
would require, as Mr. Landry said, applying some sort of twisted 
logic, 58% of the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a criticism levelled by separatists themselves.  They 
criticize us for maintaining that the majority required for 
secession must be greater than that required to join a 
federation, to take one example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect, that is our belief, and I will illustrate with an 
example that the separatists frequently trot out in support of 
their argument, the case of Newfoundland.  In a nutshell, if 52% 
was good for Newfoundland, why is 50% plus one not enough for 
Quebec to secede? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us agree on one thing from the start.  The two situations 
were very different.  In 1949 Newfoundland was a colony of 
Great Britain.  There was, so to speak, not the solid 
interdependence between Newfoundland and Great Britain that 
exists between Quebec and Canada.  And so, Quebec's separation 
would be much more complex than was Newfoundland's joining 
Canada. The risks of injustice would therefore be much greater 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not confuse the 52% of Newfoundlanders already mentioned 
with the very great majority of those who voted in favour of 
breaking with the United Kingdom.  In fact, the separatists 
never say that an initial referendum held on June 3, 1948 
proposed three options to Newfoundlanders: extension of their 
dependence for an additional five years; independence without 
financial assistance from London or entry to the Canadian 
federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Barely 14% of the electorate voted to extend dependence.  In 
other words, 86% of the electorate voted in favour of breaking 
colonial ties with London.  That, it must be said, was quite 
clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another referendum was then held on the two remaining options: 
independence without financial assistance from London or joining 
the Canadian Confederation.  On July 22, 1948, 52% of 
Newfoundlanders chose one of the two radical changes—Canadian 
Confederation.  Under the circumstances, the Canadian 
authorities decided to welcome Newfoundland and today still we 
know we made the right decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, as we have just seen, the essential difference between 
Newfoundland in 1948 and the separatist option in Quebec today 
is that Newfoundland did not break up a country when it joined 
Canada.  It terminated a temporary colonial link.  Quebec's 
secession from Canada would break up Canada, permanently. 
This is one fundamental reason the same percentage cannot be 
sought in two such different cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason has already been cited by a number of my 
colleagues on this side of the House—international precedent. 
Since 1945, in 13 cases of moves to independence in which a 
referendum was held, excluding colonial contexts, the average 
majority obtained was 92%.  I did indeed say 92%.  The lowest 
was 72%.  This is a long way from the 50% that Messrs. Bouchard, 
Parizeau, Landry and company are so desperately clinging to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason I have not much time to spend on, but which 
precludes too quick a comparison between the cases of 
Newfoundland and Quebec:  the questions put to Newfoundlanders 
were clear; those put to Quebecers in the last two referendums 
on sovereignty were not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers are entitled to know that they will not lose Canada 
without clearly renouncing it.  Secession could not be 
negotiated without the assurance that secession is really what 
Quebecers want.  This is why the government must establish the 
rules to govern its conduct in order to ensure that Quebecers 
should have nothing less than a clear question to answer. 
Secession is unthinkable without clarity of the referendum 
result, clarity of the question and clarity of the support 
obtained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it would be far preferable, if not essential, for 
the question and the majority to be sufficiently clear to leave 
no doubt as to the meaning to be taken from any referendum that 
might be held.  This is why we have this bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have trouble understanding the separatists' argument.  Do they 
really believe that we would wait with our arms folded for 
Canada to come to an end, without ensuring that this was what 
Quebecers wanted?  We are on the side of democracy.  We are in 
favour of clarity, not confusion.  We are not ones to make use 
of all manner of strategies, with varying degrees of subtlety, 
to accomplish our ends, unlike some. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court opinion clearly specified that, as political 
actors, it was our duty to ensure that if there were a 
referendum it would be held in clarity and that the issues were 
very clear for everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we keep on saying, Canada is too wonderful a country to be 
lost on the basis of a misunderstanding. 
We are betting on clarity, and on democracy.  We have no fear 
that, with clarity, Quebecers will resolutely choose to remain 
within Canada, the best country in the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to say a few words in this debate as I believe 
the debate on Bill C-20 is a very important one for the House. 
This is a very serious bill because it contemplates the potential 
breakup of our country.  It is a very serious debate.  Not too 
many years ago the House of Commons would not have even debated a 
bill of this sort without contemplating, in terms of legislation, 
the process of breaking up the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember very well back in 1981 when the constitution was 
patriated with the charter of rights.  I was a member of the 
committee.  A deliberate decision was made not to put a formula 
in it on amending process in order to have part of the country 
exit from Canada.  There is no constitutional means to exit from 
the country in terms of the constitution.  That was deliberate. 
In those days we would not have contemplated a bill like this one 
before the House of Commons.  We are doing something here that is 
very serious in terms of the future of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was disappointed today when the government brought in time 
allocation for one reason.  I think we need a lot of time to have 
a proper debate, a proper consultation about this very serious 
issue before the House.  Our party is in the process of 
consulting members and constituents across the country, chaired 
by the member for Palliser, about what probable amendments we 
could move to the bill to make it a better bill that is good for 
all of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister and the House know that we support the bill at 
second reading in principle, but it is our obligation as 
parliamentarians to make sure we have the best possible bill for 
the future of the country.  I say that because we have had many 
potholes along the constitutional trail in the past.  Members 
will recall that patriation was very divisive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prime minister of the day, Mr. Trudeau, came in with a bill 
originally supported by the provinces of Ontario and New 
Brunswick but opposed by the other eight provinces.  After a 
great debate in the House of Commons and a special Senate-House 
of Commons committee, the bill ended up being challenged in the 
Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court deliberated on the bill for quite some time 
and came down with a decision that the bill, if I remember 
correctly, was legal in terms of the constitutional changes but 
did not follow proper convention or practice in terms of the 
constitution of the country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That forced the prime minister of the day to come back to the 
House of Commons and introduce several amendments to the 
patriation act which had been suggested by people across the 
country.  That could have been done before being forced to do so 
by the Supreme Court of Canada, but it happened only after the 
intervention of the supreme court.  After about a year or so it 
got through the process.  I think there is a danger here that 
this bill could be expedited too quickly through the whole 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the alligators in the constitutional swamp, the 
Meech Lake accord also taught us quite a bit about the need for 
as much constitutional consultation with the people of the 
country as possible.  That failure was very unfortunate back in 
June 1990 because it was the failure of the Meech Lake accord 
that sprung the birth officially of the Bloc Quebecois in terms 
of the disappointment of a lot of Quebecers to the accord not 
going through.  It also set us back constitutionally a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eventually that led to the Charlottetown agreement.  Again I 
think the House and the players at that time tried to put too 
much in the accord, and eventually of course it did not pass.  It 
led to the spring of the Bloc Quebecois.  It led to I suppose the 
first big jump in support across western Canada of the Reform 
Party in response to a backlash against what happened in 
Charlottetown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look throughout history there are many examples of 
mistakes that were made, partly because there was too much haste 
and the lack of consultation along the way with the people of the 
country about proper amendments and a proper process that should 
be adhered to in any kind of serious constitutional change.  This 
is in many ways the most serious of all.  Even although it is not 
constitutional, it contemplates the potential road map to the 
breakup of our country, which indeed is extremely serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is in response to the supreme court.  That is what we 
are debating today.  The bill tries to implement the supreme 
court decision about a clear question and a clear majority, but 
one should also say that one mistake that has been made in the 
past is that too many people have not, I suppose, adhered to what 
I think is the basic fundamental principle of the legitimate 
self-determination of the people of Quebec.  There is the right 
of self-determination of a people in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do believe also that we have to recognize the uniqueness, the 
differences and the distinctiveness of the province of Quebec. 
There is some evolution in that direction, I know there is, but I 
think those things have to be said at the outset when we are 
debating a bill of this sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should keep in mind that the bill tries to balance what I 
think are two very fundamental principles and tries to recognize 
the co-existence of those two fundamental principles.  One 
principle is the right of the National Assembly of Quebec to ask 
any question any time it wants on any particular issue.  This 
bill does not thwart the ability of the National Assembly of 
Quebec to ask any question it wants at any time and in any 
wording it wants on any particular issue.  It can do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side, the bill says that the Parliament of Canada 
also has an obligation on behalf of all of Canada before the 
parliament contemplates a negotiation that may lead to the 
secession of our country and the separation of our country to 
determine whether or not that question has been clear vis-à-vis 
secession and whether or not that question has had a clear 
majority in terms of the expression of the people of the province 
of Quebec.  These two fundamental principles co-exist and it is 
important to acknowledge that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have much time this afternoon so I want to raise four 
questions which I think we should look at very carefully as we 
consult our constituents and people across the country and move 
into the committee phase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the way the bill is worded, does it suffice in terms of a 
clear question?  In my opinion it does.  Others may not agree, 
but I think that is a question we have to look at.  Is the 
question clear in terms of how the bill is worded?  Is it the 
proper way of doing it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we must look at what the bill says in terms of what is a 
clear majority.  Here I think the answer is more vague.  It 
leaves it up to future parliaments to determine whether or not 
there is a clear majority.  Maybe that parliament would make a 
wise decision.  Maybe that parliament would not be responsible. I 
do not know.  We should look at whether, within the confines of 
the supreme court decision and within the confines of fundamental 
democracy, we can more clearly define what a clear majority might 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give hon. members an example of what I mean.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have a referendum question passed by 50% plus one, with 
a 90% turnout, meaning 45% of the people in Quebec said yes to a 
clear question on separation.  We could also have 80% of the 
people say yes to a clear question but only 50% of the people 
turn out, which means 40% of the people voted for separation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we decide which of those is the most clear expression?  I 
do not know the answer to that question, but I think the 
committee has an obligation to see if we can define a bit more 
clearly what a clear majority should be for any future referendum 
that might be held in the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my remaining two minutes I want to make two more points.  A 
fairly direct amendment could be made to this bill.  I think the 
minister may agree to this one.  The first nations people, the 
aboriginal people, should be given higher recognition in terms of 
the role they would play in a potential process of consultation. 
That is something we should do.  Any division of the country will 
affect the aboriginal people, particularly those in the area that 
would be divided.  I do not think their role is high enough and 
prominent enough in the consultation process.  That is one 
amendment we should look at to make sure that they are properly 
and fully consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point is that one institution the minister is to 
consult fully is the unelected Senate.  In a democracy, for a 
question this important, this is giving an unelected body a role 
that is much too prominent.  That should be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of trying to refine and define them in accordance to 
what is best for our country, these are four areas we should look 
at in committee.

removed by the government.  Most of all, the high taxes that the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

are totally unfounded and incorrect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us understand that she is talking about the transitional

guidelines.  Sometimes difficult choices have to be made but in 
this case we have to maintain the proposed level of financing.  I 
would like to give another answer but I have no choice.  The 
Prime Minister promised this at a press conference”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister stand up and say that these charges are

is just but one partner in all those undertakings.  She will also 
know that in every case the Government of Quebec must concur.  We 
know that government is no friend of our Prime Minister.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

destroy or alter the documents that could cost her her job. Under 
any other circumstance, people under investigation lose their 
access to that potentially damning evidence.  She has tried to 
cover up this billion dollar bungle for months now— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh.

I would like to ask the hon. member to do, if he wants particular

Put it on the order paper.  Initiate an access to information

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is no wonder that HRDC is in such a sad state.  The Prime

before they were even approved.  They did not even exist.  They 
did not even have applications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The captain of the ship sets the standard for its crew.  It is

interesting.  The Reform Party has completely abandoned any 
questions on the audit report.  They are trying to raise 
questions about something that was satisfactorily answered before

Reformers' attack, because they have admitted that when it comes

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, political interference in the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, no wonder the hon. member refuses to deal any more with 
the audit report.  The audit report in question found that $1 
billion had not been lost, that the department knew where the 
money went.  It did not find any misappropriation.  Furthermore, 
it did not find any political interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wants to pay attention to the audit report,

<P><A NAME="LINK153"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
today in committee I asked the Minister of Human Resources 
Development why she was covering up information by refusing to 
give full disclosure to the Canadian people of the government's 
master list of all grants and contributions.  The minister would 
not commit in committee to a full disclosure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the minister again why she is hiding behind 
this information, because clearly a master list exists.  Is it to 
prevent a full comparison and disclosure of the political 
management of this fund? 
<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I remind the hon. member that it is a 
matter of record in the public accounts, all the expenditures in 
the ridings and the grants and contributions from my department. 
All the expenditures, over $100,000, are there.  They are public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee today I offered to members that if they wanted more 
detailed information I would be glad to satisfy their request as 
long as I know the specifics of what they are looking for. 
<P><A NAME="LINK155"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what 
Canadians want is honest answers, not creative accounting.  Not 
accounting for over $30 million of public money is a serious 
breach of trust.  The only people who do not think it is serious 
are the cabinet ministers and the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask a question of the Prime Minister.  How much 
money do his cabinet ministers have to mismanage before he thinks 
it is a problem: $50 million or $100 million?  How badly does a 
Liberal cabinet minister have to mess up before she is asked to 
resign? 
<P><A NAME="LINK156"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister has said, and she agreed, that there 
are problems of administration, of record keeping.  The Minister 
of Human Resources Development has put in place a six point plan, 
approved and supported by the auditor general, to deal with these 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the auditor general is carrying out his own audit 
and he will be reporting in the fall, including to the public 
accounts committee.  We consider every dollar of taxpayers' money 
to be important.  The premise of the hon. member's question is 
therefore quite wrong and she should withdraw that premise.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>AN ACT TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE REQUIREMENT FOR CLARITY AS SET 
OUT IN THE OPINION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF CANADA IN THE QUEBEC 
SECESSION REFERENCE 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK177">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-20, an 
act to give effect to the requirement for clarity as set out in 
the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Quebec 
Secession Reference, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee, and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wanted 
to contribute to this debate because I firmly believe that, as 
indicated in the title of the bill, we must give effect to the 
requirement for clarity as set out in the opinion offered by the 
Supreme Court on August 20, 1998. 
However, I notice that, in this debate on the possibility of a 
future referendum, political observers tend to ignore one 
question that is at the heart of this debate: Why hold another 
referendum? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing that motivates separatist leaders is that they 
are convinced that the small gap that separated the yes from the 
no on October 30, 1995 could be filled in a future referendum. 
You will certainly agree with me that it is not the best of 
reasons. So I will explain, in the time available to me, why 
another referendum should not be held in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us agree on one thing. In the minds of separatists, it is 
absolutely essential to hold another referendum because Quebec's 
situation within Canada is unbearable, or so they say. 
This is false. Quebec was able to develop in every sphere of 
human activity and to assert its distinctiveness, particularly 
in terms of language and culture. Quebec has become a dynamic 
and modern society within Canada. In short, Quebec can be itself 
and develop within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it took office, our government has undertaken several

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First there is the limit on the federal spending power, to which 
the government committed in the 1996 throne speech. The social 
union agreement reached on February 4 of last year actualized 
this commitment and restricted the federal spending power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement, into which the Bouchard government refused to 
enter, will nevertheless ensure the viability of our social 
programs. It highlights principles which are based on 
fundamental Canadian values such as equality for all, respect 
for diversity, fairness, human dignity, individual 
responsibility and solidarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement provides, among other things, that new social 
policies should not hamper mobility. Also, governments undertook

</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the regional veto legislation and the distinct

distinct society within Canada, with a French-speaking majority, 
a unique culture and a civil law tradition.

less uncertain through the creation of the Canada health and

warranted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you can see, we did not idle, watching the train go by. We 
took action, and Quebecers know it. What is very clear is that 
Quebecers do not want another referendum. Should there be 
another one, Quebecers want the question to be very clear. This 
is what recent polls have shown. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 30 a CROP poll released by the federal government 
revealed that 93% of Quebecers feel it is reasonable to require a 
clear question and 72% a clear majority.  Sixty-one per cent 
believe that the 1995 question was not clear and 60% feel that 
50% plus one does not constitute a clear majority.  In my 
opinion, those numbers speak volumes about Quebecers' opinions on 
a future referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other data from the poll shed some light on Quebecers' so-called 
right to declare independence unilaterally.  On November 23, Mr. 
Bouchard claimed that the supreme court's opinion opened the door 
to such a possibility in the event of bad faith on the part of 
the Government of Canada and that Ottawa's desire to have the 
requirement for clarity respected was an example of such bad 
faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, the majority of the CROP poll respondents, 66%, 
believe that it is reasonable that Quebec conclude an agreement 
with the rest of Canada before declaring independence.  Only 23% 
felt otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A majority of 68% believe that the opposition parties in the 
National Assembly of Quebec should have a say in how the question 
is worded. 
Fifty-eight per cent believe that the Government of Canada has a 
role to play in that regard, as do 56% with respect to the rest 
of the country.  Sixty per cent of Quebecers feel that a slim 
majority for the yes would leave the province deeply divided. 
Eighty-four per cent believe that it would be difficult to effect 
secession under those conditions.

his people, the people of Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When he was Minister of Justice, a few years later, in 1982, the 
Prime Minister worked with Pierre Trudeau—the ineffable Trudeau 
to whom no one is indifferent in Quebec—to patriate the Canadian 
constitution, with complete disregard for Quebec, even though he 
knew that a resolution had been passed almost unanimously by the 
national assembly condemning the Trudeau government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those days the Prime Minister was the Minister of Justice 
and he was right beside the Queen to sign the patriation papers. 
We remember him on the pictures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990, with his two faithful allies, Clyde Wells, the premier 
of Newfoundland, and Sharon Carstairs, the leader of the Liberal 
Party of Manitoba, he succeeded in aborting the Meech Lake 
accord, which included only the five minimum conditions, as the 
then Quebec premier, Robert Bourassa, liked to described them. 
That was a minimum. The Prime Minister, the then leader of the 
Liberal Party of Canada, succeeded in aborting the Meech Lake 
accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder this Prime Minister is so unpopular in Quebec. Some 
will say: “Sure, but he succeeded in getting elected in the 
riding of Saint-Maurice”. We know that his election in the riding 
of Saint-Maurice has had a very high cost for Quebec taxpayers. 
Besides, the Minister of Human Resources Development is now 
disclosing little by little what has been the cost of the 1997 
election in the riding of Saint-Maurice to allow the Prime 
Minister to win his seat, by a very narrow margin incidentally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was very grateful indeed for, a few months after becoming 
Prime Minister here in Ottawa in 1993, he appointed Sharon 
Carstairs to the Senate. As you know, this is a very nice gift. 
She is still young. Up till the age of 75, she will enjoy job 
security and a nice income with great working conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, what role did he play in the referendum on the 
Charlottetown accord? The trademark of this Prime Minister, the 
hon. member for Saint-Maurice, has always been that of spitting 
on and belittling his people, the Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also like to recall, in case some of my colleagues opposite 
might have forgotten about it, the famous legislation initiated 
by the Senate, Bill S-31, which forbid the Caisse de dépôts et 
placements du Québec to take control of Canadian Pacific. A 
ceiling of 10% was set. Shareholders could not hold more than 
10% of the shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same Prime Minister was willing to change this agreement, 
this legislation, to allow his friend Schwartz from Toronto to 
take control of Air Canada and Canadian. When it is good for 
others, he agrees. His trademark has always been to clobber 
Quebec to gain important supporters outside Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1982, while 73 Liberal members agreed to the patriation of 
the constitution here in the House of Commons, elected 
representatives in the Quebec National Assembly voted almost 
unanimously to condemn this unilateral move.

francophone, Pierre Trudeau, at the helm. Our country has been 
run by a francophone from Quebec, a Quebecer, for the past 32 
years, except for the nine months during which Joe Clark was in 
office. Of course, there were a few prime ministers who were 
designated, but I am talking here about those who were elected.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, Bill C-20 was initiated by one of our own, and this 
is sad for Quebecers. It was initiated by the Prime Minister, 
the hon. member for Saint-Maurice, and his colleague and friend 
whom he recruited in 1995 in a byelection and who serves as 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, a distinguished 
professor. Both are francophones from Quebec, and they are 
clobbering us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 is undemocratic. It does not respect the will of the 
people. 
It is an undemocratic bill because it makes the democratic will 
of Quebecers dependent on all of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, 101 of the 103 hon. members on the Liberal side are 
from Ontario. If we were to follow the spirit and letter of the 
Prime Minister's bill, the Ontario members of this House would 
have a veto over Quebec's future. That is undemocratic, because 
the federal government gives itself the right to refuse to 
recognize the vote of Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If 56% of Quebecers voted yes, the very next day they would say 
that 57% was required. If we had 57%, they would say that 58% was 
required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, a member from Ontario said “We have the right to do 
everything we can to keep Canada as it is right now”. Everything 
we can. 
That “everything” is a very dangerous word in the mouth of that 
man. We do not know to what extremes that government may be 
prepared to go to try to keep Canada as it is right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 is also undemocratic because it gives more weight to a 
federalist vote than to a sovereignist vote. With 50% plus one, 
one person equals one vote. However, if the limit is set at 60%, 
a federalist vote is worth 1.1 or something like that. At 70%, 
that vote would be worth 1.2. That does not make any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my family, we are seven. There is one federalist and six 
sovereignists. The federalist could boast “It takes two of your 
votes to cancel mine”. That does not make any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the co-op system, the rule was “one man, one vote; one woman, 
one vote”, and now the government wants to change this rule. I 
hope we will not let it do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote what Mackenzie King said after the 1949 
referendum in Newfoundland, where 52.3% of the people voted to 
join Canada. Incidentally, the other provinces had not been 
consulted to know if they wanted to have Newfoundland join the 
Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, shortly after the Newfoundland referendum that showed 52% 
support for that option, Mackenzie King, then Prime Minister of 
Canada, said “The result of the plebiscite in favour of the 
union between the two countries is clear beyond any potential 
misunderstanding”. Mackenzie King was satisfied with 52.3% and 
did not see any reason to persist in believing there might 
possibly be some disagreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the Prime Minister take a look in the mirror tonight, 
that he think, get out of his official residence and travel to 
Quebec. If he is afraid to go to Quebec, he should at least visit 
his riding of Saint-Maurice. He should go to restaurants in 
Shawinigan and have breakfast with Quebec people to hear what 
they think of his Bill C-20.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there anyone in this House who can explain, or even better, 
show the clarity in this bill? The Prime Minister says that a

to a question put forth by the leader of the Bloc Quebecois, when 
he said “We hope that the bill will be passed as quickly as

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, we have important things to say 
about Bill C-20 and there will be a very important vote on it 
later this afternoon. 
If Liberal members are interested in knowing what we have to 
say, if they are serious, I would ask them to help maintain the 
quorum and be present in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask you to check that we have a quorum.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will try to keep some 
kind of flow.  It might be difficult if this is the game we are 
going to be subjected to all afternoon.  Members know full well 
that members are busy in committees and in meetings doing the 
work they were sent to Ottawa to do.  A member's job is not just 
to sit in this place and participate by listening to a speech. As 
we all know, these speeches are available in <I>Hansard</I>. 
It is available electronically as it is occurring and we know 
that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tactics which simply waste the time of the House by continually 
calling quorum are silly.  They do a disservice to the Canadian 
people and the people of Quebec who want to know what other 
parliamentarians from around the country think about the bill.  I 
would hope members opposite would allow all members in this place 
to at least finish their speeches so there is a flow to their 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was making the point that historically it is easy to 
understand why the Bloc members are against the bill. It is what 
they are dedicated to and there is no puzzle there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to understand what the problem is with the 
Conservative Party.  But if we look back in history, we realize 
the deal Prime Minister Mulroney made with the devil when he 
invited the current premier of the province of Quebec to sit at 
the cabinet table.  It is not hard to understand the current 
leader of the Conservative Party who has yet to show enough 
courage to stand for election to come into this place.  There is 
a byelection coming up in the not too distant future in St. 
John's.  Member after member of that party are defecting and 
resigning because they cannot tolerate the positions being taken. 
It is not hard to understand if we look at it from a historical 
perspective where the current leader of the Conservative Party is 
coming from, but it is shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tories in my riding ask me what in the world is going on and why 
they are doing this.  It is obvious what the strategy of the 
leader is, even though he did not have the courtesy to discuss it 
with his caucus prior to announcing it to the rest of the world. 
His strategy seems to be that maybe the Conservatives can get 
some votes in Quebec and try to rebuild the party if they oppose 
this bill. It is shameful politics of the worst kind that they 
would play with the future of this country and the future of that 
province by taking that kind of a position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it that really upsets the separatists and keeps them 
motivated?  I think about the united alternative conference to 
which I unfortunately was dispatched as a representative, as a 
spy for the Liberal Party.  It was like sticking a thousand pins 
in my eyes but I went. I was astounded to see separatists were 
actually invited to be headline speakers at the united 
alternative— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We invited you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  You did not invite me.  Had they 
invited me, I would have been delighted to deliver a calm and 
rational speech on exactly what they should be doing with their 
united alternative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in Quebec remember the advertisements the Reform 
Party ran in the last election.  They attempted to suggest that 
somehow one's place of birth should disqualify one from standing 
to be prime minister.  People remember that.  I know Reform 
members have attempted to distance themselves from that. I know 
that by coming up with some new party whatever it is called, that 
again they are going to try to distance themselves, but the 
people of Quebec will not forget that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know which is the right word, sympathy or empathy, but 
having been here for two years and having worked with members of 
the Bloc and knowing them, I have a much better understanding of 
what it is that motivates them.  They get motivated tremendously 
when they see the kind of intransigent position that a party like 
the Reform Party takes in relation to what amounts to a third of 
the country which is obviously and arguably one of the most 
important parts of the country.  The province of Quebec provides 
us—

ask you to check that we have a quorum.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, maybe they could learn to 
count.  They are worried about 50% plus one but they cannot even 
count how many members are in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get back to the point, I have developed some understanding. 
In fact one of the members of the Bloc who I met outside asked me 
if I was going to speak.  When I said yes, he said to please stay 
calm.  So I will because there are some things that must be said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear Bloc members say in the House that it is undemocratic to 
require a clear question.  My constituents do not understand that 
and ask what is wrong with that and why would they object to the 
question being clear?  They say that 50% plus one should be the 
deciding factor. If in fact they believe that 50% plus one should 
be the deciding factor, why do we continue to debate another 
referendum? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> You are a block head. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I am not a square head as the member 
seems to indicate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to the results in 1980.  The results were that 
59.6% said no. I do not know what part of that they do not 
understand; 59.6% said no and 40.4% said yes.  That is more than 
50% plus one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question was quite remarkable in the 1980 referendum: “The 
Government of Quebec has made public its proposal to negotiate a 
new agreement with the rest of Canada based on the equality of 
nations; this agreement would enable Quebec to” and it goes on 
and on.  It asks if the people agree with giving the Government 
of Quebec the authority to negotiate some kind of arrangement 
with the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer was clear then.  The separatists did not agree with 
the answer.  They did not agree with the results so they worked 
over a 15 year period to develop another question.  That question 
is shorter and a little more clear.  Remember that those members 
are asking for 50% plus one.  The question is:  Do you agree that 
Quebec should become sovereign after having made a formal offer 
to Canada for a new economic and political partnership within the 
scope of the bill respecting the future of Quebec and of the 
agreement signed on June 12, 1995?  Yes, 49.4; no, 50% plus one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they agree that it should be 50% plus one, if that is the 
argument, then they should accept the results.  The results are 
very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not accept the premise that anybody wants a referendum 
other than Premier Bouchard, a few of the henchmen that work with 
him and perhaps the members of the Bloc.  In all of the polling 
results we have seen, it is absolutely clear that the population 
of Quebec does not want it.  They want to get on with other 
things in their lives.  They are the same as everybody else. 
Their Visa cards are overextended.  They are trying to get the 
kids through school.  They have to buy a new car or get the old 
one fixed. They have the same problems everybody has whether they 
are in St. John's, Newfoundland or Victoria or Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that they are saying, “Once and for all, would you 
people in Ottawa put a question that is clear and let us get an 
answer to this”.  That is what this bill says.  It is absolutely 
beyond me why anybody would object to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of this issue is quite interesting.  People talk 
about the recent history.  They talk about the referendum when 
Mulroney tore the paper in half and caused people to get upset. 
They talk about the closeness of it, but this has been going on 
in this great country for years and years and years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I consider myself to be a Pearsonian Liberal. Lester Pearson, 
the great prime minister of this country, did some things but I 
am out of time and I cannot share those comments about the Right 
Hon. Lester Pearson.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say that it is fair to have a clear question and it is 
absolutely fair to have a clear result. Finally, if we are going 
to have a referendum, once and for all we can put this issue to 
bed and get on with developing the greatest nation in the world. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is an honour and a pleasure for me to rise today in the House to 
speak to Bill C-20, the clarity bill.  The full title of the bill 
is an act to give effect to the requirement for clarity as set 
out in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Quebec 
secession reference. That title explains very well the objective 
of this legislation. However, I think the bill could just as 
easily be entitled an act to respect the rights of Quebecers and 
the rights of Canadians in any future referendum on Quebec 
separation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the justices of the supreme court noted, the subject matter 
of this issue “requires us to consider momentous questions that 
go to the heart of our system of constitutional government”. 
Momentous questions indeed.  There are few topics that this House 
of Commons has dealt with that touch the fibre of our 
constitutional being more than the bill we have before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill speaks to an issue that is fundamental to Canada and 
Canadians.  As the justices stated, the court is engaged in 
rendering an advisory opinion on certain legal aspects of the 
continued existence of the Canadian federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the risk of being somewhat literary, this bill grapples with 
the age old question raised in Hamlet's soliloquy, to be or not 
to be.  That is indeed the very real question. If the Canada we 
know, one of the great democracies of the world, an oasis of 
tolerance and compassion, a respected leader in the family of 
nations, is not to be, then the process by which we arrive at 
that tragic conclusion and the implications of such a decision 
must be absolutely clear to each and every Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one sets out to dismantle one of the greatest countries on 
the face of the planet, there is no room for confusion.  There is 
no room for obfuscation, wiggle room or interpretation.  At every 
step of the way there must be the very highest level of clarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clarity is not something that is simply owed to the people of a 
province wishing to separate.  It is owed to the people of Canada 
and indeed the international community.  No country exists in a 
vacuum, so the precedent that is set by the enactment of this 
legislation forms an important contribution to the body of 
international law on the issue of secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that, as they said at the U.S. Democratic 
convention in 1968, the whole world is watching. The issue of 
secession is one which the international community has a great 
interest in.  There are few areas in the world which have not 
been affected by both successful and unsuccessful secessionist 
movements.  The recent developments in Chechnya or the other 
former Soviet republics, East Timor, Eritrea, Slovakia, the 
breakup of the former Yugoslavia, Kosovo, and Catalonia in Spain 
illustrate the importance of this issue to the world at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent article in the respected British magazine <I>The 
Economist</I> dealt with the issue of secession.  Among the points 
this particular article made on secession were: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be carried out only if a clear majority (well over 50% 
plus one of the voters) have freely chosen it, ideally in an 
unbiased referendum held in tranquil circumstances. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian principles of peace, order and good government are 
deep democratic traditions.  Our federalism and constitutionalism 
are expressed throughout this five page bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier the purpose of this bill is to give 
effect to the requirement for clarity set out in the opinion of 
the Supreme Court of Canada.  I believe it would be helpful to 
understand precisely the nature of the questions which the 
supreme court addressed and some of the other comments that the 
court made.  There were three questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question number one:  Under the constitution of Canada, can the 
national assembly, legislature or Government of Quebec effect the 
secession of Quebec from Canada unilaterally? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question number two: Does international law give the national 
assembly, legislature or Government of Quebec the right to effect 
the secession of Quebec from Canada unilaterally?  In this regard 
is there a right to self-determination under international law 
that would give the national assembly, legislature or Government 
of Quebec the right to effect the secession of Quebec from Canada 
unilaterally? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question number three: In the event of a conflict between 
domestic and international law on the right of the national 
assembly, legislature or Government of Quebec to effect the 
secession of Quebec from Canada unilaterally, which would take 
precedence in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did the court answer the questions?  On question number one 
the supreme court response was unequivocal.  It stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Constitution vouchsafes order and stability, and accordingly 
secession of a province `under the Constitution' could not be 
achieved unilaterally, that is, without principled negotiation 
with other participants in Confederation within the existing 
constitutional framework. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again on the question of unilateral secession the court made 
some statements that may be of particular interest to those on 
the Bloc and Reform benches. 
The court stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy...means more than simple majority rule. Constitutional 
jurisprudence show that democracy exists in the larger context of 
other constitutional values. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At another point in the judgment the court stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The referendum result, if it is to be taken as an expression of 
the democratic will, must be free of ambiguity both in terms of 
the question asked and in terms of the support it achieves. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On question number two the court is again unequivocal, and I 
quote the reference: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Assembly, the legislature or the government of 
Quebec do not enjoy a right at international law to effect the 
secession of Quebec from Canada unilaterally. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly the court does note the possibility of what it 
describes as “an unconstitutional declaration of secession 
leading to a de facto secession”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I believe with great conviction that Canadians 
regardless of what province they live in have the unassailable 
right to expect that their provincial government will in every 
instance respect the rule of law and the constitution.  To do 
otherwise would turn a secessionist initiative into an illegal 
and unconstitutional activity that could very well have 
unfortunate and unintended consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On question number three the court stated that since there was 
no conflict between domestic and international law there was no 
need to address that issue.  In reading the judgment of the 
supreme court one is struck by how reasonable the court's 
conclusions were.  In every respect the court has provided a 
judgment that is in keeping with the letter and the spirit of the 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What precisely does the clarity bill do?  It provides for the 
House of Commons to determine the clarity of a referendum 
question on the secession of a province and sets out some of the 
considerations to be taken into account in making its 
determination.  It prohibits the Government of Canada from 
entering into negotiations on the terms under which a province 
might cease to be part of Canada if a referendum question was 
unclear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following a referendum on secession in a province the bill 
provides for the House of Commons to determine if a clear 
majority of the people in that province had clearly expressed a 
will to cease to be part of Canada, and it sets out factors to be 
considered in making its determination.  It also prohibits the 
Government of Canada from engaging in negotiations with a 
province unless a clear majority had clearly expressed its will 
to secede. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally the legislation recognizes that the secession of a 
province requires an amendment to the Constitution of Canada, 
which in turn requires negotiations involving all provincial 
governments and the Government of Canada.  It also requires that 
certain matters such as the division of assets and liabilities, 
border changes and the rights of aboriginal peoples and other 
minorities must be addressed before a constitutional amendment is 
proposed by a minister of the crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clarity bill is about honesty.  It is about providing the 
conditions for an honest result on any future referendum.  If one 
takes the time to read the supreme court judgment, one will find 
the document explains our rich constitutional history and 
analyzes our most important constitutional principles.  The 
inherent duty of our constitution is that it provides and 
protects fundamental rights within the framework of federalism, 
the rule of law, democracy, the protection of minorities and 
constitutionalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to end my remarks with a statement that is referred 
to in the supreme court judgment from one of our most illustrious 
Fathers of Confederation, Sir George-Étienne Cartier.  Those 
opposite who oppose this measure would do well to reflect upon 
his words when he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our federation, we will have Catholics and Protestants, 
English, French, Irish and Scots, and everyone, through his 
efforts and successes, will add to the prosperity and glory of 
the new confederation.  We are of different races, not so that we 
can wage war on one another, but in order to work together for 
our well-being. 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
honoured to stand in Canada's parliament to speak in this very 
important debate.  Frankly I wish sincerely that all members of 
the House would pay very close attention to what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is as important a matter as I believe we can ever face in 
this country.  It is the existence of our country itself.  For 
some members of our assembly not to be paying full attention, not 
to be involved and not to be thinking this through is 
unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that some are in committees and others have 
constituency work in other parts of the country.  That is part of 
the role of a member of parliament.  Perhaps it would have been 
better had we given more time to debate.  I cannot but help begin 
my intervention this afternoon by pointing out to everyone who is 
listening that once again the government has invoked a form of 
closure. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technically it is called time allocation, which is worse than 
closure, because it gives us less time for debate than closure 
does.  I cannot understand.  On an issue as important as this one 
we need to give ample time for not only parliamentarians to speak 
to it but for Canadians in general to become involved in the 
debate to discuss the issues, the pros and the cons, and to seek 
input into study of the bill.  We need to travel across the 
country to see what Canadians want or aspire to in their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disgusted at the Liberal government and its total disregard 
for the democratic process in the House.  It has a bill that is 
supposed to be related to a democratic process with respect to 
the possible secession of a province, yet it has trodden on the 
ability of parliamentarians to debate it fully not only here but 
around the country.  It is very distressing.  Although many 
members cannot possibly be here today, I know they would be here 
tomorrow, the day after, and on other days to take their turn 
expressing themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is called the clarity bill in its vernacular.  I have 
heard several speakers say this afternoon that the bill lacks 
clarity.  I am afraid I have to agree.  Basically all it says is 
that there shall be clarity in the wording of the question and 
there shall be a clear majority.  Neither the wording of the 
question nor the level of the majority nor the number of voters 
who have to participate in a vote for it to pass are spelled out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very undefined bill.  All it says is that after the 
decision is made by the province choosing to secede parliament 
will study the question within certain time limits.  It is not 
clear to me whether the bill even says that the threshold will be 
declared in advance.  I think that is the intention of the bill 
but it could be interpreted otherwise.  That is not a very good 
way of handling it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certainly not willing right now to speculate on what a 
clear question should be.  I can think of some things that 
perhaps one could put forward, but I hesitate to do it because of 
the possible ramifications of not making a wise choice.  This 
needs a lot of careful thought.  The question should be clear and 
succinct.  When it is determined it should be included in the 
bill and debated in the House.  The kind of question that would 
be considered clear should have been in Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the question of what proportion of the people 
should vote for it.  Some said 50% plus one vote.  Some said 58%. 
Some said two-thirds and so on.  The goal of Bloc members is to 
separate from Canada.  I accept that as their goal but I dislike 
it.  One thing I must say about them is that in the six years I 
have observed their work in the House they have not wavered from 
their goal.  Pretty well in every speech on no matter what topic 
they are able to weave into it that they want to get out of 
Canada.  I regret that.  If they ever do that it will pull out 
part of the heart of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am with members who say it is regrettable that we have to have 
this bill.  Yet the reality is that a number of citizens, 
primarily in Quebec, have sent more separatists members here than 
other members.

not all votes require a simple majority.  For a number of years I 
have been chairman or president of different organizations and we 
used <I>Robert's Rules of Order</I>, which are quite different 
from the rules here.  In <I>Robert's Rules of Order</I> there are 
a number of occasions where an action to be taken requires more 
than 50%.  For example— 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order 
again, we still do not have a quorum. I do not know who has been doing 
the counting. I was told we needed 20 members to have a quorum 
and at present we do not have 20 members in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I see that we have a quorum. The hon. member 
for Elk Island. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is difficult.  I do not 
use notes when I speak.  I try to use my head instead.  It is 
difficult to keep the train of thought of going but I think I 
will manage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of occasions in those rules when two-thirds 
are needed.  For example, a motion that has already been dealt 
with cannot be revisited unless two-thirds of the people present 
in the meeting vote in favour of it.  Some instances require more 
than 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The requirement is clear.  The people of the province proposing 
a question should know in advance what is the number.  We expect 
at least 60% of people vote.  We will not consider this a clear 
vote, an expression of the people, unless there is at least 50% 
plus one, 60% or 66%.  Whatever it is, it must be determined in 
advance and it must be fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a slight diversion from the topic but it has to do with 
the mathematics involved.  We very seldom have a 100% turnout at 
an election.  Sometimes it is as high as 80% in some ridings and 
it is less than 50% in others.  The question in a democracy is 
how to represent the will of the majority.  It is possible, if 
people do not show up to vote in an election, that the proportion 
of those who do show up could be a skewed sample. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could use a truly random sample.  For example, we could look 
at the HRD scandal before us these days.  Apparently the auditors 
there used a random sample.  Then it is quite accurate to 
attribute the characteristics of the sample to the whole 
population.  However, in a general election we do not have a 
random sample.  People come out to vote if they feel strongly 
about an issue.  Those who do not feel very strongly might just 
not bother.  They are not as highly motivated to attend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in some ridings people who are really against the 
government might show up in greater numbers to vote to kick the 
government out than those who are tepidly in favour of the 
government.  That poses a risk to the sitting government member 
in a riding because he or she may not get supporters out in the 
same numbers as those who want to arrange for the turfing of that 
member. 
That happens particularly in an election or in a vote which is as 
emotion bound as that of a secession vote.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my time is almost up, but I want to use the closing 
minutes to say a few words to the people of Quebec.  I do not 
think I will be successful in persuading the separatist members 
here, although I wish I could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Physically we have to live together.  We cannot take a giant 
chainsaw, cut around Quebec and float Quebec away so there will 
be some distance between us.  Physically we will stay together, 
no matter what kind of political arrangement we have.  We need to 
make sure that we have the best possible political arrangement 
for that situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that people in the province of Quebec, as in all other 
provinces, should be able to so arrange their affairs within 
confederation so they do not want to leave.  The policies of the 
Reform Party, the policies of the new Canadian alliance, are such 
that I believe Quebecers could live with them if they took the 
time to read them, study them and give them careful thought, and 
not simply say with a prejudiced point of view “We are not going 
to listen to them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I plead for a fair hearing of what we are actually saying.  They 
can look it up on the website and ask for literature.  We are 
certainly willing to share it.  I know that we can come to a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to speak about the events which led to Bill 
C-20.  Before I do so I would like to inform the House of a 
message that I received from my constituents during the recess. 
They were strongly in favour of this bill.  In fact there were a 
number of my constituents who came to me and asked why it had 
taken our government so long to table this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to look back to the circumstances of the 1995 
referendum to explain why our government decided to table Bill 
C-20.  I note that some of my colleagues noted that we do not 
take great joy in having to take such a step, but we do so 
because the separatist leaders continue to brandish the threat of 
another referendum on separation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look back for a moment to the 1994 general election in 
Quebec, which was won by the Parti Quebecois.  At that time the 
PQ strategy was to jumpstart the process leading up to Quebec 
separation, even before Quebecers had a chance to vote on it in a 
referendum.  Then Quebec Premier Jacques Parizeau claimed that 
Quebec had a right to self-determination, which would allow it to 
separate from Canada unilaterally.  Draft legislation along those 
lines was actually tabled in the national assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an attempt to whip up support for its option the Parizeau 
government struck numerous political commissions in every region 
of the province.  Following several weeks of so-called 
consultations the commissions reported back to the national 
commission on the future of Quebec, which submitted a report to 
the PQ government on April 19, 1995.  That was also the time of 
the notorious Le Hir reports, which would become one of the most 
incredible propaganda exercises ever undertaken in Quebec's 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spring of 1995 Mr. Parizeau's Parti Quebecois changed 
tack regarding the referendum question, deciding to adopt a vague 
concept of association included in an eventual question.  And so, 
the sovereignty partnership was born. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is noteworthy that Mr. Parizeau had hitherto opposed any such 
concept, wanting instead to concentrate on sovereignty.  In an 
interview in 1990 he stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I'm concerned, the question that should be asked the 
next time around ought to be on Quebec sovereignty, not on “Do 
you authorize us to negotiate to see whether....”  No, no.  I 
think it has to be clear....We've now come to the point where we 
have to ask Quebecers how they feel about sovereignty. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with certain defeat in the referendum, he chose instead, 
for political reasons, to adopt this concept of partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 12, 1995, Jacques Parizeau, Lucien Bouchard, then leader 
of the Bloc Quebecois, and Mario Dumont, leader of the Action 
démocratique du Québec, signed a tripartite agreement on that 
basis. 
Under that agreement the Government of Quebec, following a vote 
in favour of its option, would undertake negotiations with the 
rest of Canada to establish a political and economic partnership. 
Those negotiations would be limited to one year at the most, at 
which time sovereignty would be proclaimed whether or not a 
partnership had been concluded.  The agreement also stipulated 
that the Government of Quebec could terminate the negotiations at 
any time if it deemed they were not progressing quickly enough.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After having told a diplomat that the referendum process was 
like a lobster trap that Quebecers could not get out of, Mr. 
Parizeau was now hiding his true intentions.  Despite this new 
partnership spin, all he really wanted was a yes vote that he 
could then use to make a unilateral declaration of independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not conjecture on my part.  The proof is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the very day of the referendum, Mr. Parizeau taped a 
televised message to the population in which he clearly stated 
his intention of going ahead with a unilateral declaration of 
independence.  He confirmed that intention in his memoirs.  It is 
there in black and white on page 286.  He stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be noted that any speeches I have made pertaining to 
negotiations with Canada have been so worded to allow for such a 
declaration of sovereignty.  And I have never made any 
undertaking, either in public or in private, not to make a 
unilateral declaration of sovereignty. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the famous concept of partnership really boiled 
down to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anybody could have had their own interpretation of this concept, 
but Mr. Parizeau would have thrown the concept out the window at 
the first opportunity.  Fortunately, he never got that chance 
because a majority of Quebecers refused to fall into that trap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The confusion surrounding a unilateral declaration of 
independence says a lot about the agreement of June 12, 1995, 
which was one of the cornerstones of the yes side's referendum 
campaign in 1995.  Mr. Dumont, who was one of the signatories to 
the agreement, stated recently that he has never been a 
sovereignist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Mr. Parizeau, he went on to make yet another statement in 
his typical style.  He wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It's often been said that the question in 1995 wasn't clear. 
It's true, as I've said many times, that the question I would 
have preferred was the following:  Do you want Quebec to become a 
sovereign (or independent) country as of...? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There we have Mr. Parizeau's deep-rooted conviction about the 
concept of partnership.  It is noteworthy that the only time Mr. 
Parizeau ever toned down his hard line separatist rhetoric was at 
the very time he was in a position to put it into practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the question that was asked in the end?  It was set out 
in Bill 1, an act respecting the future of Quebec, and it reads 
as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you agree that Quebec should become sovereign after having 
made a formal offer to Canada for a new economic and political 
partnership within the scope of the bill respecting the future of 
Quebec and of the agreement signed on June 12, 1995? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right away we can see a key difference in comparison with the 
referendum process that was undertaken in 1980.  Unlike that 
earlier process, the Government of Quebec provided for only one 
referendum in 1995.  Let us bear in mind that under the latter 
formula sovereignty was not conditional upon a political and 
economic partnership with the rest of Canada.  Whether or not any 
agreement were reached with the rest of the country, sovereignty 
would be inevitable.  It would come about no matter what 
happened, and Quebecers would have no say on the final product. 
There would be no second vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an attempt to clarify the question, the Quebec Liberal Party 
proposed a number of amendments to Bill 1.  All of those 
amendments were rejected by the PQ government.  At the same time, 
the Prime Minister of Canada stated that the question was 
ambiguous and that a majority of 50% plus one would be too small 
to effect sovereignty.  We all know the outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 30, 1995, 50.48% of Quebec voters answered no, while 
49.42% voted yes.  Of special note are poll results obtained in 
the last days of the campaign, indicating that one out of five 
yes voters truly believed that Quebec would still remain a 
Canadian province in the event of a yes victory. 
The separatist leaders' campaign of smoke and mirrors worked 
very effectively.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all of those reasons our government is duty bound to act now 
to ensure that Quebecers will not have to bankroll yet another 
misinformation campaign to get them to support separation, an 
option which they have twice rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill tabled by the intergovernmental affairs 
minister is to ensure that the referendum process is clear and 
that Quebecers can make a choice secure in the knowledge that all 
the cards are well and truly laid on the table.  They have the 
right to vote on a clear option and a crystal clear question. 
They are entitled to the assurance that they will never lose 
their Canadian citizenship and all of the other advantages they 
enjoy as Canadians, unless they have renounced Canada loud and 
clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the purpose of the clarity act.  As its name suggests it 
seeks to ensure that the choice to be made is clear to everyone. 
Since the separatist leaders will not support that objective, our 
government has decided to enact legislation to ensure that our 
democratic tradition is not usurped by double talk and double 
dealing. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please.  It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the 
hon. member for Mercier—East Timor. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak on behalf of a vast majority of my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In everyday life, a number of them are political opponents of 
mine who do not necessarily share my burning desire to live in 
my own country, Quebec, as soon as possible. However, this time 
they share my opposition to Bill C-20, introduced in this House 
on December 10 by the member for Saint-Laurent—Cartierville, the 
Canadian Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. The bill is 
entitled an act to give effect to the requirement for clarity as 
set out in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada in the 
Quebec Secession Reference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, what happened this morning in this very House shows 
that the members of the Liberal Party of Canada, the party in 
power, have completely lost track of what it means to be 
democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy is first and foremost a concept that people must have 
between their ears. If it is not there, they can talk about it 
all they want, but they will not change anything in reality. They will 
then adopt undemocratic behaviours while pretending to serve 
democracy and to defend the public good. Moreover, they will do 
as this government is doing. They will become arrogant and go as 
far as to prevent their opponents from expressing their views on 
what the government considers to be a decisive issue for the 
future of Canada through a gag order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regularly hear on the radio or on TV and read in the 
newspapers, both English and French, statements by the 
member for Saint-Laurent—Cartierville saying that Quebecers do not 
want to hear about a referendum in the foreseeable future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has this member, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, 
already forgotten that he himself revived the debate on this 
issue in Quebec and Canada? If this minister is as sensitive to 
public opinion as he claims to be, why did he introduce a bill 
that nobody wants in Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will conclude today the debate at second reading of Bill C-20. 
Unfortunately, I will not have time to get to the core of the 
issue because I have no choice but to express my outrage at a 
government that, day after day, tramples on democracy and never 
misses an opportunity to lecture other countries. The people of 
Canada and Quebec must keep a close eye on their federal 
government, because the absence of democracy originates in its 
own backyard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last general election, in June 1997, if the Liberal Party 
of Canada had won only 151 seats, the leader of this party and 
member for Saint-Maurice would have agreed to form the government 
on the basis that his party had a majority. A majority of 50% 
plus one would have been enough to take office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister, the member for Saint-Maurice, and his Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs find that a majority of 50% plus 
one is not enough, while they belong to a party that got only 
38% of the vote in the last general election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must stop adding fuel to the flame. The hon. 
member for Saint-Maurice and the hon. member for 
Saint-Laurent—Cartierville must stop antagonizing the people of 
Quebec. 
The Prime Minister and his Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
must stop trying to gain the support of the Canadian people by 
denigrating the men and women of Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-20, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs wants 
to define the rules of the next Quebec referendum. This is clear 
interference in the democratic process that Quebec has put in 
place to decide its own political and constitutional future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the minister would have us believe that his government now 
recognizes the possibility for Quebec to break away from Canada 
when in fact his legislation is designed to make it increasingly 
difficult, if not impossible, to hold another referendum in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the former great professor will claim that I am not 
interpreting his bill properly and that he never intended to 
prevent Quebec from holding a referendum when and as it sees 
fit. But in reality, and notwithstanding what he claims so 
loudly every chance he gets, should Bill C-20 be passed, any 
potential referendum Quebec may want to hold would have to 
take into account the minister's wishes as set out in Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, I call upon members opposite who are moderately 
intelligent and who did not enter politics to be the sidekicks 
or the puppets of the member for Saint-Laurent—Cartierville. I 
call upon the intelligence of those members across the way who 
still know the meaning of the word “liberal”. I call upon those 
who are still able to express themselves within the Liberal Party 
and have not fallen victims to the gag order their party leader 
or their House leader imposes on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the people of Canada and Quebec have fully understood how 
horrible this bill is, they will know what to do at the 
ballot box at the next general federal election, as they did 
regarding employment insurance at the last general election. 
But it will be too late for our colleagues opposite, who will be 
sorry they did not have the courage to speak up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is still time for the government majority to intervene and 
make its Prime Minister and his Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs see reason. There are at least three good reasons 
the government should withdraw Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Bill C-20 is designed to give the House of Commons the 
power to disallow a legal and legitimate act of the national 
assembly and decision of the Quebec people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about a right of disallowance because Bill C-20 gives 
the House of Commons the power to determine by resolution 
whether it pleases the House to find that the question is clear 
and that a clear majority of the people of Quebec have clearly 
expressed their will to separate from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about a right of disallowance because Bill C-20 accords 
the House of Commons the power to reject a motion by which the 
national assembly would adopt a referendum question and to 
censor the result of a referendum without a clear majority, 
again in the opinion of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the intentions of the government on clarity and the 
question to be put to the aboriginal people on the Pointe-Bleue 
reserve in Roberval, no wonder doubts are cast on this 
government's ability to assess clarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the question to the voters in the band: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you accept and approve the settlement agreement dated, for 
reference purposes, the 14th day of December, 1999, between the 
Montagnais band of Lac-Saint-Jean and Her Majesty the Queen in 
right of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you agree to sanction, pursuant to sections 38(1) and 39 of 
the Indian Act, the absolute transfer to her Majesty the Queen 
in right of Canada by the Montagnais band of Lac-Saint-Jean all 
rights and those of its members pertaining to all parcels of 
reserve lands on concession IX of the Ouiatchouan township? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By voting yes, you authorize the Chief of the Montagnais band of 
Lac-Saint-Jean or any other member of the band council duly 
authorized by resolution to sign on behalf of the band council 
and its members all documents and to take all measures required 
to put into effect the settlement agreement and the absolute 
transfer of all parcels of the reserve lands on concession IX of 
the Ouiatchouan township. “Yes or no?” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much for the clarity of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Bill C-20 denies Quebecers the freedom to choose their 
political destiny, and particularly the freedom to include in a 
referendum question—if such is the desire of the national 
assembly—an offer of partnership with the rest of Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 is an attack on Quebec's freedom of choice because it 
limits the constitutional and political options for the future 
of Quebec by rejecting partnership outright. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In section 2 of Bill C-20, particularly subsections (4) (<I>a</I>) and 
(<I>b</I>), we see that the real political objective of the Liberal 
Government of Canada is to deprive the Government of Quebec of 
the possibility of presenting to the people of Quebec a modern 
version of independence and sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-20 is to prevent Quebec from extending its 
hand to Canada with the offer of a form of partnership which 
would be fully compatible with the new status of a sovereign 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As several analysts have pointed out, we are dealing with a 
strategy, a ploy of the Prime Minister and his Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, intended to place before Quebecers the 
following alternative: status quo or secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third reason is that Bill C-20 denies the universally 
accepted rule of 50% plus one for the majority, and the 
fundamental rule of the equality of votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since you are signalling that my time is nearly up, I would 
like to repeat that this bill ought to be withdrawn before the 
institution that is the House of Commons is condemned for having 
broken an essential principle, the equality of everyone before 
the law. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North—St. Paul, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we will have completed writing in the days ahead yet 
another chapter in our nation's history, a chapter that would 
make the fathers of Canadian Confederation proud of us, knowing 
that their legacy cannot be undone under a cloud of confusion and 
uncertainty of the people's will and outside our shared societal 
values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to Bill C-20 before us, also popularly known as the 
clarity act.  It is a bill that sets clear parameters under which 
Canada would negotiate the secession of a province from our 
federation.  The bill clarifies the binding relationship among 
the provinces and between them and Canada as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fate would have it that we are here on this premiere sitting of 
the House in the new century debating a bill that our forefathers 
surely would not have anticipated in 1867 when they began to 
build a country called Canada.  Nor could their wildest 
imaginations have foreseen that a nation so young would twice 
face the possibility of the breakup of our country, but prouder 
still are we that we should twice withstand the challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus I submit that past referenda on the secession of Quebec 
speak not of a weakened country, although it is my fervent hope 
that such activity will not continue indefinitely from time to 
time.  Rather, they speak to the will of the Canadian people to 
stay together when presented anew with a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, they speak to the strength of our nation's democracy.  Yes, 
they speak to the societal value of respect that we as Canadians 
hold for our shared values.  In addition to democracy, these 
values include federalism, constitutionalism and the rule of law 
and respect for minorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need only look at the make-up of the representation in this 
House to appreciate how that respect for values is manifest.  In 
what other country in the world will we find a political party 
sitting in the country's highest law-making body and yet 
unashamedly bent on separating the province from the country? 
Ironic as it sounds, it speaks to our respect for democracy in 
this country.  It speaks to our respect for democracy in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And so it is that the clarity act before us reflects this very 
shared value, including respect for minorities.  Yes, respect and 
not merely tolerance.  Unlike tolerance, respect is a more 
profound societal value, for it brings with it a sense of justice 
and human dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy is abundantly evident in Bill C-20 for it safeguards 
the rights of the governed against the totalitarian rule of their 
government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even as it protects the rights of citizens to have their 
citizenship and their province within Canada against the 
misguided wish of their provincial government, the bill respects 
at the same time their rights to secede from the rest of the 
country should they clearly express that will by a clear majority 
vote on a clear question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, these two expressions of democracy alone, a clear 
majority on a clear question, are not sufficient basis for a 
unilateral declaration of independence on the part of any 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada says “Democracy means more than 
simple majority rule”. It further says “Democracy exists in the 
larger context of other constitutional values”, to which I 
alluded to earlier.  Negotiations, therefore, have to take place 
following a clear vote on a clear question of secession from 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In clear words, the Supreme Court of Canada holds that: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>...the democratic vote, by however strong a majority, would have 
no legal effect on its own and could not push aside the 
principles of federalism and the rule of law, the rights of 
individuals and minorities, or the operation of democracy in 
other provinces or in Canada as a whole. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These democratic tenets link rights with obligations.  While 
these tenets recognize the constitutional right of the members of 
our federation to initiate constitutional change, there is the 
reciprocal duty on the part of other participants to engage in 
discussions to address any legitimate initiative to a change in 
constitutional order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, exercise only of rights without discharging one's 
reciprocal obligation puts at risk the very legitimacy of that 
exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of a clear majority, members of the opposition have 
argued that 50% plus one is sufficient.  If it were so, it would 
make it absurd to consider what then would constitute an unclear 
majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that clear majority should mean more than 50% plus 
one.  In addition to requiring that the vote be a clear majority, 
it is also crucial that the question be clear.  That is, the 
words should mean the same thing for everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the bill provide a mechanism for the measurement of 
clarity?  Yes.  The more the question makes clear the will to no 
longer remain in Canada and become an independent country, the 
more clear the question is.  The further it strays from this 
requirement of the Supreme Court of Canada, the less is the 
question's clarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 is a reasonable bill.  This is not merely a statement 
by the Government of Canada.  A cross-section of the national 
media has acknowledged this affirmation:  from Quebec's <I>La 
Presse,</I>, <I>Le Nouvelliste</I>, the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> and 
<I>La Tribune</I> to the Halifax <I>Daily News</I>, Fredericton's 
<I>Daily Gleaner</I>, the Toronto <I>Star</I>, the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>, the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> to the Winnipeg <I>Free 
Press</I>, the Regina <I>Leader Post</I>, the Saskatoon <I>Star 
Phoenix</I>, the Calgary <I>Herald</I>, the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> and 
the Victoria <I>Times Colonist</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Truly we can take pride that the federal government has deemed 
it proper to bring forward the legislation before us, a bill that 
champions the respect for democracy and the rule of law and the 
operation of our shared values as Canadian citizens when any 
province contemplates permanent departure from the Canadian 
family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This move on the part of the Government of Canada attests to its 
decisive and bold leadership on this issue.  This was the same 
leadership that was evident when the government referred this 
issue to the highest judicial tribunal of the land, the Supreme 
Court of Canada, and that judgment was applauded even by the 
incumbent premier of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, Bill C-20 exudes the fullest expression of 
responsible democracy and reasonableness.  It is all these and 
more.  It embodies the advisory judgment of the Supreme Court of 
Canada respecting the reciprocal rights and obligations of the 
federal and provincial governments and to govern within their 
respective jurisdictions.  It embodies in clarity the binding 
relationship and shared values among them and among us; a 
relationship and set of values that must be considered when a 
province contemplates secession from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Canadian I am not by birth.  A Canadian I am by choice. 
Truly, our country was created on mutual consent out of the 
diversity of our people, a diversity that has made our nation 
rich and from which we continue to draw strength. 
Bill C-20 reminds us of our diversity in origin, culture, 
language and faith.

today to take part in the discussion of this bill to give effect 
to the requirement of clarity in the opinion of the Supreme Court 
of Canada on the Quebec secession reference case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This caucus has announced its support in principle.  That is not 
to say we are not concerned about some aspects of the bill. We 
have concerns that in fairness have been heightened by what we 
can only see as the shenanigans today of the government members 
opposite with the imposition of time allocation.  I note that I 
will be the second and probably the last speaker of the day from 
our caucus that will have an opportunity to participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether other members do not see and share the 
hypocrisy in all of this.  After all, here we are with a piece of 
legislation that purports to recognize the need to consult all 
Canadians as opposed to just those living in the province of 
Quebec on this critical issue of secession.  And the government 
says, “Oh, by the way, we are introducing closure and time 
allocation and we have a mere day to debate it”. It is 
hypocritical and offensive to all democratically elected members 
in the House regardless of which side of this issue members are 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely there are very few issues in any democracy that are more 
important than keeping the country together.  To deny hundreds of 
democratically elected members the opportunity and the right to 
speak in the House of Commons about an issue as fundamental as 
this one, I find to be deeply offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP caucus approach this piece of legislation with 
some regret because it does contemplate the breakup of Canada. We 
would have preferred to concentrate on the very many positive 
aspects and proposals to strengthen national unity, to improve 
democracy and the way in which the country works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aside, I would invite listeners and members opposite to 
have a look at the social democratic forum on Canada's future 
which the New Democratic Party caucus and party worked on last 
year and presented at our convention of August 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, we think Canada could do much better and to no small 
extent we hold the government responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of us remember and were observers in person at what can 
only be described as the pathetic performance of the now Prime 
Minister when he was running for the leadership of the Liberal 
Party in Calgary almost 10 years ago.  Who can forget him 
welcoming to the box in the Saddledome the then premier of 
Newfoundland hours after Mr. Wells had done his bit to sabotage 
the Meech Lake accord?  I note a causal effect of that was the 
immediate creation of the Bloc Quebecois and the resurgence of 
discussion of separatism and separation in the province of 
Quebec. 
The rejection of the Charlottetown accord two years later gave a 
boost to the other extreme party in this parliament, the Reform 
Party.  As a result, any prospects for a plan A have now gone out 
the window and we are firmly charted on a plan B course.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the election of the government in 1993 we have seen 
devolution of powers conferred to the provinces.  We have not 
witnessed to my recollection any first ministers conferences to 
try to resolve some of our problems on the national unity issue. 
The social union framework from our point of view has failed to 
deal adequately with social rights and certainly does not 
accommodate Quebec's desire to opt out of most national programs 
with full compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill itself talks about two things, a clear question and a 
clear majority.  In speaking to constituents in my riding of 
Palliser, there is not much debate around the clear question.  I 
think there is a lot of merit in that.  A clear majority and what 
constitutes that however does give rise to more discussion and 
division of opinion. Certainly the bill to that extent does 
correspond to the two conditions set out by the supreme court 
that would have to be met before the rest of Canada is to be 
obliged to negotiate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is supposed to address what would need to occur for 
there to be an extraordinary constitutional negotiation leading 
to the secession of Quebec or any other province for that matter. 
The court said a clear majority vote in Quebec on a clear 
question in favour of secession would confer democratic 
legitimacy on the secession initiative which all of the other 
participants in Confederation would have to recognize.  However, 
the court also made a second equally important point, that 
Quebec's right to self-determination must be exercised within the 
Canadian constitutional framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see in this decision, or opinion more correctly, that 
Quebec's right to self-determination must be respected by the 
other partners of Confederation, but that this right must be 
exercised with respect for the other democratic values that have 
guided this country for more than 130 years.  In striking a 
balance between these two key principles, the supreme court 
specified a clear role for the federal parliament in any 
secession bid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a key actor in the constitutional procedure, parliament does 
have an obligation to negotiate in good faith should it be 
confronted with a clear will to secede.  It has an obligation to 
represent the rights and interests of all Canadians in any such 
negotiating process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What needs to be debated, and I assume we will now have to rely 
on doing this at the committee stage, is whether parliament in 
exercising that right has set the bar on the issue of clarity and 
majority too high or whether the bill acts in some other way that 
can be judged as unfair or prejudicial to the freedom of the 
Quebec people or the rights of minorities in Quebec, such as the 
aboriginal community.  That is what both our party's consultation 
process and parliament's legislative committee need to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to recognize and express the concern we have for the 
rights of aboriginal people because we do not feel that they are 
protected adequately in this bill.  Clearly, existing 
constitutional protections for aboriginal rights would be 
threatened by the secession of any province.  The bill does 
specify that the question of aboriginal rights would need to be 
addressed, but it does not specify a basic level of protection 
for these rights that would need to be achieved before parliament 
could agree to the secession of any province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also identifies various actors whose views parliament 
must take into consideration in its deliberations on a secession 
bid.  Unfortunately and notably, aboriginal peoples are not among 
those specifically involved.  New Democrats will therefore be 
seeking ways to ensure that aboriginal peoples are meaningfully 
involved in Bill C-20 and that there is stronger protection 
provided in the bill for their rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find this absence particularly ironic given the fact that 
there is recognition in the bill to the unelected Senate.  As 
hon. members know, New Democrats on this side of the House have 
long argued that an unelected, unaccountable Senate has no place 
in a modern democracy. 
We see again the hypocrisy of ignoring aboriginal Canadians while 
involving the Senate in a way that we think is unconscionable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years New Democrats have often had to take positions on 
so-called national unity issues.  I am very proud of the fact 
that even at the founding of the New Democratic Party back in 
1961 New Democrats affirmed the right of Quebecers to determine 
their own future freely and democratically.  The NDP is proud to 
have been the first federal party to recognize that right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the last convention in August 1999 we did adopt a paper that 
advocated recognizing Quebecers as a people not in the ethnic and 
therefore inappropriate nationalistic sense, but rather in the 
sense of recognizing that Quebecers are one of the two linguistic 
and cultural realities within which most Canadians live and move 
and have their social being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On these occasions, last year being the most recent, we have 
been able to play a constructive role in forcing improvements to 
various constitutional initiatives. With the clarity bill New 
Democrats are presented with another such opportunity.  We 
approach this bill in the same spirit of good faith with which we 
have approached other initiatives in the past.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will take the opportunity during this debate to discuss the 
legitimacy of the role of the House of Commons in setting rules 
that would guide the conduct of the House and of the federal 
government within a process that could lead to the secession of 
one of our federation's provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 19 <I>La Presse</I> published an article by Mr. Claude 
Castonguay who incidentally was the minister of health and social 
services in the first Robert Bourassa government.  He has taken 
part in all of the debates on the political future of Quebec 
either as a minister, a senator or a concerned citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his article Mr. Castonguay stated, “Quebec independence 
would have profound repercussions for all of Canada and its 
citizens, including those in Quebec who want to remain Canadian. 
So it should be no surprise that the federal government wants to 
set some rules of conduct that it intends to follow in the event 
of another referendum on sovereignty.  That is the objective of 
the recent bill on clarity tabled in the House of Commons”. He 
went on to say, “I find it difficult to see this bill which in 
no way limits the prerogatives of the national assembly as an 
attack on Quebec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the words of a great Quebecer with vast experience in 
political and federal politics whose integrity and political 
judgment have earned him the esteem of his fellow citizens 
regardless of political stripe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Castonguay chose to reflect carefully on the clarity bill 
before entering into the debate.  More than a month after the 
bill was tabled, he acknowledged loudly and clearly what many 
believe in their hearts but do not dare to say in public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is perfectly legitimate for the Government of Canada, while 
respecting the powers of the provincial legislative assembly, to 
set rules that would guide its conduct within a process that 
could lead to the secession of a province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Castonguay's statement is at odds with the many objections 
that were raised when the draft bill was introduced and which 
have been raised since the bill was tabled that challenge the 
very legitimacy of the role of the House of Commons in this 
affair. Those secessionist critics are trying to convince people 
not only in Canada but on the international scene as well that 
the House of Commons is usurping its powers when it takes the 
necessary measures to set rules that would guide its own conduct 
and that of the federal government in the event that a province 
initiates a process that could lead to secession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those critics claim that we, the members of parliament 
representing all Canadians, are subject to unilateralism of the 
secessionist leaders and have no choice but to stand idly by 
should our federation break up.  Wanting to reduce the members of 
this House to mere spectators belies the profound ignorance of 
the origins of the Parliament of Canada. 
It flies in the face of our political traditions and practices.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think a little history 101 is in order.  In the introduction 
of the reference regarding the secession of Quebec, the supreme 
court in its wisdom provided some historical background.  In the 
courts own words: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Confederation was an initiative of elected representatives of the 
people then living in the colonies scattered across part of what 
is now Canada.  It was not initiated by imperial fiat. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justices of our federation's highest court went on to 
describe the circumstances in which our federation was born: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1864, a select committee of the Legislative Assembly of 
the Province of Canada...began to explore prospects for 
constitutional reform.  The committee's report, released in June 
1864, recommended that a federal union encompassing Canada East 
and Canada West, and perhaps the other British North American 
colonies, be pursued— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An opening to pursue federal union soon arose.  The leaders of 
the maritime colonies had planned to meet at Charlottetown in the 
fall to discuss the perennial topic of maritime union.  The 
Province of Canada secured invitations to send a Canadian 
delegation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 1, 1864, 23 delegates—five from New Brunswick, 
five from Nova Scotia, five from Prince Edward Island, and eight 
from the Province of Canada...met in Charlottetown—The delegates 
reached agreement on a plan for federal union...featuring a 
bicameral central legislature. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, this plan would take the form of the 72 Quebec 
resolutions.  Those resolutions were debated and in March 1865 
approved by the Canadian Legislative Assembly with the support of 
a majority of members from both Canada East and Canada West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our parliament and the House of Commons was born out of the 
desire of elected representatives of what were then British 
colonies to establish a federal government.   The federal 
parliament and the House of Commons is the tangible expression of 
that union, which was freely approved by elected representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Mr. Lucien Bouchard pout it so eloquently on July 1, 1988, 
“Canada was born 121 years ago, as the result of a process that 
drew on the sources of dialogue, negotiation, and openness”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1867 the House of Commons has been made up of members 
representing the constituent entities of the federation.  Since 
1867 members of this House have always taken pains to fulfil 
their responsibilities under section 91 of the Constitution Act, 
1867, of which the preamble stipulates that they are free “to 
make laws for the peace, order, and good government of Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet some people claim that we, the elected members of the House 
of Commons, have no say, have no right to take tangible measures 
when faced with a threat of secession.  If there were to be a 
secession they try to deny our role to the point of relieving us 
of our responsibilities toward all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This line of reasoning by the secessionist leaders is the result 
of such mental acrobatics and such twisted logic that the hon. 
member for Beauharnois—Salaberry, an academic and expert in 
international law, sometimes finds it difficult to endorse it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 8 in an interview on RDI he declined to give a flat 
no to the following question: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Isn't it legitimate for the federal government to want to assess 
the clarity of the question? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When pressed by the interviewer to clearly state his position he 
had this to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court suggests that Canadian political actors, which 
may include the House of Commons, can assess the clarity of the 
question and the majority, but not before the referendum. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I would like to quote from an interview in <I>Le 
Devoir</I> on January 27 by Mr. Benôit Lauzière who was the 
paper's editor from 1986 to 1990.  In that interview Mr. Lauzière 
described Canada in this way: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is above all a generous idea...and in my opinion, therein lies 
the principle of a modern citizenship.  I almost want to say that 
we are condemned to ensuring that it works.  Because what is the 
alternative?  The resurgence of every sort of nationalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would be running counter to the western world.  There aren't 
many places like it in the world.  As a citizen, I don't detest 
having several orders of government.  It comes back to the idea

emotion and gravity that I take part in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by quoting René Lévesque, a former member of the 
Liberal Party of Quebec, who said as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that it is possible to avoid the shared impasse of 
Canadian confederation by adapting to our situation the two 
predominant movements of our era: the movement toward freedom of 
peoples, and the movement toward freely negotiated political and 
economic groups. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spirit and the letter of this statement, which can be said 
to underlie the evolution of the sovereignist movement in 
Quebec, is being questioned, denied and rejected in the supposed 
clarity bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By its very wording, Bill C-20 entitled “An act to give effect to 
the requirement for clarity as set out in the opinion of the 
Supreme Court of Canada in the Quebec Secession Reference” 
misleads those listening or watching.  Never did the supreme 
court say or write that for a question to be clear it could not 
be associated with an offer of partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, we have had the support of the researchers at the C.D. 
Howe Institute, who confirmed that they did not understand why 
the government was saying this in its bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does this bill lack clarity, but the only thing it does 
do is preclude any other negotiation than secession negotiation. 
It does not state clearly what kind of majority Canada would 
require before entering into negotiation. After playing around 
with all kinds of numbers, it does not dare setting a specific 
one because it knows full well it would not have the support of 
the international community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither does it say what a clear question would be. The only 
thing the bill is very clear about is that the question could 
not envisage other possibilities in addition to the secession of 
the province from Canada, such as economic or political 
arrangements with Canada, that obscure a direct expression of 
the will of the population of that province on whether the 
province should cease to be part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada missed the opportunity to show some 
openness and a modern attitude toward the Quebec issue. This 
government, which wants to be the most forward looking on this

</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 20th century, particularly during the second half, 
the people of Quebec became increasingly aware of who they were, 
of their culture and also of the fact that, as a small minority 
within North America, they needed protection. For that, they 
could only count on themselves. Progressively the people of 
Quebec—very progressively and more widely—awakened to the idea of 
sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is entitled “An Act to give effect to the requirement 
for clarity as set out in the opinion of the Supreme Court of 
Canada in the Quebec Secession Reference”. The word secession 
does not belong to the vocabulary of sovereignists. The word 
secession refers to a Quebec surrounded by walls. 
Nothing could be further from what sovereignists have in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals who, today, support free trade with the whole 
world, with the exception perhaps of a sovereign Quebec, should 
remember that it is thanks to sovereignists and Quebecers that 
the free trade agreement that they now want to extend to the 
whole world was passed, this at a time when their leader was so 
bitterly opposed to the idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sovereignty is an open and modern project by a people which, 
while being sovereign, would want to renegotiate its economic 
ties with Canada. To me, it is very significant that the only 
clear thing in this extremely confusing bill is that Canada 
refuses this renegotiation of the relations between the two 
great peoples, and also with the aboriginal people. This is 
shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more this government opposes a democratic debate, the more 
its bill—I do not wish that, but when we see how they are 
behaving, we cannot help but think that it is likely to 
happen—will become illegitimate, obsolete, reactionary and 
conservative. This bill, which does not propose any renewal of 
the relations between peoples, can only be considered a 
meaningless document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our hope that the sovereign people of Quebec will be able 
to count on the sovereign people of Canada to understand that 
the future does not lie in conflict or confrontation, but in 
negotiation, that it does not lie in a refusal to negotiate, in 
a refusal to accept reality and in an idea that some people have 
in their head about Canada. We hope that Canadians will have the 
intelligence to see that, north of the United States, it is 
better to negotiate together to be stronger than to continue to 
get deeper and deeper in the common impasse described by René 
Lévesque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 is a denial of the Canadian attitude that we have 
always known. 
It is a denial of democracy in Quebec and of its history. Let us 
not forget that Robert Bourassa is the one who passed Bill 150. 
People can say what they want, but the Quebec National Assembly, 
under the Liberal premier of the day, passed a law providing for 
a referendum, with rules defined by the national assembly, to 
get out of that impasse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1992 referendum did not get us out of there, since the 
negotiations were grossly inadequate. 
In 1995 we almost got there. We think that at the time we could 
have negotiated.

something, the sovereignty of Quebec, which  will happen, I am 
absolutely certain, even if I do not know when or how.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.)</B> moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
recognize the month of June as Leukemia Awareness Month. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, the results of the vote would indicate 
that clarity is a good thing, and we also think that awareness is a 
good thing.  Awareness is as much a motherhood issue as is 
clarity.  We find it quite astounding that our colleagues across 
the way in the Progressive Conservative Party find that clarity 
could be a bad thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that there has been a proliferation in the 
use of “the week of”, “the month of” and “the year of” in 
terms of all kinds of diseases, but particularly those concerning 
cancer.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The month of April has already been proclaimed cancer awareness 
month and as all hon. members know, October is breast cancer 
month.  Having proclaimed April as cancer month has benefited all 
cancer sites.  June is already the month for ALS, thyroid and 
spina bifida. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we think the competition among diseases has been 
uncomfortable when it comes to AIDS versus breast cancer versus 
prostate cancer, the politicizing of those diseases in terms of 
fundraising has been problematic sometimes.  In times of 
awareness, more is better.  We need to do whatever we can to 
raise the awareness of Canadians of these diseases in three ways: 
that of patient and caregiver, that of advocate and that of 
citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The organizations that deal with health issues find that 
focusing all their efforts on one month of the year works for 
them.  We therefore support the Leukemia Research Fund of 
Canada's interest in having June proclaimed leukemia awareness 
month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is interesting when we talk about awareness of leukemia 
that usually we are talking about an understanding of the 
disease, which is obviously a good thing.  We are trying to 
develop an understanding of things that reflect early detection. 
For leukemia it is things such as fatigue and bruising. We are 
obviously trying to raise the awareness of the public for dollars 
for research and support which is also an extremely good thing. 
With this disease more than any other, it is also imperative that 
Canadians come to understand the importance and effectiveness of 
becoming a bone marrow transplant donor so that we can move to 
the next step in terms of the success that already exists in 
leukemia treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1974 I graduated from the University of Toronto medical 
school.  Back then leukemia was a virtual death sentence.  Since 
then treatments have evolved, such as chemotherapy and bone 
marrow transplantation.  At the 25th anniversary of our 
graduation from medical school last June, my classmate, Dr. Mark 
Minden, made a presentation.  He is now the chair of the Leukemia 
Research Foundation's scientific review panel and one of the most 
pre-eminent researchers in leukemia and bone marrow 
transplantation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His presentation was astonishing to those of us who may not have 
focused on just how far we have come in the last 25 years. The 
motto of the Leukemia Research Fund of Canada is “We are getting 
closer every day”.  It was impressively underlined by Dr. Minden 
as to how close we really are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately well over 3,000 Canadians will be diagnosed with 
leukemia this year and over 2,000 will die.  It is important that 
Canadians understand that the cure rate is 70% in children and 
that 50% of adults affected reach disease remission lasting one 
to five years or more. Leukemia is the only form of human cancer 
where such advances have been realized. Leukemia research really 
does save lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an overview, we should note the fact that leukemia is a 
disease of the white blood cells.  Indeed it comes from two Greek 
words meaning white and blood.  It is a cancer of the blood cells 
or of the blood-forming tissues of the body, the bone marrow, the 
spleen and the lymph nodes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leukemia affects individuals of all ages, of either sex and of 
every background.  It is not contagious nor hereditary, but the 
more that we understand about the genetic disorders, the better. 
There is now a Philadelphia chromosome that is implicated with 
one of the chronic leukemias.  We know it is more common with 
things like Down's syndrome, which is a genetic condition. 
We know that exposure to certain chemicals and radiation may 
increase susceptibility.  This means that not only can we 
understand where it comes from genetically but maybe we could 
find out how it could be prevented by understanding the chemistry 
and radiation problems.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chemotherapy, radiation and bone marrow transplants are working, 
but leukemia continues to cause the death of more children than 
any other disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to highlight one of the most common leukemias in 
children, acute lymphoblastic leukemia or ALL. It represents more 
than three-quarters of leukemias in young people. It develops in 
the immature lymphoblasts or young lymphocytes. It seems to be 
caused by immunological factors. In this millennium immunology is 
probably the area which needs the most work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is evidence of a high risk for this disorder in people 
with immunodeficiency disorders.  Apparent clusters of ALL are 
age specific at two or three years of age. Differences in this 
sub-type by age suggest that we still do not even know whether 
this is a disorder in the initial development of the immune 
system or whether it is an unusual immune response to infectious 
agents. There is no question that if we came to understand this 
better, we would be able to treat lots of conditions caused by 
abnormal immune systems much better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These young people usually need chemotherapy for at least two to 
three years.  It is a treatment intended to achieve a remission 
by eliminating all leukemia cells.  But as we know, the drugs 
that are used to kill leukemia cells also kill healthy cells.  It 
means that cells are killed in the hair, the skin, and the 
linings of the stomach and the intestine. At times this 
successful drug therapy is devastating even though the disease is 
cured.  The side effects to the child are really difficult.  It 
is sometimes necessary to receive radiation therapy to the brain 
and the spinal cord and the children are extraordinarily 
uncomfortable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before 1970 few children or teenagers with leukemia were cured. 
Survival improved when treatments changed from single to many 
agent chemotherapy.  But when leukemia cells are still present 
around the brain and the spine, they are not able to be reached 
by chemotherapy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This treatment has dramatically increased the cure rate of 
children and 95% of young people with ALL are now reaching 
remission after their first month of chemotherapy.  In Canada an 
estimated three-quarters of all young people diagnosed with ALL 
between 1985 and 1988 were alive five years and most were 
considered cured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 30% of these kids experience a relapse or a return of the 
disease.  Then the help of Canadians is needed in terms of bone 
marrow transplantation.  This has been shown to improve survival 
and is offered to many children with ALL in their second or 
subsequent relapses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need Canadians to sign up as bone marrow donors.  Because we 
need to match donors on all six of the immunological markers, 
siblings have a one in four chance of being a perfect match. If 
they do not match, the sometimes dying patients must turn quickly 
to other blood relations, bone marrow registries and pleas 
through the media.  In about 40% of cases these searches fail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scientists have discovered a new method to transplant bone 
marrow from a mismatched donor, meaning almost anybody can have 
the potentially life-saving procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been almost five years since our family's best friend, 
Phillip Borsos, died of leukemia.  Phillip had had Hodgkin's 
disease and his leukemia was caused by the treatment he received 
for the Hodgkin's, an unfortunate and rare side effect but one 
nonetheless that happened. 
His wife Barret, and his two sons Angus and Silas whom I had the 
privilege of delivering, are now hoping that we in Canada will 
not take away other fathers when we are so close to the cure.

amazing documentaries: <I>Cooperage</I>; <I>Spartree</I>, and 
received an Oscar nomination for his documentary <I>Nails</I>.  He 
then went on to direct <I>The Grey Fox</I> and <I>Mean Season</I>, 
<I>One Magic Christmas</I>, <I>Bethune</I> and <I>Yellow Dog</I> and 
then he died at 40 years of age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already the Leukemia Research Foundation has made huge progress 
and it is continuing the ongoing struggle to develop greater 
awareness.  Last June during leukemia awareness month Leukemia 
Research Fund of Canada flags were flying over the city halls in 
major cities across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking for the month to be designated by the House which 
would make it even more important.  More awareness would be 
raised.  The purpose of the awareness strategy is to spread the 
message that leukemia must be eradicated and that the Leukemia 
Research Fund of Canada exists for that purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extraordinarily important that we have good messages like 
the national campaign entitled “We are getting closer every 
day”.  We have a vehicle with which to inspire Canadians to do 
all of those things, to understand the gravity and how prevalent 
leukemia is, to understand that donating to leukemia research is 
extraordinarily important, and to sign up as a bone marrow donor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada health care is so important to people.  Canadians are 
always reassured in the three roles they can play, that of 
patient and caregiver, that of advocate for the diseases, and 
that of citizen. For us to designate the month of June as 
leukemia awareness month would go a long way to that end. I hope 
there is support for this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
honoured to have the privilege of standing again in our House of 
Commons to talk about an issue which is very important to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all I commend the hon. member who has brought this 
motion forward.  I have a great deal of respect and interest in 
people who pursue research into finding the cure for many 
different diseases, so I am on the right wavelength in terms of 
supporting the intent of such a motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One needs to ask how one can best promote both the awareness of 
any particular disease or situation, and how one can best foster 
an environment both economically and academically to search for 
cures for these various diseases. This one focuses on one 
particular disease, blood cancer or leukemia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was asked to represent our party in this debate tonight.  I 
stopped to think of how many people I know who have had leukemia. 
I may be wrong but I thought of four.  I have been wracking my 
brain trying to think of whether or not there are more.  In all 
instances, as the hon. member stated, when the news is first 
given, it is like a death sentence.  Several people in our own 
family have had cancer: both my wife and her father and several 
others. 
It is devastating because it is a disease for which at this stage 
there is no known cause.  Hence there is not a cure that has any 
degree of certainty, although they have been doing research and 
great strides have been made.  It is very encouraging to realize 
that now some 70% of children who are diagnosed with leukemia 
actually will be survivors.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have thought of two people who as young adults were diagnosed 
with leukemia and who are still living.  Two have gone into 
remission of the four I was able to think of.  One is a person in 
my community who has a wife and two young children.  Frankly when 
he got the word that he had leukemia it blew this young family 
away.  He went for treatment and I believe with his extraordinary 
faith in God for his divine healing he has been in remission now 
for a number of years. I saw him not long ago and I was very 
pleased with his appearance.  I do not know if it is possible but 
he even looked healthier than I do.  He is a little less rotund 
but is very healthy.  We are grateful for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were two young fellows on my list both of whom were 
diagnosed in their late teens and neither of whom survived. Both 
young men were very close to us.  They were friends of ours. They 
were contemporaries of our children. They did not make it.  They 
were diagnosed, went through the treatment regimen with a lot of 
agony and suffering and eventually did not make it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No doubt this is a disease which requires urgent attention.  As 
a government we must promote research and development in these 
medical areas.  We need to concentrate on pockets of research in 
the country so that people who are of like mind can share their 
ideas and promote their research.  I would like to see that 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to calling a month of awareness, I am neither here 
nor there on it.  The member is proposing that June be declared 
leukemia awareness month. April already is cancer awareness 
month.  We are very aware of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I go to jail every April for the annual jail and bail 
fundraising that the Cancer Society does in our area.   I have 
had the misfortune the last couple of times of having the Liberal 
candidate whom I defeated be the judge when I was arrested. When 
they bring me in he is not very kind to me.  He always sets the 
bail really high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last April when they took me in, they arrested me and put 
handcuffs on me.  As I said, I am rather rotund and the handcuffs 
actually dug into my skin and pushed right against the bone.  I 
stood in front of the judge and said, “This is prisoner abuse”. 
He said,  “That will be $500 for speaking disrespectfully of 
our police force”.  I said, “That's not fair”.  He said, 
“Five hundred dollars for talking back to the judge” and then 
he put me into the jail. I said, “This is no real jail.  If it 
was a real jail there would be a colour TV”.  He said, “Another 
500 bucks”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had to raise $1,500 for bail to get out of jail which of 
course my friends helped me to do and I was able to get out of 
jail.  All of these different activities not only raise awareness 
of the disease but they also raise money in order to promote 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an inclination to say that leukemia awareness month 
should be tied in with the general cancer awareness in April. 
That would be my preference.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would have no objection to setting aside a separate 
month even though we have only 12 months and, as has been 
mentioned, every month is an awareness month for more than one 
cause at this stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message I would like to leave is one that has more to do 
with government involvement than with declaring a month a 
particular month.  We all have to do as much as we can to promote 
research and development, to educate particularly our young 
people, and to provide a climate for them that promotes research. 
Perhaps I should not say this in the context of this debate but I 
cannot stay away from it.  We need to reduce taxes so that our 
research scientists and our young people can find greater 
motivation to stay here and work together to find cures for 
diseases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leukemia is an interesting disease because considerable progress 
has been made in this area.  Perhaps the research in leukemia 
will eventually be the key that unlocks the door to wider 
research and gives us more clues on how to attack cancer 
generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the member for bringing forward the motion.  Even 
having this one hour of debate in the House today helps to 
increase the awareness of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two kinds of people in our country.  Those who have 
had experience with cancer, perhaps leukemia, are very aware of 
the disease and the need for research.  There are others who fall 
into the category of “it will not happen to me or to my 
family”.  Those are the ones we should target.  Those are the 
ones all of us should help to make more aware.  We should appeal 
to them to work together as Canadians.  Whether it be through our 
tax system or voluntary charitable donations, let us all work 
together to find a cure.

sensitivity she has displayed toward the fight against 
leukemia. We will indeed support her motion, while I realize it 
is not a votable item. The hon. member has suggested that there 
are three approaches to overcoming leukemia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She reminded us that, at the time when she was a medical student 
in 1974—I was barely a teenager then, as you can imagine—for all 
intents and purposes, leukemia was a terminal disease with very 
little hope of remission and with very few drugs available of 
course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe I am correct in saying today that, while there is 
still no satisfactory treatment and today still people—again too 
often children and young people—die from leukemia, there are a 
number of drugs available and treatment is possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the hon. member's motion, which is primarily 
designed to raise awareness, is also a call for research and for 
partnership between public funding agencies and the 
pharmaceutical industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to tell her that we on this side believe that her 
call should be heard. I think that research is important and can 
make a difference. When we talk about the pharmaceutical 
industry, there are two main industrial clusters, so to speak. 
There is the generic drug industry, which is based mainly in 
Ontario, in the Toronto and Mississauga area, and the brand name 
drug industry, based in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must bear in mind that the fight against leukemia or cancer 
in general cannot be won without co-ordinating the research 
effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met recently with representatives of the association formerly 
known as PMAC, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of 
Canada, whose name has been changed to Rx & D. Under this new 
designation is a long-established group of about forty companies 
essentially involved in producing brand name drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The brand name drug industry told us that a research cycle of 
more than 10 years may have elapsed between the time a molecule 
is isolated for research and the time a drug becomes available 
on the consumer market. Between the time a molecule is isolated 
for research and the time the drug becomes commercially 
available, an investment of nearly $500 million is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about huge investments, so much so that the 
legislator—I think we have to render unto Caesar what is Caesar's 
and unto Ménard what is Ménard's—Patent protection was initiated 
under the Progressive Conservative government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I am not mistaken, it was introduced in 1991 or 1992, under 
Bill C-22. The legislator found it necessary at the time to 
provide some form of protection and incentive to research, 
because to this day—and let us never forget it—it is our best and 
most legitimate hope to overcome disease, particularly 
debilitating diseases like leukemia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research has to remain our greatest hope. It is important to 
recall that, with the motion tabled by our colleague, a member 
from Ontario and a physician by trade, we as parliamentarians 
must implement the most effective, forward-looking and discerning 
tools to make research possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just reviewed actions taken under the Mulroney 
government, which my seatmate, the hon. member for Chicoutimi, 
was part of in the good as well as the bad times. Of course, he 
is convinced that the good times were more important than the 
more difficult ones, which is totally his right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in favour of this motion. We agree that awareness is 
required. This brings me to the third aspect raised by our 
colleague, namely, support for caregivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When someone in our family has an illness, this is not an 
isolated situation which has no effect on our ability to cope. 
Awareness means understanding what the illness is, understanding 
what medications are available, understanding that prophylaxis 
is available, but it also means adopting a certain behaviour 
when we know people with leukemia.

colleague from the Reform Party who alluded with great humour to 
his stoutness—which, I must tell him, makes him very likeable and 
very endearing to us—referred to the importance of showing 
solidarity as caregivers. Awareness also means providing 
information on what type of behaviour to adopt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank our colleague for her motion. We are showing solidarity. 
If the motion had been deemed votable, we would have voted for 
it as a group, as we must do in some circumstances. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to support the motion to recognize the month of June as leukemia 
awareness month as this would increase our awareness of the 
disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things we need to be aware of is that 2,000 people 
will die from this disease.  We also need to know what causes the 
disease and why it affects some people but not others.  What are 
the implications concerning our environment?  What are the 
environmental factors that may or may not play a part in this 
disease?  What are the genetic factors? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is so much to know but so little that people in general do 
know about this disease because of their busy lives.  They only 
find out about it if someone they know and love is suffering from 
the disease, but they do not know enough to be of any help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be aware of what we can do as a community and what we 
can provide in terms of medicare and home care.  We need good 
hospitals and good research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole cycle of research that was just described may take a 
long time.  If we want to decrease the number of deaths from this 
disease we must always be proactive and one step ahead.  We want 
to prevent those 2,000 deaths as a country, but more importantly, 
the deaths that each family may have to face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of cancer alone induces fear in people.  The more 
awareness we can bring to them, the more we can help our 
communities.  Most people think of cancer as a deadly disease. 
Hopefully, as we move further along in our research, there will 
be far fewer deaths and far fewer children being taken away from 
their families and out of our lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that this disease affects so many children and is the 
leading cause of death in children is enough for us to single it 
out as being a disease for which people need to develop an 
awareness.  As a mother of four children and having seen families 
lose their children, it is our deepest fear that our children 
will die ahead us.  I do not know how a family would cope with 
that.  The loss of a child to a family and to a community makes 
us want to take the extra effort to become more aware of this 
disease and to bring the issue forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year a man in our community died.  A lot of treatment 
cannot be done in the north so people have to fly out, which is 
quite a difficult endeavour in itself.  It means the waiting 
period can be far longer for people in the north than for people 
who are in a community where treatment can be easily accessed. 
The man who died had left the Yukon to undergo a bone marrow 
transplant.  Unfortunately, it was too late for Ben Sheardown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say a few words about Ben because he was an integral part 
of our community.  He was a a coach, an athlete, a teacher, a 
counsellor, a husband and a father.  To every person he came into 
contact with, he was far more than that.  Anyone who met him 
could not help but be inspired by his kindness, his passion and 
his ferocious nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who had the chance to meet him in the last month of his 
life knew immediately how privileged they were.  He went through 
incredible suffering with tremendous grace and almost transcended 
the daily world that we live in.  I think he attained a different 
spiritual level, one which we all would like to bring to our 
lives.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worst part is that he left us too soon.  He still had so 
much of himself to give to his children, his wife and his 
community. He was someone I had known throughout my whole life as 
a teacher, a neighbour and a friend.  He is still deeply missed. 
If we could have prevented his death or given him even a few more 
years of life we would have all benefited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last month I had to say goodbye to a friend who died of 
leukemia.  She did not even have a chance for a bone marrow 
transplant.  Her name was Effie Croft and she had started a small 
community newspaper in Faro.  She found out quite late that she 
had the disease because she would never have imagined herself 
sick no matter how tired she was.  She was a counsellor, but more 
than anything she brought an incredible joy to the people around 
her.  Even through the time of her whole town's decamping and 
moving away when the mine closed she was a real source of energy 
and great love to her town. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people found out how sick Ben was with leukemia and that 
they could possibly donate bone marrow, there was a huge 
outpouring of people wanting to do that.  As was described by the 
member of parliament who is also a doctor, it is a long process 
and it is not easy to find a match.  People were not aware that 
if they had made themselves available to a donor bank beforehand 
they could have helped.  It could have been easily accessible to 
Ben and anyone else who might need a bone marrow transplant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing about organ donations, bone marrow 
donations or donations of whatever piece of our bodies we are 
able to donate.  People need to know that in the case of donating 
bone marrow we do not have to die to do it.  There is a lot of 
fear for people trying to come to grips with what it means to be 
a donor, with what it means to be able to help each other. Canada 
does not have a good record for doing that, but I know people 
would do it if they were only aware of how to do it.  Then they 
would be more than generous in any way they could to help their 
fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes when we talk about diseases we talk about them in 
terms of numbers and names instead of in terms of individuals, 
children, friends, parents, sisters and the other people they 
affect.  If we appeal to the better instincts of our friends and 
neighbours in our communities I know they would respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This idea deserves action.  We can do no wrong by tightening the 
awareness of this terrible disease.  If we help just one family 
it would be worth it, but I think this awareness will help our 
whole country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to enter the debate on what is a great motion moved 
by the member for St. Paul's who is a physician and is probably 
very aware of this troublesome disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Approximately 3,300 people will be diagnosed this year with 
leukemia and 2,100 will die from it.  This is a sad reality but 
it certainly hits home in a lot of families in Canada.  Many 
families are probably saying goodbye to loved ones who are 
leaving us because of this disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must continue working together in partnership to develop 
cures for diseases such as this one.  It is not the only one. 
Before my life in politics I was very involved in the community. 
I started the Alzheimer's society in my region, another disease 
that is hitting a lot of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leukemia also hits young people as well.  The cure rate for 
young people today is 65% but 35% do not make it.  This is very 
difficult especially for parents.  It is important to make sure 
Canadians are aware of what is going on here and to make sure 
that everything possible is being done.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore important to raise the awareness of this 
disease, which takes lives every single day across Canada, from 
coast to coast. Indeed, 35% of children with leukemia will not 
make it. They will die. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parents, it is very hard to see these sick children on 
television or when visiting a hospital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the member for St. Paul's for taking the 
initiative of raising this very important issue in the House. 
I would also like to thank all the volunteers who work day and 
night from coast to coast and who, as such, are not paid of 
course. In my riding, in the Campbellton area, I went to visit a 
prison with them to help raise money for cancer. These people 
are always there, without fail. A knock on the door and they are 
ready to help fight this disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly before Christmas, our family was stricken, not by 
cancer, but by heart disease. My father died in October 1999; it 
has been extremely hard on all of us. But I am thinking about a 
family in the Dalhousie area, in Restigouche, the Perry family, 
whose 18 year old son has leukemia. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no warning.  It can hit very quickly.  That was exactly 
what happened to the Perry family, a young family in Dalhousie, 
New Brunswick.  One of the children was diagnosed with leukemia 
just before Christmas.  He is 18 years old and is receiving 
treatment as we speak.  If he is listening today I want to tell 
him, on behalf of the House, not to lose faith.  There is always 
hope.  Sixty-five per cent of people make it through.  We are all 
thinking of him and his family.  Hopefully, he will get through 
as well. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I would like to thank the hon. member for St. Paul's 
and all the volunteers. We are still asking the government for 
its partnership and effort to develop the drugs we need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, health ministers and premiers met in Quebec City and 
asked for more money for health care. We need money for 
development, but we also need money to care for the sick. We 
really need to put the emphasis on health. I think this is a 
consensus throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ball is in the government's court. We need to put pressure 
on the finance minister and the Prime Minister to put more money 
in health care, because we know health is a priority in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate once more the member opposite. We will gladly 
support this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Fontana (London North Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to applaud the member, the good doctor from St. Paul's.  I 
rise today to add my support to a very worthwhile motion to 
declare the month of June as leukemia awareness month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the son of a leukemia survivor, I know how important this 
motion is.  It really touches my heart.  My mother, thank God, 
has been in remission for six years.  Not only did it take the 
good efforts of the medical fraternity and the research which has 
been done so far on leukemia, but also the caregivers and the 
families, which provided the strength and the love that allowed 
my mother to survive.  The quality of life may not be perfect, 
but it is a very good life and one that we would hope for every 
person who has been stricken with leukemia.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leukemia affects all ages, both sexes and every background. 
Every 10 minutes another child or adult dies from leukemia or a 
related cancer.  In 1999, as we have already heard, 3,000 
Canadians were diagnosed with leukemia and 2,100 died of this 
devastating disease.  Leukemia is the number one killer of 
children. Leukemia is a destroyer of families and as we have 
heard a devastator of dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite these staggering odds, as the doctor, the member for St. 
Paul's, and others have said, we are winning important battles in 
the fight to save lives.  With the best treatment 73% of our 
children with childhood leukemia will now survive.  That is a 
great step forward.  The overall survival rates have doubled in 
the last 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are important victories with human faces.  Yet we must 
continue to work to win the war.  Yes, we all agree that medical 
research is an important component.  We must provide Canada's 
researchers with the support and the financial resources they 
need, as well as the opportunity to be able to research in Canada 
and stop this terrible disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must raise public awareness.  This is what June is all about. 
It is to make it possible for people to become aware of those 
around them who have leukemia and to make it possible for the 
volunteer sector to raise the moneys along with governments to be 
able to continue their fine work on research.  It is also an 
opportunity to thank those men and women in the hospitals and in 
the homes who provide the love, nurturing and caring that are 
important parts of the well-being of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While medicine is very important, caring and compassion are also 
important.  I must give accolades to those people, for example, 
Dr. Barr at University Hospital in London, Ontario, and those men 
and women who looked after my mother and made it possible for her 
to continue, as so many hundreds and thousands of people work 
very hard to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is essential so that the public understands and 
knows our commitment as a parliament to the eradication of 
leukemia and that we will continue to work with all our partners 
in our communities to ensure that we can stop this disease and 
make it possible for all those people to dream the possible dream 
and not to have to suffer the affliction of leukemia.

Month. I congratulate her as well as all the other members from 
the various parties who were involved in this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All over Canada, the public supports the campaign that was 
launched to find ways of preventing or treating leukemia, 
lymphoma, myeloma, Hodgkin's disease and other blood diseases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leukemia affects people of all ages, of both sexes and from all 
backgrounds. 
It was described at length by several of my colleagues who have 
spoken on this issue during the last hour. I would add one fact: 
in Canada, every ten minutes, a child or an adult dies from 
leukemia or a related form of cancer. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their homes and communities all across the country thousands 
of Canadians are living with leukemia and many Canadians are 
working to provide support and comfort to those affected by these 
forms of cancer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing the month of June as leukemia awareness month will 
help to acknowledge the important contributions of families, 
health professionals, researchers, educators and the thousands of 
other Canadians whose every day efforts help to reduce the 
incidence and impact of this disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Closely related to program delivery is public information and 
education.  Voluntary groups have the unique ability to reach 
deep into society to ensure that the public as a whole knows 
about particular services that might benefit them.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lives are saved and treatments are improved while researchers 
are working to find a permanent cure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The volunteer sector plays a crucial role in the pursuit of 
these objectives for Canadians and in the efforts to maintain a 
high quality of life. The volunteer sector has become the third 
pillar of Canadian society, with the public sector and the 
private sector, helping to make Canada a country that is more 
humanitarian, more prosperous and more attentive to the needs of 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Volunteers can help in many ways each year, and the volunteers 
with the Leukemia Research Fund of Canada collect over $3 million 
for research, that saves lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, 70% of children affected are cured, and over 50% of 
adults with the disease go into remission for five years or more, 
thanks to all these efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other volunteers help people with leukemia by giving them 
psychological support or temporarily relieving those caring for 
them.  Canadians do their part, but this deadly and challenging 
disease continues to take lives, and every life lost is a 
tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we must all support research for a cure and support 
this motion, which calls on the government to make June 
Leukemia Awareness Month. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

to work in partnership to address this important need.  Canadians 
support the investment that the federal government has made in 
research, education and funding of the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have done much but more could be done.  Through the creation 
and funding of Canadian institutes on health research, through 
promotion and prevention campaigns, and through investment in the 
Canadian health and social transfer we will all be providing much 
needed assistance to Canadians living with and supporting those 
with leukemia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing the month of June as leukemia awareness month will 
also recognize the work of the Leukemia Research Fund of Canada, 
established in 1955 as a non-profit organization. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing the month of June as Leukemia Awareness Month will 
give us an opportunity to remember all those who fell victim to 
leukemia and other forms of blood cancer, and to celebrate the 
survival of an increasingly larger number of patients.

of bone marrow transplants and of the importance of providing
