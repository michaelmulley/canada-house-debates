	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate the Niagara Federations of Agriculture on their award 
winning educational video entitled ``Where Does it All Come 
From?'' This 13-minute children's video was recently honoured at 
the TVO Telefest awards gala in Toronto where it was awarded first 
prize in the instructional category.
<P>
	The video offers children a fascinating insight into where our 
food comes from. The film represents a true picture of agriculture 
in the nineties and deals with the dairy, fruit and sheep industries.
<P>
	The video was produced in partnership with the Niagara College 
television arts program and many talented Niagara peninsula 
residents contributed to its outstanding success. Lucy Decandido, a 
Niagara College graduate, filmed and edited the piece as her 
third-year project. The narration was provided by 12-year-old 
Keely Carter of College Street Public School in Smithville.
<P>
	As one participant said: ``Agriculture has a very positive story to 
tell and it is up to the agricultural community to tell it''.
<P>
	I compliment the Niagara Federations of Agriculture on their 
initiative to sponsor a copy of the video and teacher's kit for every 
elementary school in Niagara.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
November is osteoporosis awareness month. This disease, which 
makes bones more fragile and fracture-prone, affects more than 1.5 
million people, primarily women, one woman in four and one man 
in eight in Quebec and in Canada.
<P>
	This silent and stealthy disease has a high social cost. More than 
a billion dollars are spent annually on hospitalization, ambulance 
services and drugs to treat osteoporosis-related injuries. The total 
over 25 years will be in excess of $32 billion.
<P>
	The physical and emotional suffering and the costs related to 
osteoporosis could be reduced, however, simply through 
prevention, particularly information, consciousness-raising and a 
healthy calcium-rich diet.
<P>
	Osteoporosis is surely a good example of the old adage: ``an 
ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure''.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOFTWOODLUMBER">SOFTWOOD LUMBER</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a few 
days ago some softwood lumber mills across Canada found out that 
the government is putting them out of business. They were 
expecting to have their exports to the United States cut by 10 per 
cent. They were not expecting to have to close their doors 
altogether.
<P>
	The lumber deal the government signed with the United States is 
a death warrant for some small mills in this country. The industry 
would have been better off with the American countervailing duty 
at the border. The mills would have survived and then we would be 
well on our way to a settlement with the World Trade Organization, 
a solution that we recommended to the government seven months 
ago.
<P>
	This problem has developed because the Liberal government has 
been afraid to take on the United States. It has buckled to American 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6180"> 6180 </A></B>

pressure. Unfortunately, the price will be paid by employees and 
owners of small mills across Canada.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
met recently with representatives of the SDF of Cameroun, a sister 
party of the NDP in the Socialist International, and from them I 
learned that many abuses are currently taking place without an 
appropriate international response, considering that the democratic 
institutions now in operation in the Cameroun are a result of 
conditions set by the IMF.
<P>
	For example, only a small percentage of the eligible electorate is 
registered and in the last election there were blatant episodes of 
vote rigging, ballot tampering and the overturning of results that 
were not favourable to the governing party.
<P>
	One wishes that the IMF enforced its democratic and political 
requirements as strongly as it does its structural adjustment and 
economic requirements.
<P>
	I call on the Canadian government to use its membership in the 
many international forums of which it is a member to engage 
constructively with the Cameroun to improve its democratic 
institutions. Strengthened democratic structures will be well worth 
the investment if they can prevent the kind of bloodshed and civil 
strife we are seeing in parts of central Africa today.

	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of my four-year-old daughter, her friends and, 
indeed, all of the children of Winnipeg who are outraged by the 
unwarranted attack by the member for Regina-Qu'Appelle on 
Winnie the Pooh. The member charges that by profiling Winnie the 
Pooh on our stamps we are in danger of losing our identity as a 
nation.
<P>
	Winnie the Pooh was born in White River, Ontario. He is named 
after the great city of Winnipeg. His origins have been celebrated 
for decades in Canada and there are statues to him in three 
Canadian cities.
<P>
	Like a great many other Canadians, our Winnie has made it big 
on the international stage. He won an Oscar and has become one of 
the most popular children's entertainers in the world.
<P>
	Contrary to the statement by the member that we are losing our 
identity, we are in fact enhancing it. We are celebrating a Canadian 
who brings joy to the hearts of children around the world.

<P>
	There have been too many deaths. Our youth, our best and 
brightest hopes for the future, are killing themselves at shocking

fought for us in the interests of democracy and freedom.
<P>
<B>(1405 )</B>
<P>
	We will remember our family, our friends, our neighbours, those 
in zones of conflict in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. 
They met the enemy on the high seas, in the air and on the ground, 
worked in the factories, volunteered in their communities and gave 
the best of themselves. Many made the ultimate sacrifice so that we 
may live in peace.
<P>
	Let us not forget the contribution of even one Canadian in the 
monumental struggle against hatred, racism, tyranny. All deserve 
our thanks and recognition.
<P>
	Veterans of the RAF Ferry Command, no less than veterans of 
the army, navy, air force or merchant marine, deserve recognition 
for the risks they took, sacrifices they made and the lives they lost

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
weekend, I took part in the annual assembly of the Canadian 
Hispanic Congress in Vancouver.
<P>
	The hispanic community is made up of some 300,000 men and 
women who were born in Latin America or Spain. They came here 
to escape persecution, dictatorship or civil war, or merely in search 
of a better life.
<P>
	Canadians and Quebecers of hispanic origin, of which I am one, 
constitute a relatively new, dynamic and growing community, with 
an important contribution to make to their host society. Quebec has 
welcomed some 80,000 Latin Americans with warmth and 
generosity. They have integrated well with this society, with which 
they have characteristics in common, due to their shared latin 
heritage.
<P>
	As the sole member of this House of hispanic origin, I wish to 
greet the members of this ethno-cultural community, the executive 
of the Canadian Hispanic Congress, and particularly its president, 
Bernardo Berdichewsky.

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberals have been patting themselves on the back lately, claiming 
that they have kept most of their red book promises.
<P>
	The facts are that of the 198 promises made in the red book, only 
two had a major impact on the voters and, indeed, were major 
reasons for voters giving their trust. The failure to deliver on jobs, 
jobs, jobs as well as scrap, abolish and kill the GST are the two 
broken promises Canadians will remember in the next federal 
election.
<P>
	On the GST, the Liberals had no real plan to replace the $15 
billion in revenue so they could scrap it. They just made a hollow 
promise to get elected. We are still paying the GST.
<P>
	On job creation, the Liberals had no plan to help the private 
sector create jobs. There are as many people unemployed now as 
when they made their hollow jobs promise to get elected: 4.1 
million unemployed Canadians is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	The red book was a fairy tale that should have begun ``Once 
upon a time''. There will be a happy ending, however, with the 
defeat of those who make broken promises and the election of a 
party that gives a guarantee with its promises.

Wilfrid Laurier was elected Prime Minister of Canada in June. A 
Liberal, he is filled with enthusiasm and determination. That was 
100 years ago, in 1896.
<P>
	He used to say how proud he was to be French-Canadian. And it 
is this pride I found in Vancouver when I met with British 
Columbia's francophone community in mid-October.
<P>
	The 70,000 francophones living in B.C. need our help. We must 
help them get the access they need to French-language radio and 
television programming.
<P>
	It is this pride to be French-Canadian they are demanding. I join 
with my Liberal friends, my Bloc colleagues, I am sure, and my 
friend, the hon. member for Beauce, in calling on Heritage Canada 
to set aside a special budget for B.C.-oriented programming.

French-Canadians outside Quebec have a strong voice in this

	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is Veterans Week, from November 3 to 11. It is a fitting time to 
pay tribute to one of Canada's veterans, who is also one of my 
constituents, Smokey Smith.
<P>
	Born in New Westminister, B.C. and enlisting in the Seaforth 
Highlanders Regiment in March of 1940, Smokey Smith is one of 
only two living Canadians who have received Canada's and the 
Commonwealth's highest decoration for bravery in action, the 
Victoria Cross.
<P>
	Fifty-two years ago Private Smith's regiment headed an attack 
across the Savio River in Italy. It is here Private Smith earned his 
Victoria Cross, almost single-handedly turning back an enemy 
counter attack. As a result, his battalion was able to consolidate a 
bridgehead, vital to the success of the overall Canadian military 
operations in the region.
<P>
<B>(1410 )</B>
<P>
	This House and its members salute Smokey Smith today. We 
cherish the uncommon valour and the personal commitment and 
sacrifice of Private Smith and of all our veterans who served 
Canada in two world wars and also in the United Nations military 
operations and peacekeeping missions around the world.

<P>
	We should see these as real people, real individuals, not political 
issues and not a political game. I encourage all members to speak

issues that were left on the backburner, especially those with 
Canada, on a more solid and conciliatory basis.
<P>
	Let us not forget that several trade disputes remain unsettled. 
This includes the Helms-Burton law, whose outright withdrawal we 
are calling for, as well as the disputes regarding the tariffs on dairy, 
egg and poultry products.
<P>
	Furthermore, we believe Canada could take advantage of its 
special relationship with its American neighbour to help revive the 
Middle East peace process and favour the rapid establishment of an 
international force that would open the eagerly awaited

as we prepare to once again officially commemorate the valiant

merchant mariners, the fourth arm of Canada's services.
<P>
	Their vital role in carrying supplies to our troops in battle was 
fundamental to allied victory.
<P>
	Terrible risks were a fact of life. They faced brutal U-boat 
attacks, surface raiders and marauding aircraft, all attempting to 
interrupt this lifeline to our troops.
<P>
	Merchant mariners faced severe conditions on board, shipwreck 
in a cruel, cold sea often covered in blazing fuel and a prisoner of 
war camp if they were able to reach land. Sixty-seven ships were 
lost and on average when a ship went down less than half the crew 
survived.
<P>
	Four hundred died during the great war and of the 12,000 
merchant mariners who risked their lives to preserve cherished 
freedoms in the second world war, over 1,400 died.

	For our part, we have agreed to limit at 14.7 billion board feet

<P>
	In this connection we would like to ask the Prime Minister if he

between Canada and the United States, there are no major, pressing 
problems, with the exception of Helms-Burton law.
<P>
	As for softwood lumber, we have concluded an agreement with 
them. We have agreed to impose a limit on exports. The Minister 
for International Trade has concluded an agreement, after 
consulting with the provincial governments. As far as the United 
States and we are concerned, the matter was settled by this 
agreement.
<P>
	If there are any other problems the hon. member wishes to raise, 
I will take note of them and mention them to the President when we 
meet. The softwood lumber question has already been settled, and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6184"> 6184 </A></B>
<P>
we are now  putting the requisite mechanisms in place to 
implement the agreement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the 
Prime Minister seems to be open to suggestions, I would like to 
mention that the U.S. pensions issue is disturbing many Quebecers.
<P>
	The official opposition asks the Prime Minister to raise with 
President Clinton those issues that are troubling our people and 
affect them directly.
<P>
	Furthermore, I would ask the Prime Minister this: Following the 
preliminary ruling made in the controversial eggs, milk and poultry 
question, a ruling that is to be confirmed very shortly, I would like 
to ask the Prime Minister whether he intends to make 
representations to the U.S. president before it is too late, before 
Canada is forced into the same kind of situation as in the case of 
softwood lumber, in other words, before we are forced to negotiate 
an agreement at our expense. The softwood lumber agreement is 
far from perfect and puts a heavy burden on lumber producers. The 
agreement on milk, eggs and poultry might go the same way, unless 
the Prime Minister quickly and proactively intervene with the 
President.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as far as the eggs and poultry issue is concerned, we have 
discussed this problem several times with the Americans. Our 
position is clear. We have determined that the marketing boards 
that exist in Canada have a right to exist under the agreements we 
signed with them and under the GATT agreements that were 
renegotiated a year ago.
<P>
	We believe that our position complies with the agreements we 
have with the Americans. If they want to challenge these 
agreements, legal recourse is provided under NAFTA and also 
under the GATT rules, so that we can defend our rights. Our 
positions are clear, and at this moment, these agreements between 
our two countries exist. They have been duly signed.

Speaker, my question is also for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Beyond trade-related matters, there is also a number of urgent 
issues on the international scene. Again, Canada can play a positive 
role, including through its relations with the United States.
<P>
	Following President Clinton's re-election yesterday and the 
recent Nairobi summit, will the Prime Minister propose to the 
American president to submit to the Security Council a joint 
request from Canada, the United States and France to quickly put in 
place a multinational humanitarian force to put an end to the 
terrible plight of Zairian refugees?
<P>
	We have nothing against diplomacy but, as Bernard Kouchner 
pointed out again this morning, time is of the essence and people 
are dying.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, Canada showed leadership and initiative regarding 
African regional leaders. Indeed, we are prepared to carefully 
examine the African leaders' proposals for a safe haven, a corridor 
and the presence of neutral forces. Ambassador Chrétien's special 
mission will provide us with an opportunity to immediately review 
these proposals and to determine the types of resources and 
commitments required from the international community as a

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr.

<P>
	Given that tension is rising in the Middle East, does the Prime 
Minister intend to discuss, with the American president, the urgent 
need to revive the peace process between Israel and the Palestinian 
authority, before the current crisis degenerates even more?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, beginning on Tuesday next week I will be in Cairo at the 
middle eastern major summit meeting. I hope to have direct 
discussions with the foreign minister of Israel and the 
representative of the Palestinian authority as well as other leaders 
from the Middle East.
<P>
	We will certainly make very clear our strong support for 
continuation of the peace process, our commitment to help them 
develop economically and to provide the kind of support we need 
internationally on a multilateral basis to search for the right 
solutions for peace in that area.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for months the Prime Minister has made frequent 
references to his special ethics guidelines for cabinet ministers. 
Then he says that he cannot release them because they are cabinet 
confidential. Now according to the CBC and his own ethics 
counsellor, these special ethics guidelines for cabinet ministers do 
not even exist. It seems that the Prime Minister's guidelines are 
imaginary like his homeless friends.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister clear the air and simply release his much 
touted ethics guidelines for cabinet ministers to this House?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6185"> 6185 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have seen the fresh start and it is not starting very 
well.
<P>
	In every case that comes before this House the Prime Minister 
has to judge the facts and the facts are public. I have spoken about 
the case that was mentioned which I discussed with the ethics 
counsellor.
<P>
	I have said in the House many times and I will repeat again that 
the directives written by the Prime Minister for his ministers are 
directives of the Prime Minister to the ministers for their conduct. 
The conduct of a minister is a question of public record. I take the 
responsibility if somebody questions the conduct of ministers.
<P>
	In the case of the secretary of state, I have accepted her word and 
everything is in order at this moment. I do not have anything to 
add, but had the leader been here last week he would have heard the 
same-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I would ask you to refrain from 
speaking about who is here and who is not here at whatever time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have been out talking to real Canadians, not imaginary 
ones.
<P>
	This issue really should not be that difficult. The Prime Minister 
has repeatedly told this House that he has special ethics guidelines 
for cabinet ministers. The CBC and the Prime Minister's own 
ethics counsellor say that they do not exist.
<P>
	Either it is one thing or the other. Do these special guidelines 
exist? If they do and the Prime Minister assumes responsibility for 
ethics with his ministers, will he table those guidelines in this 
House?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I repeat that I have guidelines for ministerial conduct 
which have been transmitted to the ministers. They have read them 
and they follow them.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Did they follow them?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Yes, and they follow them very 
well.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister seems to regard ethics as a private 
matter between himself and the ministers. He will not release the 
guidelines to the House and the public, and he only uses them to his 
own political advantage, like when he had to sack the former 
minister of defence.
<P>
	The ethics of elected officials are public business. For the public 
to judge whether the conduct of a cabinet minister is ethical, they 
have to know the standards against which they are being judged.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister really does believe in open government and 
a higher standard of ethics, why does he not table in this House his 
special ethics guidelines for cabinet ministers?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the conduct of the minister is public.
<P>
	We have been in government for three years. Never before has 
the ethics of a government been challenged so little by the public 
because the ministers are acting honourably in every case. I am not 
afraid to stand here with my colleagues who have shown in the last 
three years that we in this government have extremely high 
standards. That is why this government is respected by the 
Canadian public.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the last Liberal report of the Standing Committee on 
Finance contains the following phrase, and I quote: ``The 
Committee encourages the government to continue working with 
interested provinces in order to set up a Canadian securities 
commission'' But, in this morning's papers, we learned that a 
number of provinces think the project is on the way out.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Will he confirm that 
his government is dropping the project to set up a Canadian 
securities commission, knowing that it is unanimously opposed by 
economic, financial and political circles in Montreal and 
throughout Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, at 
the request of several provinces, the federal government is 
examining the possibility of setting up a Canadian securities 
commission. We are negotiating with these provinces. It is not the 
federal government's intention to impose it on anyone.
<P>
	It is certainly our intention to make it easier to put the industry in 
a position of being able to compete with the financial industry 
outside our borders.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the very least that can be said in all this is that the Minister 
of Finance is completely confused. The first project was for a 
Canadian securities commission that would replace all the 
provincial commissions.
<P>
	Second, faced with mounting opposition to the project, they 
decided it would be optional. Then there were, in theory, not ten 
securities commissions but 11. This morning, in the newspaper, the 
minister said: ``This could perhaps be cut down to two or three''. 
This is just so much stalling around. It is what comes of not looking 
after your own affairs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6186"> 6186 </A></B>
<P>
	Since nobody in Quebec wants a Canadian securities 
commission, since opposition is growing in British Columbia and 
Alberta, and since there is a viable alternative to this commission 
known as the SEDAR system, now being developed and put in 
place by provincial commissions, why is the finance minister so 
bent on pushing ahead with this project, which would be 
devastating for the economy of Montreal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the member seems a bit confused.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What has happened is that the federal government at the request 
of a number of provinces has sat down and looked at the possibility 
of creating a national securities commission. The major purpose of 
this is to ease the issuance of prospectuses, a great deal of which 
will benefit the business community in Montreal, in Quebec and in 
Vancouver and all of British Columbia.
<P>
	I find it very hard to understand that the hon. member opposite 
would say to the federal government that when the provinces want 
to rationalize their operations, make them more effective, make 
them more competitive, the federal government should not sit 
down with them and try to do that. It is very clear that the real 
purpose the member has is to not make the federation work, is to 
not make Canada competitive. That will not work out to the benefit 
of anybody, including the business community in Montreal.

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the appointment 
of cabinet ministers to their posts is the responsibility of the Prime 
Minister and my question is directed to him. He has created a bit of 
a conundrum here by saying that the code has been read by his 
ministers, which shows that it is in printed form, yet the ethics 
counsellor says that it does not exist.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	My question relates to a code that we do know exists. The 1994 
code states that ``a public office holder shall not directly or 
indirectly use or allow the use of government property of any 
kind-for anything other than officially approved activities''.
<P>
	Yesterday the President of the Treasury Board said quite clearly 
that the whited out portions on the case in question were for 
personal expenditures.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister prepared to admit at least that the secretary 
of state clearly breached that section of the code?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
can only repeat what I said yesterday.
<P>
	Under section 19 of the Access to Information Act, a 
government institution shall not disclose personal information. The 
Access to Information Act goes on to say that the definition of 
personal information stated under the Privacy Act applies. Personal 
financial transactions are included under personal information 
under the Privacy Act. Therefore, these things should not be given 
for public scrutiny because they are protected under the Privacy 
Act. It is clear and that is the end of the matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the President of 
the Treasury Board has just confirmed what we believe to be true, 
which is that all of these things which are whited out are personal. 
All we want is accountability of those personal amounts so we can 
estimate their value.
<P>
	An ordinary Canadian caught robbing a bank would not be 
allowed to simply return the money and walk away on the grounds 
that he was not committing the offence in bad faith or for personal 
financial benefit and intended to reimburse the bank at some future 
date.
<P>
	In breaching the code and chapter 2-7 of the Treasury Board 
guidelines, the junior minister committed a serious offence, one 
which would have resulted in severe discipline for any other 
member of the department.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister's talk about a high standard of ethics 
not demand that these guidelines and code be enforced?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
once again the rule is clear. Government travel cards should be 
used for official government expenses. When they are not, when 
they are used for personal expenses, then the card holder must 
reimburse all personal expenses.
<P>
	This is exactly what the secretary of state did. She has 
reimbursed all the expenditures which were made with the 
government travel card. In this case, she has followed the rules and 
has presented excuses for what she has done, but what she has done 
is considered to be under the rules.
<P>
	Once again if we were to have a beer or see a film in our hotel 
room which is on an account and we pay with a government card, 
the rules say that we must reimburse that personal expenditure. 
This is exactly what the secretary of state did. She made excuses 
for using a government travel card. She now has a personal 
expenditure travel card. That is the end of it.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, as you know, in the preambles to 
our questions I give quite a bit of latitude because I am waiting

<P>
	The members of the Merchant Marine who took part in Canada's

Veterans Affairs do not consider their concerns to be a priority. 
They are calling for the benefits available to other veterans to be 
available to them as well, without any discrimination.

veterans?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Secretary of State

full status veterans and they receive every pension and anything 
that is available to any other veteran in this country. They are 
eligible for all the benefits that any veteran in Canada is eligible 
for.

of the members of the Merchant Navy who lost their lives in the 
second world war came from Quebec. There is a reason for the 
Merchant Navy veterans to be meeting. They are excluded from a 
number of the provisions of the war-related benefits act.
<P>
	Does the minister commit to holding consultations with the 
coalition of Merchant Navy veterans before tabling his bill to 
modify the provisions currently in effect?

<P>
	On October 31, following the recent Canada-U.S. agreement on 
softwood lumber, lumber companies in Quebec and Canada 
received a letter from the Canadian government indicating their 
market quotas.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade,

first of all we responded in this agreement with the United States at 
the request of the industry. The industry was, of course, in the 
setting of the quotas consulted right throughout the way. It 
established criteria, forwarded its suggestions to us and by and 
large that is what we followed.
<P>
	By and large the setting of the quota is based on past experience. 
Each of the companies was allowed to pick its best 12 month period 
with a two and a half year timeframe, and that is the information 
they provided for us and that was the basis for our calculating what 
they should be getting in the way of quota.
<P>
	I should point out that quota means free quota because they can 
still export as much as they want but it means that there are fees 
that have to be paid over and above that quota.
<P>
	There are some companies, as the hon. member has pointed out 
in his question, that have exceeded their allocation. A lot of them 
have done this of course in full knowledge about what their past 
experience has been but have elected to rush the border and sell all 
in the early phases of this program, which is unfortunate if they are

an acceptance by the people that those are the facts until they can 
prove the contrary.
<P>
	The secretary of state rose and explained her case in front of the 
nation, and they carry on the innuendoes with no facts.
<P>
	He should do his homework, find the facts and come back, not 
operate on innuendoes. This is not the dignity in this House that we 
used to have in the old days.

	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	Since Canadian airlines' restructuring plan was announced last 
Friday, divisions have appeared within the Canadian government. 
On the one hand, the Minister of Industry was willing to consider a 
request for financial assistance from Canadian; on the other hand, 
the Minister of Transport reiterated yesterday that his government 
would not invest another penny in Canadian.
<P>
	Since the federal government has already done more than its 
share for Canadian, notably by guaranteeing a $120 million loan, 
buying back three Airbus planes for $150 million and awarding it 
the lucrative Asian market, can the Minister guarantee us today he 
has no intention of injecting more tax dollars into a company that 
has lost over $1.3 billion in the past eight years?
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member talks about differences of opinion between 
ministers and getting quotes by two ministers who said exactly the 
same thing.
<P>
	I would point out to the member that the company we are talking 
about, Canadian airlines, has a major problem of restructuring 
which it faces and this will require substantial changes to its 
operations. It is a private company and therefore must go out and, 
like other  private companies, attempt to deal with its problems on 
its own.
<P>
	From the government's point of view, we wish to encourage 
competition. Many of the steps we have taken since becoming 
government have shown that. We believe the increase in air traffic 
that has resulted since we have taken office does show that we have 
succeeded in this regard.
<P>
	Obviously we are particularly interested in this major company, 
one of our major carriers internationally as well as domestically, 
but at the present time we have received no request for any 
assistance from either the company or from the unions involved as 
well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I note that the 
minister gave no guarantee.
<P>
	But could the minister at least guarantee us that Ottawa will not 
amend its foreign investment regulations to allow U.S. interests to 
take over Canadian airlines, which is less and less Canadian?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is no question at the present time of answering such 
a question in this House because no request has been put by anyone 
in the airline industry for us to make that decision or to reconsider 
that decision.
<P>
	Therefore the question is entirely hypothetical and obviously 
cannot be answered in this House under the rules of Beauchesne's, 
which I happen to have in my hands at the present time.

<P>
	Yesterday the Minister of Justice accused me and my colleagues 
of failing to support some of the bills that he has rammed through 
this House, including Bill C-68.
<P>
	I have today with me 24 reasons why we could not support Bill 
C-68. Canadians were told repeatedly that the security of the 
firearms registration system could not be breached. Today I have 
24 individual restricted firearms registration certificates containing 
the name and address of each owner together with the full 
description of each firearm. These were all sent to the wrong 
individuals in the mail.
<P>
	I ask the solicitor general how this enormous breach of security 
could occur.

my hon. friend has raised this with  me for the first time right now

the material I will do my utmost to get him a complete answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly 
will do that. I will make sure that he gets these certificates so that 
the rightful owners can eventually get them.
<P>
	However, it is clear that Reform members were right. The 
firearms registration system is not secure and serious breaches 
have occurred.
<P>
	Will the solicitor general admit this and agree that this presents a 
serious problem for the Liberal's proposed registration system for 
rifles and shotguns?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the registration system we have at present is designed for use under 
the present law that is the registration law that existed prior to Bill 
C-68. We are busy working very vigorously to have a cost effective 
automated system using the best of technology which will respond 
to the needs of Bill C-68 and which will be based on learning from 
any difficulties that relate to the present system.
<P>
	The present system is not the one which will be applied in order 
to carry out Bill C-68, which is overwhelmingly supported and 
desired by the great majority of Canadians.

Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows, Canada is one of the

take their environmental responsibilities very seriously.
<P>
	A recent example of this responsibility is an industry driven 
initiative undertaken in conjunction with the Canadian Standards 
Association to develop a new sustainable forest management 
standard.
<P>
	These standards were recently approved by the Standards 
Council of Canada. They will subject the forestry industry to a 
rigorous, scientifically technical standard in relation to sustainable 
forestry management. They will also be subject to independent 
third party audits.

as one of the world's leading forestry nations.

legislation enacting the blended 15 per cent tax is not etched in

<P>
	She goes on to point out that the government is open to accepting 
a number of changes and then says that the Canadian public wants 
this tax.

indicate that the Canadian public wants this tax? If he cannot prove 
that, is he open to scrapping the whole notion?
<P>

Speaker, the hon. member knows that legislation is developed and 
passes through this House in a particular way. He knows that my 
department, along with the Minister of Finance, have worked with 
the three Atlantic provinces to develop legislation that will 
harmonize the sales tax system.
<P>
	As a member of the finance committee, I crossed this country 
and listened to Canadians who said to us: ``Fix this tax. Fix it by 
harmonizing it. Fix it by having tax included pricing. Fix it by 
having one administration''.
<P>
	I congratulate the Atlantic provinces for having the foresight to 
understand that this is what will be the solution to this tax. I would

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to rise on a point of order. 
I will be very brief, but I am asking for clarification from the Chair 
on an important issue regarding the certification of a petition.
<P>
	Just to give the background on this, I sent to the clerk of petitions 
a petition which was signed by 27 Canadians residing in my riding 
of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt. The clerk sent it back to me 
not certified. In her decision she outlined the reason as ``not 
meeting the requirements of Standing Order 36(2)(g)'', which 
reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In order to be certified, pursuant to section (1) of this Standing Order, every 
petition shall:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(g) contain at least twenty-five signatures together with the addresses of the 
signatories, from persons other than Members of Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I disagreed at the time with the clerk that the petition failed to 
meet this criterion. When I pursued the matter with her office I was 
informed by her staff that the petition was not certified because five 
of the signatures were in Punjabi. I was further informed that all 
signatures must be in either French or English.
<P>
	Now, in an attempt to get further clarification of how I could 
table this petition, I approached-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is this the same petition that you approached the 
Table with earlier today which was subsequently approved? Could 
you answer that question for me?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, it was. But I think the House needs to 
get clarification on this matter and that is why I raise it.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I undertake to look into this matter further. I 
understand that the petition was approved. Therefore, that would 
seem to put the case to rest.
<P>
	As far as the clarification goes, I will look into that matter and I 
will come back to the hon. member with some more information if 
it is necessary, either here in the House or in my chambers.

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
three petitions to present today on behalf of my constituents.
<P>
	The first group of petitioners request that Parliament pass

publishing the names of young offenders, lowering the age of 
application and transferring serious offenders to adult court.

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the

from sexual exploitation and abuse.

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUMANRIGHTS">HUMAN RIGHTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
final group of petitioners are requesting that the Government of 
Canada not amend federal legislation to include the phrase sexual 
orientation. The petitioners fear that such an inclusion would 
indicate societal approval of homosexual behaviour. The 
petitioners believe that the government should not legitimize this 
behaviour against the clear wishes of the majority.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="JAMESBAYNORTHERNQUEBECAGREEMENT">JAMES BAY NORTHERN QUEBEC AGREEMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have a petition from numerous citizens of my riding of 
Peterborough.
<P>
	These citizens draw to the attention of the House the fact that 
section 327 of the James Bay Northern Quebec Agreement 
discriminates against James Bay Crees who no longer live in James 
Bay, Quebec simply by virtue of their not living there. Specifically, 
the Mocreebec Nation who reside in northern Ontario suffer due to 
not having a land base, rights within the James Bay Northern 
Quebec Agreement, or federal funds.
<P>
	Therefore these petitioners request that Parliament revoke 
section 327 of the James Bay Northern Quebec Agreement due to 
its contravening the Canadian Constitution 1981. They request that 
the Mocreebec  Nation be recognized and a land base and federal 
funds be allocated to them.

	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I wish to present to the House today a petition signed by 
several hundred Canadians calling on the government and 
members of Parliament to support Bill C-205 introduced by the 
member for Scarborough West so as to provide in Canadian law 
that no criminal profits from committing a crime.
<P>
	Criminals are not prohibited by Canadian law from profiting 
from their crimes. Criminals have the opportunity today to produce 
videotapes, write books and to profit as a result of their crimes.
<P>
	These petitioners call on the Government of Canada to take 
immediate action to stop people like Clifford Olson from profiting 
from their heinous crimes.

	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the second petition has to do with section 745 of the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	Section 745 allows convicted killers to apply to have their parole 
ineligibility reduced. The petitioners and millions of other 
Canadians want this government to take immediate action to stop 
convicted killers from applying under section 745 to have their 
parole ineligibility reduced so that the penalty for first degree

from Saskatoon, Shellbrook, Warman and Hepburn.
<P>
	This petition is in response to the price gouging by gasoline 
companies in Saskatchewan. These people are very concerned 
about the fact that they are being gouged at the pumps. The 
petitioners call upon the House of Commons to urge the 
government to establish an energy pricing review commission to

	The first petition is from Cambridge, Ontario. The petitioners 
would like to draw to the attention of the House that our police and

that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is

syndrome or other alcohol related birth defects are 100 per cent 
preventable by avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

merging the GST and PST but are actually asking the Liberals to 
keep their promise and not proceed with the GST any longer. After 
all, that is what they promised and that is why people voted for the

These people are infuriated. I suspect they are all Liberals on this

in exporting CANDU reactors to China. They realize that this will 
upset the very delicate balance that currently exists in terms of our 
overseas exports. They are concerned about the abuse of human 
rights in that country and feel it is morally wrong to be exporting 
CANDU reactors with the suggestion that in the future they could 
be converted into nuclear weaponry. These Canadians want nothing

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order today to ask the government 
House leader when I can expect to receive answers to my Questions 
on the Order Paper Nos. 4 and 52. I requested an answer to both 
questions within 45 days.
<P>
	As of today, Q-4 has been outstanding for 253 days and Q-52 has 
been outstanding for 175 days. Q-4 is about public safety. It is 
about criminal access to firearms from the police and military. Q-4 
was first placed on notice in the last session of Parliament on 
November 24, 1995, almost one full year ago. Even though I 
requested an answer within 45 days, almost a year has passed and 
the government still refuses to provide me and my constituents 
with the information we need to hold the government accountable 
for its actions.
<P>
	I am concerned that the government will call an election before it 
gives us an answer. I as a member of Parliament cannot function 
and do my job if the government continues to hide information that 
should be on the public record and that it should have full access to.
<P>
	I am going to ask the Speaker as well, can you tell me what 
options I have to ensure that my rights and privileges as a member 
of Parliament are respected in this regard?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President 
of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member 
has asked for information that is very complex and takes a lot of 
research. I am sure that he would like to get the full documentation 
on all the questions he has asked.
<P>
	As I understand it, the papers are being processed and as soon as 
they are available we will have them in this House. Some 
information is very easy to get within the allotted time but when the 
member asks such convoluted questions and so many questions at a 
time, it takes the department a little longer to get this information 
for him.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
member also has the option to transfer those questions under a 
motion to adjourn the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
prefer that those questions remain as they are so I receive a good 
answer to them.
<P>
	My response to what the hon. member has said is that they have 
told me this for months already. The fact is this information should 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6196"> 6196 </A></B>
<P>
be on the public record and available before the legislation is even 
brought before the House.  Therefore I cannot understand why it is 
not available to me.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, on the 
same point of order, I view the point of order raised by my 
colleague with great concern. I had raised virtually the identical 
issue for another question. The Speaker at that time ruled that this 
was a serious matter. The government did not seem to be too 
concerned about meeting its obligations to respond within 45 days.
<P>
	I would therefore ask again, on behalf of my colleague, and 
reiterate and point to the Speaker's ruling of some months ago 
when he said that he views this issue very seriously. I would 
certainly hope that the government would hear my colleague's 
request and answer forthwith, rather than putting us off time and 
time again with the fact that it takes a great deal of work.
<P>
	There is no indication whether it is going to answer tomorrow, 
next week, next month or whether it is going to take so long that we 
have an election in the meantime.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I think your 
point of order has been well received.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DIVORCEACT">DIVORCE ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-41, an act to amend the 
Divorce Act, the Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement 
Assistance Act, the Garnishment, Attachment and Pension 
Diversion Act and the Canada Shipping Act, be read the third time 
and passed.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak today on third 
reading debate of Bill C-41, which is intended to amend a number 
of statutes to provide a comprehensive approach to improving the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6197"> 6197 </A></B>
<P>
system in Canada for determining the amounts and making more 
certain the payment of child support for parents who separate.
<P>
	The objective, first and foremost, is to ensure that the interests of 
the children are put first in terms of financial support when families 
separate.
<P>
	The House will know from the measures already announced that 
the initiative rests on four principle grounds. First is the creation 
through regulations to the Divorce Act of guidelines governing the 
determination of standard, uniform amounts for child support 
depending on the income of the parents.
<P>
	Second is a change to the way child support payments are taxed 
to make things simpler and fairer.
<P>
	Third is an improvement to the process by which the federal 
government assists in the enforcement of child support orders once 
made.
<P>
	Last is a measure that will double within the next two years the 
amount of the working income supplement which is a tax free 
component of the child tax benefit available to working families 
with children whose total income is less than $26,000 per year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	First of all, I must say that we have introduced the child support 
guidelines as a way of determining what constitutes a proper 
amount of support according to the financial capabilities of the 
payer.
<P>
	They involve numerical calculations which take into account 
amounts that families at similar income levels would spend on their 
children. These amounts are easy enough to ascertain. They are 
presented in a table format, similar to an income tax table.
<P>
	In this way, child support awards can be consistent, fair and 
predictable. Yet at the same time, the objective of consistency 
always has to be balanced with the need to have sufficient 
flexibility to deal with individual circumstances.
<P>
	Consequently, application of the table amounts is not completely 
rigid. The table award can be adjusted either upwards or 
downwards to account for special expenses or for any undue 
hardship suffered by either parent or the child as a result of 
awarding the amount of child support proposed by the guidelines.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In addition, there is a provision in the bill which allows the court 
to adjust the award if it causes unfairness because of special 
provisions made in a pre-existing agreement between the parties.
<P>
	For example, if the couple agreed that the custodial parent would 
maintain ownership of the family home but that in return the 
amounts of child support would be lower than they might otherwise 
be, a court could consider departing from the guideline amounts, 
taking into consideration the unequal division of property. This 
allows parties to negotiate agreements that may be suitable to their 
own particular situations.
<P>
	Also in recognition of the reality that many children's parents 
are not fortunate enough to be represented by legal counsel, the 
guidelines will help ensure that they too benefit from an adequate 
award by providing for a standard amount depending on income.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	During the hearings on Bill C-41, the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs heard from a wide variety of witnesses, 
many of them representing separated and divorced parents. One of 
the issues they addressed was the challenge we face in working 
toward a greater consistency in awards while allowing for some 
flexibility to adjust to individual circumstances. Some witnesses 
thought that a greater discretion should rest in the court while 
others preferred the greater predictability and consistency that the 
guidelines provide.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	However, the major legal organizations appearing before the 
committee, such as the Canadian Bar Association, the Barreau du 
Québec and the National Association of Women and the Law, all 
welcomed the guidelines as an initiative which provided a better 
balance of predictability and response to individual circumstances. 
They considered the guidelines to be a positive step.
<P>
	And I am confident that canadian families will share this 
conclusion once the guidelines are operational next May.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are no doubt those-as there were among the witnesses 
before the committee-who considered the actual amounts in the 
guidelines to be either too high or too low. Opinion will be divided 
forever on whether we have captured just the right amounts in the 
relevant income categories. However, we believe that as a matter of 
policy, standard guideline amounts are a vast improvement for 
children of separated families and we have to start somewhere.
<P>
	The first draft of proposed guideline amounts were published in 
1992 and there were many who commented and reacted. The 
federal-provincial-territorial committee that designed these 
proposals went back to the drawing board with those comments in 
mind and published a second proposed guideline table in 1995. 
Once again reactions and comments were received, changes were 
made. In the income levels of $40,000 and below there was a 15 per 
cent across the board increase in the proposed amounts.
<P>
	We believe the amounts now proposed are realistic, fair and 
appropriate. However, I want to assure the House that Bill C-41 
contemplates continuous review and monitoring of these amounts, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6198"> 6198 </A></B>
<P>
and of the guideline system as a whole, to ensure the process can be 
changed and improved to meet and overcome difficulties as they 
arise.
<P>
	Bill C-41 provides for a review process that contemplates a 
report to Parliament on the operation of the guidelines to be tabled 
no later than the fifth year following the implementation. If the 
right balance has not been struck, there will be an opportunity to 
change the guidelines.
<P>
	The Department of Justice is committed to ongoing monitoring. 
If gaps arise early on, before the end of the five-year review, they 
can be addressed quickly through amendments to the regulations. 
The guidelines are primarily found through subordinate legislation. 
That will allow us to respond more quickly and effectively when 
changes are needed.
<P>
	This is a process that has been followed in other countries which 
have adopted guidelines, including Australia, New Zealand, 
England and each state of the United States of America. The 
guidelines will be refined and improved as experience is amassed 
in dealing with them. It is extremely significant that in none of 
those countries where guidelines have been adopted, has it been 
concluded that it would be appropriate to return to the old system 
of judicial discretion from which we are now departing with the 
adoption of a similar approach.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	I am confident that in bringing forward this legislation we are 
taking a significant and a positive step for the children of separated 
and divorced families in Canada and we are doing so in a way that 
is flexible and capable of responding to the need for adjustment as 
time goes on.
<P>
	Adequate and consistent awards are of little comfort to children 
if they are not paid. That is why more than half of the bill is 
devoted to measures which will strengthen the existing means of 
enforcement available to the federal government, introducing new 
ways of securing payment of support for children.
<P>
	The federal licence denial mechanism set out in part III of Bill 
C-41 is a new measure designed to deal with those support payers 
who persistently breach their payment obligations.
<P>
	We know that many parents make their child support payments 
in full and on time, notwithstanding the fact that they often do so 
with great difficulty. They take their responsibilities seriously. It is 
out of respect for those people who make their payments in full and 
in the interests of the children who would otherwise suffer that we 
must do everything possible to ensure that those who can pay but 
wilfully refuse to do so are pursued by every means within our 
disposal. Part II of Bill C-41 is designed to do just that.
<P>
	While many of the options relating to enforcement fall within 
provincial jurisdiction, the new licence denial measures in Bill 
C-41 will provide concrete action at the federal level to address 
chronic and wilful default by those who can pay but do not. It will 
provide provincial and territorial governments with programs and 
new enforcement mechanisms to go after delinquent debtors and 
send a strong message that they must address and not avoid their 
support obligations.
<P>
	Refusing to support one's children is a serious breach of the law 
with consequences that can affect children throughout their lives. It 
is not simply a matter of providing the necessities and furnishing 
financial support. The record shows that a child who is in a 
situation where payments are not made by an absent parent bears 
emotional scars for life and takes the message that the absent 
parent has abandoned or rejected them and left them behind.
<P>
	The legislation we are urging on the House is intended through 
its specific requirements to ensure that licence denial at the federal 
level is available to the provinces which seek it as a last resort 
against support defaulters who have persistently breached their 
obligations. Since our goal is to see that children are supported, 
particular emphasis is placed on making sure that the defaulter is 
given an opportunity to avoid licence denial actions by making 
arrangements for payment with a provincial enforcement agency.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In addition, we are taking steps to strengthen the effectiveness of 
our existing enforcement services by ensuring that support 
recipients obtain monies owing more quickly.
<P>
	While the major role of enforcing support orders is carried out 
by provincial and territorial enforcement programs, the federal 
government is the largest collector, on their behalf, of delinquent 
payments.
<P>
	Through garnishment of income tax refunds and unemployment 
insurance monies, among others, the federal government collected 
$53 million last year. And it is estimated that at least this amount or 
more will be collected again this year.
<P>
	The salaries and pensions of federal employees can also be 
garnished for support enforcement purposes.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	Through Bill C-41, the government will collect more, and more 
efficiently, on behalf of children owed child support in this country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is often difficult to locate a defaulting parent who is in arrears. 
So as well as garnisheeing money owed to the children the federal 
government helps provincial governments find payers whose 
whereabouts are unknown. Accurate information to locate persons 
who have breached family support orders is a key first step to 
collection.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6199"> 6199 </A></B>
<P>
	One of the most significant and practical improvements 
provided in part II of Bill C-41 is the addition of the data banks 
of Revenue Canada to the list of those sources already searched 
to provide address information for locating defaulting payers. The 
confidentiality of the information held by Revenue Canada will 
be safeguarded to ensure that it is used solely for the purpose of 
locating support defaulters and securing support payments.
<P>
	Finally, I should not leave the subject without noting that many 
of the witnesses who appeared before the committee expressed the 
wish that we would have gone further into a different but related 
area of custody and access enforcement in dealing generally with 
the subject of child support.
<P>
	There is no question that difficulties with custody and access are 
the single most significant and difficult source of emotional pain 
for separating parents. Among all the problems that are presented 
when parents divided and must share the responsibility of children 
in those difficult circumstances, deciding on and honouring the 
terms of custody and access present the most complex and 
challenging of the problems.
<P>
	The Divorce Act already provides that when access and custody 
are being determined or enforced, the court must be governed by 
the best interests of children. As a result of amendments introduced 
in the House 10 years ago, the Divorce Act also provides that in 
determining which parent is to have custody, the willingness of the 
intended custodial parent to provide maximum access to the other 
parent is to be taken into account, reflecting the underlying value 
that we must place on the child seeing as much of both parents as 
possible, all other things being equal.
<P>
	But the disputes between parents on terms of custody and 
enforcing access are such that more than merely legislative change 
is required in order to meet them. We can use all the words we want 
to express the desire we all feel that in appropriate cases, all things 
being equal, both parents should see as much as possible of the 
children when the parents separate.
<P>
	In the last analysis it is up to the two individuals in their own 
circumstances, in their own good conscience and acting in the best 
interests of their own children to resolve the problems that arise.
<P>
	Some three or four years ago the Department of Justice started a 
broad public consultation on the subject of custody and access. 
After spending those years discussing with judges, family law 
lawyers, family counsellors, custodial and non-custodial parents, 
children, medical experts all of the issues arising from custody and 
access paradigm, we concluded that no consensus was out there in 
terms of specific legislative changes to be made to help improve 
the situation.
<P>
	There are so many facets to this difficult problem of human 
relations that there was no consensus about how a legislature could
<P>
help beyond what is already there as tools in the Divorce Act. And 
so this bill does not propose legislative change to deal with custody 
and access. It deals rather with child support. It is careful not to 
link child support and access because in our judgment that would 
be a terrible mistake.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	To suggest or to provide that money could be withheld if access 
is denied would leave the child or the children hostage to the 
emotional dealings between the parties. It would deny the child 
necessities based on the ability or willingness of the parents to iron 
out their difficulties in terms of access. That is simply bad public 
policy and is unacceptable.
<P>
	We recognize that the issues of custody and access remain 
unaddressed at least in terms of the federal legislation. It is our 
intention, once Bill C-41 is adopted, to renew and complete our 
work on custody and access to determine whether there is any way 
in which we can, through legislative change or other policy 
initiatives, improve the present situation in Canada in terms of 
custody and access.
<P>
	For the present those are the reasons this bill does not deal with 
that subject. Rather, it deals with the four elements which I 
described at the outset:
<P>
	First, it has guidelines to help introduce an element of 
consistency and practicability in establishing uniform amounts 
geared to income for children. It takes the guesswork out of fixing 
child support amounts. It provides guidance to parents as to what 
their obligations are. It reduces the costs of litigating this issue and 
perhaps facilitates the settlement of issues between parties by 
taking at least one issue off the table and providing a legislated 
response.
<P>
	Second, it changes the tax system. It eliminates the deduction to 
the payer and no longer requires the recipient to take child support 
into income for tax purposes. It sweeps away a rule that was put in 
place in the early forties so that the tax system can more fairly 
reflect the social values of the current age and overcome the 
unfairness of the custodial parent having to pay income tax on what 
is not usually money for that person but is support for the child. It 
relieves the custodial parent of the burden of administering the tax 
system with all of the complexities that involves.
<P>
	Third, it strengthens the provisions for enforcement, as I have 
described them today.
<P>
	Fourth and last, it takes all of the revenue the federal government 
will derive from ending the deduction for the payer and devotes 
that revenue dollar for dollar and then some to a doubling of the 
working income supplement. This provides tax free dollars for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6200"> 6200 </A></B>
<P>
those who need it most: working families with children and 
incomes below $26,000.
<P>
	I should say in closing that the measure of doubling to $1,000 
per family the working income supplement in July 1998 will result 
over the next five years in our putting more than a billion dollars of 
additional revenue into the hands of over 700,000 families in this 
country, fully one-third of whom are single parent families. That is 
going to be a real improvement to the lives of those children.
<P>
	I commend Bill C-41 to the House as an important part of an 
integrated strategy to improve the system for child support 
payment and enforcement in this country. It represents sound 
public policy and a genuine improvement for children of separated 
parents. I ask the House to support it.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
passing of Bill C-41, which seeks to modify the system for 
determining support payments is, in our view, another indication of 
this government's unwillingness to listen to the provinces, in this 
case Quebec. It is still the same old game of cat and mouse, as we 
see again with this bill on support payments.
<P>
	The current government is once again imposing legislation that 
we think is flawed, and is rejecting out of hand amendments from 
any party other than its own. This is a sad state of affairs and I 
deplore it, particularly as the purpose of this bill is to improve the 
living conditions of children.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	I know that the minister is just as anxious to attain this goal as I 
am. However, the route chosen does not seem to be the same as the 
one favoured by Quebec. When we compare the guidelines being 
proposed by Quebec and those being proposed by the federal 
government, it is clear that we are at cross purposes. I will come 
back to this a bit later.
<P>
	Right now, I would like to remind the government that too often 
its words are unfortunately at odds with its actions. As always, the 
government claims to have fine principles. It proclaims its wish to 
work toward decentralization of power, but it does absolutely 
nothing concrete to move in this direction when the opportunity 
arises.
<P>
	I think that this bill was a good opportunity for the government 
to show that it was open to including the small changes needed to 
recognize Quebec's distinct character. I will, if I may, repeat what 
the Prime Minister said less than a year ago, on November 29, 
1995, during the debate on the much discussed distinct society 
motion. Members will recall, I hope, that it is this motion the Prime 
Minister is relying on today in his attempt to trick  Quebecers into 
believing that he has kept his pre-referendum promises.
<P>
	Back to what the Prime Minister said. He said, here in this 
House: ``I made three commitments during the Quebec referendum 
campaign: first, to recognize that Quebec forms a distinct society 
within Canada; second, not to make any constitutional change that 
affects Quebec without Quebecers' consent; and third, to undertake 
changes to bring services and the decision making process closer to 
citizens''. This is where I would question the minister. In this bill, I 
would like to see him respect the guidelines proposed by the 
government of Quebec.
<P>
	Members on the government side will have noted, I hope, that 
Quebec forms a distinct society, or so their leader claims. They will 
also have noted that he spoke of bringing services and the decision 
making process closer to citizens.
<P>
	Regarding the recognition of Quebec as a distinct society, the 
Prime Minister said a bit later on: ``Once it is passed, this 
resolution will have an impact on how legislation is passed in the 
House of Commons. I remind Canadians that the legislative branch 
will be bound by this resolution, as will the executive branch''. 
``This is a real, dynamic recognition, recorded in the very heart of 
our country's government''. That is what the Prime Minister said. I 
am not inventing anything, I have taken it word for word from what 
he said.
<P>
	I will repeat it again, for I am a person who has doubts if 
somebody tells me one thing and does the opposite. ``Once it is 
passed, this resolution will have an impact on how legislation is 
passed in the House of Commons. I remind Canadians that the 
legislative branch will be bound by this resolution, as will the 
executive branch. This is a real, dynamic recognition, recorded in 
the very heart of our country's government''. When I say that the 
words spoken in this House by this government are not in keeping 
with its actions, this is the proof.
<P>
	On Bill C-41, we had proposed modifications, amendments, and 
I would liked to have seen some of them passed. I could perhaps 
have thought there was come connection between these words and 
the actions being prepared. I have to say that this is lip service only.
<P>
	The motion on the distinct society is supposed to have a real 
impact on the way the wording of bills is passed. What impact did 
this motion have on Bill C-41? Barely two days ago, the Bloc 
Quebecois presented motions to amend the bill, to improve it, to 
bring it more in line with the aspirations of Quebecers.
<P>
	Two days ago, we proposed that a province's guidelines be 
automatically recognized if they met the standards set out in the 
bill, the criteria imposed by the federal government. It seems to me 
that this is not so difficult, when they claim to wish to recognize 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6201"> 6201 </A></B>
<P>
different ways of doing things, and acknowledge in a bill that 
Quebec is a distinct society.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	I will tell you why we think it is distinct. In my opinion, this 
position was perfectly reasonable and desirable. First, as I have 
said, we accepted, albeit a bit reluctantly, it is true, the federal 
jurisdiction over divorce. I say a bit reluctantly, because Quebec 
has long desired to regain jurisdiction over divorce. Why? Because 
this is one more aberration in the division of powers. We cannot, of 
course, rewrite history, but it is still a fact that Quebec has been 
extremely patient in constitutional matters.
<P>
	Divorce renders the end of a marriage official, as everyone 
knows. That is a self-evident truth. Since unions between 
individuals fall under civil law, and therefore under provincial 
jurisdiction, it became evident to Quebecers long ago that 
dissolution of marriage ought to also be a provincial jurisdiction. 
Such is not the case. however.
<P>
	Despite this historical aberration and despite Quebec's desire to 
regulate this area, we acknowledge, still being part of the federal 
regime, that divorce does fall under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	Now we find the federal government wanting to modify the 
Divorce Act. Is this not a good opportunity to make some space for 
Quebec and the other provinces?
<P>
	The government has made sure not to do so, and this is what we 
find regrettable. We propose to respect the standards imposed by 
the federal government, and that is acceptable, but what we are 
demanding is that, once this condition is met, they give way in 
favour of the provincial rules.
<P>
	Why is it so important for Quebec and eventually for the other 
provinces? Because the Quebec government is closest to its 
citizens. As we said repeatedly only two days ago, this is the 
government that administers all aspects of life in our society. It is 
the government that is responsible for education, for providing 
assistance with housing, food, clothing, entertainment, health care, 
transportation, and so forth. In fact, the list is much longer.
<P>
	The Quebec government and other provincial governments are 
there to redistribute wealth and ensure that citizens who are less 
well off or not as well equipped to make their way through life have 
the minimum they need.
<P>
	The provincial government looks after family life, day care and 
the problems in this respect. So obviously, as we said before, it is in 
the best position to know how to organize a child support payment 
system in terms of the choices this society has made.
<P>
	The Quebec government, as we all know, is about to adopt its 
own guidelines. We explained at length that  before drafting a final 
policy, it considered all provincial transfer payments to its citizens. 
It had to bring this new legislation into line with all its existing and 
draft policies and also in terms of the government's review of its 
approach to family policy.
<P>
	The Quebec government, for the benefit of Quebec society and 
especially that of its children, is preparing to adopt a policy on 
child support payments, a policy that will complement steps that 
have already been taken with respect to the collection of support 
payments and their tax treatment.
<P>
	We are talking about a concrete aspect of the specific identity of 
Quebec society. That is why we asked the federal government for a 
commitment to recognize the guidelines established by a province 
for child support payments.
<P>
	What did we get as an answer? A resounding no. We voted 
yesterday, and it was no all the time. All the amendments we 
proposed got no for an answer from all government members. I 
find that deplorable. And do not tell us they are sensitive to 
Quebec's demands. We have made those demands clear in this 
House ever since we were elected. Was an amendment ever really 
accepted? The list is very short, even in that case. And we deplore 
that.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	The response we got smacked of the usual paternalism. We were 
told that the federal government alone, without any debate in the 
House, will decide if it feels like recognizing provincial 
regulations. Period.
<P>
	The Liberals are now in power. What would happen if they lost 
the next election? No one knows. That is what we deplore. We 
would have liked this bill to be sent back to committee so we could 
talk about this. It is up to the people's elected representatives to 
discuss general policy matters. This should not be done in small, 
restricted committees.
<P>
	This is rather inconsistent with the Prime Minister's comments, 
which, I think, is unfortunate. It is totally inconsistent with the fine 
promise to respect Quebec's distinct society. It is totally 
inconsistent with the promise to bring services and decisions closer 
to the people.
<P>
	As far as I know, the provincial governments are closer to their 
people than the federal government. That is what I am told every 
day. When I tell the people in my riding that I come back every 
weekend, they feel-and it is true, given their interest in provincial 
legislation and in their government, not only in Quebec but in the 
other provinces as well-that their provincial government is closer 
to them.
<P>
	I also deplore the federal government's spending powers that 
have grown over the years. That is why we have an enormous 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6202"> 6202 </A></B>
<P>
deficit. There is overlap and duplication. Even our friends in power 
never had the nerve to pretend that the federal government was 
closer to its people than the provincial governments. It think it 
would have been too much, even for them.
<P>
	This is the first proof that the Prime Minister's promises were 
not kept and that his government has no intention of keeping them. 
Allow me to be sceptical. Even in a neutral bill like this one, the 
Liberals found a way of sweeping Quebec's demands, however 
modest, under the carpet.
<P>
	I will now move on to the second motion we proposed in order to 
improve Bill C-41. Its purpose is to limit the list of criteria listed in 
new clause 26.1.
<P>
	The minister did not say anything about it earlier. That is another 
problem. As we know, this section lists subjects that federal or 
provincial authorities may legislate guidelines on. Basically, these 
are all the foreseeable issues that may arise in relation to child 
support. These are the criteria I referred to in the first part of my 
speech.
<P>
	The problem with section 26.1 is that not only does it list 
requirements, but it leaves the list open. Why is this a problem? 
The problem arises from the fact that these requirements represent 
an absolute prerequisite to the recognition of provincial guidelines 
by the federal government, while the word ``including'' leaves the 
door open to a redefinition of these requirements. Additions could 
be made whenever someone feels like it without the hon. members 
having any say in the matter.
<P>
	The bill explicitly provides that, before any province may 
implement its own guidelines in divorce cases, these guidelines 
must have been approved by the federal government. In order to be 
approved by the federal government, the guidelines must meet the 
requirements set out in section 26.1. But in section 26.1, the 
requirements are listed under the phrase ``including''.
<P>
	This word is explicit. It means that what follows are examples, 
indicating that the list is not restrictive or exhaustive. So, should 
the government change tomorrow, they could take a look at the act 
and decide to apply it completely differently. How can a province 
make sure to meet the federal requirements when it knows only 
about part of them? How can a province make sure to meet the 
federal requirements if the federal government can change these 
requirements as it pleases?
<P>
	Let us imagine for a moment that a similar procedure applied to 
tenders regularly issued by the government. There could be, for 
instance, an invitation to tender for the provision of building 
materials. The contract would state: ``The tenderer shall provide 
the materials required to build a museum. He may also be required 
to provide materials to build another type of building''.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	The fact is no one in the business would venture to bid on 
something like that. We can easily understand why. How is the 
required materials cost supposed to be estimated without knowing 
how much will be needed?
<P>
	Let me give you another example: the provision of services. No 
one would respond to an invitation to tender for janitorial building 
maintenance services stating that other work may be involved, but 
not specifying what. How are people supposed to know if they can 
meet the requirements for a given job when they do not know the 
specifics? While simplistic, these examples are good illustrations 
of the arbitrary nature of a clause that uses the term ``including'', 
particularly when it applies to a regulatory process, something 
about which I have doubts.
<P>
	How could a province believe in an eventual recognition of its 
guidelines, if the criteria relating to this recognition can be changed 
at any time, at the federal government's discretion? How will a 
provincial government be able to set its work objectives if it does 
not know the expectations of the federal government, or if these 
expectations are likely to change? It is like playing cat and mouse. 
The federal government puts out a piece of cheese, watches the 
provinces run for it and then puts the piece out of reach. This is 
more or less what will happen with this bill.
<P>
	Clarity must be the basic rule regarding legislation. The theme, 
the objectives and also the consequences for non-compliance must 
be clear. However, the proposed clause 26.1 is not clear, far from it.
<P>
	In order to show its goodwill, the government must clearly set 
the rules. The word ``including'' should have disappeared from the 
final version of the bill, as was my wish and that of Bloc members 
and Quebecers. Once again, the Liberal team did not deem it 
appropriate to take into account its commitment to respect the 
jurisdiction of the provinces.
<P>
	Far from facilitating the taking over of responsibilities by the 
provinces, the federal government passes legislation that could put 
off some provinces, including Quebec, and deter them from taking 
any initiative regarding the issue of child support. We do not want 
this to happen and nor does the minister, because, as you know, the 
objective is to improve the living conditions of children. We are all 
working toward this goal. However, Quebec wants a little more 
flexibility, and should have it. The government is working on 
guidelines which will not be based on the same criteria as those that 
will be proposed by Quebec.
<P>
	However, I do not think Quebec will let the federal government 
put it on the sideline. The issue will turn into another battle. As we 
said, Quebec will proceed very soon. What will happen then? I do 
not know. The situation is quite simple: Quebec is once again in the 
great position of having to totally depend on the federal  
government's goodwill regarding whether or not these guidelines 
will apply in the case of a divorce. Is this the respect shown to 
Quebec society? Is this the respect shown by governments that are 
close to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6203"> 6203 </A></B>
<P>
their citizens? This government shows its respect by keeping things 
in a precarious position, and this is what we deplore. This is why 
we are fighting in this House; this is what we were elected for. This 
government shows its respect by keeping the provinces in the dark. 
Its rule is might is right. Some respect!
<P>
	This kind of respect is also displayed by the Liberal 
government's attitude toward our request that the child's place of 
residence-and this is important-be the factor determining 
whether federal or provincial rules will apply when the parents do 
not live in the same province. There is disagreement on this issue. 
Quebec wants the place of residence to be that of the child, while 
the federal government says it should be the domicile of the parent 
paying support.
<P>
	This may seem inconsequential to a member who does not really 
pay attention to this issue and who simply votes as instructed by his 
whip. However, this unjustified refusal by the Liberal team will 
have a negative impact on many children, and I will tell you why.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	I will repeat the explanation given by my colleagues and myself 
barely two days ago. Perhaps certain members across the way did 
not hear, or perhaps they were absent. I will repeat it. The bill states 
that, when parents do not reside in the same province, the federal 
guidelines will apply. We in the Bloc Quebecois say that the 
guidelines of the province in which the child lives should apply.
<P>
	I will attempt to explain why. Setting aside the fact that the 
federal grid does not, in our opinion, take into account all pertinent 
information and is therefore flawed, and setting aside the fact that, 
as I explained earlier, the provinces are in the best position to 
develop their own grid, this rule will skew the support payments 
regime and will create unfairness within a province, because 
children in the same province will not all be entitled to the same 
treatment for the sole reason that their non-custodial parent lives in 
another province.
<P>
	Furthermore, as I mentioned two days ago, since the stability of 
the custodial parent is usually greater than that of the parent paying 
support, it follows that the economic stability of the child demands 
that his place of residence be the criterion used, to prevent grid 
shopping by the parent paying support.
<P>
	It is difficult to justify this government's rejection of our 
proposal, all the more so in light of the Prime Minister's fine 
words, his fine promises to respect Quebec society and to respect 
the provinces. They were empty words, and nothing more.
<P>
	When we know that families come under the exclusive 
jurisdiction of the provinces, and rightly so, we are  entitled to 
wonder why the Minister of Justice is unwilling to budge, unless 
what he has in mind is the provinces leaving it to the federal 
government to resolve all support payment cases, regardless of 
their legal foundation. Unless that is what the minister wants.
<P>
	Someone across the way should have reminded the justice 
minister that he must keep his word and respect the spirit of his bill. 
If it had truly been his intention, as he says, to recognize grids 
adopted by the provinces at some future date, he should have 
recognized that the principle of uniformity applies first of all 
within the provinces. He ought to have given up on imposing his 
grid for paying parents living in a different province than the child. 
He has not done so. Like his Liberal colleagues, the minister has 
perpetuated the closed-minded attitude Quebecers are so 
accustomed to.
<P>
	One other proposal by the Bloc Quebecois was cavalierly 
rejected yesterday. It was intended to protect the provinces. The 
purpose of the proposal was to confer a grandfather clause on 
provinces which had already adopted their own guidelines, and 
which had succeeded in having them recognized by the federal 
government. Why such a clause?
<P>
	First of all, my fellow citizens will have understood that there is 
not exactly an atmosphere of total confidence reigning at present. 
When, as it has clearly done in its bill, the government keeps all of 
the doors wide open, when it does not yield even one inch of a 
virtually absolute discretionary power, there are grounds for 
wondering where it is headed, and how it plans to exercise its 
powers. If the past is any indication of the future, Quebecers will 
have to brace themselves for more federal government 
imperialism, especially from the present government.
<P>
	What is more, even in a context that is relatively more 
harmonious, in most areas the parties often deem it more prudent to 
have a ``grandfather clause'' in order to ensure stability, whether 
for a business contract, a collective agreement, or an agreement 
between governments.
<P>
	Considering the huge efforts invested by a government in 
drafting and passing total legislation on support payments, it can be 
readily concluded that there are grounds for preserving acquired 
rights for some time to come. That is what the official opposition 
tried to do on Monday. That is what the government refused to do 
on Monday, on purely partisan grounds, if I dare say so.
<P>
	If we look at this rebuff in the context of the fine promises of 
November 29, 1995, it is patently obvious that the Liberal 
government has no intention of modifying one iota of the 
legislative process in recognition of the distinct society and to 
show respect for the governments closest to the people.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6204"> 6204 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	The members of the Bloc Quebecois did not need this further 
evidence of the hollow statements and promises made by the Prime 
Minister and his team. However, Quebecers have now seen once 
again that they have nothing more to expect from the federal 
government.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to point out that the official 
opposition will vote for this bill only because members of the Bloc 
Quebecois believe in the value and importance of guidelines for 
child support payments.
<P>
	We will vote for this bill because we support the principle, 
because we believe that guidelines will improve the quality of life 
of women and children, of Quebecers and Canadians. We will vote 
for this bill because we believe in a more just society, a society 
where poverty will no longer be the fate of a large part of the 
population.
<P>
	We will vote for this bill because we set a priority on principle 
and the well being of our fellow citizens. Certainly not because we 
believe the bill is adequate in its final form. That is what I wanted 
to say this afternoon. Certainly not because we appreciate the 
overly paternalistic attitude of the present government. That is 
what I wanted to deplore this afternoon.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill C-41. This bill establishes a 
framework for the use of child support guidelines and measures to 
tighten enforcement of support orders, to be effective May 1, 1997. 
It amends the Divorce Act, Family Orders and Agreements 
Enforcement Assistance Act, the Garnishment, Attachment and 
Pension Diversion Act and the Canada Shipping Act.
<P>
	It is my understanding that it does not apply to unmarried or 
separated persons but it is expected that the provinces will enact 
similar legislation and that the provisions will be applied 
unilaterally in the provinces.
<P>
	It is assumed following the passage of Bill C-41 we can expect 
changes to the Income Tax Act to make child support payments 
taxable in the hands of the non-custodial spouse, or ex-spouse in 
this case.
<P>
	This bill follows a federal-provincial territorial task force report 
which did encompass the areas of custody, access and maintenance. 
It is interesting to note that this bill virtually ignored two-thirds of 
that report and simply went to the issues of child support guidelines 
and enforcement.
<P>
	This bill passed report stage on November 5 and the Reform 
Party did express concerns and amendments at that time. First was 
the consideration of the appropriateness of the process of guideline 
review. Those guidelines are out of sight of public scrutiny and are 
not as flexible as we felt would be necessary.
<P>
	Second was the consideration of the payment and the ability to 
pay and who it was that would be taken into consideration in the 
payment of the child support.
<P>
	Third was the lack of direction in the root causes and the damage 
done through divorce proceedings and substantive measures to 
address those root causes. That involves the issues of access and 
the process of the divorce itself. I will be addressing these topics 
today.
<P>
	It is not often that the Divorce Act is opened up and when it is, it 
is an important enough topic that Reform feels that surely the 
government should take the time and the effort to do what is 
necessary, to do what is best in this area. Today I ask this 
government what indeed are the best interests of the child. 
Certainly that is an issue that surrounds this whole issue of divorce, 
one that needs to be answered in relation to the issue of divorce.
<P>
	To whom do our children belong? Do our children belong to one 
parent, both parents or do our children belong to the state? How 
best do we address the needs of these children through what we all 
know is the painful and often destructive process of divorce?
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	These questions I fear are not well addressed in this bill and 
today I would like to speak to that. Divorce indeed is a tug of war 
between parents and perhaps the interests of government and how it 
then proceeds to oversee that tug of war.
<P>
	On the issue of the differences, I can see three principles where 
the Reform Party would differ from the Liberal Party, and certainly 
in my discussion today I would like to bring these out. These are 
principles, not the specifics of the bill. I will mention them now so 
that these can be considered as we look at the elements of the bill.
<P>
	The first principle is the importance of families in our society 
and the importance of government to support those families. I am 
afraid in so much of what I see in what this government does. It has 
forgotten that basic fact. Here we have a government wedded to the 
idea of big government that would like to tax families into oblivion 
with the stresses that come with the taxes that they give, families 
that have to work half a year simply for the government and then in 
light of that earn less and less each year as they work harder and 
harder.
<P>
	This government has forgotten the value of parenting and 
perhaps even it has forgotten that within the family context divorce 
hurts. Divorce hurts the families. The family breakdown now is 
epidemic, going up 400 per cent in the last 30 years.
<P>
	The root causes of many of our social dilemmas and the stresses 
that we see I believe can be found in this very epidemic that we see, 
whether it be youth crime, whether it be suicide among our youth, 
whether it be the welfare rolls or poverty itself that concerns each 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6205"> 6205 </A></B>
<P>
of us in  this country and in this place. What are the root causes? 
Much of it can be traced back to this very institution we talk about 
today.
<P>
	Divorce hurts families. It hurts parents, it hurts the grandparents 
and those around and, I would put to the House today, most of all it 
hurts the children that watch it all go by.
<P>
	The second principle is we have a government that is seized with 
its own importance, a government that thinks that government can 
solve all the problems, a government that thinks coming to a bill 
such as this in an easy, fast manner, that wants to put a legislative, 
legalistic quick fix to a problem that is much too major. It shows a 
mindset of a government that is set on itself, a government that 
believes in lawyers rather than people, a government that would 
make decisions behind the closed doors of an order in council 
rather than bringing them to a public place where they can be 
discussed.
<P>
	That is the kind of government that we see at work, a 
government that would spend millions of taxpayer dollars on 
poverty programs but forget to solve the underlying issues, 
thinking that government can solve these things and forgetting that 
it is people and the families in which they live who solve the 
problems that are causing these very stresses; a government quite 
frankly that is stuck on itself.
<P>
	The third principle is true equality, the equality in the processes 
that this government oversees, the equality of men and women, of 
two parents coming into a situation such as divorce, both senior 
partners treated with dignity and equality in the process the 
government puts forward.
<P>
	These three issues, the importance of family, the overriding 
intervention of government and equality of people in the processes, 
are the three principles that go through the discussion that I want to 
bring to this place today.
<P>
	I would put to the House that the government's solution, as 
proposed in Bill C-41, is really no solution at all. What it does is 
create greater inequity within our families. It creates greater 
insecurity within our families, greater potential rancour within the 
divorce process and greater potential economic loss to the parties 
involved with the potential need for greater litigation.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	There are several concerns that I want to bring forward today 
which are specific to the bill. First is the guidelines, their control 
and application.
<P>
	These guidelines will not be developed within the House of 
Commons. As the justice minister mentioned, there will be a 
review in five years and I do commend the government for putting 
in place a specific review process. But in the meantime these 
guidelines can be adjusted and changed. Again, I agree with the 
adjustment factor for the guidelines. However, I disagree that the  
adjustment be made behind closed doors, without accountability to 
the Canadian public. This is much too important.
<P>
	The principle of order in council, behind closed doors 
government decision, I remind members on the other side, is 
something they spoke out against when they sat on this side of the 
House. Again in this legislation, as in other legislation, there are 
regulations, orders in council determining the direction of things 
that affect Canadians in a very real and important way.
<P>
	The process of the review of the guidelines must come back to 
Parliament, back to the committees of this place. The process must 
be accountable to Canadians. The pattern of the government is all 
too common. It shows that the government again thinks too much 
of itself and too little of the Canadian people.
<P>
	How would the guidelines be applied? How would they actually 
work in the lives of Canadians who are already in distress, in a 
situation which is causing them and their children much pain?
<P>
	I feel that the principle of the guidelines is well intentioned. 
Largely guidelines can bring about a fairer process. They give 
parameters wherein perhaps we could have a system that would 
treat those involved in a fair and equitable way.
<P>
	The system that existed before these guidelines were put in place 
was criticized for producing different awards for individuals in 
similar situations. It was felt that it allowed too much judicial 
discretion. Therefore people who were in identical support 
situations but with different judges and in different provinces 
would receive vastly different awards. The new system will 
produce similar awards but for very different scenarios or 
circumstances. In effect, we have taken the danger from one side 
and actually overcompensated. The solution suggested by the 
government could be just as dangerous and just as unfair for the 
Canadians who will be using the system.
<P>
	The system for which the guidelines are proposed is constructed 
on the assumption that the non-custodial parent is basically a 
source of funds and that the custodial parent has the exclusive care 
of the child or children involved in the divorce. This is a simplistic 
approach to the issue. It could be a detrimental approach to the 
families that go through this painful procedure.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	The first thing I would like to do is put forward our concerns 
about the guidelines. The process that is put to the guidelines 
withdraws the joint financial responsibility from the parents; it is 
one parent's single responsibility for the support of the children. 
The non-custodial parent is exclusively considered the source of 
the funds for the support of the children.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6206"> 6206 </A></B>
<P>
	One part of the bill calls for the removal of section 17(8) of 
the original Divorce Act which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A variation order varying a support order that provides for the support of a child 
of a marriage should</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) recognize that the former spouses have a joint financial obligation to maintain 
the child; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) apportion that obligation between the former spouses according to their 
relative abilities to contribute to the performance of the obligation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I repeat that this section has been removed. Reference to joint 
financial obligation or relative abilities of both former spouses is 
removed. Perhaps this is the most apparent place where the 
underlying function of the guidelines is clarified. Within the 
guidelines and the setting up of the guidelines and as I said with the 
removal of this section it becomes very apparent there is no longer 
joint financial responsibility for the support of the children.
<P>
	A child is the product of two parents. Until a divorce is 
encountered, there is a shared responsibility for the support of that 
child. It is worked out between the parents and in no way does 
society dictate that one should support and one should not. The 
choice is there and should be there for both parents. That child then 
walks into a court with the two parents and within a few minutes, 
on a variation of an order, when that child walks out of the court the 
financial responsibility for the support of that child rests solely on 
the non-custodial parent. The guidelines are based on one income 
only and the ability to pay of that one income only.
<P>
	Given the situation of a professional custodial parent and a 
non-custodial parent who perhaps works on commission or works 
seasonally or whatever it might be, it seems to me to be unfair to 
say that one is sole owner of the responsibility for support of the 
child when indeed both could work that out together.
<P>
	Presently in order to change that or to revise it, perhaps at the 
time the decision is made the non-custodial parent is able and will 
be determined to be able to make that support, but the only review 
of that situation would be based on undue hardship. Again it would 
still fall back to the non-custodial parent. In the meantime, the 
custodial parent could have resources far beyond those of the 
non-custodial parent and be willing to use those resources.
<P>
	This system suggests an unequal value to the ability and the 
desire of parents to put their resources toward their children. The 
way this system is put forward, it is not the ability to support the 
child that determines who supports the child but simply who does 
not get custody of the child.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	If we think of that, the very rancour in the divorce proceedings 
centres around the custody battle. The changes to the Divorce Act 
the last two times it was opened-the only two times it was 
opened-with no fault divorce were to make the litigation process 
quicker, easier and less rancorous. However, battles are fought on 
custody considerations. Now something has been added to that 
battle.
<P>
	Not only does the battle concern custody but the battle for 
custody will dictate a winner and a loser. I would suggest that the 
winner takes all. The winner takes the child, the winner takes what 
is given within the custody order. The loser loses the child and 
instead becomes the payer and is completely responsible for the 
support of the child. The ante increases in the custody battle. There 
is a winner and there is a loser. Not only is there a loser in the 
decision of who will be the non-custodial parent, but within this 
extended battle the loser is the child who sees the rancour involved.
<P>
	The guidelines ignore the non-custodial parenting process 
outside the support payment responsibility. As we have said, the 
non-custodial parent is fully responsible for the support payment, 
which is based solely on the non-custodial parent's gross income. 
The parent in this process is defined simply by the dollars and cents 
they will be giving to the child, the dollars and cents that will be 
ordered for payment within the child support decision.
<P>
	There is no allowance in the process for any expenses, direct or 
indirect, no matter how significant they may be, which the 
non-custodial parent may put toward the child they will be 
supporting. The guidelines completely ignore any other support in 
the form of expenses. The guidelines cannot be challenged without 
proof of a condition of undue hardship.
<P>
	What about a non-custodial parent's costs for housing, 
transportation and food, or costs in their activities with the 
children? These are not even considered, nor can they be within the 
guidelines. This results in a very great inequity in the value of 
parenting between the custodial and non-custodial parents. Perhaps 
worse, it may be a disincentive for a non-custodial parent to put 
resources toward the child.
<P>
	They will pay the same award regardless of how they interact 
with the children after divorce. The non-custodial parent who 
spends one day a week with their child will have the same order as 
one who spends three hours with their child, or perhaps one who 
spends every other month with their child. The actual child support 
guidelines will give each an identical award.
<P>
	I see this as the government's lack of recognition of the value of 
parenting. A non-custodial parent is a parent, as is a custodial 
parent. Both have valued input to the child. That is not recognized 
and there may be a disincentive for that activity. This will lead 
directly to greater custody battles. If payment is all that counts, 
once someone becomes a non-custodial parent perhaps the custody 
becomes all that much more valuable. Perhaps this too gives a 
greater chance of payment delinquency.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6207"> 6207 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	In my riding and in meetings, non-custodial parents already feel 
abandoned by the system. Anger and betrayal are felt by 
non-custodial parents. They care about the children of the families 
that have been broken up. They have been affected in very real 
ways by the break-up of the marriage. It has been shown that 
children are affected in very real ways by the removal of one 
parent. They are affected by the rancour of a divorce proceeding. 
There is already enough anger in the court decisions and in the 
access problems. We need no greater anger or greater potential for 
anger.
<P>
	The government claims that the guidelines will ease tensions and 
expedite the process. As I have said, the main area where acrimony 
arises within divorce is within the custody proceedings. By putting 
these guidelines forward and the way that these guidelines work, 
the government has upped the ante on the battle that will go on in 
the custody courtrooms of this nation.
<P>
	This legislation means there will be more to lose in the process 
for the loser and there will be more to win for the winner. There 
will be more rancour in the process and unfortunately, the children 
of divorce will be caught in the middle.
<P>
	Outside the guidelines, the second major portion of the bill 
would be the enforcement considerations that have been proposed. 
The Reform Party strongly supports compliance with court orders. 
It supports justice being done. It supports people obeying the law.
<P>
	The Reform amendment that was put forward suggested that 
more notice be given for federal activities such as the withdrawal 
of passports or federal licences for the fairness of all concerned. 
We also recognize that the present statistics of non-compliance are 
indeed shocking. We want more investigation done about the 
reasons for this non-compliance and the sources for this data. The 
reasons are incredibly important. Unfortunately, because 
investigation has not been done on why or how the information has 
been gathered, we must speculate on what the reasons are for the 
non-compliance.
<P>
	An interesting study was done in 1992 in the United States by the 
general accounting officer. Typically when people are investigating 
non-compliance, they ask the custodial parent what the situation is. 
In the study 66 per cent of custodial parents reported not receiving 
child support because the non-custodial parent was unable to pay.
<P>
	Part of this legislation is the ability to pay. I would hope that 
indeed the guideline is met by the judges and the guidelines that are 
put forward. It would seem that most people feel the guidelines are 
a good start in that direction.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	The three best predictors of compliance are the fairness of the 
original order, the non-custodial access to the child and the work 
stability of the non-custodial parent.
<P>
	The fairness of the original order depends on the reasonableness 
of the guidelines. As I have already mentioned, the guidelines 
which have been put forward ignore the value of parenting and 
certainly the value of co-parenting. The fairness of the order must 
be flexible. The guidelines must allow flexibility. They should 
include flexibility beyond simply a condition of undue hardship. 
The fairness of the original order depends on a workable review of 
the circumstances and an equitable review of the situations of the 
two parents and their ability to pay support.
<P>
	One of the predictors I mentioned was the work stability of the 
non-custodial parent. Part of that depends, of course, on 
employment opportunities. The unemployment rate stands at 10 
per cent. That is affecting non-custodial parents who want to 
support their children and comply with court orders. The 10 per 
cent unemployment rate is very much a part of the problem which 
non-custodial parents face.
<P>
	The final predictor which I mentioned was non-custodial access 
to the child. This is a determining factor of compliance. While it 
cannot be linked directly, however, one does affect the other. 
Access goes to the heart of the matter when it concerns 
non-custodial parents. Access and the issues surrounding it 
underlie the value of parenting.
<P>
	In the report of the provincial-territorial task force, access, 
custody and support were interwoven. Divorce, access, custody and 
support issues cross federal and provincial jurisdictions and take us 
into territory which is confusing to both judges and the people 
going through divorce proceedings.
<P>
	In B.C. in the 1980s an experiment was carried out in a family 
court. Federal and provincial jurisdictions were combined under 
one roof.
<P>
	Another experiment was carried out in Manitoba in 1989. It 
investigated legislation that would enforce court awards that 
granted access of the children to non-custodial parents. It was a 
pilot project. It was different in that it provided access assistance. It 
did not enforce access. Rather than necessitating a court 
proceeding, it offered assessments, counselling, supervision, 
conciliation and arbitration. Going to court in this process was a 
last resort. Even then if the parties found that court was necessary 
for an access determination they had help available through this 
pilot program of assessment counselling and supervision.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6208"> 6208 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	As I looked at what was brought to me by different individuals in 
terms of access, there are three kinds of access available. The first 
is called reasonable access awarded. In perhaps two-thirds of cases 
this would be the norm. It assumes communication between the 
parents and that access is negotiated through that communication 
but sole custody would generally be allotted to one parent. It is less 
flexible than it sounds in that it tends to be specific but not specific 
through a court order or a court agreement. Reasonable access is 
then left up to the parents to determine the details.
<P>
	It is this very process of reasonable access awarded by the courts 
that seems to be open over time to changes, in some cases abuse by 
one spouse or the other. It can lead both partners back to repeated 
court visits, demanding perhaps court orders to make it work.
<P>
	The new system proposed would not be helpful in this type of 
situation. About one-seventh of orders are specified access and that 
is when non-custodial visitation rights are given within certain time 
limits. This is specified in the court agreement or in the court order. 
This might be a second step for a couple from reasonable access to 
specified access. However, couples find that within the process 
there is little or no enforcement of access orders provided within 
the court, within the system that gives them.
<P>
	Within this legislation there are no enforcement measures 
proposed for this important area. It has been suggested to me that 
the provincial enforcement agencies that are proposed to enforce 
the child support orders could also enforce the access orders, but 
this has been totally ignored by the proposed government 
legislation.
<P>
	We have reasonable access or specified access but from what I 
have seen the most reasonable and positive is the award of joint 
custody. Perhaps 20 per cent of divorce cases go toward joint 
custody. Sometimes it is de facto and sometimes it is de jure 
situations but mostly through court ordered situations. That is 
where parents agree to share the custody and the decisions, 
including access to their children. In most cases it is extremely 
flexible. With joint custody it can be equal or it can be that the 
children are mostly with one parent, but it is a custody and access 
decision that has flexibility without the winner and without the 
loser implications that we have discussed.
<P>
	It does not regard children as property to be bartered over but as 
something valued by both parents and can be taken care of and 
parented by both parents. It is interesting to note in terms of 
enforcement and the compliance to a child support order that the 
best case scenario is found in joint custody arrangements.
<P>
	The member for Prince George-Peace River has put forward a 
private member's bill, Bill C-242, that would make this type of 
arrangement, joint custody, the rule instead of the exception in 
divorce proceedings. This  indeed would address the enforcement 
of child support and the whole issue of child support in a far more 
positive way than what we see within the present bill.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	The government version that we see today is actually a 
disincentive to this type of arrangement which allows both parents 
to parent and both parents to dialogue. According to the 
government version if this joint custody is what is decided, then the 
guidelines must minimize the differences in the standard of living 
in the two households. This is a unique situation and applies to the 
joint custody arrangements. This implicitly then includes the entire 
households involved with the two parents. It includes spouses, it 
includes children, it includes changes in circumstance and it is very 
difficult. It is very hard to imagine how this will work, with 
changing circumstances, new families and ongoing circumstance 
provisions.
<P>
	Someone deciding how they will have access and custody orders 
made would see joint custody arrangements as having a greater 
potential for invasion into the privacy of their home, greater 
potential for acrimony in the decisions and unpredictable 
obligations of child support in future years.
<P>
	It would be less likely for spouses to take a chance on joint 
custody because of the unpredictability of what their obligations 
might be.
<P>
	As I mentioned, this is the best approach. Yet this legislation 
would penalize those who would potentially want to take this best 
approach of joint custody. It would penalize those who would look 
at their responsibilities of shared parenting with the greatest 
importance. Those who want to contribute most in the co-parenting 
process would actually be discouraged from doing so.
<P>
	What is the purpose of the Divorce Act? I would like to say that 
it is to protect the best interests of the child in difficult 
circumstances. It is to protect strong family ties and try to keep a 
connection with those ties and with those family members both in 
the process and after the process of divorce.
<P>
	This takes me to my final point, rethinking the whole divorce 
process. A recommendation of the law society would remove the 
adversarial approach. I say that the process needs change. The 
process should go to a unified family court. The process, to be 
optimum, should go to compulsory mediation that would force 
communication rather than adversarial approaches. It would 
protect the best interests of the child by putting connection between 
the members who are going through divorce.
<P>
	The Liberal version is big government, unbalanced 
responsibilities and rights and a blindness to the child's best 
interests. We need a balance to the roles of parents, equal treatment 
of the spouses, valuing the role of parents and making government 
accountable for its actions and motivations.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honour to speak in support of Bill C-41. I encourage all members to 
support the legislation.
<P>
	I say with the greatest respect that after listening to the speech of 
hon. colleague from the Reform Party, I think at times we are 
looking at a very different piece of legislation. This bill will make 
support orders more fair. It will make them more consistent. It 
takes into account the income of both parents.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Have you read it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Knutson:</B> I have read it. It helps with dispute resolution at a 
very difficult time. It is in the best interests of children that the 
legislation go ahead.
<P>
	I would like to emphasize that Canadians, regardless of what 
political party they support, or what part of the country they are 
from, share some fundamental values. One is that children should 
come first. All of us in the House acknowledge that children, by the 
very nature of their childhood, are vulnerable and powerless and 
that their interests should be put first and foremost in every piece of 
legislation affecting children. That is what this legislation does.
<P>
	Those values make up an important part of providing the 
framework for the legislation. The legislation will provide 
adequate and consistent child support levels. Those values should 
respect fathers who make their payments and make sure that those 
who are obliged to pay actually do.
<P>
	The starting point for understanding this legislation is to 
understand that the Canadian family has changed dramatically over 
the last 20 years. I agree with the sentiment of the Reform Party 
that oftentimes those changes are not for the better. I do not think 
any of us are particularly comfortable with the rise in family 
break-up and divorce.
<P>
	Over the past 20 years families headed by an individual parent 
have doubled in number. There are almost one million such 
families in Canada. In 1990, 61 per cent of single parent families 
headed by women lived below the poverty line. That is an 
extremely difficult social problem. It is not the fault of government 
per se, it is a combination of a number of factors. But government 
needs to address the issue.
<P>
	The poverty level for single parent families headed by women is 
at 61 per cent compared with just 10 per cent for two parent 
families with children. While the steps taken in this bill will not 
end child poverty, they are an important part of the Liberal 
government's program to try to alleviate child poverty.
<P>
	This measure derives its value from shared principles that we 
have as Canadians. First is the principle that children should be 
first in line. These reforms will put them there and keep them there. 
Child support is the first obligation of parents.
<P>
	Second is the principle that a child's standard of living both 
before and after divorce should reflect the means of both parents. 
These reforms make sure that it does. Children are a shared 
responsibility of both the mother and father and the income of both 
parents should be taken into account. A divorce does not change 
that.
<P>
	Third is the principle that people in like circumstances should be 
treated in like fashion. The guidelines mentioned by my hon. 
colleague are a core part of this legislation. They will ensure that a 
couple with children who are getting divorced in British Columbia 
and are in virtually the same circumstances as a couple getting 
divorced in Ontario will by and large pay the same amount of 
support for their children.
<P>
	The strategy that the government has adopted has four 
interdependent elements. We are introducing child support 
guidelines to establish appropriate and consistent support levels 
and reduce the degree of conflict between separating parents. 
Anyone who has first hand knowledge of a divorce knows that it 
can be extremely acrimonious and at the end of the day children 
ultimately are the losers.
<P>
	The government is also changing the way the child support 
payments are taxed to make things fairer and simpler. Furthermore, 
it is enhancing federal and provincial enforcement measures 
targeted at the wilful defaulters. We are helping working poor 
families by doubling the level of the working income supplement 
of the federal child tax benefit over the next two years. I would like 
to talk about each of these items in a little more detail.
<P>
	First is the guidelines. As mentioned in my opening remarks, the 
guidelines are about consistency. We all know and I think agree 
that consistency is a fundamental part of justice. At the heart of this 
approach, the guidelines will be used across Canada by the courts, 
by lawyers and by parents to establish appropriate levels of support 
payments for children. At present, courts determine support 
payment levels on a case by case basis. Too often they are 
inconsistent and it means that somewhere Canadian children are 
the losers.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	The issue of the lack of consistency prolongs litigation and adds 
to the anguish of parents. Unfortunately, not all  judges take the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6210"> 6210 </A></B>
<P>
same approach or have the same philosophy. As a result, levels 
vary greatly not just across Canada but even from family to family.
<P>
	The amount that is available to pay for a child's needs should not 
depend on which province one lives in or to which court room the 
case is assigned or which party has the more persuasive lawyer. 
The guidelines will establish without the need for a trial the levels 
of child support to be paid according to the income of the person 
paying. The amounts are calculated by a formula that takes into 
account average expenditures on children at various income levels. 
If income levels increase or decrease so will the parent's 
contributions to the needs of children, just as they would be if the 
family had remained together.
<P>
	The guidelines are standard but they are also flexible. They 
allow for particular circumstances, such as child care costs and 
uninsured medical expenses to be taken into account when 
assessing the award. Furthermore, a court can also change the 
amounts if undue hardship can be established.
<P>
	This approach has tremendous strengths. It is simple and it is 
standard. It ensures that support paying parents with the same level 
of income will pay the same amount of child support.
<P>
	Second, I would like to deal with the issue of tax treatment. As 
most of us know, the change we are making has been controversial. 
I support the changes to the tax treatment for a number of reasons. 
Currently child support payments are tax deductible for the payer 
and taxable for the recipient. This rule was put in place 54 years 
ago and it needs to be changed.
<P>
	Child support is not income for the parent but is money intended 
for children and as such it should not be taxed. While I am not 
divorced, when I spend money on my children it is not tax 
deductible. If I were to become divorced why should it become tax 
deductible if it was sent to an ex-wife?
<P>
	Even when incomes are different, the courts often times do not 
take into account the tax liability. Therefore, by making this rule it 
will be taken out of the equation.
<P>
	The no deduction, no inclusion approach will not come into 
effect until May 1, 1997. It will apply to all new awards made after 
that date but it will not apply after that date to existing awards 
unless parties agree or unless a court directs that the changes be 
made. By waiting 14 months, Canadians everywhere, as well as the 
provincial governments, are being given the time to adjust to these 
new rules.
<P>
	The second most important part of the bill is the area of 
enforcement. The guidelines or any law for that matter are 
absolutely useless if we do not have the appropriate enforcement in 
place to make the law work.
<P>
	Let me make it clear from the outset that I acknowledge that the 
vast majority of parents make their  payments on time and deserve 
our respect. These parents take their responsibility seriously and 
they follow through. I want to point out emphatically that this bill 
is about the chronic defaulter and the enforcement provisions in it 
will apply to people who are far too many in number but by and 
large are not typical of the majority.
<P>
	Wilful and chronic default by people who can pay but refuse to 
pay child support is simply unacceptable. The bill will do a number 
of things. Let me just mention a few of them. Federal legislation 
will authorize us to suspend federal licences and certificates such 
as passports in cases of persistent default. The provinces will be 
allowed access to the database of Revenue Canada to help trace 
persistent defaulters. Money and effort will be invested in 
upgrading computer systems to share information among the 
provinces to help in co-ordinating their efforts.
<P>
	Some of these measures may seem particularly harsh, but when 
one looks at the consequences of defaulting parents and the 
negative effects it has on children and the fact that often the family 
in which these children live have to go to food banks and incur the 
negative effects of poverty, these measures are appropriate.
<P>
	The fourth pillar in our child support strategy is the doubling of 
the working income supplement. I take a particular amount of pride 
in this measures in because I was part of a group that lobbied the 
government to double the working income supplement. When the 
working income supplement was brought in by the previous 
government it was placed at $500. It is a tax free benefit that goes 
to working families with an approximate net income of $25,000.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	It recognizes that sometimes there is a cost when someone 
moves off welfare into the work force. It gives people an extra 
incentive to move off welfare and into the work force. The 
government has decided to double it to $1,000 and I applaud it for 
doing that.
<P>
	I would like to point out that the working income supplement is 
tax free and will go right to the bottom line for families who need 
dollars for their children. It is distributed fairly, benefiting children 
of separated families and families that remain intact. It is targeted 
to those most in need.
<P>
	In conclusion, these guidelines will ensure consistent awards at 
the appropriate levels with diminished conflict and expenses. A tax 
rule that reflects the social conditions and the values of 1942 will 
be changed to conform to current needs.
<P>
	Effective tools will enhance enforcement so that the people who 
make their payments will know that those in wilful default will be 
pursued. Every dollar of increased revenue that Ottawa derives 
from the tax changes will be ploughed directly back into the system 
for the benefit of  children in low income working families. I ask 
all members to support this bill.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the speech made by my Liberal colleague. 
There is an issue on which I would like to hear his opinion because 
he did not address it. As we know, the Liberal government often 
claims to recognize Quebec's distinctiveness. It says it adopted 
certain motions to that effect and even accuses the Bloc Quebecois, 
the official opposition, of complaining for no reason since, finally, 
the Liberals are recognizing Quebec's distinctiveness.
<P>
	As far as Bill C-41, an act to amend the Divorce Act, is 
concerned, everyone knows that, one, the Constitution gives the 
federal government jurisdiction in this area and, two, Quebec has 
some very special demands. We know that the National Assembly 
would have liked to be consulted more extensively. It particularly 
wanted the federal government to specify in the clause dealing with 
guidelines that it would recognize any guidelines adopted by the 
National Assembly.
<P>
	I am asking the hon. member opposite, whose Liberal 
government likes to brag about its recognition of Quebec's 
distinctiveness, if he agrees that, if the government really cared 
about this, it would have provided for Quebec's distinctiveness in 
Bill C-41.
<P>
	Why does this bill not provide for Quebec's special legislation? 
Yes, it deals with divorce, but it is mainly concerned with children. 
The main purpose of Bill C-41 is to protect children, to pursue a 
family policy Quebec is developing, as we clearly saw last 
weekend.
<P>
	I am asking the hon. member why Bill C-41 does not make 
special provision for Quebec's distinctiveness?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Knutson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for his 
question. I would like to make a couple of points. The way his 
question came over the translation it was why does the federal 
government not bind itself legally and put it in the bill?
<P>
	I would like to remind the hon. member that the only way the 
federal government can bind itself is by changing the Constitution. 
The government cannot bind future Parliaments.
<P>
	If the hon. member would like to engage in a discussion on how 
we should change the Constitution to deal with these issues, I 
would be fully prepared to have that discussion with him. From 
what I understand, it is the position of the Bloc Quebecois and the 
Parti Quebecois that they are not interested in a constitutional 
question.
<P>
	The issue also raises a broader point. In the current Canadian 
federal system two people can move in together, not get married, 
have children and become  separated. The rules that apply to their 
separation and how the children are dealt with are all within 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	We can have two other people who happen to get married and 
have children and yet the rules that apply concerning their children 
when they break up are dealt with under the federal system. That 
does not seem to make a lot of sense these days. It should be dealt 
with constitutionally.
<P>
	I would invite members opposite to enter into a discussion of 
how we can change the Constitution while taking fully into account 
the distinct society in Quebec. We could try to find a way to make 
the country work better for all Canadians, including all Canadian 
children.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. As you 
know, members of Parliament, other than by the usage of the bells, 
are not notified of when votes take place in the House. This is 
especially of concern to members of Parliament who do not belong 
to a particular caucus. There are some 15 of them in the House of 
Commons. These members of Parliament are not advised.
<P>
	My office called the clerk's department and there is no procedure 
in place for those members of Parliament to be told when a vote 
takes place and, in my view, that affects the ability of these 
members to adequately represent their constituents.
<P>
	We are about to vote on a matter and I am not aware of what the 
nature of that matter is.

it gives the time of the vote for tonight.
<P>
	I appreciate that sometimes that does not happen. The member is 
quite right that sometimes there is no indication of a vote, other 
than the bells. I appreciate the point he has made to the House.

	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-214, an 
act to provide for improved information on the cost of proposed 
government programs, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to start debate 
on Bill C-214.
<P>
	The people want to turn the light on the departments of 
government that are spending their money. They want to be part of 
the process of government spending and not merely the recipients 
of the bills through income taxes after the money is spent. They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6213"> 6213 </A></B>
<P>
want to return to the  origins of taxation when individuals gave 
their specific consent to be taxed.
<P>
	Many look in mystery as they study their weekly pay cheques. 
They are mystified that so much is gobbled up by taxation and they 
are at a loss to understand how they were part of a process that 
allowed this to happen.
<P>
	Over 55 per cent of our total personal income is accounted for by 
all forms of taxation, from income taxes, sales taxes, payroll taxes 
and municipal taxes. Government expenditure is a great confusion 
to the public. It is an attempt to clarify and shed light on this 
darkness which my bill before us tonight addresses. The whole 
concept of taxation was originally based on consent, the consent to 
be taxed for things which we considered common good, for 
example sidewalks, snow removal and armies.
<P>
	I have practised as a tax advisor to many Canadians and not just 
the wealthy but also those to whom I have donated my time. The 
common theme was did we consent to this level of taxation. Why is 
it important and why have we succumbed to this state of affairs 
when Canada's tax rates are the second highest in the western 
world? Graduates of Waterloo university are encouraged to leave 
the country because of a promise of lower tax regimes south of the 
border.
<P>
	Did people rationally weigh the cost of programs which have 
pushed us to this dilemma? Indeed there are those who think by 
simply balancing the annual deficit it is good enough, as if we 
should continue to carry a mortgage of this magnitude forever.
<P>
	What has caused us to create a deficit of over $600 billion? How 
can we prevent this situation from repeating itself? This is the real 
purpose of Bill C-214. People have lived in the dark over the cost 
of government programs. This does not mean we should turn every 
citizen into a bookkeeper or an accountant. We have to do away 
with a thought process that someone else is paying the bills.
<P>
	I often encountered this philosophy in my professional life. 
People thought it was their next door neighbour who was paying for 
programs and not them. The reality of course is that nothing is for 
free and in one way or another we are all contributors. People want 
to get out of the darkness and turn on the light.
<P>
	This is the purpose of this legislation. We have bureaucrats who 
spend endless hours studying government programs. Indeed 
recently in the October report from the Treasury Board the minister 
stated: ``We must equip ourselves with better systems for 
evaluating the actions of government so that we can genuinely 
answer for our actions, first and foremost to our fellow citizens 
who are both clients and taxpayers''.
<P>
	Our government has come a long way in bringing fiscal 
responsibility back to government, from an annualized deficit of 
$44 billion down to $17 billion. We are on the road to financial 
responsibility.
<P>
	The problem that gave rise to the original issue has not been 
solved. Simply put, everyday people did not understand the process 
or consent to the process that removed over 55 per cent of their 
disposable income. I suggest that because of this lack of consent we 
have watched a burgeoning underground economy and people 
taking their investments offshore.
<P>
	Thomas Jefferson stated the people are collectively wise. That is 
why I believe this legislation will turn the lights on for those who 
pay the bills. It will allow them to be included.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	This bill will not give everybody an economic overview of 
government but it will encapsulate the costs of specific legislation. 
It will make the information readily available to the public and to 
parliamentarians. Think of it, a bill that would shed light on the 
back rooms of Ottawa where people spend our money.
<P>
	Members of Parliament jump up and down here all week long. 
They vote on legislation when many have not the slightest idea of 
its fiscal impact on individuals and the economy in general. This is 
because this information is not readily available. This legislation 
would empower them. It would give them more information and 
make them more effective in representing their constituents. 
Accountability is what it is all about. The public is clamouring for 
it and who are we to deny its rights?
<P>
	The critics of this bill state two basic objections, that the process 
itself will increase the cost of government and it will inhibit the 
legislative agenda of the government. First, the government has 
prided itself on its program evaluation system which analyses the 
cost benefits of government programs. This is part of a program 
known as program review. The tool for doing this is a process 
called expenditure management systems. This is all very well and 
good as far as it goes.
<P>
	The problem is all of this examines costs and benefits which 
have already occurred. Clearly knowing that programs have been 
efficient or otherwise is useful but the taxpayer will already be 
stuck with the bill. We are spending millions of dollars to conduct 
this after the fact review. It would make more sense to bring this 
examination process forward to the initial stage of legislation.
<P>
	There is no question that with a greater degree of financial 
control and scrutiny the government will save more money than 
any incremental cost of having bureaucrats cost legislation prior to 
its introduction as opposed to after it is in full swing. Simple 
common sense tells us that better cost efficient decisions are made 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6214"> 6214 </A></B>
<P>
when  people assess them prior to their commencement than after 
the costs have been incurred.
<P>
	A press release that was issued this morning by the Canadian 
Federation of Taxpayers states: ``Taxpayers could save billions of 
dollars if the House of Commons votes to pass Bill C-214, the 
program cost declaration act, introduced by the member for 
Durham, to be voted on today''-which is not quite true-``at 
second reading. It would require government departments to 
provide a cost analysis for each new bill''. The federation has 
stated that billions of dollars could be saved for the taxpayers of 
Canada.
<P>
	Second is the concern that this will inhibit the legislative 
process. It seems to me this argument goes back to regimes of the 
past. Nobody would go down to a car lot, look over the car, agree to 
purchase it, drive it away and say ``send me the bill'' without 
knowing the cost, and neither should government. This is the whole 
point of this legislation.
<P>
	Past governments have promised us all kinds of programs 
without fully informing us of their costs. A quick look at the state 
of affairs of the Canada pension plan would leave anyone to 
conclude that not taking the time or effort to anticipate cost has 
now led us to a place where we have to make some pretty drastic 
decisions which will not only affect the younger generations but 
also some who thought their immediate retirement incomes were 
secure. What degree of participation did people have in all of this 
anyway?
<P>
	It is hard to understand how someone could argue the point of 
hindrance to the legislative process. It should be part of the 
legislative process and people should have a right to know.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	These are not the issues of the rich but rather the poor and the 
disenfranchised. As we go through a period of retrenchment of 
fiscal priorities, many of the poor will be negatively affected. It is 
to the loss of some of these social programs that this bill directs 
itself, to the fact that after years of economic expansion that 
government has extended itself well beyond what it is able to 
sustain.
<P>
	Indeed, the auditor general has gone on at length about whether 
our current levels of deficit are sustainable. That is to say at what 
point can governments no longer shoulder the cost of servicing the 
debt? If we have a mortgage on every single Canadian, as our 
government does, surely these same people have a right to see what 
the costs are. More important, they want some assurance that we 
are not going to return to the errors of the past.
<P>
	This bill does simply two things. First, it requires that the fiscal 
impact of new legislation be included in a bill at the same time it is 
presented in this House. This also extends to the regulations of 
departments.
<P>
	Second, it requires that the auditor general certify that the 
method of cost evaluation was fair and reasonable. I would like to 
underline this matter. The auditor general is only certifying that the 
method is correct. He or she has no political interference in the 
worthiness of programs but simply whether the method used to 
arrive at the estimated costs was reasonable under the 
circumstances. I suggest that the parallel in the private sector 
would be the certification of prospectuses.
<P>
	Like the expenditures in the management system that we now 
have in place, the role of the auditor general is what is known as ex 
post. By this I mean he examines costs after they occur. Some of 
our listeners would equate this to closing the barn door after the 
horse is out.
<P>
	This is the whole point of moving this process forward in time. It 
is small comfort for taxpayers and citizens generally to discover 
wasteful spending three years after the fact. It only makes them less 
trustful of their elected officials and government generally. They 
certainly feel they had no part in the decision making.
<P>
	By costing legislation prior to its initiation, taxpayers and 
citizens generally will have available to them the tools by which to 
judge. It will be up to members of Parliament to justify whether the 
cost is justified relative to the benefits to be derived. This clearly is 
what democracy is all about. It makes people part of the decision 
making of government financing.
<P>
	I have always had much respect for the people who work for the 
Treasury Board and also those in finance. I have often thought they 
were much like a lopsided hockey team where they were the 
goaltenders and every other department was the offence, all trying 
to score, and score means budget allocations.
<P>
	This is why I find it hard to understand why some of them are 
reticent to accept this degree of accountability. It seems to me that 
with the support of the general public they will be in a better 
position to stop the pucks of the spenders of the future. This is the 
problem. Many legislators equate a zero annual deficit with the end 
of the story. This legislation would make legislators more 
cognizant of the cost effects on the general public. Turn the lights 
on. This is what taxpayers and citizens demand.
<P>
	Here is what some people are saying about the bill. I have some 
quotations here. The Auditor General of Canada said: ``We share 
your view that the cost of government programs and operations 
should be made more visible to Parliament and taxpayers''. ``I am 
pleased to inform you that the Certified General Accountant's 
Association of Ontario fully supports your private member's bill. 
Your initiative accords with the CGA's Ontario Board of Governors 
requirements that all action items presented to the board must be 
accompanied by an explanation of financial implications''.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6215"> 6215 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	Another quote: ``Mr. Shepherd's bill is a good first kick at the 
can and deserves the consideration of all members of Parliament''. 
That was said by James Forrest of the Alberta Taxpayers' 
Association.
<P>
	``I commend you for presenting the right type of legislation 
which will help the public to understand where their hard earned 
tax dollars are being spent''. That is a quote from the president of 
the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. I could go on 
with the list but obviously time will not permit.
<P>
	We talk a lot about our youth and it is truly the younger 
generation that will inherit our nation and propel it into the next 
millennium. Saddling our youth with debts, which they did not 
incur, will tie their hands. Governments are struggling with this 
reality as we move toward a more responsible fiscal framework.
<P>
	It is also appropriate that we conduct a post mortem. That does 
not mean that we are dead, but it certainly means that financially 
we are very much on the ground. When we conduct this port 
mortem we must ask ourselves how this situation occurred in the 
first place and ensure that we cure the disease so that it will not 
happen again. That is what my bill attempts to do.
<P>
	We need to give people the tools to make conscious choices 
about government policy. Our younger generation will accept 
nothing else. It is to these people that we address the need for a 
more consensual form of government.
<P>
	This is the day after the U.S. election. I was in the United States 
on the weekend and I actually took part in some of the 
electioneering. I stopped people on the street and I knocked on 
doors. The mood was: ``They are nothing but a bunch of crooks. It 
really does not matter anyway''. Corrupt election financing 
practices, together with the fact that people cannot see how they 
would count, has brought their voter turnout to less than 50 per 
cent. Imagine, more than half the population of the so-called 
strongest nation in the world do not consent to their government.
<P>
	It is this issue which this legislation addresses here in Canada. 
Turn on the lights and let the people decide. Include them in the 
decision making process. To do otherwise is to court divisiveness 
and exclusivity which may well lead to violence.
<P>
	I have studied many regimes in Australia, Great Britain and the 
Netherlands that are all moving in the direction of providing more 
accountability for the actions of government to the people. Think 
about it. Every piece of legislation that comes before the House 
would have a cost attached to it. Some in the bureaucracy are going 
to say it is very difficult to do. But the reality is that we already 
have an evaluation and internal system of calculating the cost of 
programs. It simply means moving  the thought process up a little 
bit closer to the legislative process.
<P>
	How can we as legislators go around the country talking about 
various pieces of legislation without understanding the full impact 
it will have on the economy and on government spending? As I 
researched this issue in other countries, I found that other 
parliamentarians were doing much of what I am suggesting: 
moving in the general area of greater accountability, greater 
awareness of the programs for the general public.
<P>
	There is nothing unusual about any of the things I am suggesting. 
It is done in business every day. I am not saying that government is 
a business. It is not. We have a very different social purpose here. 
But government needs to be run a little bit more like a business. 
People have to know the costs.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	My fear is that even though we are going down the road of 
financial and fiscal responsibility and we have moved the ship of 
state, if you will, maybe 10 degrees on the course where we want to 
go, there are people who will move it back the other way and we 
will be off course again. People want to be part of the process. They 
want to be involved in the process that allows them to make 
judgments on how governments spend.
<P>
	People are not going to sit down with a calculator and figure out 
how much every piece of legislation impacts them, which is why I 
have included a clause that says: ``divided by the population 
statistics''. That way, everyone will know exactly how much every 
piece of legislation costs him or her.
<P>
	This could be a good thing. This is not a negative thing for 
government programs. It could well be a good thing. For instance, 
we may find that the cost of day care, if we extrapolate it over our 
population base, is really quite small. People would have a greater 
degree of acceptance of that if they saw that it was a small cost on 
an individual basis. On the other hand, there would be those 
programs that people would not think were particularly cost 
effective. They would be able to make those kind of judgment calls.
<P>
	There will be those people who could not care less. They will not 
use the information at all but the bottom line is that they will have 
the ability to do so.
<P>
	The longer I sit in this House and the more legislation I see come 
by, I cannot figure out what the financial impact of it is at all. I feel 
it is really part of my responsibility, as a legislator, to know that 
and to explain it to my constituents. I do not feel that I have the 
ability to do that with the present legislative format.
<P>
	Finally in summary, just simply turn the lights on here in 
Ottawa.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Durham, a Liberal member, has put forward Bill 
C-214, a bill to provide for improved information on the cost of 
proposed government programs.
<P>
	The hon. member for Durham, who sat on the Standing 
Committee on Public Accounts as vice-chairman, is very interested 
in any administrative or legislative measure that would make the 
government more responsible or accountable for the enormous 
amounts taxpayers invest every year in the federal public service.
<P>
	I want to assure the hon. member of my support in requiring the 
estimated annual cost and cost per capita of every new program be 
published as soon as the bill that authorizes it is introduced in 
Parliament or the regulation that implements it is issued.
<P>
	The bill also requires that the auditor general be called upon to 
determine whether the method of calculation is valid and the cost is 
a good estimate. This assessment and the method to calculate the 
estimated cost used by the auditor general would go a long way to 
reassure the public on the objectivity of the calculations and cost 
estimate.
<P>
	To increase public awareness of the actual cost of government 
programs and enhance transparency, as promised by the Prime 
Minister during the last election campaign, transparency that never 
really materialized, this bill also requires the total cost and cost per 
capital of each program to be displayed at any place where the 
program is delivered to the public.
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-214 is to require all departments to 
provide detailed financial or cost analyses for any new legislative 
measure.
<P>
	Estimating these costs on a per capita basis will help individual 
citizens understand more clearly how much each new piece of 
legislation costs them personally, how much is actually taken out of 
their pockets each time the government put a new program in place.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	This bill will make legislators and public service officials more 
aware of the financial impact of various legislative measures. It 
will also encourage the public to pay closer attention to 
government spending.
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member for Durham, when he says that, had 
such a legislation been in place in the past, the debt burden facing 
the taxpayers would have been much lower today.
<P>
	I sympathize with the hon. member for Durham. His background 
and personal experience, as well as his work at the public accounts 
committee level, have all contributed to leading him to put Bill 
C-214 before this House. However, while he has our support, the 
problem  for the hon. member, who sincerely wants to prevent the 
setting up of programs that are useless and too costly, is that his 
own government, his own party turns a deaf ear to his bill.
<P>
	Indeed, the cost of government programs is the least of the 
Liberal's worries. Since the days of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the 
Liberal Party of Canada has buried Canadians under a mountain of 
debts, and the current Prime Minister is carrying on the tradition. 
The notion of cost-benefit analysis is a foreign to this government 
as its understanding of Quebec is flawed or, for that matter, the 
existence of two distinct peoples in Canada and the partnership that 
could exist between them. This Liberal government's 
constitutional policy is based on confrontation. The Liberals prefer 
covering up to transparency and to analyzing the real costs of 
government programs.
<P>
	For these reasons, Bill C-214 stands little chance of being 
supported by the hon. member's own party, even though such 
legislation is urgently required.
<P>
	A good illustration of the Liberals lack of support for Bill C-214 
is an E-mail note we received in which the Liberal member for 
Bruce-Grey writes the following to his colleague for Durham, and I 
quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``While I find the objective of the bill laudable, I am concerned 
that it could prove to be costly and cumbersome, particularly if 
applied to all new programming proposals regardless of 
materiality''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	While cost estimating is the very basis of the evaluation of any 
new product or service in the private sector, the Liberal member for 
Bruce-Grey tells us that estimating the cost of any new program 
would be too costly when we do not know whether the program will 
actually be implemented. The member for Bruce-Grey seems to be 
implying that it is better to implement a new program without 
knowing its costs, then to know the costs of a new program whose 
financial impact would lead us not to implement it.
<P>
	Such is the Liberal philosophy: it is better to not know the costs 
of a new program, because this information could arouse the 
suspicions of the media, of the opposition parties and of the 
taxpayers, who would strongly object to its implementation.
<P>
	Better to keep the public in the dark about the real costs of 
programs, and above all to keep the auditor general, with his 
objective and transparent opinion about such information, at a 
distance.
<P>
	We saw this, during hearings of the finance committee on the 
transfer of two billion dollars of Canadian capital tax free to the 
United States. Members of the Liberal majority and the chairman 
of the committee himself tried to put the auditor general on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6217"> 6217 </A></B>
<P>
spot, because he had  dared to give a dissenting opinion on the 
controversial decision by the revenue department and the finance 
minister regarding this unusual transfer of funds to the United 
States.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	The final report by the Standing Committee on Finance, with 
which the Bloc Quebecois was not in agreement-we tabled a 
dissenting report-is devoted largely to trying to refute and 
undermine the auditor general's opinion.
<P>
	As political debate and public morality, we have seen worse. 
Instead of attacking the message, Liberals attack the messenger.
<P>
	At the end of his note to the member for Durham, the Liberal 
member for Bruce-Grey says, and I quote:
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	``With respect to the role of the auditor general, his mandate is 
one of ex-post review. Indeed your proposal may create a conflict 
of interest for his office''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Liberals want to continue to maintain the role of the auditor 
general's office as one of intervening after the fact, when the deed 
is done and taxpayers money has already been committed and 
spent.
<P>
	As for the possibility of conflict of interest in the auditor 
general's role, the Liberals have put themselves in a conflict of 
interest situation for some time by attacking the auditor general 
during hearings of the finance committee and in their subsequent 
committee report to the House. The auditor general is accountable 
only to Parliament, and that is why the Liberals are so afraid of 
him, do not want to extend his mandate and are trying to undermine 
his credibility to diminish the impact of his views. This is petty 
politicking.
<P>
	Bill C-214 presented by the hon. member for Durham, will 
unfortunately not be supported by his own party, because it calls for 
innovation in administration, for transparency-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but the hon. member's time 
has expired.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to 
rise today in this House to speak in favour of Bill C-214 put forth 
by my hon. colleague from Durham.
<P>
	Bill C-214 is an act to provide for improved information on the 
cost of proposed government programs. We as parliamentarians 
need to rethink from time to time not only what we do but also how 
we do it. Bill C-214 will help us to achieve this.
<P>
	This bill will require the estimated annual cost and the cost per 
capita of every new government program to be  published as soon 
as the bill that authorizes it is introduced into Parliament, or the 
regulation that implements it is issued. The auditor general's 
opinion on the estimate is also to be published. It also requires the 
cost and the cost per capita to be displayed in any place where the 
program is to be delivered to the public.
<P>
	When a new program is to be funded from public money, the 
minister responsible must make a declaration of the estimated 
annual cost of the program in each of the first five years of its 
intended operation, expressed as a total cost and as a cost per capita 
for every resident of Canada. This declaration must be made in the 
House of Commons if it is sitting, in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>, in 
writing to every member of Parliament and in a media statement.
<P>
	The Auditor General of Canada will provide an opinion that the 
method of calculation on the cost referred to in this declaration is 
valid and that the cost is a good estimate. If the auditor general 
dissents from that opinion given by the minister, then the reasons 
for the dissent shall be made public by the responsible minister. 
The minister shall also ensure that the program costs are clearly 
displayed at every place where the program is delivered and in 
every document pertaining to the program.
<P>
	This bill has the support of the Certified General Accountants 
Association of Ontario, the Alberta Taxpayers Association, the 
Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, the Society of 
Management Accountants of New Brunswick and Prince Edward 
Island and the Certified General Accountants of New Brunswick. It 
is obvious that this bill is endorsed from coast to coast and for very 
good reason.
<P>
	Members of Parliament must be the stewards of the taxpayers' 
dollars and MPs often cannot understand the financial impact of 
legislation for the simple reason that it may not be presented in a 
clear, concise manner. I believe that Bill C-214 will change this.
<P>
	Over the years the information provided to parliamentarians has 
become very technical and lengthy and deals with mainly short 
term issues. It does not sufficiently help parliamentarians 
understand the relationships between the resources we are 
approving and the financial impact they would have on Canadians 
and the results actually achieved by the program if applicable in 
previous years.
<P>
<B>(1835 )</B>
<P>
	No one will dispute that governments should be accountable to 
the Canadian taxpayers. In fact it is the foundation of our 
parliamentary system of government. The problem with our current 
way of doing business is the timing of that accountability.
<P>
	Most government accountability options focus on after the fact 
methodologies such as evaluation systems. These initiatives 
provide for reporting long after the tax dollars  have been spent. To 
me, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6218"> 6218 </A></B>
<P>
this does not make sense and is questionable at best. The auditor 
general also provides Parliament with that same hindsight analysis.
<P>
	We must look at the issue of control and the understanding of 
cost before moneys are spent. Is this not a logical extenuation of 
accountability to the client or taxpayers? Our constituents deserve 
nothing less.
<P>
	Each piece of legislation should have attached to it the estimated 
impact on government expenditures. Indeed it is a logical extension 
of the current expenditures management system, one which must 
involve the ultimate client: the people of Canada.
<P>
	The provisions requiring publication of the costs and opinions 
about those costs is an excellent initiative. Not only will it provide 
a greater degree of financial scrutiny by the public over their 
elected officials, it will also increase the public awareness of the 
cost of government at all times but especially during periods of 
restraint.
<P>
	I know that some hospitals now issue a statement to the patient 
after being discharged, not for the purpose of payment but to show 
the patient the cost of hospitalization. Raising the awareness of the 
public to programs and services that can be easily taken for granted 
is good. The taxpayers are entitled to see where their money goes 
and conversely they should be shown how much it is costing when 
they themselves access programs and services. Very simply, it is 
accountability.
<P>
	When the board of directors of a corporation is considering a 
new initiative, do they not intensely scrutinize the financial 
implications of the corporation, both in the short term and long 
term? Are we as parliamentarians not the board of directors of this 
great country Canada? Should we not also be making decisions on 
the new initiatives by intense scrutiny of the financial 
implications? The answer is clearly yes, yes, yes.
<P>
	With respect to accountability, the public demands more 
accountability from Parliament. Bill C-214 is one way in which we 
are counting taxpayers and citizens in on the process of evaluation 
before the money is actually spent. People wonder at the deficits 
built up by past governments. How did we get into this horrible 
situation? By making Canadians and parliamentarians partners at 
the point of sale rather than only when the bills come in will help 
prevent or hopefully eliminate escalating deficits in the future.
<P>
	My constituents can look at the per capita cost of a proposed 
project and tell me it is not worth it. Many supporters of an 
initiative in government may look at the cost in black and white 
and decide it is not worth it. We can give Canadians these choices.
<P>
	Our children are the true recipients of any unpaid liabilities and 
the beneficiaries of prudent or imprudent decision making. We owe 
it to that generation to be aware of the costs of programs before we 
initiate them and before we saddle these children with an 
unacceptable financial burden.
<P>
	The forces that would turn government back on the road to fiscal 
irresponsibility are at work today. Our colleagues opposite and 
perhaps members of the bureaucracy are already pondering how to 
spend annualized surpluses even though the deficit stands at over 
$600 billion. This legislation will serve as a check on these forces.
<P>
	Today one of the priorities of the Canadian government is to get 
government right. Getting government right means modernizing 
the way we conduct our business and to include the Canadian 
public as citizens, as clients and as taxpayers. Governments must 
be transparent. Canadians have the right to know and we 
parliamentarians have the responsibility of informing them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to address the Bill C-214 put 
forward by the hon. member for Durham, an act to provide for 
improved information on the cost of proposed government 
programs.
<P>
	Bill C-214 contains several proposals all of which address or 
seek to address the need for accountability in federal spending, 
particularly on government programs. The objective of this bill is 
simple: accountability. This is an issue which must be addressed 
and without question I support this objective. Accountability is 
critical to good government, and unfortunately there is a need for 
accountability within this government.
<P>
	I support this bill in principle and I believe some of the proposals 
contained in this bill merit support. However, there are also many 
areas that must be amended before the bill can be supported in its 
entirety.
<P>
	For example, to make government more accountable, Bill C-214 
proposes that a minister of the crown make a public declaration of 
the cost of each new program funded from public money. This 
public declaration would include the estimated annual cost of the 
program in each of the first five years of its intended operation 
expressed both as a total cost and as a cost per capita for every 
resident of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	Providing annual projections for the first five years of operation 
is a reasonable expectation for new programs. This should be a 
matter of course. However there is a problem. Projections are not 
binding once they are published. There is nothing to ensure that the 
amount published will be the amount spent. One possible solution 
could be an amendment to the bill that would require amendments 
beyond 5 per cent to be announced as well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6219"> 6219 </A></B>
<P>
	The proposal in Bill C-214 to provide estimated costs for each 
program on an annual basis is clearly a good idea. However, I have 
concerns that the proposed cost calculations for each program may 
take the issue too far.
<P>
	Estimating each program as a cost per capita for every resident 
of Canada does not appear to be a necessary or cost effective 
procedure. This proposal would be an inefficient use of 
government money and has the potential to create an unnecessary 
bureaucracy within government.
<P>
	Bill C-214 also proposes that program costs be made available in 
the House of Commons if it is sitting at the time, by publication in 
the <I>Canada Gazette</I>, a letter to each and every member of 
Parliament and a statement to the media if the House is not sitting 
at that time. I fully support this proposal. In fact, this proposal 
should be strengthened so that the minister's statement to the 
media is not limited to periods when the House of Commons is not 
sitting. The public should be informed each and every time a new 
program is proposed.
<P>
	Another concern I have is that Bill C-214 proposes that 
following each new program declaration, the auditor general 
should provide to the minister responsible for the program an 
analysis of the cost proposal. The main purpose of the auditor 
general is to report on how federal government departments and 
agencies spend taxpayers' money. The role of the auditor general in 
providing a measure of accountability between the government and 
the people cannot be underemphasized. On first sight, the proposal 
to have the auditor general evaluate the cost for each new program 
may appear valid. However, this is not necessarily a good idea for 
the following reasons.
<P>
	I have concerns that such a proposal will create unnecessary 
work for the auditor general. The independence of the auditor 
general gives him the freedom to criticize and to form independent 
assessments on how things are working. There is clearly a risk of 
overloading the auditor general. Forcing many small projects on 
him and his department as proposed in this bill would hinder the 
auditor general from examining more significant issues.
<P>
	Such a proposal also steps on the independence of the auditor 
general. He must be allowed to use his own judgment in choosing 
which areas to report on. Government must not legislate the auditor 
general to evaluate specific programs.
<P>
	However, if we wish to be more accountable, we must make 
changes that allow the auditor general more freedom to report on 
government spending. The auditor general should have access to 
reporting on the costs of all government programs and initiatives, 
including crown corporations and the Senate.
<P>
	The auditor general provides a very valuable service to 
Canadians and to parliamentarians. As it stands, he only  has 
limited
<P>
jurisdiction as to what he can now report on. If Canadian tax dollars 
are funding it, then the auditor general should be able to investigate 
it. It should be that basic.
<P>
	Bill C-214 also proposes ``that program costs be clearly and 
publicly displayed at every place under the jurisdiction of or 
contracted to the Government of Canada at which the program is 
delivered and in every document in which the minister or a person 
acting with the authority of the minister undertakes to deliver to 
any person a good or service under the program''.
<P>
	Although I agree with the principle of this idea, I have concerns 
that this procedure may also run into unnecessarily high expenses 
that may not be essential. I suggest we maintain the principle of the 
proposal, yet it should be revised with a more realistic goal.
<P>
	Costs of programs and initiatives must be public and accountable 
to the public, but how far we should go in this respect needs to be 
discussed in depth. As it stands, Canadians have been left out of the 
picture for too long. Canadians do not find out about the cost of 
programs until they are already established and by then the money 
is committed.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-214 must be applauded for its efforts to make 
governments inform Canadians. This is a step in the right direction 
and it is good to see it coming from the other side of the House.
<P>
	Governments clearly must be accountable to the people. 
Canadians need to know what the costs are. After all, they are the 
ones who are paying for the programs in the first place.
<P>
	Certainly costs of advertising must be balanced against the 
extent of advertising. The proposal in this bill appears to go too far 
in advertising the costs with too little concern for the cost of doing 
so. A balanced approach is needed, as both sides of the issue must 
be addressed.
<P>
	Government fiscal policies must be open and within the scrutiny 
of the general public. The minister of heritage's complete lack of 
accountability with her flag money is a typical example of the kind 
of mismanagement and utter lack of accountability that goes on in 
this government, and this type of irresponsibility must be brought 
to an end. Spending millions of tax dollars without a clue of where 
the money is coming from is utterly irresponsible.
<P>
	Another issue is our debt, which is out of control. Canadians 
want to know where their money is being spent. The member for 
Durham, in his move toward accountability, is moving clearly in 
the right direction.
<P>
	Canadians want to know what they are paying for. Canadians 
deserve to know what is going on in Parliament, in its departments 
and in its crown agencies. Yet time and time again this government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6220"> 6220 </A></B>
<P>
has voted down initiatives that would give Canadians open and 
accountable government.
<P>
	For example, if this government is truly committed to open 
government as it claims, it would open all crown corporations to 
the Access to Information Act.
<P>
	Last week I asked the minister of public works to open Canada 
Post to the public by putting it under the Freedom of Information 
Act and to the scrutiny of the auditor general, but the minister 
responsible for Canada Post refused. The government's refusal to 
open crown corporations to the public makes its commitment to 
open and transparent government somewhat hollow.
<P>
	As well, there is complete lack of accountability in the Senate. 
The Senate continues to spend over $40 million a year with 
absolutely no accountability to the taxpayers who pay its way. 
Actions must be taken, yet this government voted down a motion 
that would require the Senate to account for its spending to the 
elected members within this House.
<P>
	The government voted for the Senate budget of over $40 million 
without knowing how the money would be spent. This is very poor 
accountability.
<P>
	Open government means not only opening the finances of 
government to the people but conducting the affairs of government 
above board. Open government and accountability are the two 
main principles within this bill. I believe the member is right on 
track when he attempts to target these areas.
<P>
	The member sees there is a lack of accountability and openness 
in his government and is doing his bit to address the situation.
<P>
	In conclusion, I support the member in his efforts and, as such, I 
will support this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
support a good friend, a good colleague and a damn good bill which 
has been presented to this House, Bill C-214, the program cost 
declaration act.
<P>
	The member for Durham probably needs no introduction to 
parliamentarians, but I think it is of note the work he has done on 
public accounts and the work he has done hither to his hopefully 
very long career as a politician, including many years as a 
chartered accountant and a very fine, upstanding man in terms of 
the community of Durham.
<P>
	I speak with some knowledge, although he is not my chartered 
accountant. I can assure members that many people speak very 
highly of him. Any member whose dentist goes by the last name 
McTeague has to know something about his clients.
<P>
	Mirth aside, the bill deals very specifically with a concern that 
Canadians have. The concern is that when we decide to move or to 
allow supply, when legislation is provided, we seem never to be 
able to provide people with an opportunity of knowing just how 
much that legislation is going to cost.
<P>
	I therefore commend the member of Parliament for having the 
foresight and the experience in terms of his committee work to be 
able to present a bill which I think a lot of members of Parliament 
on both sides of the House are expressing they will support.
<P>
<B>(1850 )</B>
<P>
	We realize that the bill is only in second reading and therefore 
only in its first hour of debate. There will be two more hours of 
debate. I look forward to listening to other members of Parliament 
as they provide their views on the bill.
<P>
	It is important to point out that the committee will hopefully also 
be able to address the amendments that were suggested, for 
example, by my hon. colleague from the Reform Party. I cannot 
help but remark that while the member from the Reform Party 
rightfully supports the bill, he took the opportunity to talk a bit 
about the Senate. I was quite amazed to note yesterday that the 
Reform Party was not willing to join in a motion by other members 
to remove the section that would deal with abrogating or removing 
the Senate.
<P>
	The public has demanded greater transparency from us. It is a 
slogan for many of us. As we go into campaigns we talk about the 
need for making sure that people understand how much programs 
and legislation will cost.
<P>
	I believe this bill squares with the public expectations, certainly 
in an era where there is justified or perhaps even unjustified 
cynicism toward how politicians and governments spend money.
<P>
	The hon. member for Durham who presented the bill has pointed 
out that we are currently in a situation of being $600 billion in debt. 
Some of that, I am sure, is the result of changes in the economic 
climate, governments not being able to change with the times and 
the result of great adjustments that have necessitated the 
government to incur such a debt.
<P>
	But that does not relinquish us from our responsibility of 
providing the kinds of instruments that will allow the public and 
politicians greater scrutiny on the bills that they pass from time to 
time. Having had 18 votes in this Chamber last evening, it would be 
good to know the quantum effect of how much those bills will 
impact on our ability to make ends meet at the end of the day.
<P>
	The hon. member from Durham who proposed this, whose riding 
happens to be beside mine, talked about the importance of 
inclusion, the importance of providing people a real opportunity for 
participation. That does not mean that people necessarily will take 
an interest in every single bill. But it allows one dimension of 
information which allows a democracy to survive in a very trying 
time. As we approach the 21st century an informed citizenry may 
avail itself of very important  information. That is why I believe the 
member's bill is not only timely in the context of the deficit and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6221"> 6221 </A></B>
<P>
debt situation we have, but it is also timely because the public 
expects us to do this.
<P>
	Right now there is every indication that there is something 
lacking when we talk about an underground economy. According to 
some estimates by the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business we are losing somewhere in the order of as much as $100 
billion a year because people are looking for alternatives. Some 
people have low faith in the system and the way their tax money is 
dealt with that they believe the best way to get around it is to cheat 
the system.
<P>
	I think that is a rather sad indictment on the situation we find 
ourselves in. It makes the job of the revenue minister and in 
particular the finance minister almost impossible if not elusive. We 
have to bring Canadians back on side. How we do that is to provide 
them absolute, open, honest, up front probate information so that 
they can judge for themselves how the money is spent and ensure 
their members of Parliament are accountable. In that way it would 
make my job as a member of Parliament much easier to say to 
those engaged in the underground economy, given the importance 
of this bill and that it might someday be enacted, they have 
absolutely no reason to hurt their fellow Canadians by simply 
withholding or not paying taxes due.
<P>
	This is what Parliament can do to bring people back on board and 
address the cynicism that exists out there.
<P>
	This may also, as the hon. member has indicated, prevent 
unnecessary spending. There would certainly be a reluctance by 
some members to accept a bill that would seem on the surface to be 
aiming in the right direction. Sure, there are a lot of things we 
would like to do, but if we do not have the money to make those 
projects a reality, on whose shoulders or whose generation will the 
mortgage or the cost of that program be borne? We have many good 
programs in this country. Some of them have served this country 
very well and will continue to serve the country in the future. I 
think of our medicare programs and the transfer payments to the 
provinces. There are many projects and undertakings that the 
government has considered in the past and it has enacted valid 
legislation. However, we must ensure that these projects and 
undertakings square with public expectations as to how we are able 
to finance them.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	In terms of the debate that surrounds what we are to spend and 
what we are not to spend, it is important to allow people an 
opportunity to converse with their representatives, if it is not 
during an election campaign, in the case of a majority government. 
There is an opportunity to speak to hundreds of constituents, who I 
know attend the hon. member's office. It is one of the most 
accessible offices in the region. It allows them to judge for 
themselves the importance of the program and to weigh the cost 
versus the social benefit. That is consistent with my definition and I 
believe it is consistent with the definition of the Liberal Party.
<P>
	I want to put this into context in the few minutes which are 
allowed to me and talk about a project in the town of Ajax, which is 
in my riding. It has a population of approximately 75,000. In that 
town there is a program known as Stars. It was featured not too 
long ago on ``W5''. The Stars program saves taxpayer money by 
increasing their awareness of how to reduce spending. No jobs have 
ever been lost by the town of Ajax. We have given people an 
opportunity to determine how best to save valuable taxpayer 
dollars while at the same time making sure that ends meet because 
municipalities do not have the ability to incur debt.
<P>
	The architect of this idea was Mr. Barry Malmsten. I am of the 
opinion that the member for Durham may have talked to Barry 
about this and applied the wisdom which has been enacted in 
municipalities such as Ajax to the federal realm. That is very 
laudable. If that is not the case, then it is certainly an awesome 
coincidence. Again it leads me to the conclusion that what the 
member is proposing at the federal level has already proven to bear 
fruit at the municipal level.
<P>
	I believe it is up to Parliament to at least consider it. It is an 
important issue. Obviously it can be tinkered with in committee, 
but the general thrust of the bill is something which I believe all 
Canadians would support.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to commend the hon. member. He has 
put behind him a variety of well known organizations such as the 
Certified General Accountants of Canada. I note that the 
organizations include the Canadian Taxpayers Federation and its 
chairman Jason Kenney. The federation has its provincial 
organization in my riding. He commented on this as being common 
sense in the Commons. Such flattery speaks to the importance and 
the timeliness of this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In concluding, we can say that this bill deserves the attention, 
respect and even the support of the vast majority of members of 
this House. I am pleased to have had a chance to speak to my 
colleague's bill, and I hope it will be passed very shortly.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AGRICULTURE">AGRICULTURE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on October 
30, I asked the President of the Treasury Board the following 
question:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Farmers are increasingly concerned about the multiple impact cost recovery is 
having on their ability to survive and prosper.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What economic impact analysis has been and will be done to monitor these 
impacts and is the minister prepared to redress any serious negative impacts should 
they result?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The President of the Treasury Board responded by indicating 
that each department is responsible for the cost recovery programs 
it administers and responsible for any impact analysis undertaken. 
He also indicated that the analysis would be undertaken in response 
to specific concerns raised by stakeholders in the industry.
<P>
	The role of Treasury Board seems to be to monitor and 
apparently report on the overall impact of cost recovery programs. 
My concern is that the cumulative impact of various cost recovery 
programs which involve more than one department but impact on 
the individual producer is not being adequately responded to.
<P>
	For example, an individual producer may not have a direct 
problem with cost recovery programs of Agriculture Canada, but 
may have a problem arising out of the impact of cost recovery 
programs from Health Canada, Transport Canada, et cetera.
<P>
	It appears to me that an individual who has a problem with the 
cumulative impact of cost recovery does not have any one place to 
bring these concerns forward for redress. I would point out that 
producers have to be assured that they will not be burdened with 
new costs that will affect their competitiveness, especially now that 
we are part of the new global environment.
<P>
	The Canadian Federation of Agriculture has pointed out that the 
new Pest Management Review Agency will cost recover 
approximately 60 per cent of its costs while the counterpart agency 
in the United States has a cost recovery initiative of only 15 per 
cent. I understand the Minister of Health disputes some of those 
figures, is reviewing the matter and will come back to the issue.
<P>
	In the Prince Edward Island <I>Guardian</I> on September 26 under 
the headline: ``Farmers fear fee hikes'', a very serious matter was 
raised by Ivan Noonan who is general manager of the P.E.I. Potato 
Board.
<P>
	The article pointed out that fee schedules obtained by the 
<I>Guardian</I> show that the government expects the new fees to more 
than double the revenue it currently earns from a range of 
Agriculture Canada services, such as licensing and inspection. Ivan 
Noonan said: ``It is going to cause a lot more hardship for growers, 
that is certain. If growers cannot pick up the revenue through better 
prices or cutting costs per acre, then they will be out of business''.
<P>
	We must assure producers that that cannot happen. Imagine the 
cost. Imagine the impact on the macro economy of Prince Edward 
Island if the multiple impact of cost recovery fees forced some 
producers out of business.
<P>
	We cannot allow ourselves to be penny wise and pound foolish. 
My colleague, the member for Victoria-Haliburton, produced a 
letter at committee that was sent to him by the vice-president of 
Pickseed Canada.
<P>
	In the letter the individual, Mr. Pick, said: ``Agriculture and 
Agri-food Canada now has plans to increase our costs to export to 
certain countries by as much as four times in 1997. If full cost 
recovery is passed on, this could rise to as much as 10 times''. He 
concludes by saying: ``We simply cannot do business with these 
costs''.
<P>
	The government must be extremely careful not to allow cost 
recovery to push producers out of business.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President 
of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to 
respond to the member for Malpeque. I have a lot of respect for 
him. He works extremely hard on behalf of his constituents and he 
is very knowledgeable about farming.
<P>
	It is important that Canadians get food at a good price and that 
user fees do not put an undue burden on them. The user fee concept 
is not new. Canadians have paid a passport fee since the 1800s. 
However, the extent to which public sector goods and services are 
being financed by users and beneficiaries is increasing in Canada 
as it is in other OECD countries.
<P>
	The first principle is that those who enjoy, profit or benefit from 
government services to the exclusion of the public at large, should 
be the ones who pay the cost of providing them. That is the 
underlying premise of the user pay policy. This promotes fairness 
in the use of tax dollars, discipline in the consumption of services, 
and allows users to have a direct say in the service and how it is 
delivered.
<P>
	The very existence of user charges permits the federal 
government to improve cost recovered activities that it might not 
otherwise be able to provide. It permits tax dollars previously used 
to finance these activities to be reallocated to fund general 
activities benefiting all Canadians.
<P>
	The Treasury Board establishes government wide policies and 
provides general guidance to departments on their 
implementa-tion, but individual ministers are responsible for 
applying the policy to programs under their area of responsibility. 
Individual
<P>

<P>

<P>
departments are responsible for deciding where fees are 
appropriate and are to be initiated.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but the parliamentary 
secretary's time has expired.
<P>
	The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.06 p.m.)
