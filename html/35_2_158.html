	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-406, an act to amend the Criminal Code, 
the Corrections and Conditional Release Act and the Immigration 
Act, to provide for new offences relative to the spread of HIV and 
AIDS and to require mandatory testing of inmates of a penitentiary 
and immigrants for sexually transmitted diseases in order to reduce

<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	In September 1992, Margot Blackburn from Dunham, Quebec 
was raped in a church by a convict who was on a day pass from a 
prison.
<P>
	In 1994 Mrs. Blackburn presented a 50,000 signature petition to 
the justice minister who responded by putting criminal rights ahead 
of victims rights and refused to amend the law to force rapists to 
undergo AIDS tests. Mrs. Blackburn has described the last five 
years as hell on earth.
<P>
	My bill should give Mrs. Blackburn and all victims some hope 
that this travesty of justice can be reversed. It introduces a number 
of measures to help control the spread of HIV, AIDS and sexually 
transmitted diseases by creating new offences for the criminal 
transmission of HIV and AIDS, introducing mandatory HIV tests 
for 13 designated criminal offences, requiring regular HIV testing 
of prison inmates, creating a health focused prison for inmates who 
test positive and, by adding HIV and AIDS to the tests required by 
immigrants and refugees.
<P>
	The bill puts the rights of victims ahead of criminal rights. It 
places the health and safety of prison guards ahead of prisoners' 
rights. It also will stop the spread of HIV and AIDS, improve the 
health and safety of Canadian citizens and save lives.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
two petitions today.
<P>
	The first petition comes from St. John's, Newfoundland. The 
petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House that 
police officers and firefighters place their lives at risk on a daily 
basis as they serve the emergency needs of all Canadians. They also 
state that on many occasions the families of police officers and 
firefighters killed in the line of duty are often left without sufficient 
financial means to meet their obligations.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to establish 
a public safety officers compensation fund to receive gifts and 
bequests for the benefit of the families of police officers and 
firefighters killed in the line of duty.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
second petition is from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. The petitioners 
would like to draw to the attention of the House that managing the 
family home and caring for preschool children is an honourable 
profession which has not been recognized for its value to our 
society.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to assist families who choose to provide care in the home 
for preschool children, the chronically ill, the aged or the disabled.

interest in the affairs of this House.
<P>
	The petition states: ``We the residents of the municipality of 
Delta, British Columbia draw the attention of the House to the 
following: that there is escalating youth unemployment and 
alienation leading to more crime and suicide each day; that there is 
a lack of motivation largely due to youth unemployment leading to 
more drug and alcohol abuse; and that job finding programs which 
exist are either not easily accessible, not readily available to high 
school youth or overly directed  at a select group of participants.

<P>
	These constituents call on the government, particularly the 
minister responsible for the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation, to immediately suspend negotiations on social 
housing with the province of Ontario and to resume negotiations 
only if the minister proceeds under publicly declared principles 
established with the input of co-operative housing stakeholders.

<P>
	The people of North Bay humbly pray and call on Parliament 
that there be no further downsizing after 242 jobs are lost over the 
next 18 months at 22 Wing. Also, the petitioners request that 22 
Wing and Squadrons 21 and 51 stay in North Bay, that the 
government announces the retention of the air base before the next 
election, that the prototype computer system for air surveillance 
comes to North Bay in 1998, that the permanent Canadian location 
site for the new surveillance system remains in North Bay, and 
there be greater community consultation before any further assets 
or jobs are terminated, including the underground site.

	<B>Mr. Bob Wood (Nipissing, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant to 
Standing Order 36 I have the pleasure to present a petition.
<P>
	Members of the Public Service Alliance of Canada in my riding 
of Nipissing humbly pray and ask the government to guarantee that 
Treasury Board representing the employer negotiates in good faith, 
including open and honest bargaining practices; to guarantee that it 
does not abuse its power by legislating any part of the collective 
agreement negotiated and signed by both Treasury Board 
representing the employer and the Public Service Alliance of 
Canada representing the employees; to guarantee that the pay 
equity issue be resolved before the next election; and to guarantee 
that this settlement will not result in further job cuts.
<P>
	The petitioners request that the petition be read and supported by 
a democratically elected member of Parliament in the House of 
Commons prior to the next federal election.

	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am

	The first one is signed by 99 of my constituents. The petitioners 
call upon Parliament to maintain the present provisions of the 
Criminal Code of Canada which prohibit assisted suicide and to 
vigorously enforce those provisions.
<P>
	They also request that Parliament not change the law in any way 
which would allow the aiding or abetting of suicide or active or

Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The most safe, sure and swift way to deal with the threat of nuclear arms is to do 
away with them in every regard.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Inasmuch as Canada is a part of the non-proliferation of nuclear

negotiations in good faith and take effective measures that will lead 
to the cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to 
nuclear disarmament altogether.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We are now at third reading stage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we understood 
the government was to make a few remarks in opening the debate

<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure today to rise to speak in support of Bill C-46, an act 
to amend the Criminal Code regarding the production of records in 
sexual offence proceedings.
<P>
	I have outlined the specific amendments proposed and have 
described the problems the amendments seek to rectify when I 
addressed the House on February 4.
<P>
	I applaud the efforts of the justice minister in crafting 
progressive reforms to Canada's sexual offence laws, reforms that 
reflect the charter guarantee of equal protection and benefit of the 
law.
<P>
	As a society we do not tolerate abhorrent behaviour. We rely on 
our criminal law for protection. We rely on our criminal law to 
prosecute vigorously those who contravene the law.
<P>
	Sexual offences are unlike other offences. They are the most 
invasive, violative and degrading offences that a person could 
experience. Any one of us could become a  victim of crime, but we 
all know it is more likely that a woman or a child will be the victim 
of a sexual offence.
<P>
	Outdated attitudes in sexual offences and the women who are 
victimized by sexual offences are changing but are changing 
slowly. Many myths and stereotypes persist in society and within 
the criminal justice system in relation to sexual offences.
<P>
	This creates a climate that undermines our confidence in the 
justice system designed to be fair and just. As has been pointed out, 
sexual offences are unique in the sense that there are rarely any 
witnesses.
<P>
	Consent and credibility are the central issues in the prosecution. 
There appears to be more of a stigma associated with being a 
victim of a sexual offence than being charged with a sexual 
offence. The complainant's credibility and character are under a 
microscope.
<P>
	Sexual assaults and other sexual offences are grossly 
underreported. The true rate of sexual assaults can only be 
estimated through victimization surveys but police statistics 
provide some indication. Approximately 110 sexual assaults were 
reported annually per 100,000 population, but only about 10 per 
cent of all sexual assaults are reported.
<P>
	We should not be proud of these statistics. That so many sexual 
assaults occur in a year is shocking. That so few are reported is 
even more shocking.
<P>
	I am proud to be part of a government committed to improving 
the criminal justice system, committed to enhancing public safety 
and committed to removing many of the barriers that impede a 
victim's access to the justice system.
<P>
	The plundering by the accused of some of the most personal and 
private records of the complainant is more than simply 
embarrassing. It is an assault on the complainant's dignity, 
personal autonomy and integrity.
<P>
	I want to be able to say with confidence that the law will protect 
us from crime and that the law will provide for the prosecution of 
offences consistent with the principles of fundamental justice 
which are fair to both accused persons and victims. The 
amendments proposed in Bill C-46 go a long way to meeting this 
goal.
<P>
	The legislation will ensure that relevance is the basis for 
demands for records. In all other criminal proceedings courts seem 
to have no difficulty in determining whether evidence is relevant or 
whether materials requested for production or disclosure are 
relevant.
<P>
	In sexual offence proceedings it appears that false statements by 
defence counsel about why they apparently need certain records are 
enough to warrant a violation of the complainant's privacy. We 
cannot seem to rid our society of these attitudes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9849"> 9849 </A></B>
<P>
	I welcome the proposed legislation which will guide the courts 
in determining whether the records are relevant and in ensuring 
that only the relevant parts of such records will be produced to 
the accused.
<P>
	I would like to focus on a few significant features of the bill. The 
bill includes a preamble which has become a fairly familiar feature 
in new legislation. A preamble is an effective way to assist the 
courts in interpreting legislation and to clearly state Parliament's 
intention in bringing forward these amendments.
<P>
	The preamble in Bill C-46 refers to our concerns regarding 
violence against women and children and the need to ensure and 
promote the charter rights of all people. It recognizes the impact 
that compelled production of private and confidential records has 
on complainants and witnesses. In other words, it squarely 
addresses the mischief the amendments seek to rectify.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	The preamble notes the need to ensure that requests for the 
production of such records is carefully scrutinized and determined 
with regard to the charter rights of both the accused and the 
complainant or the witness.
<P>
	The Supreme Court of Canada has emphasized that there is no 
hierarchy among charter rights. Competing or conflicting charter 
rights must be accommodated and reconciled to the greatest extent 
possible. The amendments proposed reflect the goal of 
accommodating charter rights that may come into conflict.
<P>
	The minister has emphasized that the amendments are narrow in 
their focus. While they require the accused to demonstrate the 
likely relevance of the records and require the court to carefully 
scrutinize applications for records in accordance with detailed 
substantive and procedural provisions, the new production regime 
applies only to sexual offences.
<P>
	The extensive consultation process the Minister of Justice and 
his officials followed has revealed that the overwhelming majority 
of applications for records occur in sexual offence proceedings. 
The case law bears this out. A wide range of personal records is 
sought in sexual offence proceedings that is simply not requested in 
other prosecutions. Therefore this type of production regime 
appears not to be necessary or warranted to govern the production 
of records in other criminal proceedings.
<P>
	While the amendments apply only in sexual offence proceedings 
and are carefully drafted and tailored to sexual offences, they will 
protect a broad range of records. The legislation will define a 
record generally as any form of record that contains personal 
information for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. 
The definition is capable of encompassing a variety of records in 
any form and adapting to new situations that present themselves in 
the future.
<P>
	In addition, the definition specifically includes certain records to 
ensure that there is no doubt in anyone's mind that they are 
captured by the production regime.
<P>
	I commend the Minister of Justice for his initiatives. Bill C-46 
reflects a fair and balanced approach to a difficult problem. In 
developing the legislation, the minister has listened attentively to 
the views of those most affected by the production of records: 
victim service providers, equality seeking women's groups, crown 
attorneys and the defence bar. The legislation has benefited from 
their participation. Yet no one view has dominated.
<P>
	In conclusion, Bill C-46 is an excellent example of a law which 
puts into practice the values we promote as parliamentarians: 
fairness and equality. I would appreciate the support of all 
members in the House for Bill C-46.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak in a debate on legislation whose 
purpose is to make some contribution towards reducing violence 
against women.
<P>
	The subject is of particular interest to me, as the official 
opposition critic for the status of women. The purpose of Bill C-46 
is to regulate the production of records of victims of sexual assault, 
most of whom are, unfortunately, women and children. This bill 
became necessary following a judgment handed down in December 
1995 by the Supreme Court of Canada in the O'Connor case.
<P>
	This was a case of sexual assault in which a man accused of 
sexually assaulting four young girls demanded access to the school, 
medical and counselling records of the complainants. In a majority 
decision, the Supreme Court ruled that, in some cases, the accused 
had the right to access the complainant's records.
<P>
	We should see this in the context that existed at the time. For a 
number of years, victims of sexual assault had been protected by 
new provisions in the Criminal Code which provide that the 
accused cannot attack the reputation of the victim, especially the 
victim's sexual reputation. You will recall that these provisions 
were adopted following decades of abuse of victims by the 
accused. The latter could, and most often did, try to tarnish the 
credibility of their victims by putting the latter's sexual past on the 
public record. Thus the myth was maintained that a woman who 
was no longer a virgin deserved to be raped.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	Times have changed. Women have gradually acquired equal 
rights, including the right to sexual freedom. The battle has been 
long and arduous, and it is not necessarily over. We see this 
regularly when certain judges publicly vent their private thoughts 
about women.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9850"> 9850 </A></B>
<P>
	Women had won a measure of judicial protection. This 
protection is important because it provides an incentive for women 
who are victims of sexual assault to press charges. It is also an 
incentive to persevere, once the initial charge has been laid. Legal 
protection also allows victims to minimize, to the extent possible, 
the impact of the aggression against them, by encouraging them 
to find help within the community and from professionals.
<P>
	This context of legal protection is vital to the women's struggle 
and explains the importance of having laws that afford the accused 
a full and complete defence but also protect the victims' access to 
the courts. This access guarantees equal rights for men and women. 
How can we talk of equality between men and women, when men 
can continue to sexually assault women with impunity, because the 
women refuse to report the assault for fear of having their private 
lives dragged out for all to see?
<P>
	If we want a society where men and women are equal, we must 
take every means at our disposal to ensure they enjoy the same 
right to integrity and security. The best guarantee of these rights, 
despite its imperfections, continues to be the legal system.
<P>
	On the subject of rights protection, I will address the first bone 
of contention: that of the balance between the rights of the accused 
and those of the victim. The bill, in its preamble, refers to the 
accused's right to a full and complete defence and the victim's right 
to privacy and equality. It also mentions that a balance must be 
struck between these rights to the extent possible.
<P>
	These last words and the notion of balance underlie the 
arguments of the parties opposing this bill. On the one hand, 
defence lawyers want greater access to victims' files, basing this 
request on the fact that the accused has an absolute right to make a 
full answer and defence. The philosophy behind this is that it is 
better to let 1,000 guilty individuals be set free than to have one 
innocent person sentenced unfairly.
<P>
	On the other hand, according to those speaking on behalf of the 
traditional victims of sexual assault, that is to say, women, hardly 
any lawsuits are instigated on the basis of false accusations, and the 
right of women to privacy and to not be assaulted demands that 
access to records be strictly forbidden. Where is the middle ground 
between these two extreme positions? How can a balance be struck 
between the rights of the accused and those of the victim? At 
present, it would appear that the rights of the accused are better 
protected. Let me explain.
<P>
	As we all know, the right of the accused to a full defence has 
been entrenched in the Constitution since 1982. But this right was 
already afforded enough protection by the courts before the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was adopted. As I said 
earlier, it is already part of our judicial standard to protect the 
innocent against wrongful conviction at any cost. Indeed, 
especially since passage of the charter, the courts have developed a 
whole slew of rules and criteria to provide  even greater protection 
for the right to a full defence. A whole series of rulings have been 
made on this provision of the charter, with still more to come.
<P>
	But much less known is the right to privacy and the right to 
personal safety, which have not yet made it into our legal and 
popular culture. Because fewer judicial decisions having a strong 
impact have been made on this subject, it is wrongly viewed as less 
important, when in fact, both rights are mentioned in the charter 
and nowhere does it say that they are less important. Why is this? I 
think this is, unfortunately, a reflection of the lesser prominence 
traditionally given to women's rights.
<P>
	As <I>Toronto Star</I> journalist Michele Landsberg pointed out, have 
we ever heard of a police officer testifying at a trial and being 
required to disclose his medical records or to talk about his sex life 
in order to establish his credibility as a witness? In fact, a number 
of witnesses who appeared before the committee made the same 
comment.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Why have women traditionally been subjected to such 
humiliation, if not because they were not given the same 
credibility? Yet, as this journalist noted, there is no such invasion 
of the victims' privacy in other criminal cases. Whenever women 
and sexuality are involved, our society has always felt the need to 
impose constraints on women. Yet, their right to privacy is 
protected under the charter.
<P>
	Now that I have raised this issue, I want to deal specifically with 
the justice minister's bill. Through this legislation, the minister 
wants to strike a balance between the rights of the accused and 
those of the victim. Under the existing legislation, an accused can 
ask for a wide variety of records, simply on the grounds that such 
records might be relevant. The existing legislation is also silent on 
several issues. For example, what records are involved, what 
conditions can be set for their production, what information must 
be included in the subpoena, and what must be done with the 
records while waiting for the appeal process?
<P>
	Bill C-46 seeks to deal with all these issues. Under the bill, the 
accused will be required to specify the reasons why he feels that a 
given record might be useful for his defence. In other words, the 
bill seeks to prevent an accused from going fishing.
<P>
	I know that a number of witnesses representing sexual assault 
victims groups, including victims consultants, were hoping that an 
accused would not be given access to any confidential records. 
However, we all know that this is very difficult to achieve because, 
according to some experts, such a provision would not pass the 
charter test.
<P>
	Therefore, the production of records could potentially violate 
women's right to have access to social and health services that are 
essential to their physical and psychological well-being. Indeed, 
the possibility that the content of a session between a woman and 
her therapist  might be disclosed to the judge and the defence 
lawyer may prevent many women from getting the care and support 
they need to overcome the consequences of a sexual assault. This 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9851"> 9851 </A></B>
<P>
view was shared by all the witnesses who appeared before the 
committee.
<P>
	They all said that women would seek certain therapeutic services 
less frequently.
<P>
	Given what is at stake for victims of sexual assault and given the 
fact that the information contained in records will very likely not 
be relevant to the accused's defence, I think that the defence should 
be required to show that access to confidential records is probably 
necessary for a full defence of the accused, and that the benefits of 
producing records substantially outweigh the prejudice to the 
complainant's constitutional rights.
<P>
	Like many of the groups that appeared, I would have liked to see 
a number of amendments to this bill. I introduced several in 
committee. You will not be surprised to hear that they were all 
rejected by the largely Liberal committee. Does that surprise you, 
Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	I sincerely believe, however, that these amendments were very 
realistic and, more to the point, that they reflected the suggestions 
made by witnesses, by those who very often accompany the victims 
of sexual abuse.
<P>
	One of the first amendments sought was inclusion of the 
preamble in the body of the bill. The groups that made these 
recommendations include the Regroupement québécois des centres 
d'aide et de lutte contre les agressions à caractère sexuel, the 
Ontario action group to combat violence against women, the legal 
action and education fund for women, and METRAC.
<P>
	Several of these witnesses told us that certain judges are only too 
ready to express their true feelings about women publicly.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	That is why it would have been desirable to include the preamble 
in the body of the bill, in order to counteract these sexist myths and 
prejudices which are still clearly present in our judiciary system. 
For a clearer understanding of the message of this preamble, I am 
going to read it. It is worded as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the Parliament of Canada continues to be gravely concerned about the 
incidence of sexual violence and abuse in Canadian society and, in particular, the 
prevalence of sexual violence against women and children;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the Parliament of Canada recognizes that violence has a particularly 
disadvantageous impact on the equal participation of women and children in society 
and on the rights of women and children to security of the person, privacy and equal 
benefit of the law as guaranteed by sections 7, 8, 15 and 28 of the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the Parliament of Canada intends to promote and help to ensure the full 
protection of the rights guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms for 
all, including those  who are accused of, and those who are or may be victims of, sexual 
violence or abuse;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the rights guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
are guaranteed equally to all and, in the event of a conflict, those rights are to be 
accommodated and reconciled to the greatest extent possible;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the Parliament of Canada wishes to encourage the reporting of incidents 
of sexual violence and abuse and to provide for the prosecution of offenses within a 
framework of laws that are consistent with the principles of fundamental justice and 
that are fair to complainants as well as to accused persons;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the Parliament of Canada recognizes that the compelled production of 
personal information may deter complainants of sexual offenses from reporting the 
offence to the police and may deter complainants from seeking necessary treatment, 
counselling or advice;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the Parliament of Canada recognizes that the work of those who provide 
services and assistance to complainants of sexual offenses is detrimentally affected 
by the compelled production of records and by the process to compel that 
production;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And whereas the Parliament of Canada recognizes that, while production to the 
court and to the accused of personal information regarding any person may be 
necessary in order for an accused to make a full answer and defence, that production 
may breach the person's right to privacy and equality and therefore the 
determination as to whether to order production should be subject to careful scrutiny.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	You can see then, from reading this preamble and the reason it 
was included in the Criminal Code as introduction to Part VIII on 
crimes against persons, that it is hard to understand why the 
committee rejected the recommendations made by a number of 
witnesses and by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	I understand very well that the Criminal Code must not be 
unduly burdened, and that many of the principles are covered in the 
general provisions, that being the argument that is normally used. 
However, considering that the objective was to change attitudes, it 
would have been preferable to accept this amendment.
<P>
	A preamble was included in the case of the young offenders bill. 
So why not do the same in the case of this bill? Does this mean that 
attitudes are harder to change where women are concerned? Does 
it?
<P>
	Including this preamble in Bill C-46 would be a major step. The 
preamble not only has great educational value for the legal 
profession and the general public but would also have been very 
helpful in the case of court challenges by counsel for the defence, 
because the preamble could have been invoked to guarantee an 
interpretation that considers the constitutional rights of women as 
well as those of the accused.
<P>
	The purpose of including this preamble in the Criminal Code 
was to recognize the negative impact the production of confidential 
records has on the lives of women and the importance of 
guaranteeing respect and support for their constitutional rights.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9852"> 9852 </A></B>
<P>
	A second amendment would also have been desirable to limit 
access to the victim's confidential records. This amendment would 
have required the accused to prove that access to confidential 
records was ``probably essential'' instead of ``likely relevant'', the 
term used in the bill. The burden of proof would have been better 
served by the concept of the balance of probability than by the 
principle of likely relevance.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	The balance of probability is a legal concept that increases the 
onus on the person who wishes to obtain the record to provide 
specific proof. However, I admit I am pleased that the government 
has agreed to review the impact of this bill in three years' time. The 
amendment was welcomed by all members of the committee. It 
was proposed by the Bloc Quebecois, and I know that a Liberal 
colleague tabled a similar amendment. The committee was 
unanimous because the amendment reflected the preferences of the 
majority of those who appeared before the committee.
<P>
	We will be able to check whether certain fears about the 
enforcement of this legislation were founded. I will name a few: a 
reluctance to have personal journals and diaries included in the 
definition of ``records''. Including it would lead the courts to 
permit access to other personal documents written by the victim, 
unlike institutional records. This is one fear expressed by the 
various witnesses heard.
<P>
	There is also the fear that victims would have less contact with 
groups or individuals that exist to help them, that women should 
not have to choose between justice and therapy. There is the fear 
that, once a subpoena has been issued, counsellors or therapists will 
lose contact with the victim, their client, and that this will serve to 
further isolate the victim. There is the fear that judges examining 
records will be insensitive. It is felt that personal and psychological 
records are not relevant in a trial and the reasons given for 
examining them are often trivial and are intended to further 
intimidate the victim.
<P>
	There is also the fear that women will not lay charges more often 
for fear of having their private life made public. There is the fear 
that the defence will try to obtain psychological or personal records 
to show that the complainant had reason to lie about the sexual 
assault, that she entertained malicious intent with respect to the 
accused or that she had already wrongly charged him.
<P>
	The evaluation, after the law has been in effect for three years, 
will provide the means of assessing its impact on victims and the 
various consultants in the community.
<P>
	In Quebec, there are far fewer requests for access to victims' 
files than in other provinces. However, there is some concern about 
the phenomenon and people are keeping an eye on the potential 
catch up that could occur in Quebec in this practice. This is why 
passage of this bill  will significantly limit access to the victim's 
records-and this concern came out during committee 
hearings-although we would have liked to further restrict access 
to certain records.
<P>
	Parliament should have set up without further delay a legal and 
procedural framework to create a real balance between the right of 
women to security, integrity and privacy and the right of the 
accused to a full and complete defence. Bill C-46 is attempting to 
partially close a door that never should have been opened.
<P>
	This is why we will support the principle of this bill. However, 
we will be watchful and keeping a sharp eye on the bill's 
implementation so we can assess the concerns expressed to the 
justice committee. I am sure that passage of this bill represents a 
major step forward, because the situation was not desirable for the 
victims of sexual violence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
is debate on third reading of Bill C-46. This is a bill intended to 
strengthen the protection of privacy and equality rights of 
complainants in prosecution for a variety of sexual offences. This 
added protection is gained through restricting defence lawyers' 
ability to apply for production and disclosure of private documents 
such as medical, counselling and therapeutic records.
<P>
	The bill's proposed amendments to the Criminal Code would 
permit applications for a complainant's records only at trial stage 
and then in a two step process.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	First, the accused would have to establish the likely relevance of 
the records to an issue at trial or a witness' competence to testify. If 
the accused did establish that the records were likely to be relevant, 
the records would be ordered to be produced to the trial judge. The 
judge at that first stage would be the only person who would see the 
records.
<P>
	In the second stage the judge would review the records in 
private, taking into account their likely relevance and the charter 
rights of both the complainant and the accused. The judge's 
decision would determine the extent to which the accused would 
have access to the records. The determination would not affect the 
test for admissibility of any matters that the accused sought to 
introduce as evidence in the trial.
<P>
	The job of the opposition is to scrutinize government measures 
and government proposals that are brought forward, to hold the 
government accountable for the measures that are brought forward 
and to act as a watchdog, a check and balance on the power of 
government as it brings forward legislation that will affect citizens, 
their rights and their lives. We take our responsibility as opposition 
very seriously.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9853"> 9853 </A></B>
<P>
	I said in my remarks at second reading of this bill before it went 
to committee I would be watching carefully to see what evidence 
came forward at committee, what concerns were raised and how 
the bill was viewed by those most affected.
<P>
	In principle the Reform Party supports very strongly legislation 
that provides increased protection to law-abiding citizens and 
victims of crime. We have made a very strong case for increased 
protection for victims rights. On April 9 we had an example of an 
individual who was affected in this type of instance. I refer to a 
case in Edmonton where a 13-year old girl's counselling records 
were directed to be given to the 27-year old man accused of 
sexually assaulting her.
<P>
	The mother of the girl said: ``My daughter was invaded a year 
and a half ago and now it starts again. It just feels that as victims we 
don't have rights''.
<P>
	Reform has urged the House and the justice minister repeatedly 
to enact a victims bill of rights and we have given a substantive 
draft of the measures such a bill should contain. So far the 
government and the justice minister have not taken those urgings to 
heart and have not put into place a victims bill of rights which 
would give legal standing and protection to all victims, not just 
victims in sexual assault cases.
<P>
	It is very clear that there is real concern from people who have 
been sexually assaulted about continued victimization by the 
justice system which can force the opening of very private matters. 
As a corollary to their first victimization a second one takes place.
<P>
	The unfortunate consideration, though, is that not all 
complainants are victims. Sometimes accused individuals are 
victims because they are wrongfully accused and are put into a 
situation where they need to prove their innocence. I do not think I 
need to belabour the fact that for a man who is wrongfully accused 
of sexual assault and sexual misconduct the affect on that 
individual, his life and also the lives of his family members and 
those who are close to him is very serious.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	We must be very careful that we balance in the legislation, as I 
have said before in discussing the bill, the interests of the right to 
privacy and the right to equality of victims of sexual assault with 
the right to liberty of the person and the right to make a full and fair 
defence of individuals who are wrongfully accused of these actions 
and who are really the victims.
<P>
	That makes for a difficult balance. I am sure all members of the 
House, the justice committee and the justice minister are very 
anxious to have a proper balance in this situation.
<P>
	The bill includes a preamble emphasizing Parliament's concern 
about sexual violence against women and children. I think there 
would be very few people in the  country who would not be 
wholeheartedly in favour of providing protection for women and 
children against the kinds of terrible violence we have talked about 
in the House over the last few days. I am not going to repeat some 
of the situations that innocent citizens and innocent women have 
had to face.
<P>
	Bill C-55 could have allowed violent offenders who have 
perpetrated sexual assaults and sexual crimes on women and 
children to be designated as dangerous offenders and to be kept out 
of society indefinitely.
<P>
	For reasons which mystify me, this bill omitted sexual predators 
and sexual offenders from the list of individuals who could be 
designated as dangerous offenders. Again, I would urge the 
government to rectify what I think is a very serious omission and 
which is very much at odds and variance with its purported concern 
for the safety of women and children.
<P>
	I would now like to make a couple of comments about the 
committee hearings on this bill. One thing that did concern me is 
that there was only one submission on the bill from the viewpoint 
of those representing accused persons. There were many excellent 
submissions from groups and individuals concerned about the 
rights and protection of complainants and victims of sexual assault. 
These submissions came from individuals and groups that have 
gone to tremendous lengths and have a tremendous depth of caring 
and compassion in a very practical way, particularly for women and 
children who have been victimized by sexual assault and very 
personal invasion.
<P>
	I commend these individuals, as I think do all members of the 
committee, for the work they are doing to encourage, support and 
assist victims of sexual assault in these life shattering situations. 
We appreciated the submissions, there was only one submission 
expressing concern about the right to a full and fair defence of 
individuals who may be wrongfully accused of these terrible 
crimes. I would point out that I am not entirely satisfied with the 
kind of analysis and viewpoints of the bill on this side which we 
need.
<P>
	There was an amendment to this bill at committee stage which 
also troubled me. Not only would a record have to be applied for in 
a procedurally correct manner and not only would the record have 
to be shown as relevant, but a third test was added by amendment 
which said that the production of a record, even it if relevant, 
would be ordered only if in the best interests of justice.
<P>
	It seems to me that if a record is relevant in a judicial 
proceeding, surely it would be in the best interests of justice that it 
be produced. That is a matter that leaves the bill open to a charter 
challenge.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	I was concerned about that. I raised it at committee. The 
department officials responsible for drafting the bill pointed out 
that they wanted to tie the application for records back to some of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9854"> 9854 </A></B>
<P>
the balancing concerns and  balancing rights that are the whole 
reason for the bill. I accept that explanation.
<P>
	I am a little concerned, though, that the way the bill is drafted 
leaves an argument open that if a document is relevant but still 
withheld in a judicial proceedings, withholding it would be 
improper. The defence counsels I have talked to about this have a 
similar concern.
<P>
	The department officials were very anxious and very careful to 
make a good balance in this bill. I was satisfied that they did a very 
excellent job and consulted widely. I was very impressed with the 
care, the concern and the ability they demonstrated in drafting this 
bill. They are to be commended and the minister and his 
department are to be commended for this.
<P>
	A couple of other concerns about the bill are that there are major 
cost implications because not only the complainant but the record 
holder or agency that has dealt with a complainant is entitled to be 
represented by counsel at hearings into the production of records.
<P>
	The question is who will pay for that counsel. That was raised. 
The department had thought through that and had some 
suggestions. That is a practical matter that is really up in the air 
regarding how that will really take place in practice and who will 
cover that area.
<P>
	There is also a concern that these cases will be extended 
considerably because of the extra hearings and the extra provisions 
in these kinds of cases for examining records and making 
applications and that sort of thing.
<P>
	Senior counsels who might be prepared to take on these cases on 
a legal aid basis would be more inclined to withdraw because of the 
time commitment, leaving only more junior counsels to represent 
complainants, going up against senior crown counsels.
<P>
	These are some practical things that were raised, and rightly so. 
On balance the intent of the bill is appropriate. The bill is as 
carefully balanced as the officials and the drafters could make it.
<P>
	It is appropriate to raise some of the concerns that I just talked 
about. Defence counsel and the criminal bar are very unhappy with 
how far this bill takes us in putting barriers up to the production of 
material that could be relevant in a full and fair defence.
<P>
	It is fair that it is mentioned, but the one thing that does give us 
some help is the amendment that was put in by committee to 
review the bill after three years. We will be watching very closely 
how this bill operates in the real world. Then we will be prepared to 
push strongly for changes if we see the need.
<P>
	On balance, after committee hearings and after speaking to a 
number of people directly concerned by this legislation, my party 
will be supporting this bill. We will be watching to see how it 
works out in effect.
<P>
	We want to make sure that the balance is appropriate but we 
should let this go ahead to see whether it does give the protections 
needed to innocent victims of a very terrible crime.

	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (for the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food)</B> moved that Bill C-34, an act to establish programs for 
the marketing of agricultural products, to repeal the Agricultural 
Products Board Act, the Agricultural Products Cooperative 
Marketing Act, the Advance Payments for Crops Act and the 
Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act and to make consequential 
amendments to other Acts, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> He said: Mr. 
Speaker, once again I rise to address Bill C-34. I am pleased to 
reiterate my support and that of the Bloc Quebecois for this bill, 
which the agricultural sector has been anxiously waiting. However, 
the official opposition's support should not be viewed by the 
government as an unconditional endorsement.
<P>
	I want to make it clear: We support the principle of this bill, and 
most of its provisions, but we still have reservations about the 
budget allocation.
<P>
	Therefore, I want to explain our reservations. The Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food spent a long time 
discussing the benefits, and particularly the gains that could be 
achieved by the agricultural industry, both in Quebec and in the rest 
of Canada.
<P>
	The major irritant at the root of the Bloc Quebecois' opposition, 
or at least its reservations, had to do with the budget allocation. The 
development of the advanced payments program is a major aspect 
of Bill C-34.
<P>
	Since I do not know, Mr. Speaker, whether you are aware of the 
situation in the agricultural sector, I will try to shed some light on 
the issue. Bill C-34 provides that $120 million will be allocated to 
the advance payments program, in equal parts, over the next three 
years.
<P>
	Needless to say, these funds are absolutely necessary to ensure 
the survival, or at least the financial viability, of  farm operations. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9855"> 9855 </A></B>
<P>
In many cases, the final payment for a given crop can take weeks or 
even months to get to farmers while payments for costs associated 
with operating the farm get to them in no time.
<P>
	At this point, I would like to give you a specific example. Take 
maple syrup producers for instance. The sap runs for two, three or 
four weeks maximum. Of course, producers must invest large 
amounts of money before and during this short period. As we 
know, preparations often start right after New Year's day, and this 
involves tapping the trees and getting the tubing ready, along with 
all the other equipment that will be used in the sugar bush.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	During these tree or four weeks of intense work, maple syrup 
producers must invest large amounts. A portion of the production 
will be sold at retail to people visiting the sugar bush. But for the 
most part the crop is sold wholesale, in barrels, and often maple 
syrup producers have to wait for months, if not years, to receive 
final payment.
<P>
	With this advance payment scheme, producers will be receiving 
a reasonable payment on the fair value of the syrup. This also 
means that advance payments for crops provide balance in the 
financial management of farm operations. Need I point out also 
that, in many cases, this represents the operations' lifeline? It is the 
difference between an anxiety ridden operation and a prosperous 
one and the profitability of farms, which are the pride of rural 
areas.
<P>
	You can see that a farmer has to be able to count on a higher 
authority to guarantee the investments required to run a farm.
<P>
	From a strictly analytical and non-partisan point of view, the bill 
introduced by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food is 
certainly very laudable and full of good will, but certain features of 
the bill leave me wondering about the minister's real intentions and 
motivations with respect to the main idea behind marketing these 
agricultural products.
<P>
	As I pointed out in my speech last June 17, just before the House 
rose for the summer, there is a rather obvious inconsistency in the 
way the government markets these crops. Let me explain.
<P>
	Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada will use huge sums of money 
to facilitate the marketing of annual crops, but this money already 
comes from the income protection programs envelope. This is a 
rather huge inconsistency. In my humble opinion, the government 
is trying to hide the cuts it is forcing on a category of taxpayers, 
who are already in a precarious financial position.
<P>
	This brings me to the agriculture department's unfair treatment 
of farmers, particularly dairy producers. I remind you that on 
August 1, 1995 we cut the price paid  for a hectolitre of industrial 
milk by 81 cents. On August 1, 1996, the same thing: another 81 
cents cut per hectolitre, with another 76 cents to come next August 
1-in a few months-until it is all used up, or in other words until 
August 1, 2001, when there will be no milk subsidy left, when it 
was $5.43 per hectolitre to begin with.
<P>
	I will give you the example of an average Quebec farm, since 
Quebec alone produces 47 per cent of industrial milk in Canada. An 
average farm, a family farming operation, producing 1,900 
hectolitres of industrial milk yearly, will lose $1,500 a year, or over 
the five year period of regular cuts, an average of $7,500. That 
represents a drop in income of between 5 and 5.5 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	Often, that 5 per cent in question is the only net income that is 
left in the dairy farmer's pocket at the end of the year, with which 
he can treat himself to a little outing, a little trip.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the government across the way is taking care not 
to speak of this cut. For instance, between 1994 and 1995, when the 
subsidy was $5.43 a hectolitre-a hectolitre being 100 litres-that 
meant that the government was paying about 5.5 cents per litre in 
industrial milk subsidies. As of August 1, 2001, that figure will be 
down to zero.
<P>
	Do you know what this means for the dairy producers of Quebec, 
the 26,000 dairy producers of Quebec? It means a cut of $108 
million, for Quebec alone. For all of Canada, $228 million. Since 
Quebec produces 48 per cent, you will see that, first and foremost, 
it is the Quebec dairy farmers who are being penalized most 
heavily.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has made more cuts in the Department 
of Agriculture than in all of the other departments. Between the 
1994-95 budget and next year's 1998 budget, cuts in agriculture 
will be 35.5 per cent, close to three eighths of the total cuts. In Bill 
C-34, the principle of interconnectedness is being used, linking 
what has been forecast as revenue and what will be given in 
anticipated payments, to what must be guaranteed as income if the 
crop should fail.
<P>
	In other words, it is a question of robbing Peter to pay Paul. 
There is no fresh money, no new money. Together with the cuts in 
subsidies for producers of industrial milk, this will inevitably lead 
to a price increase for the processors.
<P>
	I want dairy producers to listen carefully to these figures. 
According to a study, every time we increase the price of butter by 
10 per cent, and butter costs more than $3 a pound today, the price 
goes up 30 cents. Will people eat more butter? No. It means a 7 per 
cent drop in sales.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9856"> 9856 </A></B>
<P>
	The problem in Quebec is not that we have trouble supplying 
the processing plants, on the contrary. Every dairy producer would 
be delighted to keep an extra cow or two. Of course he would, 
but if we raise the price of industrial milk, instead of keeping an 
extra cow he will have to get rid of one, which means a difference 
of two cows. As you know, not the first cow in the herd but the 
last one makes money. The last cow is pure profit. Thanks to her, 
the farmer can buy a few extras, like other skilled workers in our 
country.
<P>
	I have another example which concerns cheese. The same thing 
will happen if we increase the price of cheese by 10 per cent. I see 
the parliamentary secretary to the minister of agriculture who is 
being very attentive, and I suggest that he get in touch with me if he 
does not understand the figures and also that he listen carefully.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	So in the case of cheese, if we increase the price by 10 per cent, 
there will be 4 per cent drop in sales. Here again, increasing the 
price will mean be a drop in sales. Mr. Speaker, you do not seem to 
care about the problems facing dairy producers, and I think that is 
very unfortunate, because these people do not work five but seven 
days a week.
<P>
	The morning milking and evening milking and taking care of the 
livestock goes on week in, week out, even on Sundays, even New 
Year's Day, Christmas and Easter. Farmers cannot afford to lose, 
and we have no right to make them lose, 5.5 per cent of their 
income. We have no right unilaterally to cut subsidies that were 
introduced by the central government in the first place in the early 
70s.
<P>
	I think this is an important point, and if the parliamentary 
secretary does not agree, let him argue otherwise: on average, the 
overall budget of the Department of Agriculture invested only 9 per 
cent last year in Quebec. The current average would seem to be11 per cent. One year when the department was particularly 
generous farmers in Quebec, it invested up to 17 per cent in 
purchasing goods and services or setting up research stations, 5 or 6 
of which were closed two years ago. That was the best it did.
<P>
	However, Quebec's agricultural activity represents 17 per cent of 
total gross agricultural activity in this country. However, when 
processing plants-which is where value is added, that is the value 
added in the processing of cheese, yogurt, butter and ice 
cream-are included, Quebec contributes 24 per cent to Canada's 
agricultural economy. Yet, only a meagre 9 per cent is invested in 
Quebec, while the average elsewhere is 11 per cent. It is shameful, 
a scandal.
<P>
	When I meet the producers in my riding, I regularly explain the 
unfair treatment we have been getting, not just once in a while, but 
every decade. I would go so far to say that it dates back to the 
supposed union of Upper  and Lower Canada, which took place in 
1841 and predates Confederation in 1867; at that time, the debts of 
Upper and Lower Canada were combined. Upper Canada is Ontario 
today, Lower Canada is Quebec. The debts were combined, and 
everyone was made to pay.
<P>
	Ontario, Upper Canada, had 12 times the debt of Quebec, and, 
obviously, its infrastructures, its port in Toronto, roads and 
railways were also 12 times more developed than in Quebec. The 
situation could be likened to that of a wolf whelping four cubs. As 
you already know, the first cub to suckle will be the strongest, the 
most vigilant and the most vigorous of the entire pack. By 1841, 
Ontario was already ahead and has retained the lead.
<P>
	Another example of unfairness occurred two years ago when the 
government in Ottawa did away with the WGTA in the west. When 
the subsidy to industrial milk producers was cut here, it was cut, 
and of course no compensation was paid. However, when the 
WGTA, the Western Grain Transportation Act, was eliminated to 
permit savings of $860 million a year, the government invested 
$2.9 billion, not $2.9 million, in order to save $860 million.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	This amount of $2.9 billion was divided in three. First, $1.6 
billion was allocated to grain producers, based on the size of their 
farms, the number of bushels sold the previous year and so on, 
depending on the geographical location of the farm, if it were close 
to this or that. A cheque for $1.6 billion was issued but, listen to 
this, no TP4 or T4 was issued. This means it was tax free, clear, 
which is rather unusual. It takes some doing, does it not?
<P>
	The federal government paid out substantial amounts without 
those at the receiving end having to include them in their income 
tax return. That is what I call money paid under the blanket.
<P>
	In addition, $300 million in adaptation funds have been 
earmarked for upgrading roads and railways, silo construction, 
rentals and so on. A $1 billion loan guarantee has also been 
established to help certain foreign countries that may want to buy 
western grain but cannot afford to do so. This all adds up to $2.9 
billion.
<P>
	As you can see, once again, Agriculture Canada has created 
inequity between farm producers in the west and the east, not just 
in Quebec, but also in the maritimes and, of course, in Ontario.
<P>
	In a sense, Bill C-34 will benefit those producers who have to do 
without an income for extended periods because the money comes 
in all at once, come harvest time. I gave the best possible example, 
the easiest one to understand, since we are now at the very end of 
the maple syrup season. A maple syrup producer can try to sell all 
the production at once, but maple products will be on the market 
throughout the year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9857"> 9857 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, while this government may be trying to improve 
things, it has a weakness, and I will remind the public of that 
weakness in my speeches during the upcoming election campaign. 
That weakness is a lack of fairness. The government does not seem 
to know about fairness.
<P>
	As André Pratte, from the daily <I>La Presse</I>, wrote so well in his 
book entitled <I>Le syndrome de Pinocchio</I>, Canadians politicians 
have unfortunately lost all credibility, because they have abused 
voters' confidence for too long.
<P>
	A poll conducted a while ago by a specialized magazine showed 
that, out of some 30 professions in Canada, politicians came next to 
last at the bottom of the list, just before used car dealers. Doctors 
and police officers were at the top of the list. Lawyers, because 
their job is often rather difficult, came pretty close to politicians. 
Come to think of it, a number of members here are lawyers by 
training. So, politicians were very low on the list, just before used 
car dealers. Incidentally, new car dealers did relatively well.
<P>
	Granted, a Ford salesman will extol the virtues of that make, at 
the expense of Chrysler and so on. But the bottom line is that 
politicians did very poorly. Unfortunately, I became one by 
accident, but I will do my best to avoid catching the Pinocchio 
syndrome. My children often tell me: ``Daddy, someone else in the 
House of Commons has the same name as you''. I tell them: 
``Listen, he is the king and his Deputy Prime Minister is the queen 
when it comes to that syndrome''. We saw this with the GST, when 
they promised to scrap it. To us, scrapping something means 
throwing it out, destroying it, sending it to the scrap heap.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	So, when the Prime Minister said he was going to scrap the GST, 
we understood that he was going to abolish it and perhaps find 
another clever way of coming up with the $19 billion that the GST 
brings into the federal coffers. Remember what he said he meant: 
``If you understood that I was going to scrap it, you misunderstood, 
and if you did not understand, you were not listening. And if you do 
not understand, you are idiots''. This was the answer given by the 
Prime Minister over Christmas when questioned by several 
members of the public chosen at random from across Canada.
<P>
	So, not surprisingly, politicians do not rate very high with the 
public, and yet an election campaign is going to be launched in a 
few days. There will be more and more of these distortions of the 
truth. The President of the Treasury Board, who visited Thetford 
Mines in my region on the eve of the 1995 referendum, said he was 
giving Quebec much more money than this province was paying. 
Year after year, we pay $30 billion in taxes of one sort or another to 
this institution called the federal government. And the President of 
the Treasury Board tried to make us believe he was giving us too 
much. If we  are costing this government, this Treasury Board, this 
minister, too much, they should let us leave, for heaven's sake. I 
have never seen anyone so anxious to hang on to something that 
was costing him so much.
<P>
	I am sure that, when you look at the figures for each department, 
Quebec is not receiving its fair share. I just gave the example of the 
Department of Agriculture, which is giving us 9 per cent compared 
to an 11 per cent average. Last year, Quebec received 9 per cent of 
the overall envelope of the Department of Agriculture, when it 
represents 24 or 25 per cent of the population, pays 24 per cent of 
taxes and generates 17 per cent of direct agricultural activity. When 
you include processing plants, it is easily 24 per cent. We could 
come up with more examples of such unfairness if we took the 
trouble to look for them.
<P>
	When all is said and done, we are going to vote in favour of Bill 
C-34. We will support it, although it is not a perfect bill. I told you 
how they came up with $120 million by taking it from somewhere 
else. This is not new money. They take it out of another envelope, 
the one for farmers, and invest it to generate advance payments. 
However, as requested by many farmers and farmers associations 
which called my office to ask us to support Bill C-34, we will go 
along with the consensus that exists among farmers across Canada. 
Because after all, there are some good things in this bill.
<P>
	The government could have ended up with a far better bill if it 
had bothered to accept the amendments proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois. These were very sound amendments, as the 
parliamentary secretary may recall, we moved in the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-food. However, if they do not 
initiate it, it is no good, and if they do, it is.
<P>
	I remember this week that when we were discussing Bill C-72, 
we were talking about the majority of grain producers to be elected 
to the board of directors of the Canadian Wheat Board. A majority, 
that is what it said in the bill.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	I said: ``Listen, let us write down a number. Out of 15 members, 
they could elect nine. That is a majority, nine out of 15. Or we 
could put eight, which is still a majority. To avoid any 
misunderstanding, we will set a figure''. I set the limit at 12. I 
presented an amendment to the amendment. The Reform Party 
agreed with the Bloc Quebecois; the Liberal Party, all eight 
members, including the parliamentary secretary, voted against it 
because it was not their idea. Thirty-six hours later, unanimous 
consent was requested to present an amendment that would set the 
majority at 10 out of 15, which is what it says now in Bill C-72: 10 
out of 15 to be elected by the grain producers.
<P>
	This is an improvement, but 36 hours earlier, it was the Bloc 
Quebecois that came up with this idea, and even  my colleague 
from Malpeque voted against it, to the eternal shame of the farmers 
of Prince Edward Island. But 36 hours later, the Liberals came 
back, sweet as you please, and suggested 10. So 10 out of 15, 66 per 
cent. I said: ``Let us see whether our colleagues opposite have any 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9858"> 9858 </A></B>
<P>
guts. Sixty-six per cent, 12 out of 15, 75 per cent, let us split the 
difference, and I presented an amendment to the amendment: 11.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board, I should point out, was not 
established 60 years ago, during the Depression, for eastern 
farmers, to please the members of this House, for consumers or for 
tractor sellers-there were none then, or very few. The Canadian 
Wheat Board was established during a Depression in the 1930s, to 
support grain growers who were declaring bankruptcy one after 
another and to ensure their grain was properly marketed. It was for 
them. Since it was for them, they should have control. The 
government, however, sees it as an opportunity to make three or 
four political appointments.
<P>
	I proposed 12. Thirty-six hours later they came back with 10. 
The next day, during deliberations I proposed 11. We looked each 
other squarely in the face, and my Liberal colleagues voted against 
it. My Reform Party colleagues joined with the Bloc, and agreed on 
11. However, as the Liberals have total control, and committees 
often being nothing more than a charade, time wasted, it was a 
good thing in this case, because we at least made them aware with 
our arguments and ended up with 10 in the bill, which is none too 
many.
<P>
	If the Liberal Party paid more attention to the official opposition, 
bills would often be more acceptable and would have a better 
impact on the farming community.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to address Bill C-34, the Agricultural Marketing 
Programs Act.
<P>
	To refresh the memory of those who are watching, this bill 
combines four separate agricultural acts and one program into a 
single act. The Agricultural Marketing Programs Act will provide 
for the marketing of agricultural products.
<P>
	The four acts it combines are the Advance Payments for Crops 
Act, the Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act, the Agricultural 
Products Co-operative Marketing Act and the Agricultural 
Products Board Act. The program is the cash flow enhancement 
program.
<P>
	I would like to review the three main parts of the bill before I 
address some of the things that we, as Reformers, would like to 
recommend. The new act incorporates the existing provisions of 
the current Advance Payments for Crops Act and also the Prairie 
Grain Advance Payments Act into the advance payments program. 
That will guarantee interest free loans. The new program will now 
include adjustments and a phase-in  period to allow producers 
marketing wheat and barley through the Canadian Wheat Board to 
be eligible as well.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	The second part of the bill is the price pooling program. The new 
act incorporates the existing provisions of the current Agricultural 
Products Co-operative Marketing Act that provides for price 
guarantees for agricultural products marketed by a co-op. Also the 
new program's administration and approval process will be 
clarified, modernized and streamlined since approval is now the 
minister's responsibility rather than that of cabinet and Treasury 
Board.
<P>
	The third part of the bill is the government purchases program. 
The new program incorporates the current provisions of the 
Agricultural Products Board Act which offers government 
purchases, sales and importation of agricultural products and 
abolishes the agricultural products board.
<P>
	The new act also provides for the recovery of administrative 
costs, creates offences, requires reports to Parliament and makes 
consequential amendments to other acts. There will be a mandatory 
legislative review of the act five years following enactment, which 
is a good idea for all legislation.
<P>
	The Reform Party agricultural policy supports maintaining the 
advanced payment for crops program since the program has been 
shown to have a stabilizing influence on the marketplace, while at 
the same time maintaining an acceptable level of default exposure 
to taxpayers.
<P>
	Reformers agree that the three different pieces of cash advance 
legislation should be consolidated into one to save administrative 
costs. We have proposed amendments that include, first, 
entrenching the limit on the government's contingent liability in 
the act or allowing the agricultural standing committee to review 
any increases; second, allowing farmers to access emergency 
advances of an interest free basis but only as part of the overall 
$50,000 interest free portion; third, eliminating the government 
purchases program because it is incompatible with the competitive 
market driven, modern, Canadian agricultural economy; and 
fourth, treating all agricultural organizations equally in terms of 
defaulted advances by not allowing the Canadian Wheat Board a 
special two-year exemption.
<P>
	Unfortunately the Liberals have only kept about 25 per cent of 
the election promises that they made on agriculture in the 1993 
campaign. I have gone through the red book and it is very difficult 
to even find them buried in all of the other 100 and some pages of 
rhetoric. One of their promises was to provide interest free cash 
advances. By voting against Reform's amendments, the Liberals 
are voting against their own promise.
<P>
	I just listened to my colleague from the Bloc talking about the 
committee process and the amendments that  are often brought to 
improve legislation. Very often these suggestions are not accepted 
because they do not come from the government side. That is 
unfortunate because the Liberals promised to allow committees 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9859"> 9859 </A></B>
<P>
more say in legislation. That has really not happened which is again 
another broken election promise.
<P>
	All of Reform's amendments were voted down in committee, 
even though the reason for sending the bill to committee before 
second reading was to allow MPs to make substantive changes. The 
Liberals' red book promise of giving MPs a greater role in drafting 
legislation has really become a hollow promise. The red book at 
pages 91 and 92 states the promise to allow MPs a greater role in 
drafting legislation. It was a very hollow promise. It has not 
happened in 3.5 years.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	If the Liberals on the committee were truly committed to the red 
book they would have voted for some of Reform's amendments to 
make substantive changes, in particular the amendment in which 
we actually do what the Liberals claimed they would do in their red 
book.
<P>
	Having kept only 25 per cent of their promises on agriculture in 
the 1993 campaign is very serious. We have to take everything 
together, but let me give an example of what they said in the red 
book at page 15:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Governments have little room to find new revenues from the tax side; indeed, the 
long term objective of all governments must be to reduce the tax burden.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The fact is the government has collected $24 billion more in tax 
revenue. Unfortunately that is a very serious broken promise.
<P>
	Let me turn to page 57 where the Liberals buried a few of their 
promises with regard to agriculture. They said they would develop 
new domestic and international markets for Canadian food 
products. They were to reduce input costs to make farming more 
viable and to introduce a whole farm income stabilization program.
<P>
	I am quite familiar with the area of reducing input costs. I live on 
a farm and have close ties to the farm community. I listen on almost 
a daily basis to the concerns of farmers. One of their very critical or 
serious concerns is the high input costs they experience. Many 
input costs have taxes built right into them.
<P>
	For example, fertilizer is made from natural gas and natural gas 
has a high tax component. A very high tax component is built right 
into the product they must use to produce their product. Instead of 
reducing costs and the size of government, government taxes to 
support big government.
<P>
	The high cost of transportation is another serious concern of 
farmers. I have looked through the red book and I have yet to find 
anywhere any indication that the Liberals were to remove the Crow 
subsidy as soon as they were elected. I believe this was a shock to 
farmers. Very  often it was not just the promises they made but the 
things they did once they got into power that people had no idea 
they would do. That is very serious.
<P>
	The Bloc member talked about the cynical attitude of the public 
has toward politicians. I agree. We have to be held accountable. 
There must be some mechanism built into our democratic structure 
whereby the constituents may hold their MP more accountable. 
That is a very key change Reformers will make when we form 
government.
<P>
	I will now talk about some of our amendments. We propose a 
limiting of the governments contingent liability. The government is 
increasingly allowing the review of government policies, 
regulations, expenditures and contingent liabilities by bureaucrats 
rather than elected officials.
<P>
	I asked a question of the Library of Parliament dealing with how 
much legislation has come before the House in the last while that 
has taken away power from the elected people and given it to 
bureaucrats. It is a question that had not been asked previously. The 
people doing the research were shocked and amazed as they began 
to go through the legislation to find that routinely legislation before 
the House was taking away the power of those elected to run the 
affairs of the country and giving it to bureaucrats.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	The bill before us does the same thing. That is a very serious 
matter. That was one of our concerns with regard to the Canadian 
Wheat Board. There is no reason farmers cannot completely 
control their own affairs. It does not have to be under the thumb of 
the agriculture minister where he an appoint the CEO and control 
the affairs of the wheat board completely. It should be run from 
Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba, those most affected by it.
<P>
	The standing committee with all its expertise should review any 
increase in the contingent liability under the cash advance program. 
The agriculture minister would simply have to notify the 
committee of his intention to raise the amount well before it may 
be needed and hearings could be held to quickly determine whether 
an increase is actually needed.
<P>
	Reformers would like to comment on allowing interest free 
advances. The Liberals voted against a Reform amendment in 
committee to provide interest free spring advances. It was one of 
their own election promises. They have not fulfilled it. Nor do they 
agree with Reform's amendment.
<P>
	Let me now deal with the aspect concerning the limiting of the 
government purchases program. The government purchases 
program provides the minister with a wide ranging authority to 
buy, sell or import agricultural products to stabilize domestic 
market conditions or to conclude sales to other governments or 
government agencies.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9860"> 9860 </A></B>
<P>
	Although there are no resources budgeted to the program the 
government has been unable to adequately justify extending or 
continuing it by entrenching it in new legislation. The extensive 
powers encompassed by the program have not been used since 
1985 and have only been used a couple of times in the past 20 
years. Most important, the intent of this type of program is 
incompatible with the competitive market driven modern 
Canadian agricultural economy.
<P>
	For instance, exactly what are the unusual market conditions for 
perishable crops as specified in the government's literature as 
grounds for using the program? The government should fully 
explain its rationale of continuing to have a potentially controlling 
hand over Canada's agricultural economy.
<P>
	Let me now deal with the treating of all producer organizations 
equally. Under the new act the portion of each defaulted advance 
that will be the responsibility of the program administrator or 
producer organization will be based on the historical defaults of the 
organization. The liability amount will vary from 1 per cent to15 per cent depending on past performance.
<P>
	Reform supports this change but opposes the two-year delay for 
the Canadian Wheat Board. Although the government claims the 
Canadian Wheat Board needs time to make the necessary 
administrative adjustments, the principles of equity and fiscal 
responsibility should be respected.
<P>
	I wonder if some of the political tactics the government is using 
is to deflect attention away from its more controversial bills. I often 
look at what has happened in the last few weeks as we prepare for 
the next election. We have seen a sudden increase in spending by 
the government in certain areas. Is this spending increase a way of 
deflecting attention away from what it has done previously, 
especially in Saskatchewan? The gun control bill has been of 
concern to many people. Also there is the gay rights amendment.
<P>
	Some of so-called good news bills the agriculture minister 
announced are maybe an attempt to make people forget what has 
happened over the past 3.5 years. If there is anything Canadians 
really want it is more control over their own affairs. They want us 
to work together as MPs to improve legislation and to make sure it 
is effective. That really has not happened.
<P>
	My greatest concern is that agriculture has had a lower priority 
with the government. Very little was done to help farmers. The 
removal of the crow rate subsidy without any warning, without any 
opportunity for adjustments to be made in the transportation area, 
has been a very serious blow to farmers. It will have a devastating 
effect on the farm economy. The government should have done 
what was necessary to bring down the input costs of farmers before 
it made some of these other moves.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great 
pleasure to bring forth the government's concerns on Bill C-34 
during this debate.
<P>
	Bill C-34 will establish the agriculture marketing programs act. 
It is a major piece of legislation put forward by the government to 
help Canadian farmers compete in the global marketplace by 
modernizing Canadian cash advance and price pooling systems.
<P>
	The new act is intended to replace the Prairie Grain Advance 
Payments Act, the Advance Payments for Crops Act, the 
Agricultural Products Co-operative Marketing Act and the 
Agricultural Products Board Act. The four acts were created at 
different times to meet different marketing needs. They were 
however all designed for the same purpose: to support and 
encourage the efficient and orderly marketing of agricultural 
commodities.
<P>
	The bill will fulfil a red book promise to restore a statutory, 
interest free cash advance program for agriculture that was 
discontinued by the previous government. Although the cash 
advances were reimplemented each year on an ad hoc basis by 
cabinet, cash strapped producers could never be sure in advance 
whether the provisions would be renewed or whether farmers 
would be left high and dry.
<P>
	The reinstatement of the statutory interest free cash advance 
program is important because farmers do not have the luxury of 
choosing when they plant or harvest their crops. Sometimes they 
cannot control when they have to sell. They may be forced by 
financial pressures to sell their products immediately after harvest, 
at a time when prices are often at their lowest.
<P>
	With the legislation the government is helping to alleviate some 
of the financial pressures farmers face, as well as the actual 
uncertainty caused by waiting for a government to announce 
whether interest free cash provisions will be temporarily reinstated.
<P>
	In the spring of 1995 Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada started 
the process of reinstatement by initiating consultations with more 
than 160 producer groups on advance payments and orderly 
marketing legislation. We held further consultations in the winter 
and summer of 1996. The department wanted to have all 
stakeholder concerns about the bill and the concerns that financial 
programs would act in favour of and help farmers do what they 
intended to do.
<P>
	The consultations produced many good suggestions which the 
government has incorporated including the idea of combining four 
programs into one. The producers said that they found four 
different acts too confusing. They also said that the four existing 
acts did not treat all producers equally and that some commodities 
were not covered at all. The new legislation eliminates those 
inequities and anomalies.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9861"> 9861 </A></B>
<P>
	Farming is a risky enterprise. Success depends a lot on different 
conditions over which the farmer has no control. The agricultural 
marketing programs act will bring a little more certainty to 
Canadian producers at risk. It will give them a measure of control 
and flexibility which would otherwise not be there. It will keep 
them competitive with their international counterparts.
<P>
	The new legislation represents real progress for taxpayers and a 
more effective use of their tax dollars. It will also mean progress 
for farmers who will get a more stable environment as we restore a 
statutory interest free cash advance system. It will give them a 
measure of control and flexibility they have been without since the 
late eighties.
<P>
	The bill will help farmers to be competitive in international 
circuits with their counterparts. It will be good news for all of 
Canada because the more Canadians farmers succeed, the more 
jobs are created for Canadians in agriculture and the agri-food 
sector as well as industry across the country.
<P>
	I will be voting for the bill. I urge all members of the House to 
vote for it as well.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday we saw that the pilotage issue was not 
addressed in the marine bill. I know farmers would have 
appreciated very much if that issue had been resolved and they 
could have expected lower costs in shipping their grain.
<P>
	How does the parliamentary secretary feel about these exorbitant 
charges by pilots when they are really not needed these days with 
the global technology and the positioning technology that we have 
that can be used instead of them? It is still on the shoulders of 
farmers to pay $53,000 per trip, an average of $5,200 a day per 
pilot. Those are things that farmers would appreciate having 
resolved, giving them a break and reducing to some extent the costs 
of their shipping charges.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pickard:</B> Mr. Speaker, clearly this government has stood for 
doing what it can in order to make our input costs, costs of 
transportation and other costs as reasonable and equitable as 
possible for the farm community.
<P>
	There is absolutely no question that if costs are exorbitant that 
issue has to be examined and dealt with in a reasonable way. The 
premise that costs are not fair is one that is not necessarily agreed 
to by everyone in this country. However, where those costs are 
unfair we certainly have looked at it, examined issues and tried to 
bring our costs in line with where they should be.
<P>
	However, that question really does relate to another piece of 
legislation. At this point in time the focus is on cash advance 
payments and the restructuring of four bills  which will treat all 
people, all the farm communities on an equal and fair basis. That is 
a really critical issue.
<P>
	I know that after the consultations that have gone on across this 
country almost everyone is united. Bill C-34 is a very important 
bill to all of us and it is one that we must have in place in order to 
be fair to all Canadians on an international competitive basis as 
well as on an agricultural competitive basis within the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House today and address this 
issue. We have looked at different types of legislation and I know 
that a lot of the farm problems are not just in one or two of the bills. 
The problems we have tried to address are in at least six, seven or 
eight acts that the minister of agriculture has jurisdiction over. We 
have to take into account that just by addressing a few of the acts 
does not resolve the problems that farmers have.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary mentioned this act more or less 
amalgamates three acts, the Advance Payments for Crops Act, the 
Prairie Grain Advance Payments Act and the Agricultural Products 
Co-operative Marketing Act. Amalgamating these four programs is 
going in the right direction. There is no doubt about that. If we can 
take the bureaucracy out of farm acts or out of farm legislation it is 
only going to be a benefit for farmers.
<P>
	The Reform Party is very much in favour of reducing the costs of 
administration, reducing the bureaucracy and the red tape that 
farmers have to deal with when they conduct their business. I think 
I made it clear yesterday in committee that harmonization of 
chemical registration and food inspection is a very important issue 
as well as these acts.
<P>
	It is only fair to show how unfair sometimes our legislation deals 
with farmers. When I look at the millers' testimony before the 
standing committee here just a few days ago they were allowed to 
import U.S. grain without wheat board control and as far as milling 
or processing their product was concerned. But when farmers find a 
market for their American unlicensed grains they are growing in 
the U.S. at $2 a bushel higher than in Canada, they are thrown in 
jail.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	That is not a fair way to treat one sector of our economy. We 
allow one thing to happen that is beneficial to the value added 
industry but then the producers of the raw product who are trying to 
capture the market are denied access to that market. Those are 
things that farmers object to and those are things that farmers will 
take into consideration when they go to the polls in the next 
election.
<P>
	We support maintaining the advanced payments for crop 
programs since they are shown to be a stabilizing influence on the 
marketplace while maintaining an acceptable level of default 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9862"> 9862 </A></B>
<P>
exposure for taxpayers.  Farmers are pretty honest generally and try 
to do their very best to keep their end of the bargain.
<P>
	We see that the Liberal government is very short on keeping 
promises. It is very easy to make quick promises but to implement 
them is a little harder to do. One of those promises was there would 
be a spring cash advance which should be interest free. I know the 
member for Malpeque argued for it strongly but being a Liberal 
backbencher he does not seem to have that much clout in having his 
own government listen to him.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party were supporters of that issue, saying it 
should be increased at least to $50,000 and included in the other 
advance programs so that farmers were treated equally. There are 
some Liberal backbenchers who do get the right idea sometimes 
but because there is not a democracy on the government side of the 
House they have very little clout or impact.
<P>
	We saw that happen on the backtracking issue when every 
member on the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food 
said that it should be stopped and it was costing us millions and 
millions of dollars. We wasted something like $60 million of 
taxpayer money by backtracking grain before it finally was done 
away with by scrapping the western grain transportation act.
<P>
	Those are things that farmers would appreciate action being 
taken on when brought before the House, and not just a quick 
promise before the next election that we will look at this in the 
September sitting of the House or in the new Parliament, which is 
what I heard yesterday when I was talking about the pilotage fees 
that were charged to grain transportation.
<P>
	The Reform Party proposed some amendments to this bill which 
would have ensured a more responsible implementation of the bill. 
One dealt with regulations made by governor in council that dealt 
with government contingency liability in the legislation. We see 
that it is the direction this government seems to want to take, that 
more things should be done by order in council rather than by the 
House itself. This is a very bad direction in which we are going. In 
the next election taxpayers and voters will make that message very 
clear to this government.
<P>
	We wanted to have the regulations presented to the House of 
Commons, but no one would listen. No one seems to care. The 
attitude is ``we are the government and we do as we please''.
<P>
	We wanted farmers to have access to that emergency advance but 
no, as we heard, the government would not allow it. We wanted the 
government to eliminate the purchases program and treat all 
agriculture organizations equally.
<P>
	When I look at certain issues that have come before the House it 
astounds me that at times we just look at one of the industries and 
forget that it is affecting the other industries.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	When we saw offshore beef coming here a year or so ago, 
increased from the GATT allocations of something like 75,000 
tonnes to 115,000 tonnes, we forgot how many jobs that took away. 
Our farmers had to export their cows into the U.S. to get them 
slaughtered. That took away at least three jobs to every one we 
created by bringing in this extra offshore beef.
<P>
	Not only that, the countries that were shipping this beef into our 
country have an export balance that is positive. We had to borrow 
that money to finance these imports. To me that is not the way to 
run a business or a country.
<P>
	When we look at running this country, it should be run on the 
basis of a business. If it is not going to show a bottom line that is in 
the positive then we should scrap it.
<P>
	Also one of the Reform amendments was voted down because it 
was not really very advantageous politically at that time. It may be 
different now.
<P>
	This shows that the Liberal red book promise to give MPs a 
greater role in drafting legislation is a hollow promise and one 
more broken promise that Liberals will have to explain to the 
electorate.
<P>
	We wanted to have the committee become more democratic. We 
wanted to have the committee read the red book and then 
implement the promises. The record is there. It will be of real 
advantage to us on the campaign trail to once in a while wave it and 
say here are the promises, see how they were kept.
<P>
	It will be a pleasure to have the back-up material that we will 
really need in this next election. Sometimes these promises, if they 
are put down in writing, have a disadvantage for people later.
<P>
	I have to admire my colleague from Yorkton-Melville when he 
started mentioning a few things on the wheat board issue. We see 
again that in the last six months or so we have a real problem in 
getting our grain moved.
<P>
	The wheat board blames it on the railways. The railways blame it 
on the weather and the Liberals probably blame it on God, the last 
one who seems to get blamed by this government when there is no 
other excuse.
<P>
	Where we will wind up, who will take the responsibility remains 
to be seen. It was astounding that in the last year, in the spring of 
1996, the Canadian Wheat Board cancelled the C quota on barley 
because it said that there was a shortage of grain, that there was 
nothing to sell.
<P>
	We had thousands of hopper cars sitting empty on sidings, not 
knowing what to do with them. All of a sudden when a new crop 
comes in we find out we have a record carry over of feed grains, a 
record carry over of durum. We have had all these empty hopper 
cars sitting around doing nothing and nobody taking any action.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9863"> 9863 </A></B>
<P>
	We were promised when the WGTA was done away with that 
the Liberals would guarantee our grain would be moved. They 
would keep track of the situation and they would put on certain 
regulations or rules that the railways would comply with.
<P>
	It has not happened. Reading the latest report from one of the 
railway companies, it says that in the last month it shipped around 
or backtracked 2,000 empty hopper cars from terminals that were 
never loaded in the first place.
<P>
	We can see what a mess the whole transportation system really is 
in. This government is failing to correct it. We are trying to correct 
some of the problems with these bills. We will have a partial 
success but I do not think it is nearly what farmers desire or what is 
needed in the industry.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	We now have a situation where the transportation system is not 
working. Canadian farmers who are within trucking distance of the 
U.S. could have a viable market opportunity there but it is denied 
them because we have a monopoly that does not want to co-operate 
when certain situations are run into or when market conditions 
develop during the year.
<P>
	I know for a fact there is a tremendous demand for our feed 
grains in the U.S. In my little area of Morden-Winkler, over 
200,000 bushels have gone into the U.S. by truck in the last week or 
two because of a market that was found by a few farmers. They 
have developed that market to a point where it is becoming quite 
lucrative.
<P>
	This is the type of farm policy we need, where farmers take 
control of the situation and direct the government to provide 
through regulation the guidelines that make it fair to everyone. 
That has not been happening. Again I point to the witness we heard 
from just recently, the millers. They can import their grains from 
the U.S. without any restrictions while farmers do not have that 
freedom because they have to go through the buyback program. As 
we heard at the standing committee hearings, the buyback program 
is not what farmers want. It is not fair to all farmers and should be 
changed.
<P>
	It is really sad how much farmers distrust government and 
bureaucrats. It is very hard for them to believe what is happening in 
the House. A very humourous incident happened on April 1. I do 
not know if the House has heard about the story in <I>Grainews</I> which 
stated that the the agriculture minister had announced a new 
bio-diesel initiative and created a government crown corporation 
called Petro Canola.
<P>
	I received a number of calls from my constituents wondering 
whether this could have really happened in Ottawa. When I first 
heard about it I thought it had to be crazy. I wondered why anybody 
would even believe something like that.
<P>
	I will read a few comments from that article so members have an 
idea how the farm community feels about Ottawa and how much 
trust they have in politicians. The article states that the Prime 
Minister has a better plan than the old national energy program 
from the early 1980s. ``We are setting up refineries near Ottawa on 
both sides of the Ontario and Quebec border to provide a balanced 
industry. The western farmers get the benefit of growing canola and 
eastern Canadians get the value added benefit of a new industry. It 
is an everybody win situation''.
<P>
	It really sounds like it could be something that is viable, 
something some bureaucrat or politician dreamed up. The article 
then goes on to say: ``The PCB''-which is this new Petro Canola 
crown corporation-``will buy canola from western Canadian 
farmers at an average of 15 per cent below the world price but they 
will have the benefit of a guaranteed market''. I guess after having 
been tied to a monopoly under the Canadian Wheat Board farmers 
really believe that they will be asked to sell their products under 
lower than world market prices.
<P>
	I could see them maybe falling for that bit of bait but the article 
then goes on to state: ``The board will then ship the canola east at 
the subsidized magpie rate, refine it and sell it back to western 
farmers and other users of diesel fuel''. On reading that everyone 
should have realized that it just could not happen and, if it did, I am 
sure that we would have more provinces wanting to separate.
<P>
	However, this is the kind of problem that we as farmers have 
been living with for a lot of years. I just want to make it clear to the 
parliamentary secretary and to members in western Canada 
especially that the farming industry is still the industry that drives 
the whole economy.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	Once we lose the farmers and the farming industry there will not 
be much left to save in the western provinces, or probably in the 
whole country. That is why it is very important that we start to 
work as a unit in the House to protect farmers, food processors and 
marketing agencies in a manner which will put more money into 
the pockets of farmers.
<P>
	The cash advance program, as far as interest free loans on certain 
amounts are concerned, in my opinion, is the right direction. But 
when a farmer has a disaster and is probably in dire need of some 
cash in the spring, to make him pay interest on the first $50,000 to 
me is totally ridiculous. I do not think that is what farmers really 
want or that it will benefit the farming industry as a whole.
<P>
	The Reform Party is very strong on making agriculture a very 
viable, market driven industry and farmers should be paid for their 
labour and should get a fair price for what they produce.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9864"> 9864 </A></B>
<P>
	When I see the cost of producing a bushel of grain today and 
I see how much more efficient farmers have become and how their 
production has increased every year and their increased capability 
of feeding the world population and then they get hammered at 
every corner by government or by regulations, things must change.
<P>
	One example I brought forward yesterday was past management 
and the harmonization of rules and regulations between the U.S. 
and Canada. Last year I noticed an article in one the farm papers 
which said that Ontario farmers illegally brought into the country 
about $11 million worth of chemicals to use on their corn 
production and a blind eye was turned to that. It did not seem to 
bother law enforcement officers or government officials that this 
was happening.
<P>
	Then another farm paper stated that farmers went to jail to try 
and get an extra dollar for a bushel of grain. Something is wrong in 
this country.
<P>
	Bureaucrats and politicians have been doing this for a lot of 
years. In 1992, before I was elected to the House, I know Grandin 
wheat was being smuggled into the Canadian system. Some 
farmers were for it and others were against it, but a blind eye was 
turned to the breaking of the law.
<P>
	When customs officers wanted to intervene and uphold the law 
because some farmers were not just breaking the law but probably 
making huge profits, they were told by Ag Canada and by other 
officials in government to just turn a blind eye to the issue. ``We 
will not prosecute''.
<P>
	I came to the House to make sure that it was run in a fashion that 
upheld the laws of the country. When I see certain issues such as 
that one not being addressed and issues such as advanced payments 
again nailing the farmer who has had a disaster in his production 
cycle, we need a different government in Ottawa. Over the past 25 
or 30 years we have discovered that Tories and Liberals are the 
same. They are only concerned about getting the bucks into the 
east. The west might as well disappear.
<P>
	That is why 52 Reformers are here. The slogan was: ``The west 
wants in''. We are here and we are going to stay here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I enjoyed my colleague's comments, as I always do. He is 
very knowledgeable about agriculture and the agriculture 
legislation that comes before this place.
<P>
	Of the 50 Reform MPs that were elected this term, seven are still 
actively farming or were active farmers prior to being elected to 
this place. A number of Reform MPs speak with a certain amount 
of knowledge about agricultural issues and the hon. member for 
Lisgar-Marquette is one of them.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	In the few minutes I have I would like to relay something which 
happened to me as the member of Parliament for Prince 
George-Peace River recently in connection with the Canadian 
Wheat Board. I will relate the story to my colleague and ask him to 
comment because I know he has done a lot of research and has 
taken some strong positions with respect to reform of the Canadian 
Wheat Board.
<P>
	There was a bill before the House, which for some mysterious 
reason has not come back since the Easter break, called Bill C-72. I 
wanted to ascertain if there was a consensus of the farmers in my 
riding so that I could speak with authority in the House of 
Commons and vote accordingly.
<P>
	I approached the Canadian Wheat Board. I had about 10 
questions which I wanted to ask specifically about the bill. I wanted 
to ask those questions of Canadian Wheat Board permit book 
holders. Obviously, as anyone who has done polling or surveying 
will know, you do not want to dilute the results on an issue such as 
this by surveying ranchers or dairymen or other people who would 
not be in the business of exporting grain. It was key to having the 
most accurate results possible for my survey to target Canadian 
Wheat Board permit book holders.
<P>
	I called the office of the Canadian Wheat Board in Winnipeg and 
explained to them that I wanted the mailing list for all Canadian 
Wheat Board permit book holders in the B.C. Peace region, for 
both north and south Peace. They explained to me that they could 
not give out the mailing list under any circumstances. It had to be 
kept secret.
<P>
	I explained who I was. I faxed them a copy of my questionnaire. 
I was not trying to hide anything. I was not trying to ask loaded 
questions or anything like that. They still would not help me, as the 
elected member of the people of that region.
<P>
	I then said: ``Out of my member's operating budget I will send 
you the questionnaire, pre-sealed, in envelopes. All you have to do 
is print out the labels, put the labels on the envelopes and send them 
out. I will pay someone at the Canadian Wheat Board office in 
Winnipeg for however many hours it takes to print out the labels, 
affix them to the envelopes and mail them out''. They still refused 
to provide that service, even if I was going to cover their costs. 
Therefore I could not accurately poll the permit book holders in my 
riding on the issue.
<P>
	I find it very deeply troubling that an organization such as the 
Canadian Wheat Board, which is supposedly there for the 
betterment of farmers, would not allow a member of Parliament, 
regardless of political stripe, the opportunity to accurately survey 
constituents on such an important issue.
<P>
	That is the story of one of my experiences with the Canadian 
Wheat Board. It is very secretive. It is well  known that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9865"> 9865 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian Wheat Board, like CSIS, does not have to comply with 
access to information requests. Farmers and Canadians are 
becoming increasingly troubled by that.
<P>
	I want to ask my colleague if he has had the similar experience of 
running up against a brick wall with the Canadian Wheat Board and 
not being able to access a mailing list so that he could properly 
survey constituents.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the 
question.
<P>
	As the House probably knows, I have been a critic of the 
Canadian Wheat Board, not because it is the Canadian Wheat 
Board and that it has a job to do, but because it is such a closed 
shop. It does not give farmers the right to direct its affairs. It does 
not give farmers the right to really look into its books to see what is 
going on.
<P>
	I would like to point out to my colleague that about a year and a 
half ago, when I was serving on the subcommittee on 
transportation, we had the advisory board appear before us. At that 
time barley was being shipped to Thunder Bay, put in boxcars and 
shipped to California to fulfil some prearranged contract sales. It 
was very foolish to ship it all the way to Thunder Bay and then by 
rail to California instead of going through Vancouver and down the 
coastline. A lot of money could have been saved for the Canadian 
farmer.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	I saw the article and phoned the Canadian Wheat Board after the 
advisory board was before us. It mentioned that boxcars were going 
from Thunder Bay to California. According to our transportation 
policy boxcars were supposed to be going to Churchill and not to 
Thunder Bay. The hopper cars were supposed to be going to 
Thunder Bay.
<P>
	I had my researcher contact the Canadian Wheat Board on the 
issue. I wanted to find out how many boxcars were being tied up in 
shipping grain to California instead of going to Churchill where 
there was a need for them. My researcher was informed that the 
information was not to be divulged to the public. It was none of my 
business. As a member of Parliament I was trying to reorganize the 
transportation system and trying to make government agencies 
such as the wheat board accountable to the producers, the people 
who really depend on it. I was told that the information was not for 
my perusal. It could indicate something was going on that should 
not be going on.
<P>
	The port of Churchill was in desperate need of grain. We could 
ship grain through that port for $35 a tonne cheaper than we could 
do it through Thunder Bay. That is the way the ball bounces for 
farmers. I am getting disturbed over those issues. They will be 
looked at in the next election.
<P>
	We have had 25 or 30 years of Tory and Liberal governments that 
have neglected farm organizations and farmers. They have more or 
less directed their focus on eastern interests. The St. Lawrence 
seaway cannot function without grain going through it. There is no 
interest on the part of the government to produce the grain as 
efficiently as it can or transport it out of the country as cost 
effectively as it can to compete on the world market. All it is 
interested in is buying votes for the next election. I think that will 
change. I thank my colleague for the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-34. We will support the bill because 
enough in it should be presented to farmers.
<P>
	Why is the bill coming before the House now for final debate? It 
has been around at least two years. For some time farmers have 
been calling for the legislation to pass. It has been let sit. It was not 
of particular interest to the government to deal with it in spite of a 
very light legislative load before the House.
<P>
	The government has debated very little of importance since 
Parliament was called. Very little of importance has passed. In spite 
of that these pieces of legislation, Bill C-34 and Bill C-38, were 
forgotten somewhere in a stack on the parliamentary secretary's 
desk or something. That is unacceptable.
<P>
	The government has shown a lack of caring and a lack of interest 
when it comes to farmers. We will raise its record with farmers 
across the country. They can compare it to what we have proposed, 
pushed for and presented in our agriculture policy sheet since the 
last election. We have presented many ideas. Farmers will see the 
choice is very simple to make and will choose Reform.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	Why was the legislation brought forward now? Why was it 
forgotten on the parliamentary secretary's desk? I cannot answer 
the questions. There is a rumour that I find difficult to believe, but 
it could be true there is to be an election. I would not expect it 
because there are still six months before the four-year mandate is 
up. I suspect the election will be called between six months and a 
year and a half from now. That is what normally happens.
<P>
	A government only calls an election early, especially this early 
after only 3.5 years, if it is afraid of holding off a little longer. The 
government has a lot of reason to be afraid of calling the election 
after four years, as is normal. It was given a five-year mandate. 
Calling an election after 3.5 years would mean an extra election 
over a 10-year period and extra cost. What does an election cost? 
Maybe $400 million, with all the costs to taxpayers. It is 
somewhere in that range. There will be an extra $400 million spent 
over a 10-year period and for that reason I doubt the rumour is true.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9866"> 9866 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us say that the rumour is true and an election is called in 
the next few months, or maybe even the next few weeks. I have 
even heard that rumour. Why would it be that the government held 
off on the legislation until now? Why would that be?
<P>
	Could it be that the government is absolutely terrified farmers 
will reject them en masse because of Bill C-68, the gun control 
legislation? It has been widely rejected across the country by 
farmers and by many people in cities and small towns. It is a bad 
piece of legislation. Farmers will be considering that piece of 
legislation very carefully when they go to the polls in rural areas.
<P>
	Could the legislation have been forgotten on the parliamentary 
secretary's desk deliberately? Not caring about the situation it 
could put farmers in, it was put aside on the minister's desk to be 
kept until just before an election call to try to make farmers forget 
that the $120 million figure that comes the legislation. That is not 
what it will mean to farmers but it is the political figure that will be 
thrown around. Could this have been saved until just before 
election time to cover up for Bill C-68?
<P>
	Or, could it have been left and forgotten on the parliamentary 
secretary's desk because farmers remember Bill C-33, the 
legislation that gives special rights to homosexuals? We now have 
to pay benefits for any of my staff who claim they are in a same sex 
relationship. This us what Bill C-33 led to. This was widely 
rejected right across the country and very strongly in rural areas.
<P>
	Could the bill have been left on the parliamentary secretary's 
desk, on the bottom of the pile in the dark, until just now? Surely 
the government would not be so blatantly willing to cost Canadians 
an extra $400 million for an election that should not be held until 
after four years. However, let us say that it is the case. Is the 
legislation being used to cover up some very bad pieces of 
legislation rural areas would rather the government had forgotten? 
That is the reason it was been left on his desk.
<P>
	I will talk a bit about the bill. Later I will talk about some related 
issues. Most Reform MPs will support the legislation. We have 
some very grave concerns about it that I will talk about. Some 
members have already spoken about the bill and what it deals with 
regarding advance payments and so on. They have also talked 
about what it is not.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	The concerns of the Reform Party and the changes we tried to 
make were in four main areas. First, we say a limit should be 
entrenched on government contingent liability instead of just an 
open ended liability. Most taxpayers do not accept an open ended 
liability. An upper limit should be entrenched in the legislation, or 
the House of Commons Standing Committee on Agriculture  and 
Agri-Food should review any increases in the legislation on a 
regular basis rather than just having orders in council. Orders in 
council have the power to act on their own. Under the legislation 
the minister has the power to determine an acceptable liability 
without it ever coming to Parliament. That fits in with the lack of 
democratic process the government has shown over the 3.5 years it 
has been in power.
<P>
	Second, farmers should be allowed access to emergency 
advances on an interest free basis but only within part of the 
existing $50,000 interest free portion. That did not happen either.
<P>
	Third, we have pushed the government to eliminate the 
government purchases program which allows government under 
certain completely unspecified circumstances and with unspecified 
crops to buy crops. This supposedly helps farmers out of serious 
situations. It has not been used since 1985 and we really do not 
know what it is to be used for. It has not been defined in any way. It 
is bad legislation when it has no guidelines.
<P>
	Fourth, we pushed throughout the process for all agricultural 
organizations to be treated the same with regard to this legislation. 
That has not happened. Which body was given a two-year reprieve 
from enactment of the legislation? The Canadian Wheat Board. 
Why would I be surprised by that?
<P>
	Wheat board commissioners run the board. Farmers have 
absolutely no say in what happens with the board. We do not even 
know what is going on inside the wheat board. Everything is kept 
top secret, a level of secrecy equal to CSIS and the privy council. It 
is unbelievable. It is the only organization given a two-year 
reprieve from the legislation. It is no surprise. Government 
members are in bed with wheat board commissioners.
<P>
	The wheat board serves a very useful purpose for Canadian 
farmers. I have always supported it as a marketing agency. 
However farmers accountability. They want to know what goes on 
inside the wheat board. They want some answers when they have 
questions. They want the auditor general to have access to what 
goes on inside the board. For Pete's sake, the auditor general 
cannot even get at it. We get no answers.
<P>
	Only through a leaked document did we find out that 
commissioners who are fired or choose to leave are paid a 
severance package of up to $290,000. It is unbelievable.
<P>
	Why was that the only organization the government decided to 
give a two-year reprieve in the enactment of the legislation? It is no 
surprise but it is not acceptable either. Those are the changes we 
have pushed for regarding Bill C-34.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	Again we support this legislation because it is something that 
farmers want. We believe that the advanced payments do provide 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9867"> 9867 </A></B>
<P>
some stability in the  whole grain marketing industry. We believe 
that is required and it has been our policy all along. We support it 
for that reason but it is unfortunate that the changes we proposed 
were not dealt with.
<P>
	I have already talked a bit about why this has come up now. Of 
course I cannot say why and I would not want in any way to guess 
at motives. However, the timing is really strange. Could it be that 
this government is really concerned with the problems in other 
areas of agriculture which have been brought about directly as a 
result of its action and inaction?
<P>
	For example, we have a problem in the grain industry right now. 
I have neighbours who right now should have all of their supplies 
on hand for seeding. They should be starting to seed two to three 
weeks down the road. However, they do not have the money to do 
that because they have not been able to move their grain. Why can 
they not move their grain? This government, in the three pieces of 
legislation that dealt with grain marketing, has failed miserably.
<P>
	An example is the elimination by this government of the Crow 
benefit, the Crow subsidy as it was called, which the Reform Party 
supported. However, our policy was that it should go into a trade 
distortion adjustment program so that it would be there to help 
fight the trade battles such as those provided by the European 
Economic Community and the export enhancement program in the 
United States. That was our policy that we ran on before the last 
election. We said that the money should go into that but we 
recognized that the Crow subsidy was doing a lot of damage 
moving grain out to central Canada so that all the value added took 
place in central Canada or in fact encouraged exports through a 
subsidy so that processing would take place outside the country. 
That does not make any sense, so eliminating it made sense.
<P>
	However, there were changes that had to take place before this 
move was made and they just did not happen.
<P>
	The same types of changes should have been made when CN was 
privatized. The same types of changes should have been made with 
the new Canadian transportation act. Those changes are changes 
which would have made the transportation system much more 
effective. It would have brought competition into the system and 
allowed for competition. It would have dealt with the car allocation 
problem which just has not been dealt with in any way after 3.5 
years of this government knowing when it first came that it was a 
huge problem. It knew car allocation was not working. We had a 
special subcommittee set up to deal with that but it just did not 
happen. Therefore the car allocation system is failing dismally. The 
wheat board as too much control over car allocation. That is a big 
part of the reason why we do not have grain moving properly now.
<P>
	As a result of action and inaction on the part of this government, 
I have neighbours who just are not going to  have the money to buy 
the inputs to seed this year's crop. They go hat in hand to the banks. 
Some banks in some cases will lend the money. In other cases, 
because of the drought situation that we have had for many years in 
our part of the country, there are many bankers who will not lend 
the money to farmers. We are going to have farmers who will not 
be able to seed their crops this year. For many of them it is going to 
mean the end of their farming careers and the loss of their family 
farms in many cases.
<P>
	Why? This government did nothing to allow competition in the 
system. It did not put in a series of incentives and penalties so that 
railways and grain companies would perform. It would not put in 
place, as we recommended, a system of final offer arbitration to 
deal with disputes with captive shippers. We talked about it under 
the new Canada transportation act and the privatization of CN and 
the legislation that eliminated the Crow or the debate around that 
issue.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	We proposed this. We said let us do it. At the committee we 
proposed the changes that would have given captive shippers the 
power to deal with the railways and with grain handling companies 
when they did not perform. Unfortunately those changes were not 
made.
<P>
	We have a system that predictably is not working. We predicted 
that this system would not work with the changes that this 
government put in place. It was predictable, unfortunately. It has 
happened.
<P>
	Now we have grain farmers in a very serious situation where 
their grain is left, in some cases, in piles on the ground and will 
spoil. In other cases the bins are full but they cannot get money to 
seed the crops.
<P>
	Of course, the wheat board did not help this situation out with its 
price forecast set extremely high when farmers went into planting 
last year. Of course, now we are finding that the actual price that 
farmers are getting for their grain has dropped off to such a low 
level that it certainly has not helped the problem.
<P>
	That is the problem and it is the reason that this government 
brought this legislation up now. It wants to cover up for its inaction 
and in some cases for its actions since the last election.
<P>
	Do the Liberals want to cover up that they have delivered on less 
than 25 per cent of the promises they made in the area of 
agriculture? That is the case.
<P>
	While I support this legislation I want farmers to recognize, as I 
am sure they do, that this is an election ploy. They were left in the 
lurch for I do not know how long. It seems to me it has been two 
years since the legislation was proposed. Farmers will recognize 
that is why this legislation has been held off the table for so long.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9868"> 9868 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that presentation by my hon. colleague from Vegreville 
was very informative. I cannot believe how much information he 
packed into a short 20 minute presentation to the House of 
Commons today.
<P>
	I notice the rapt attention from the Liberal members opposite. I 
hope it was not just an act, that they were really paying attention 
and drawing in the expertise and the knowledge this hon. member 
has on these important topics.
<P>
	As I indicated earlier, the reality is that in the Reform Party we 
have quite a number in our caucus who were actively farming and 
who know the difference between a bushel of wheat and a potato.
<P>
	I am not sure that there are some on the other side who know the 
difference or even for that matter care that much about the 
difference. They try to talk about how much they care about the 
plight of the western farmer but I really do not see it being brought 
forward in any substantive legislation.
<P>
	As my hon. colleagues have said, we are supporting this piece of 
legislation even though it does not go near even far enough to 
address the real issues that are out there in the farm community, the 
farm community in western Canada and the grain producers of 
western Canada specifically.
<P>
	Since my colleague has gone to such trouble to very eloquently 
articulate his concerns not only about this piece of legislation but 
about the situation facing grain farmers in particular, I would 
certainly like to hear more.
<P>
	He made some reference during his speech that he would not 
really want to imply why the government is bringing forward this 
legislation presumably at the 11th hour. He did remark that there 
are rumours rampant that we are going to go into an election when 
there is really no need to at this point.
<P>
	The government has no pressing concern why we could not have 
extended the legislative agenda to ensure that all proper avenues 
were taken to properly debate and bring forward amendments on 
legislation and improve it. Instead it waits and waits and then just 
before an impending election it will rush ahead with this bill as 
well as with a few others.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	I would ask my hon. colleague if he could expound a bit further 
on what he suspects are the possible motives for the government's 
inaction for so long. Now all of a sudden it has hurried its 
legislative agenda in the last week or two.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not in any way going to try to 
guess the motives. Look at the situation and the rumours that an 
election will be called in less than six months. Some say it will be 
called on April 27. That has been mentioned a lot. But that is early 
and I think  Canadians are going to punish the government if it does 
call an election six months before the earliest acceptable date of 
four years. Farmers are also going to punish them if the 
government does that.
<P>
	I am wondering why the government is raising this now, why it 
has been put ahead of a lot of other legislation which it stated is 
very important to it. I would guess that the reason is the Liberals 
want to deal with the negative reaction to their so-called gun 
control bill. It is really a bill that imposes penalties on law-abiding 
gun owners and makes things extremely difficult for them. It 
overrides normally accepted judicial principles. The legislation 
puts in place gun registration which will cost by some estimates at 
least $500 million. That is money that is not available for health 
care or other things that are really important to Canadians.
<P>
	Maybe the Liberals are trying to get people to forget about that. 
Maybe they are trying to get farmers to forget about other 
legislation that has hurt them very dramatically, legislation such as 
on transportation which was a dismal failure.
<P>
	We called for changes to that transportation legislation which 
would have made things better for farmers. Unfortunately it was 
not put in place.
<P>
	The government says it puts agriculture at a high priority. There 
are two other pieces of legislation which really affect farmers quite 
dramatically and which are on the table right now. One is Bill C-65, 
the endangered species legislation. It is another piece of legislation 
that if it is rammed through before the election is called it will 
really put farmers in a very awkward situation. I am mentioning 
farmers because we are talking about an agricultural bill right now. 
Any land user or owner could be put in a very awkward situation by 
this endangered species legislation which allows government to 
mandate that land users, land owners will have to spend money to 
fence off an area to protect an endangered species or lose the use of 
their land completely without compensation. That is the key. There 
will be no compensation for losing the use of their land. There will 
be nothing to help pay for the cost of fencing the land.
<P>
	This will not only affect farmers. Think of someone who intends 
to build a business in an industrial park and a habitat for an 
endangered species is found in the park. The endangered species 
legislation can require that the land will never be used for 
development. The value of the land could be lost almost entirely. 
Would they be compensated for that? No.
<P>
	That is another piece of legislation that maybe the Liberals want 
farmers to forget about. Or could it be the wheat board legislation? 
I did polls in my constituency and there was one done in the 
constituency of Beaver River concerning the wheat board. I tabled 
the results with the agriculture committee of the survey done by 
Tele Research out of Edmonton. In Beaver River 92 per cent of 
farmers wanted a choice in marketing grain. They  want the wheat 
board to remain but they want the monopoly removed. They want 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9869"> 9869 </A></B>
<P>
what many call a dual marketing system. They want choice in 
marketing.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-72 does not give them that choice. The plebiscite that the 
government held on barley marketing did not even have the option 
of choice on the ballot. Farmers either have to market their barley 
through the board in a monopoly situation, or the board would be 
abolished. That was the choice.
<P>
	Maybe with this legislation the government is trying to cover up 
Bill C-72 which is not supported by farmers. It will not give 
farmers any substantial control over the wheat board. It will make 
it more difficult for farmers to change the board and to remove the 
monopoly.
<P>
	Bill C-72 was rammed through committee. It is a very complex 
bill. It deals with the Canadian Wheat Board, which is a very 
complex and secretive organization. I did not feel that I was given 
enough time to look at each clause as we were going through the 
bill. I examined the clauses ahead of time and was prepared, but I 
do not believe the proper amount of time was given at committee to 
go through the clauses and lay out arguments. The legislation is 
being rammed through. Farmers do not want it. Maybe the 
government is trying to cover it up with this bill.
<P>
	It is not that this bill is a big deal for farmers. Advance payments 
have been around for many years. This is not putting anything new 
in place, it is just changing the legislation to ensure that advance 
payments will not be eliminated.
<P>
	My best guess why this legislation has come up now is because, 
according to the rumours in the media, an election will be called 
some time in the very near future, some time like Sunday, April 27 
at one o'clock in the afternoon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate today on Bill C-34, which will 
establish the agricultural marketing programs act. The bill will 
consolidate a number of programs. I believe the consolidation 
which the government has undertaken is good. It will cut out some 
of the bureaucracy in the department of agriculture. Specifically it 
deals with the advance payments program which I would like to 
address in detail and give some background on to explain why the 
advance payments are necessary and how they have developed over 
the years.
<P>
	Many farmers take advantage of the cash advances program. I 
did so myself. For those farmers who want to pool their product 
and continue to use the Canadian Wheat Board, it is a useful tool 
for the future.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board does not always move product in a 
timely manner. It does not always suit individual needs. There is a 
reason for the cash advances  program. I know that farmers take 
advantage of it so they do not have to worry about marketing their 
grain early in the fall when they need cash flow. There are those 
people who are happy to have the Canadian Wheat Board do their 
marketing for them. One of the tools which they use to manage 
their cash flow is the cash advances program.
<P>
	However, a number of farmers in western Canada are not happy 
with the Canadian Wheat Board. In fact they have used other 
methods to find ways of getting around marketing their grain 
through the Canadian Wheat Board. Some grow commodities that 
the wheat board does not handle. They want out of the system. 
They want choice. They want to be able to sell their grain when it 
best suits them. They do not want to be part of the cash advances 
program and they would not use it.
<P>
	The chair of the agriculture committee was in the House earlier. I 
believe he will be speaking on the bill at some point. He was in 
Grand Prairie with the agriculture committee to discuss Bill C-72. 
One of the farmers on one of the panels during that morning said 
that only one-third of his income came from Canadian Wheat 
Board crops and that it was becoming less and less over the years.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	A neighbouring farmer to me, Terry Balisky, is a big farmer in 
the area. He is well known for managing a good operation. He went 
on to say that over the years he is getting out of crops that the 
Canadian Wheat Board administers or controls gradually and is 
getting into crops over which he has more management.
<P>
	The chair of the committee asked him a very good question: 
``You are not growing crops under the Canadian Wheat Board. Is it 
because those crops are just not doing well in the world market or 
are there other reasons?'' Terry did not have answer for him.
<P>
	I asked him about that when we were having coffee later and he 
said: ``I was thinking about that and I really did not answer that 
question properly. It is really all about timing''. In his view the 
Canadian Wheat Board does not serve his needs because of the 
untimely manner in which it moves crops. It is not just the cash 
flow. Sometimes he has grain in the bins on his farm and that grain 
is carried over for more than one year. He finds that he can manage 
his operation far better by going to non-Canadian Wheat Board 
crops. It does not serve him well. I have heard other farmers say 
that as well.
<P>
	When the western grain marketing panel was in Edmonton I 
listened to farmers making representation. The marketing panel 
travelled across western Canada at the behest of the minister of 
agriculture to find out what farmers wanted in terms of grain 
marketing in the future. I believe at this point that farmers want 
leadership. We were hoping that we would get that kind of 
leadership from the grain marketing panel in its recommendations  
to the minister of agriculture. Then he could act on the 
recommendations once the panel had listened to farmers from 
across western Canada in the Canadian Wheat Board designated 
marketing area. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9870"> 9870 </A></B>
<P>
would give him its recommendations after listening and the 
minister would act.
<P>
	One farmer I listened to was from the riding next to mine, Prince 
George-Peace River, B.C. His name is Gary Scott and he is 
another good farmer from that area. He was telling the panel that he 
basically grows no product now that requires Canadian Wheat 
Board control. I will summarize what he said.
<P>
	He did not say that the Canadian Wheat Board does not function 
well for his neighbour. Many farmers want to use the Canadian 
Wheat Board. He was not telling the panel that the board should not 
be there. For his operation-and I know this is a big farmer and 
does a good job-the board does not serve him well. Different 
operations have different needs.
<P>
	He said he might have a situation where he needed cash flow to 
make a payment in October and there are limits on how much can 
come out of the cash advances program. He might need to move 
some product at that time and even if he had to take a little bit less 
for it he was paying down a payment. One of his neighbours down 
the road has been in business for 35 years, has everything paid for 
and he does not have the same need. Therefore there are different 
needs in the farming community.
<P>
	He was trying to say that there needs to be choice in grain 
marketing, a choice that reflects the different needs of farmers. My 
son and I and our families farm 1,500 acres in the Peace River 
country of Alberta. In my situation I would be happy to let the 
Canadian Wheat Board market my product but my 30-year-old son 
does not want that option. He wants to be able to go out and market 
his crops. He is a university graduate with some marketing skills. I 
wonder, what is wrong with that? There is something wrong with 
this picture when we will not allow that to happen. Surely we live 
in a free country and choice should be what this is all about.
<P>
	In fact, we have choice in probably 97 per cent of the economy. 
We have a $750 billion plus GDP of this country. How much of it is 
under a monopoly situation? Not very much.
<P>
	In the areas where there are monopolies such as public utilities 
or private utilities, where there is no competition, governments 
have done a fairly good job of putting in a public utilities board. 
Some avenue for redress has been put in for the public. That is not 
the case in grain marketing on exports sales of wheat and barley.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Just as my neighbours are using the board less and less, the board 
does not handle all the product that my son  and I produce on our 
farm. We grow canola. It is a major crop. In fact it competes head 
to head with wheat in western Canada as to which has the highest 
sales volume per year. We grow fescue which is a lawn seed 
product. We grow rye from time to time. We grow peas and clovers. 
Farmers in western Canada are growing many commodities that are 
not marketed by the Canadian Wheat Board. We seem to be doing a 
pretty good job of handling those. In fact, I am glad of that choice 
and I think that those farmers who want to also market wheat and 
barley should be allowed to do so.
<P>
	To get back to the history of what has been happening in western 
Canada, we need to look back just a bit beyond that. I would go 
back to the Uruguay round of the GATT. It took some eight or nine 
years to finally conclude the negotiations in 1992 when agriculture 
was brought under trade rules for the first time.
<P>
	We have had trade rules for industrial products, goods and 
merchandise for a long time. After the second world war Canada 
was instrumental in working at the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade to establish trade rules. It was in our interest. After all in this 
last year 40 per cent of our gross domestic product was derived 
from exports. It is growing. Canada is a trading nation and we need 
some trade rules to work by.
<P>
	I was glad when we finally reached an agreement under the 
Uruguay round of the GATT and agriculture was brought under 
trade rules for the first time. In fact we had a massive trade war in 
agriculture products raging at that time. Canada was devastated in 
that process.
<P>
	While I believe that our agriculture producers can match or 
better anybody else in the world in terms of production, I know 
quite well that we cannot match their treasuries, especially the 
treasury of the European Union and the treasury of the United 
States. While our governments made a valiant effort to support 
farmers during that time, which was greatly needed and 
appreciated, we know that the long term solution was to have some 
phase down of that trade war and some rules in agriculture.
<P>
	After the signing of the GATT, agriculture was brought under 
trade rules. Because it was the first step in that process we were not 
able to accomplish everything we wanted to do. It was a step in the 
right direction. Canada's border closures in the area of supply 
management were changed to tariffs. In other areas of agriculture, 
we were asked to phase down subsidies and tariffs over a scheduled 
period of time at a scheduled rate in concert at the same rate as all 
the other member countries that signed the GATT.
<P>
	This was a phase down of tariffs and a phase down of subsidies 
world wide and I applaud that. Almost immediately following the 
introduction of trade rules in the GATT the trade war that had been 
raging in agriculture products pretty well came to an end. The 
export enhancement program in the United States is  basically not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9871"> 9871 </A></B>
<P>
used. Canada in fact moved faster than anybody else. We phased 
out the GRIP program. We got out of the subsidy in transportation, 
the Crow rate. We were the model student in that whole program of 
the GATT. We phased down faster than anybody else.
<P>
	I do not personally have a problem with that, although I guess 
some people would have said that we should have matched our 
phase down to that of other member countries.
<P>
	We had already benefited from the old free trade agreement with 
the United States in the area of beef. In the 10 years of the free 
trade agreement with the United States the beef market is now 
continental, with a North American price. Exports have risen about 
50 per cent in the beef industry. It is just a perfect example of a 
market driven industry and the beef producers in western Canada 
are saying: ``Please don't give us any subsidies. Don't give us any 
programs that might attract the Americans' attention to us to say 
that our industry is subsidized and therefore they have some reason 
not to deal with us''.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	Things have improved greatly with trade rules in agriculture, but 
the one area for which I fault the Conservative government of the 
day in 1992 is supply management. It defended article 11 of supply 
management which was border closures. It did not want it 
converted to tariffs.
<P>
	The Liberal government elected in 1993 continued with that and 
found that it was isolated at the GATT discussions in Geneva along 
with Japan and Korea. I believe it was a deliberate move. It could 
go there to argue that it would not give in to anybody else and that it 
would keep border closures. However it knew all along that it could 
not win the argument. It looked good at home politically but it 
knew it would be hit with tariffs, which is exactly what happened.
<P>
	When I talk about leadership I believe the same thing is 
happening this time around. We have a built in agenda for work on 
the second phase of agriculture that will take place at the World 
Trade Organization in 1999. There is a working agenda. The 
Canadian government is playing the same game this time. It is 
playing the game of knowing there will be massive reductions in 
the tariffs on supply management. It knows that state trading 
enterprises such as the Canadian Wheat Board will be reviewed. It 
is not just on the agenda for Canada. It is on the agenda for a 
number of member countries such as the United States. These 
issues will be raised during the talks.
<P>
	I am concerned the Canadian government is saying there will be 
no changes at all when it knows that state trading enterprises such 
as the Canadian Wheat Board will probably be hit, because there is 
no competition and  they are monopolies, with having to be 
transparent. That is the trade-off to not having any competition.
<P>
	People say that Cargill in the United States or Cargill in Canada 
does not have to show its books. That is true but there is 
competition. We do not have to deal with Cargill. There are a 
number of grain companies we can deal with. The Canadian Wheat 
Board has a very closed system and quite frankly cannot stand up to 
transparency.
<P>
	I would suggest a proactive approach, showing some leadership 
and giving 10 per cent of farmers who want to market their grain 
outside the board the ability to do so. What is wrong with that?
<P>
	A letter published in the last edition of <I>Maclean's</I> magazine from 
a farmer in western Canada essentially said the same thing. It was 
from Ken Motiuk of Mundare, Alberta. It appears on the guest page 
under ``The Road Ahead''. He wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Western Canadian farmers are preparing to seed another crop.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Farmers fight the elements annually. They own and operate sophisticated farm 
equipment worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. They have adopted new 
technologies. They manage annual cash flows that approach millions of dollars on 
larger operations. But they are not considered smart enough to market their own 
wheat and barley.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Farmers must cede that responsibility to the bureaucrats at the Canadian Wheat 
Board in Winnipeg-government employees with no investment in the business, 
people who have never bottom-lined a business, people who don't manage their own 
pensions because the government even does that for them. In the consummate 
wisdom of our political masters in Ottawa, those people are more capable than we 
are of selling our wheat and barley. If we see a better price across the border, it is 
inaccessible. We can only long for it, like an adolescent with a forbidden magazine. 
Only the chosen ones in Winnipeg are able to access that market for us-after all 
appropriate deductions, of course.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And dare not cross the line with your own grain, for Ottawa will spare no cost or 
effort to hunt you down and see that justice is served. For the heinous crime of 
selling your grain across the border, you can expect to have law enforcement officers 
bust into your home in the early hours of the morning, scare your wife and children, 
seize your property, manacle you in handcuffs and leg-irons and put you behind 
bars. This is justice. For you have broken the law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The gentleman continued:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My grandfather left Ukraine because the Czar's soldiers would imprison peasants 
for hiding wheat.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Does that not sound sort of similar to what we are talking about 
here? He wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One hundred years later, here in Canada, we are being imprisoned for not turning 
our wheat over to the government for sale.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Don't get me wrong. This is a great country, and we have chosen it as a place to 
raise our family and run our business. But if we don't speak up, the bloated egos of 
Ottawa and Winnipeg bureaucrats will continue to confiscate our rights and 
freedoms.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	That is a pretty powerful statement. The debate that is taking 
place in western Canada is all about choice. The minister of 
agriculture has not categorized this debate right. He is saying that 
there are those who want to destroy the Canadian Wheat Board and 
those who want to keep it. That is baloney.
<P>
	The people I have listened to in my riding and the people who 
appeared before the committee on Bill C-72 as it travelled across 
the country did not want to destroy the board. They wanted choice 
for those who wanted to market through the board, pool their 
product and accept an average price. By all means those farmers 
could use it, but they did not want to be condemned to the same fate 
if they do not want to use it. I remind members that we have a $750 
billion economy. Most of it runs on a free market principle, so what 
is wrong with that idea?
<P>
	I hear Liberal members tell us what is good for us farmers in 
western Canada. My colleague from Lisgar-Marquette, my 
colleague from Vegreville and I run farm operations. I have been 
under the Canadian Wheat Board designated area. I say that we 
should let the board exist for those who want to use it but do not 
maintain that farmers who want choice cannot have another choice.
<P>
	Members on that side do not know what they are talking about. 
There is only one member over there who has any credibility in the 
matter. Most of them are lawyers, supply management operators or 
a potato farmer from Prince Edward Island who have never been 
under the Canadian Wheat Board system. They have no credibility 
in the matter.
<P>
	Farmers want leadership. They want to be proactive. They want 
to function well and to participate in the economy that will take us 
into the 21st century. They recognize the trade rules in agriculture 
have been a good thing for Canada. They also recognize that there 
will be further agricultural reform in the World Trade Organization. 
We could benefit from it. We do not have to hide. We do not have to 
be afraid of the change that is taking place.

	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-38, an act to

creditors, to amend the Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative 
Monetary Penalties Act and to repeal the Farm Debt Review Act, as 
reported (with amendments) from the committee.

a third time? By leave, now?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased 
to introduce Bill C-38, the farm debt mediation act for third 
reading.
<P>
	The bill will create a new strengthened farm debt mediation 
service to replace farm debt review boards. It will maintain the 
essential features of the old legislation including the stay of 
proceedings and a review of the mediation process. It will be 
coupled with and simultaneously implemented with a new farm 
debt consultation service.
<P>
	The legislation reflects the views of farmers, their creditors and 
provincial governments across the country. We had many 
consultations with all groups. The bill was forged through some 18 
months of consultations with farm organizations, leading 
institutions, farm debt review boards, panel members, financial 
experts, provincial government officials and the Canadian 
Federation of Agriculture. They all took part in our consultation 
process.
<P>
	It is a prime example of the government making good on 
promises to give members of Parliament and parliamentary 
committees more influence in drafting legislation.
<P>
	Standing committee deliberations included MPs from all sides 
and a host of informed and experienced witnesses from both inside 
and outside government. The result is that we have before us today 
legislation to replace the existing Farm Debt Review Act with a 
new, simplified mediation service for insolvent farmers that still 
brings the same benefits as before and adds several others. The new 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9873"> 9873 </A></B>
<P>
act, along with the consultation service,  means reduced overlap 
and duplication, streamlined administration of financial mediation 
and consultation services, and a broader range of advisory and 
counselling options.
<P>
	The bill recognizes that farmers and creditors are generally 
comfortable with the current process that allows mediation with a 
view to resolving the debt situations of farmers. It also reflects a 
demand for flexibility, an effective and streamlined process that is 
immune to the realities of farmers today. It will help creditors. It 
will help provincial governments deal with the realities of financial 
problems in the overall picture of operating farm debt problems. 
We are looking for resolutions that will be helpful to farmers and 
creditors.
<P>
	As recommended by producer organizations, we will have an act 
that provides a new appeal mechanism not provided by an old law. 
It will give farmers and creditors an impartial review of decisions 
related to stay of proceedings. We will have an act that will allow 
farmers to engage their financial advisers for the preparation and 
recovery plan.
<P>
	The new farm debt mediation act and complementary farm 
consultation service will be funded through the Canadian 
adaptation and rural development program or CARD. Funds for 
those purposes will help agriculture and agri-food sectors be more 
efficient, self-reliant and competitive.
<P>
	There is one point I would like to underline. The new farm 
consultation service provides farmers in financial difficulty with 
the same and probably a broader financial review and consulting 
service than was ever provided in the preceding acts.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	This new service will be more proactive. It will help farmers to 
find sources of advice and one on one counselling very early on in 
the stage before serious difficulties develop. It will provide 
non-farm assessment and diagnostic review for farmers already in 
financial difficulty, including three year operational plans which 
will be a key to financial recovery for many. In essence it will 
provide more extensive services than those farmers get under 
section 16 of the act.
<P>
	I would now like to focus on the administration of the mediation 
process. Ten years ago the Farm Debt Review Act responded to 
severe debt problems of farmers by establishing farm debt review 
boards in every province. They were to assist farmers and creditors 
in finding mutually satisfactory financial arrangements.
<P>
	There are currently some 32 review board members appointed at 
the discretion of the minister and by order in council. These OIC 
appointees participate in panel meetings between farmers and 
creditors and facilitate discussions leading to an arrangement to be 
finalized. Under the new debt farm mediation act there will be no 
OIC appointments. Mediators who have specific  mediation 
expertise and experience in agriculture and finance may apply and 
compete to be on a list of standing offers to provide the mediation 
service under the act.
<P>
	The existing act also requires that at every meeting with the 
farmers and creditors there be a three person panel, a mediator and 
two panel members, regardless of whether they are needed. This 
often results in unwanted expenses, including per diems, travel and 
room and board. The new act does away with this requirement, 
allowing experts to be brought into the case only when 
circumstances warrant.
<P>
	I am pleased that we have reached this stage of consideration of 
Bill C-38 with the quality input from so many organizations and 
individuals. I am pleased that together we have fashioned an act 
which preserves what was valued most in the past and builds on a 
relevant new approach to the future.
<P>
	I know that many will welcome the more efficient, more friendly 
service we are providing today. It will assist farmers in improving 
their financial circumstance and it will promote growth and 
prosperity in Canada's agriculture and agri-food sector.
<P>
	I therefore submit to every member of the House that the bill is 
great for Canadian farmers. I hope all members will support the 
bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address Bill C-38 immediately after the parliamentary 
secretary.
<P>
	As mentioned earlier, this is an act to provide for the mediation 
between insolvent farmers and their creditors, to amend the 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties Act 
and to repeal the Farm Debt Review Act.
<P>
	Before drafting Bill C-38, the Minister of Agriculture should 
have given some thought as to why many farmers experience 
serious financial difficulties. Some of them may have a hard time 
when they go through a divorce or a separation. This can cause 
financial difficulties, and so could, for example, an illness. 
Nowadays, the agricultural world has very little to do with the 
popular television series currently being rerun on Radio-Canada, 
<I>Le Temps d'une paix</I>.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Today, farmers must be good administrators, since they manage 
small businesses. The invested capital often approaches or exceeds 
$1 million. But could it be that these financial problems are also 
directly related to the federal government, to its lack of vision 
concerning agriculture in Canada and in Quebec?
<P>
	After watching for almost four years this government mishandle 
agricultural issues, it is no surprise to see that, every year, hundreds 
of farmers run into serious problems and must declare bankruptcy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	Just before I rose, I was reading the classified adds in the most 
widely read newspaper in French Canada, in Quebec, <I>La Terre de 
chez nous</I>. When you see so many auctions and liquidations being 
held in April, it means there is a problem. That problem is not 
just the result of bad management, family problems, or illness: 
it is also the result of the terrible conditions being imposed on 
farmers by the government, month after month.
<P>
	Let me give you an example of the problems experienced by our 
producers, with the exception of course of those who are in a 
supply-managed sector such as dairy, poultry and egg producers, 
who are lucky enough to be protected, at last. Still, later on I will 
discuss price fluctuations in the dairy industry.
<P>
	Take, for example, feeder calves. Three years ago, we could 
expect to get $1.15 or $1.20 per pound, in the fall, for our veal 
calves. One year ago, or seven months to be exact, last fall, it was 
possible to buy very fine calves at 50 per cent of what they were 
worth two years ago. A farmer hoping to get $700 for his calf got 
$350 or $360. We are no longer talking about a drop of 2 or 3 per 
cent, but of 50 per cent.
<P>
	You will reply that cow and calf stabilization insurance is 
needed. You are right, but you know how insurance works: the 
more you use it, the more premiums go up. Since the government is 
also getting ready to cut its share of funding for the farm income 
stabilization program, we can expect a large increase in premiums 
there too, as well as a decrease in services.
<P>
	Take maple syrup. This year, the run seems much inferior in 
quality and quantity to what it was last year. Prices will therefore 
rise slightly, but the maple syrup producer will not receive a fair 
wage. Pork production is fine, but reform is another matter entirely. 
In the case of softwood lumber, with the agreement the federal 
government negotiated with our neighbours to the south, when the 
export quota is reached, it will be the same story there as well.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board, which one of my Reform colleagues 
brought up earlier in connection with Bill C-72, and which has a 
monopoly, of course, is trying to get the best prices, except that 
western grain producers are not free to sell directly to their 
neighbours across the border at prices very often higher than what 
they could get from the Board.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	With the exception of producers who operate under a supply 
management system, dairy, poultry and egg producers face 
uncertainty as a result of fluctuating prices.
<P>
	Which reminds me, I wonder whether this government will have 
the guts to defend supply management at the WTO, since the 
American foreign trade representative has sworn she would not 
accept the tariffs imposed in the course of negotiations approved in 
December 1993 by  GATT, now the WTO. She said she would fight 
to the death, if necessary, to win her case. The United States seems 
determined to go before a WTO panel.
<P>
	I asked the Minister of Agriculture whether he would defend our 
tariffs with equal vigour. We shall see if the government is able to 
defend our interests. Of course we have only a few sitting days left. 
We will have to run again in our respective ridings. So we do not 
know who will be in a position to defend us. Will we have a 
minority or a majority government? As for who will form the next 
government, your guess is as good as mine.
<P>
	This also brings us to examine the role that could be played by 
the Farm Credit Corporation. I hope that when the FCC evaluates 
the solvency of a farmer and approves a loan of $300,000 or 
$400,000, it does a very thorough evaluation. If approving the loan 
is too risky, the right thing to do would be for FCC representatives 
to consolidate the loan or simply refuse it.
<P>
	So in several respects, farmers are like skilled workers or the 
owner of a factory, except they should not expect to work only40 hours, five days a week. A dairy farmer has to milk cows twice a 
day, seven times a week. If he leaves Friday evening, there will be 
no scabs on his farm. He will have to find a replacement or make 
arrangements with his neighbour, and next time he will have to 
return the favour, because, as I pointed out earlier, there are no 
scabs.
<P>
	So a farmer has to work seven days a week and often 60 or70 hours a week. Unfortunately, in many cases his income is less 
than that of a skilled worker who only has to work 40 hours a week 
for five days, and in many cases, a little less than 40 hours in four 
days. The farmer therefore has to devote a great deal of time to the 
operation, often along with his wife and children, in order to make 
ends meet.
<P>
	Recently, this government made its cuts and the agricultural 
sector got it in the neck. Taking the example of a dairy farmer 
producing industrial milk, the government has found the trick of 
reducing his income by an average 5.5 per cent, for the past two 
years and the coming three. Then the government wonders why 
dairy farmers have to give up their farms, or even declare 
bankruptcy.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Their income is cut and then they are told what poor managers 
they are. You know as well as I that, for a dairy farmer, it is not the 
first cow in the barn that brings him profit, but the last ones. His 
electricity costs the same, regardless of the number of cows, and 
more cows of course require more feed and more hay, but the last 
ones you milk will be nothing but profit.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois, like the Reform Party, was vigorously 
opposed, while this government, including some of its members 
who are involved in the dairy industry, such as the hon. member for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9875"> 9875 </A></B>
<P>
Malpèque on  Prince Edward Island, voted in favour of cutting the 
milk subsidy. This is an out and out scandal.
<P>
	In a few weeks, however, the member in question will be doing 
the rounds of his beautiful riding of Malpèque, and he will forget 
all about this. He will, as André Pratte so aptly described it, be 
playing Pinocchio, hiding or falsifying the fact that he voted 
against the dairy farmers in his riding and in favour of cutting back 
to zero the milk subsidy, which was $5.43, or 5.5 cents a litre. For 
an average farm, such as my colleague from Malpèque himself has, 
5.5 cents a litre represents a loss of $7,500.
<P>
	It is not surprising that the dairy farmers, while not necessarily 
going bankrupt, will be announcing farm auctions on such and such 
a day at such and such a time, in order to get rid of all their stock 
and equipment. They are opting for retirement before they are 
forced into it. The worst thing is that 48 per cent of dairy farmers 
are located in Quebec. So this government is following its usual 
practice of going after Quebec first and foremost, which is forcing 
our dairy farmers to take a $108 million loss as a result of the 
elimination of this subsidy. And so, once again, Quebec pays the 
highest price.
<P>
	The worst of it is that, if milk producers want to get as much 
money for their milk, the price of industrial milk will have to be 
raised, and that decision rests with the Canadian Dairy 
Commission. You do not have to be a lawyer to see that raising the 
price of industrial milk will raise the price of butter, cheese and all 
other dairy products.
<P>
	According to a study ordered by the dairy producers of Canada, a 
10 per cent increase in the price of butter results in a 7 per cent 
decrease in its consumption. When I said, Mr. Speaker, that the last 
cow is the most profitable, you seemed to agree with me. So, if 
consumption now drops by 7 or 14 per cent, you cannot even keep 
one or two extra, but may have to lose a couple. This sort of 
situation will bring hard financial times to the farming community.
<P>
	According to the same study, raising the price of cheese by10 per cent lowers consumption by 4 per cent and further reduces 
the size of your herd. The worst is that, when you look at 
Agriculture Canada's overall budget, Quebec gets only 9 per cent 
of what it invested last year in Canada. In a good year, the figure 
goes up to 16 per cent.
<P>
	Quebec alone generates some 17 per cent of direct agricultural 
activity. Add to that the processing of such things as cheese, butter 
and ham, and our share climbs to 24 per cent. We pay 24 per cent of 
federal taxes, or $30 billion. But we are getting barely 9 or 10 per 
cent back year after year. That is appalling.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	I will be waiting for you, my Liberal friends, when you visit the 
riding of Frontenac in the next election campaign and tell the 
people of my riding, as the  President of the Treasury Board did in 
the referendum, that, while Quebec pays $30 billion, it receives 
$31 billion or $32 billion. Why is it so important to you that we 
remain a part of your Canadian federation if we are costing you so 
much?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, we must look at who, in this country, got the first 
break. We will recall that, in 1841, when Upper and Lower Canada 
were joined-Upper Canada corresponding to what is now known 
as Ontario, and Lower Canada to Quebec-so were their respective 
debts. Upper Canada's debt was 1.195 million pounds, as compared 
to a mere 200,000 pounds for Lower Canada. How were the debts 
handled? They were simply added up. Living together meant 
paying off our debts together. So the French Canadians had to pay 
up. At the time, they were referred to as the Canadians, while the 
others were called the English. That is how it was at the beginning 
of the colony.
<P>
	When this government abolished the WGTA, the Western Grain 
Transportation Act, two years ago, the yearly cost was-I would be 
much obliged to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Agriculture to look me straight in the eye. The yearly cost to the 
government was $860 million. What did you do to sugarcoat it in 
western Canada, to make this cut more palatable to western 
producers? You gave them $1.6 billion. Worse yet, you gave this 
money under the table. Farmers were not required to claim it on 
their income tax returns. This is appalling.
<P>
	You have established a $300 million fund to finance adjustment 
measures, road upgrading, silo construction and the upgrading and 
construction of new railway lines. One million dollars was used to 
establish a loan guarantee fund to help certain foreign countries 
buy Canadian grain. All this adds up to $2.9 billion. Where is the 
equity in all this? For western grain producers, the government is 
prepared to pay $2.9 billion to save $860 million. But when the 
dairy producers subsidy was cut by $228 million, how much was 
paid in compensation? Not a penny.
<P>
	Mister Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture, 
48 per cent of all Canadian milk is produced in Quebec. That is 
what your notion of equity is all about. You and I can debate this in 
my riding of Frontenac.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I remind the hon. member that he must always 
address the Chair and everything will be fine.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien:</B> Mr. Speaker, you are absolutely right. I got 
carried away in the heat of the moment. Through the Chair, I am 
sending an invitation to the parliamentary secretary to come to the 
riding of Frontenac and debate the issue of his government's 
fairness-it will also be an opportunity for him to meet 
francophones.
<P>
	In conclusion, since it is 1.55 p.m. and question period is fast 
approaching, the Bloc Quebecois will support Bill  C-38. Of 
course, I hope our farm producers never have to use Bill C-38. It 
would be better if they had a decent income, even though I am well 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9876"> 9876 </A></B>
<P>
aware that a bad manager can have problems making the best use of 
a loan and paying it off.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, what I would like you to convey to the 
parliamentary secretary has to do with the appointment of 
mediators. For example, look at what is going on in my riding. 
Who was appointed to the employment insurance board of 
referees? Nathalie. Who will be the Liberal Party candidate? 
Manon. You see, everything makes sense. In small communities, 
people all know each other. These are partisan appointments. This 
week, I got quite a shock when I asked a witness about the salaries 
of the five Canadian Wheat Board commissioners. My colleagues 
and friends from the Reform Party were just as surprised as I was to 
learn that the commissioners' salaries range from $114,000 to 
$144,000 annually.
<P>
	Occasionally a member of Parliament is appointed to one of 
these boards after giving up his or her seat, to make room for 
someone who will eventually become minister. The federal 
government did that in two Quebec byelections, by bringing in 
newcomers who respectively became Minister of Human 
Resources Development and Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs. It seems the government is about to do the same in the 
riding of Beauce, to make room for its candidate.
<P>
	In the end, who pays for this? The answer is always the same: the 
taxpayers. Mr. Speaker, I am co-operating with you by concluding 
my speech and confirming that, in the interest of our farmers, we 
will support Bill C-38.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being now almost 2 p.m., we will resume debate 
after oral question period. We will now proceed to statements by 
members.

	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last month I 
introduced into the House Bill C-391, which would seek to amend 
the Criminal Code to increase the maximum sentence for child sex 
offenders to a life sentence with no possibility of parole for 25 
years.
<P>
	While it seems doubtful that this bill will pass before this 
Parliament completes its work, I want to assure my constituents 
that I remain committed to this issue. We must send a strong 
message to those who prey on our children that their actions will 
result in a life behind bars. A maximum penalty at present of ten 
years is simply not enough for someone who steals and 
manipulates the innocence of youth.

continue to pursue this issue in the future.

<P>
	Competition was fierce as teams vied for provincial honours. As 
one of the judges, I was impressed with the depth of knowledge, the 
spirit of competitiveness and the ability of the participants to 
articulate their responses. These students are a reflection of parents 
who care enough to instil in their children a quest for knowledge 
and fair play.
<P>
	The commitment and confidence shown by these young people 
prove that our future is in good hands.
<P>
	Good luck to the Leduc Composite Reach team in the national 
finals. I know they will prove to be a formidable force in 
Vancouver but, win or lose, they have made their parents,

communities across the country will pay tribute to their volunteers 
and reflect on the countless ways in which they help individuals, 
organizations and causes.
<P>
	Volunteering is a prime example of active citizenship. It helps 
build a sense of community, of belonging, of being a part of this

quality of life for all of us, volunteers are a crucial component of 
every community.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage works with a wide

promote national volunteer week, an integral part of the

	In this year's budget the finance minister affirmed: ``Our 
commitment to the principles contained in the Canada Health Act 
is unequivocal. These principles will be maintained''. This echoed 
the Prime Minister's promise in the throne speech to ensure the 
future of our publicly financed health care system.
<P>
	Since then the opposition parties have been tripping over each 
other to pay lip service to health care. It is one thing to make grand 
statements about the importance of medicare but what really 
matters is making sure we have the plan to pay for it.
<P>
	Through good money management our government has provided 
the means to preserve and strengthen our social programs. By 
meeting and beating our deficit targets every year since taking 
office we have been able to put words into practice, committing 
some $300 million over the next three years to promote health care 
in Canada.

Hemophilia Society in improving treatment for bleeding disorders

	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the 1950s and 1960s were good years for Canadians. We had the 
opportunity for employment of choice, more earnings were in our 
pockets and we respected our justice system, and so on.
<P>
	Since the early 1970s the traditional parties have applied their 
Liberal and Conservative political philosophies in such a manner 
causing Canadians to lose ground in their day to day lifestyles. For 
example, these  parties have passed legislation that has eroded the 
opportunity for employment of choice to almost none, reduced the 
amount of money that we retain in our pockets and so on.
<P>
	The United Nations may have said that Canada is the best 
country to live in but the majority of Canadians are saying even 
best can be better. We have been there and we can get there again. 
We have the resources and after 20 years of traditional party 
mismanagement we have the motivation.
<P>

Reform Party has the plan.

	<B>Mr. Elijah Harper (Churchill, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to advise that the Liberal government recently signed the 100th 
tripartite policing agreement under the First Nations policing 
policy with the Shoal Lake First Nation in Saskatchewan. The First 
Nations policing policy provides First Nations policing services 
that are professional, effective and accountable to the community.
<P>
	This policy represents the federal government's commitment to 
working with First Nations. But in Manitoba only one of these 
agreements has been signed and that was with the Dakota Ojibway 
Tribal Council. Many First Nations in my riding are ready to talk 
seriously with the Manitoba government about tripartite policing 
agreements but they are getting nowhere.

and we will accommodate them''.
<P>
	As a Quebecer, I think Lucien Bouchard has incredible nerve 
abandoning his responsibilities as premier of Quebec for over one 
month in order to volunteer his services to help the Bloc Quebecois 
campaign.
<P>
	In light of the very difficult social and economic situation in 
which Quebec finds itself, the premier perhaps has better things to 
do than warm up crowds for the member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie. Is this how they govern? Or, better yet, if 
the members of the Bloc Quebecois are looking for a good slogan

``scum'' from the Bloc Quebecois benches, when the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs rose to vote.
<P>
	Intolerance and personal insults of this type are unacceptable in 
an open and democratic society. These labels are all the more 
unacceptable coming from a sector of this House dedicated to 
destroying the very country those members have a mandate to

<P>
	A household name across North America, K.D. Lang is just one 
of a long line of Canadian entertainers who have not shied from the 
challenge of succeeding on the world stage. She is living proof that 
Canadian musicians can and do compete with anybody anywhere, 
not because of government assistance or policy but because of 
doing what they are good at.

of the long knives in April 1982. The Constitution, which does not 
acknowledge Quebec and restricts it powers, was unanimously 
rejected by the National Assembly of the day.
<P>
	The people of Quebec must remember that the present Prime 
Minister was the one who made a promise in the last referendum 
debate to recognize distinct society in the Constitution, a veto for 
Quebec, and respect for areas of jurisdiction. That same Prime 
Minister reneged on his promises as soon as the referendum threat 
was past.

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9880"> 9880 </A></B>
<P>
was in Ottawa, and the Canadian  government patriated the 
Constitution against the wishes of the Government of Quebec, the 
Quebec National Assembly and the vast majority of Quebecers.
<P>
	I would like to ask the Prime Minister or the Acting Prime 
Minister the following question: How can he say the Constitution 
of 1982 is legitimate, when Quebec, when no government in 
Quebec, whether headed by sovereignists or federalists, ever 
recognized this Constitution?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, since the Constitution Act, 1982 has been in effect for 
15 years, we can now judge the tree by its fruits.
<P>
	This Constitution brought us the Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
and is popular throughout Canada, including Quebec. It has 
reinforced the control of provinces over their natural resources; it 
has strengthened the position of French across Canada in its rights 
and freedoms-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dion: </B>-it has enshrined equalization, nearly half of which 
goes to Quebec, and has also provided for a bilateral amending 
process, when necessary, involving the Parliament of Canada and a 
provincial legislature.
<P>
	That is not bad. Of course there is room for improvement. For 
instance, we could have a better amending formula, better 
recognition of Quebec. There is always room for improvement, but 
on the whole, it is quite an achievement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is rather sad to see members from Quebec applaud the 
Constitution of 1982, and I think of the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration who was part of a government that never recognized 
this Constitution, and the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, a former assistant to Claude Ryan, who condemned 
this Constitution. This is what happens to some Quebecers when 
they become ministers in Ottawa.
<P>
	The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, I assume, is the 
Acting Prime Minister today. I agree, we must judge the tree by its 
fruits. Does the minister want us to forget the past, the role his own 
leader, the Prime Minister, has played for 30 years? Does he want 
us to forget that the Prime Minister's entire career was marked by 
his systematic opposition to Quebec? Does he want us to forget that 
this Prime Minister spent his entire career trying to put Quebec 
down and put it in its place? How can the minister expect 
Quebecers to be proud of what the Liberal Party of Canada 
perpetrated in 1982?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think the sarcastic remarks we just heard are 
irresponsible. I will simply say that we  owe this Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms to the Minister of Justice at the time.
<P>
	I may also recall that, at that time, Quebecers were more inclined 
to support the Prime Minister of Canada, as was borne out by the 
polls. There has been a lot of mythologizing in this respect. I think 
that some day we should have a substantive debate on the 
Constitution Act, 1982, and the ensuing benefits for Canada, 
including Quebec. I wish they would stop demonizing the current 
Prime Minister and that some day we could have an intelligent 
debate on the future of Quebec within Canada. It is very difficult to 
have one now, considering what was said by the Leader of the 
Opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would have liked to have this debate with the Prime 
Minister on this very day, 15 years after the patriation of the 
Constitution. I would have liked that very much.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	If the minister wants this debate, is he willing to let federal 
Liberal members go to every riding in Quebec, and sign this 
Constitution on behalf of Quebecers and defend it against Quebec 
sovereignists and federalists who never accepted this Constitution?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, they are demonizing the Constitution. They are 
incapable of discussing this calmly to see what exactly is so 
appalling. If we showed it to the UN, would they say: ``Good 
heavens, this Constitution is unacceptable from the human rights 
point of view''.
<P>
	Of course not. They could not do that, nor could they say that the 
province of Quebec does not have very broad responsibilities, 
compared with what we see in other federations. They could never 
say the federation has not been decentralized since 1982. It has 
been decentralized in several areas and we are clarifying the roles 
of the various levels of government. Only yesterday, in the case of 
British Columbia, we signed an agreement clarifyibg the roles of 
governments in fisheries.
<P>
	Good federalism is clarifying roles with respect to manpower, 
the environment and social housing. But of course the opposition is 
not interested in such a debate. They only want to demonize what 
has been done by the present Prime Minister.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 15 
years after the Constitution was unilaterally patriated, after two 
abortive attempts at constitutional reform, after a series of unkept 
promises made on the eve of the 1995 referendum, the federal 
government has nothing more to offer Quebecers. It has therefore 
decided to take the hard line and fight the Quebecers' right to self 
determination.
<P>

<P>
	I would like to ask the Prime Minister or whomever is replacing 
him whether he acknowledges that there is a constitutional 
problem given that no government in Quebec, federalist or 
sovereignist, has wanted to recognize the Canadian Constitution 
in the past 15 years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it would indeed be desirable to reach an agreement 
that would enable a Quebec government that believed in Canada to 
return to the constitutional fold. There is no disagreement on that 
point.
<P>
	The disagreement is as follows: Do we judge Canada and its 
blessings solely on a dispute over certain aspects of the 
Constitution? In my opinion, this would be a serious mistake. 
Instead, we should look at what Quebecers and Canadians have 
accomplished together, at how the country we built together is the 
envy of billions of people, and ask ourselves how we got here. We 
should look especially at what giving up the solidarity uniting them 
in a great federation means to Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
rather surprising to hear the Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs 
say that neither Bourassa nor Johnson believed in Canada. It is very 
surprising indeed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne: </B>Does the person replacing the Prime Minister 
acknowledge that it is the current Prime Minister who is guilty of 
going against the wishes of Quebecers in 1982, that all attempts to 
rectify the situation since have failed and that the only solution this 
government accepts is to ensure that Quebec no longer has the 
means to decide its own future?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think I already answered all those questions.
<P>
	I will have to repeat what I said, but I realize that it is impossible 
to find out from the Bloc Quebecois exactly what it is they do not 
like in the Constitution Act, 1982.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dion:</B> We have said that we would prefer an amending 
formula giving a veto to all the major regions in the country and 
ensuring stronger recognition of Quebec in the Constitution.
<P>
	We are in fact trying to convince all Canadians of this. Generally 
speaking, however, the Constitution is a good one. That does not 
preclude our moving forward and enjoying a quality of life that is 
among the highest in the world. It does not preclude our 
recognizing that we can reach the point where the OECD says we 
are one of the countries in the best economic health to face the new 
century.
<P>
	Would we have all this if we did not help each other as 
Canadians? This is the real issue, and we are prevented from 
debating it with the people whose sole focus is to demonize the 
Prime Minister.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it seems we have all been transported to the set of ``Let's 
Make A Deal''. It is like this country is suddenly being governed by 
Prime Minister Monty Hall. Pearson, salmon, cod, patronage 
appointments, government handouts galore. The only people who 
will not be walking away with a Liberal gift in the next little while 
are the 1.4 million unemployed Canadians.
<P>
	Since the Prime Minister appears so preoccupied with passing 
out his pre-election goodies, what does he have to offer the 1.4 
million unemployed Canadians in the country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
whenever we go to the people we can offer the success in creating 
close to 800,000 jobs and the pledge that we will build on that to do 
much better than ever could be contemplated by the discredited 
Reform Party program.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the fact is that the country currently has the worst string of 
jobless numbers since the great depression. That is a fact and the 
government knows it. One would think the Liberals would be 
trying to come up with some new ways to put Canadians back to 
work, but the government is so void of ideas that it wants to call an 
election after only three and a half years in office.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister have anything new to offer unemployed 
Canadians or does he still believe, as he said during the CBC town 
hall meeting, that some are lucky, some are unlucky and that's just 
life?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the hon. member and the members of his party were truly 
concerned about the plight of the unemployed, they would have 
supported the government when it brought in the infrastructure 
program, when it brought in programs to deal with tourism, when it 
brought in programs to deal with education, when it brought in 
programs to deal with research and development.
<P>
	The fact is the Reform Party voted against every single measure, 
whether youth unemployment or summer jobs. Every measure the 
government brought in the Reform Party opposed. On the other 
hand, it is understandable why it has opposed these measures. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9882"> 9882 </A></B>
<P>
House leader  made a reference to what the Reform Party has had to 
say about its program for the unemployed.
<P>
	I quote from the taxpayers' budget, which is the Reform Party 
talking about what it would do: ``The short term employment 
impact of the Reform Party program is negative but manageable''. 
How much unemployment is manageable? How much human 
suffering is the Reform Party prepared to put up with? How much 
degradation of families from coast to coast does the Reform Party 
want to recommend in order to put in place its archaic policies?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister can huff and puff and bluff all he wants. He 
can talk about documents that are years old. We could go back to 
when the government was in opposition and see what it said when it 
was over on this side. That is the debate that will occur in the next 
election and I look forward to that.
<P>
	In the past three and a half years the Liberals have done little to 
put Canadians back to work. The minister talked about programs. I 
guess there were not enough canoe museums, hotels and armouries 
to go around, only enough for Shawinigan. There are 1.4 million 
unemployed, two million to three million underemployed and one 
in four Canadians worried about losing the job they have today. 
That is the Liberal legacy.
<P>
	In 1993 the Prime Minister said that he had the plan. Is his only 
plan in 1997 to have all the unemployed move to Shawinigan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the ink is barely dry on the two-year-old taxpayers' budget and 
already Reformers deny it. Is there no policy the Reform Party will 
stand behind?
<P>
	The taxpayers' budget is two years old and we reject it. The false 
start, six months old, we reject it.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	Time and time again members of the Reform Party stand up in 
this House and deny what other members of the Reform Party have 
said. It is why so many of them have already decided to leave.
<P>
	Every single policy reform of the Reform Party contradicts 
itself. The only consistent factor the Reform Party puts forward is 
its inconsistency.
<P>
	We will match any one of our budgets against anything that we 
have said. We stand behind our first budget. We stand behind our

our fourth budget. We look forward to bringing in four more.

Speaker, for months now, the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs has been saying there must be a reasonable consensus 
before the government can go ahead with the constitutional 
amendment requested by Quebec. Yesterday, he finally admitted 
that there was consensus on the issue in Quebec, but that he would 
do everything in his power to include Alliance Quebec in that 
consensus.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that the only reason his 
government is requiring public hearings on the eve of a federal 
election is to satisfy a pressure group, Alliance Quebec, an ally of 
the federal Liberals, whose view it values more than that of all 
allophone, anglophone and francophone MNAs, who were 
democratically elected in Quebec and who voted unanimously in 
the National Assembly?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday it was still good news. The Government of 
Canada said that it supported the proposal to amend the 
Constitution put forward by Quebec. We approve it and we are 
going to defend it. This will be done: it is still good news.
<P>
	What is so scandalous about having a parliamentary committee 
on an issue as important as this one, which involves language, 
religion and education? Why is this a problem? Why is the official 
opposition unable to accept good news? Is it because it is afraid 
that good news, by definition, will be interpreted by Quebec as 
additional proof of the benefits of a united Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, instead of rambling on, the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs should repeat what he said yesterday on RDI. He said that 
people would have to vote Liberal in the next election if they 
wanted the constitutional amendment to be approved, because it 
would not be done before the election. That is what he said.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is blackmail.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is truly unacceptable and 
shameless blackmail.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. Will he 
admit that he can, if he wishes, pull out all the stops and have his 
government approve the constitutional amendment before the 
election, even if it means postponing it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
First of all, Mr. Speaker, I note that the  official opposition is 
applauding the idea of voting Liberal. That is already progress.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9883"> 9883 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, what I said was that, if in fact it cannot be done before 
the election, people will know that if they vote for the Liberals they 
are voting for candidates that support the amendment. It will be an 
interesting piece of information. I fail to see how it is such a 
problem
<P>
	And finally, as for how long it will take, it will take far less time 
than it took the Government of Quebec. The Government of 
Quebec, which was elected in September 1994, only put the 
proposal forward last February 7, only presented the exact wording 
of the amendment March 24, and only approved it last Tuesday, 
after waiting six days for the leader of the official opposition to 
come back from holiday.

creation policy?

finance small and medium sized business pork-barrelling? Is $50 
million put into the Farm Credit Corporation to help with rural 
diversification pork-barrelling? Is $800 million put into the 
Foundation for Innovation so that Canadian universities and 
teaching hospitals can spawn the new economy pork-barrelling? 
Are tuition credits, helping students to go back to school and 
helping parents to save for their children's education 
pork-barrelling?
<P>
	No. It is the result of sound policy that will build a great country. 
The Reform Party ought to get on board.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we just 
heard the Minister of Finance brag about all this new spending 
when taxpayers cannot afford to pay their own  bills, much less the 
bill for taxes that he wants to squeeze out of them.
<P>
	Let us listen to the record. Unemployment insurance premiums 
are up by $900 million. Corporate tax revenues are up $1.3 billion. 
Revenues from the GST are up $700 million. Other revenues are up 
$1.3 billion. And the list goes on. He has even squeezed taxpayers 
for $3.5 billion more in personal taxes.

	What are cash strapped Canadians getting in return for all this 
extra money, other than the worst string of jobless numbers since 
the great depression and a pitiful job creation program?

us take a look at what has happened.
<P>
	Since we have taken office unemployment insurance premiums, 
which under the Conservatives were supposed to go to $3.30, are 
now down to $2.90. The last three years the Tories were in power 
they went up every year. We have brought them down the last three 
years.
<P>
	The hon. member wants to talk about tax cuts. How about the tax 
cuts and the credits that were given to students to enable them to go 
back to school? How about the tax credits given to disabled 
Canadians to level the playing field? How about $600 million in 
new tax credits for poor children to give them a decent shot?
<P>
	The hon. member objects to the fact that the government's 
revenues from corporations are going up. He ought to understand 
that they are going up because business is better and the economy is 
booming. That is a good thing. It is not a bad thing.

<P>
	Pearson was not the only airport the government invested in. 
What about the Calgary airport? Is the hon. member against us 
spending money to improve capital safety projects and 
environmental projects at that airport? How about Edmonton and 
the $127 million spent on that airport? What about the $45 million 
spent on the Vancouver airport? What about the $120 million spent 
on the Montreal airport?

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Two months ago, the official opposition pointed out to the 
minister that his deficit projections of $19 billion for the 1996-97 
fiscal year seemed totally wrong. The minister refused to admit his 
mistake and tried to tell us that, in the two months that would 
follow, the figures might vary enormously. Now, the figures are in 
for 11 months out of 12, and they show that the deficit stands at 
$7.8 billion, which is far below the minister's forecasts.
<P>
	Either the minister voluntarily overestimated his deficit to make 
the major cuts imposed on the provinces and the unemployed more 
palatable, or the government is in the dark and the minister is 
incapable of coming up with a credible forecast. Which is it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as 
the hon. member knows, when I tabled the budget, I said that the 
deficit for the current year would not exceed-meaning it will be 
below-$19 billion, and it is definitely the case.
<P>
	I also said that we did not have the figures for the months of 
January, February and March. We still do not have the figures for 
March. When we get these figures, we will certainly have a clearer 
picture.
<P>
	I should also remind the member that, historically speaking, 
there always are adjustments ranging from $4 billion to $6 billion 
at the end of the year. Finally, the member should know that the 
fact that the deficit is going down is not bad news but good news.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, given that 84 per cent of the deficit reduction for the 
first 11 months was achieved at the expense of unemployed 
workers, welfare recipients, sick  people and students, it is a bit 
ridiculous for the other side to applaud.
<P>
	Since the minister has more room to manoeuvre every month, to 
the point where he will achieve a zero deficit by the year 2000, will 
he pledge to pay back the money he took from the provinces and 
from unemployed workers, welfare recipients, sick people and 
students?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
think the hon. member has the wrong government in mind. He may 
be referring to some provincial governments, but certainly not to 
this government.
<P>
	The first reason why we are ahead is because we did not have to 
use our contingency reserve. The second reason is that our 
revenues are on the rise, because the economy is on rise. The third 
reason is that our interest rates are lower than expected. Again, this 
is all good news.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FARMDEBTMEDIATIONACT">FARM DEBT MEDIATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-38, 
an act to provide for mediation between insolvent farmers and their 
creditors, to amend the Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative 
Monetary Penalties Act and to repeal the Farm Debt Review Act, 
be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today on Bill C-38, the farm debt mediation act. 
The purpose of the bill is to change the farm debt review legislation 
and replace this decade old legislation with a review board system 
which involves a mediation type service for farmers who are facing 
seizure of their property by creditors.
<P>
	First I will discuss the legislation currently in place and then the 
changes that have been made to it. After that I will discuss issues 
related to the farm debt review bill.  The main provisions of this 
legislation put in place a review of a farmer's financial affairs, as 
there was in the old act and the provision of mediation between 
farmers and creditors to replace the old system which was far more 
adversarial. I am very familiar with that system. I have worked 
through it with some farmers.
<P>
	The bill puts in place an order temporarily suspending the right 
of creditors to continue proceedings against farmers. The intent of 
this legislation more than anything else is to hold off creditors that 
are knocking at the door if the farmers and the board feel there is a 
possibility of working out a deal that will be beneficial to the 
creditors and the farmer involved. That is the purpose of the act.
<P>
	The new system would replace the appointed panel members 
with mediators who would be hired after a bidding process. It 
allows a farmer facing insolvency to apply for up to a 30-day stay 
of proceedings. Then a farmer could renew this 30-day stay of 
proceedings for up to a total of 120 days.
<P>
	In complicated cases, an expert on debt and the reorganization of 
debt could be hired to prepare an assessment of the farmer's 
situation. That was done under the old system as well.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	The main change in the process is to move to a system which 
involves more mediation. In fact I know from personal experience 
that in many of the cases under the old system it did work more like 
a mediation process. In a way this formalizes the process that was 
being used before this change to the act.
<P>
	The appeal board is made up of farmers who are considered to be 
financial experts and would be available to hear complaints about 
decisions and to grant, extend or to terminate proceedings. That is 
what this legislation is about.
<P>
	The Reform Party's policy, even before the last election, 
supports measures by government to give farmers the instruments 
necessary to create more self-reliance. Farmers have used these 
instruments. Some have been available for some time. Farmers 
have used them extremely well and are far more capable now of 
working through complex financial situations, the reorganization 
of debt and situations like that, than they were a few years ago.
<P>
	Unfortunately part of the reason they have become so good at 
reorganizing debt is that some of them have had to do it several 
times. Agriculture has gone through extremely tough times. 
Unfortunately, governments-it is not just this Liberal government 
but the Conservative government before as well-have put in place 
legislation and programs which have damaged farmers 
immeasurably.
<P>
	It is very unfortunate that we even need legislation that is geared 
to helping farmers reorganize debt or geared to  finding some way 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9889"> 9889 </A></B>
<P>
of working with creditors so they have something left should they 
have financial failure and should the creditors come to collect. I put 
the blame for that clearly at the feet of governments and again, not 
just this government. Certainly past Conservative governments 
have put in several programs which have made things much worse 
for farmers and which have distorted the market so badly that 
farmers really do not have the opportunity to work within a free 
enterprise market situation. Instead they have had to work under 
the framework laid out by these various government programs. 
That has harmed the competitive ability of Canadian farmers 
immeasurably.
<P>
	Liberal governments before the Conservatives were in power 
and this current Liberal government have to share some of the 
blame for those programs which have replaced the market situation 
which would be much healthier for farmers.
<P>
	While this legislation makes some improvements to the farm 
debt review board act, it does not solve the main problem that 
farmers face today. The main problem that farmers face today 
directly stems from governments becoming too involved in the 
agriculture industry. I am not just talking about the Canadian 
government, although the Canadian government is certainly guilty 
of this and has been for the past 20 to 30 years. I am also talking 
about foreign governments. The European governments have 
dumped completely unfairly on markets around the world that 
under a competitive situation, under a fair trade situation, would 
have been markets for Canadian farmers.
<P>
	In the grain industry, for example, the American government 
with its export enhancement program depressed world markets 
around the world. Canadian governments, Liberal, Conservative 
and now Liberal again, have put in place programs that make it 
difficult for farmers to do business. That is what they want to do. 
Farmers have no choice with the present trade agreements.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	We have moved to some extent back to the free enterprise system 
that farmers want, but we have a long way to go and the 
government certainly has not helped to accommodate that change. 
It should be chastized for that.
<P>
	I mentioned in my opening remarks that I know how the old 
Farm Debt Review Act works. I have seen how the panels work. In 
some cases it has helped farmers work through some very difficult 
situations. Unfortunately in most cases it involves the farmers 
going out of business. At least in some cases they can go out of 
business without having to carry debt beyond the end of their 
farming business.
<P>
	In other cases there have been successes. Some farmers who 
have used the farm debt review board have  managed to keep their 
farms. In some cases they rent the land from the Farm Credit 
Corporation, which became the owner as a result of the farm debt 
review board process. The farmers were able to farm the land. In 
some cases they were able to buy the land from the Farm Credit 
Corporation and other creditors.
<P>
	The old Farm Debt Review Act worked in some cases. It was 
good for some farmers. At the same time it considered what the 
creditors wanted. It succeeded in getting farmers and creditors 
together to try to work out a deal which would be beneficial to both.
<P>
	On the other hand, this program involves a lot of overlap with 
provincial programs which are already in place. I have personal 
experience. I was hired as a consultant by Alberta agriculture to 
work with farmers. I know the Farm Debt Review Act duplicated 
the services which were offered by the province and by the private 
sector. The duplication was completely unnecessary. Unfortunately 
that will continue with the new act. In many cases it puts the federal 
government into provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	The services that the mediator and others in the process offer to 
farmers to work out a deal with creditors are being provided by 
private consultants and provincial governments. The provinces 
have hired farmers on a contract basis to do the work. There is a lot 
of duplication.
<P>
	Ten years ago when the Farm Debt Review Act was put in place 
it served a purpose. However, the provinces were fulfilling that role 
much better than the federal legislation. In the late 1980s farmers 
were being forced out of business as a result of government 
involvement in markets, which was depressing the prices at 
alarming rates.
<P>
	I believe there was a role for provincial governments. Private 
consultants were not available and they certainly were not trained 
to the level which would allow them to help farmers work through 
their problems. For provincial governments to get involved made 
sense back then. They provided a service.
<P>
	I worked for Alberta agriculture. I worked with dozens and 
dozens of farmers as a business management consultant. I helped 
them work through their difficult situations.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	I have often worked with creditors just as a go between to try to 
work out a deal, sometimes very successfully but in many cases 
unfortunately completely unsuccessfully in terms of saving the 
business. However, often the farmers who were leaving the 
business because they were being forced out ended up with 
something. They had a little something to help them.
<P>
	I think that was a useful service. I really wonder about the 
necessity of duplicating that service. I now know that  private 
consultants are far better trained, are there and are quite willing to 
help farmers to work through these very difficult situations and, 
more important, to work with farmers before the situations become 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9890"> 9890 </A></B>
<P>
so desperate that they go to the farm debt review board or to this 
new farm mediation system.
<P>
	I do think there are some improvements in this legislation. For 
some of the reasons I mentioned earlier this legislation does 
provide a better framework. However, I have some specific 
concerns on the amount of money involved. My first concern is that 
the budget for this process is way too high. It is not just an arbitrary 
judgment that I make. Right now the Saskatchewan farm debt 
review board handles about half of all the cases in Canada and the 
cost is $700,000. Yet the budget for this new new farm debt board 
is $2.2 million. It leads one to ask if this government is anticipating 
that the load of farmers needing this service will increase 
dramatically. There has to be a reason for a budget being much 
higher than would seem to make sense when one considers the 
current budget.
<P>
	One has to ask whether this government really does anticipate 
that more farmers are going to end up in serious financial trouble 
and will need the services of this act to work through financial 
difficulty, which usually ends in farmers being forced out of 
business and losing, in many cases, all their assets but at least not 
having to carry debt beyond the termination of their business.
<P>
	As members would know, many Reform MPs are farmers or 
were before they got into this business. Of 52 members of 
Parliament, we have somewhere between 14 and 17 members who 
have a farming background, own farms or have worked in the 
agriculture industry. That is a real high number for a caucus of 52. 
When we have meetings dealing with agricultural issues it is not 
unusual, as we have had many times in the past, to have 14 to 16 
Reform MPs at these meetings. The interest in agriculture certainly 
cannot be equaled in any caucus. The level of expertise on 
agriculture certainly cannot and is not equalled in any other caucus 
in the House.
<P>
	The importance that the Reform caucus places on agriculture, on 
farmers, on ranchers and on others in agricultural business is not 
equalled by any other caucus in this country. We have shown a 
commitment to farmers and we are going to continue to do that. We 
ask farmers, as we ask all other Canadians going into the election, 
which seems certain to be coming quite soon, to look at everyone's 
platforms. We ask them to take a good look at the platforms that are 
being offered in agriculture and in other areas by all the political 
parties. I then ask them to look at the Reform platform and 
compare it to the platforms offered by others in the agriculture area 
and other areas.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	Let us have the election fought on issues, not on labels that one 
party tries to pin on another. Let us not have an  election with name 
calling and dirty politics. I invite any other political party to 
compare what we offer in agriculture and in the the rest of our 
platform to theirs. If that comparison takes place during the 
election campaign, Reform will form the government after the 
election.
<P>
	All I ask is that the political parties compare platforms so that 
Canadians can compare platforms and vote for whomever has the 
best ideas, the best policies, the best people to carry them out and 
the best leader. I believe it will prove to be the Reform Party.
<P>
	Another problem with the legislation is that there is too much 
political patronage. That should not be a big surprise because 
members throughout the day have been pointing out Liberal 
patronages one after the other; all Liberals appointed to the Senate 
since they came to office. It is unbelievable.
<P>
	Even under the Mulroney government there was an elected 
Senator, Stan Waters of Alberta. He happened to be a Reform 
member. But what is important is that he was elected to the Senate. 
A precedent was set.
<P>
	British Columbia has legislation to accommodate elected 
senators. The premier of British Columbia has asked that senators 
be elected. Albertans and the Government of Alberta have asked 
for elected senators. And what do we get? Every senator since the 
election has been replaced by patronage appointees by the Prime 
Minister. That is completely unacceptable. That is just the start of 
the list of patronage appointments. It goes on and on. I am not 
going to get into the list because I do not have time in my 
presentation today.
<P>
	This legislation just sets up space for more patronage 
appointments. That is completely unacceptable. That alone is 
reason enough to not support the bill. We do not want to support 
anything which would allow more spots to be filled by patronage 
appointments.
<P>
	This legislation is a minor one, acknowledged. It makes minor 
changes to the existing Farm Debt Review Act. It is really dealing 
with a small issue in terms of how many people it affects and it 
should be dealing with important issues. At least it does offer some 
changes to improve the existing Act.
<P>
	I want to congratulate the government for those particular 
changes. On the other hand, as I have said, there a lot of other 
things that should have been changed but were not. There is $2.2 
million in the budget, but if we could trust that the government had 
any ability to forecast accurately, I think farmers should be very 
concerned because the budget is way beyond what should be 
required when we consider the present costs.
<P>
	Instead of dealing with this legislation just before an election, 
the government should be dealing with some serious legislation to 
improve grain transportation which would allow competition in the 
grain transportation system, allow some recourse for farmers to 
make the  railways and grain handlers accountable. But it is not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9891"> 9891 </A></B>
<P>
doing that. The government should be dealing with legislation that 
would get rid of the wheat board monopoly and instead improve the 
wheat board to make it accountable to farmers and to give farmers 
an option to either market their products through the wheat board 
or a grain company or on their own. The government did not do 
that, therefore we are debating this legislation. Much more 
important legislation should have been debated than this. For that 
reason I will not take any more time on this legislation.

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are not 
many farmers in the riding of Lévis, but I wanted to speak in this 
debate nevertheless. In any case, whenever we talk about 
agriculture in the House of Commons, I have a particular interest in 
the subject for two reasons.
<P>
	As a farmer's son, I was aware of these problems from an early 
age. Reform Party members just said there were a lot of problems 
in the agriculture and agri-food sectors in Canada today, and 
especially in Quebec. Why? Because we do not get our fair share of 
federal spending on agriculture, although we contribute 24 per 
cent.
<P>
	Today we are discussing Bill C-38, an act to provide for 
mediation between insolvent farmers and their creditors. We are 
talking about this because there is an increasing number of farmers 
with serious financial problems, in Quebec and in Canada. Why do 
they have so many financial problems? Because they must operate 
within an international free trade context which is hard on farmers. 
And also because the federal government's policies have brought a 
number of farmers close to bankruptcy and in many cases have 
pushed them over the brink.
<P>
	This bill, although not perfect, has the effect of alleviating to 
some extent the untenable situation of certain farmers. Farmers 
today have to invest and go deeper and deeper into debt. To have a 
viable operation, they have to increase their acreage and expand 
their operations by buying their neighbour's land. Where I used to 
live, there were seven or eight farmers, but today there is only one 
farm, one operation.
<P>
	An individual who has to manage all that has to incur enormous 
debts and take enormous risks, considering the fact that there is no 
new generation waiting in the wings. People are not lining up to 
continue this agricultural tradition. Why not? Because of the 
enormous investment involved.
<P>
	You have to have a vocation. You almost have to be a missionary 
today to be a farmer. It is a very demanding occupation. As the 
Bloc Quebecois critic, the hon. member for Frontenac, said this 
morning, it is a seven-day-a-week job. It is as demanding as being a 
member of Parliament. We have to be here during the  week and in 
our ridings on the weekend to take part in all kinds of activities. It 
is very demanding.
<P>
	But do not expect any sympathy from farmers. No Quebec 
farmers will pity us because of the hours we work, because for 
years they have been used to working long hours to support their 
families. If everything works out, when he is old enough to retire, 
the farmer manages to convince his son or daughter or several sons 
to take over the farm and take out a farm loan, and then perhaps he 
will be able to enjoy his retirement.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	But for 30 or maybe 40 years, the farmer and his wife have to 
work very hard. I mention the farm wives because, if there is any 
sector in Quebec that is a prime example of a family enterprise, it is 
farming.
<P>
	Farm wives deserve as much praise as their husbands. The work 
has been divided up on the farm for years. Often the wife does the 
books, because the accounting is getting more and more 
complicated, and then there is all the paperwork to do with the 
milk.
<P>
	I grew up with that, so I know what I am talking about. But 
people often have no idea. I am sometimes horrified to hear city 
people, of which I am one myself now, people who deserve what 
they earn and have their own problems but do not have to work the 
hours that farmers do, making deplorable comments about farmers.
<P>
	They think the government heavily subsidizes agriculture and 
supports farmers. So many city folks make comments like this that 
they have an influence on the lawmakers and the people in 
government, especially the federal government, and end up 
convincing them that cuts to agriculture are justified.
<P>
	This opinion is shortsighted because, if agricultural subsidies are 
cut, if there is no help for farmers at the primary level, this will 
have repercussions in the processing industry and then at the 
tertiary level, where agricultural products are sold to consumers.
<P>
	I was listening earlier to our excellent agriculture critic, the hon. 
member for Frontenac, who often reminds us in the Bloc 
Quebecois of the importance of agriculture in Quebec, and no 
doubt in Canada as well, and in the West, as defended by the 
Reform Party. But we are not reminded often enough.
<P>
	Based on my years as the political assistant to Jean Garon, the 
Quebec minister of agriculture between the Parti Quebecois' assent 
to power in 1976 and 1996, I would have no hesitation in 
describing him as the best minister of agriculture Quebec has ever 
had. He developed a concept that was no longer agriculture, but the 
concept known as agri-food, which established the link between 
production, processing and marketing. That forms a whole.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9892"> 9892 </A></B>
<P>
	Mr. Garon used to talk about the importance of self-sufficiency 
and of buying our own products. This is vital. Why? Because it 
provided a living for more people in rural areas.
<P>
	Whatever problem there may be in rural communities in Canada 
is due to the fact that we have started to ignore agriculture. Without 
agriculture, the major rural areas could not survive, and I think the 
problem starts at the grassroots. In other words, we have lost sight 
of the problems of the farming community, of farm producers, of 
people who process farm products and of those who sell them. 
Things are very difficult in the context of globalization.
<P>
	This bill will ease things a bit for those in difficulty, because all 
too often we have seen people go bankrupt. I know you know how 
it works, but it always bears repeating. People get a farm loan, but 
they often must provide part of the financing themselves.
<P>
	Parents who want their children to take over the farm sometimes 
loan some of the proceeds from the sale of their property to their 
children so they can make up the difference. This means that, at 
some point, there are two loans outstanding: the farm loan and the 
parents' loan. The time comes when they cannot be repaid, the 
operation is no longer profitable, and some of them face 
bankruptcy.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	This legislation softens the edges. It provides for a new 
procedure to be established at the federal level to allow for 
mediation, so that people can make arrangements to keep the farm 
in operation before it reaches the point of going bankrupt.
<P>
	What good does it do to declare someone bankrupt if no one else 
wants to buy the property and this agricultural heritage, sometimes 
built over generations, has to be abandoned for wanting to get out 
from under a burden of debt that has become excessive for a 
family? I think this is a good idea.
<P>
	At report stage, the Bloc Quebecois, through its agriculture 
critic, the hon. member for Frontenac, put forward several 
amendments in committee. Like the third party, we had concerns. 
The whole issue of political patronage appointments, among other 
things, was of concern to us. We would like appointments to be 
made on a non-partisan basis, putting an end to the practice 
established in the federal government of rewarding defeated 
candidates by giving them a position. There will be plenty of them 
after the next election.
<P>
	I know that many expect to win in ridings where the hold of the 
Bloc Quebecois is very strong. Soon we will have some of these 
people sitting on the kind of board that Bill C-38 is seeking to 
establish.
<P>
	It is extremely difficult to wrest approval from the Liberals in 
committee, as is usually the case with the  government, for 
amendments put forward by the opposition, sovereignist members 
who are looking after the interests of Quebecers. They cannot 
support this kind of amendments, because they are in office. So, the 
amendments are lost.
<P>
	This does not prevent us from very objectively recognizing that 
this is a step in the right direction. Because it could save the 
taxpayers $1 million, we will vote in favour of this bill at third 
reading.
<P>
	The hon. member for Frontenac has pointed out a number of 
flaws, which were unfortunately not addressed. But when one 
cannot have the best, one has to settle for second best. Because this 
bill is an improvement over the existing legislation, we will 
support it.
<P>
	I would like to use the time I have left to remind the hon. 
members that, as I said at the beginning of my speech, Quebec is 
not getting its fair share of federal spending in agriculture. 
According to figures from the Quebec Department of Agriculture, 
Fisheries and Food, we get only about 10 per cent of the federal 
expenditures in that sector, or some $311 million.
<P>
	Yet, Quebec's contribution to Canadian revenues from 
agriculture represents about 16.4 per cent of the total. The figure 
goes up to 21.4 per cent if we take into account not just farm 
production itself, but the whole agri-food industry. In this case, if 
we take into account only the processing industry, the shortfall is 
increased by an additional $201 million.
<P>
	In the years 1985-86 to 1994-95, when the Conservatives were in 
office, federal expenditures in Quebec's agri-food industry 
represented only 9 per cent of the total. During the same period, 
agricultural revenues from our province amounted to 16.3 per cent 
of the total. So, for these 10 years, the cumulative shortfall for 
Quebec totalled $3 billion. I could go on.
<P>
	One might have thought the Liberals would have corrected the 
situation, but no. Things remain the same and Quebec is still being 
treated unfairly. Let me mention an important point. The figure of 
$3 billion resurfaces again. The government abolished the Crow's 
Nest rate. What was the result? They gave $3 billion in 
compensation to western farmers because that was what the 
Reform Party called for. In this case, Reform Party members 
deserve credit. They obtained $3 billion in compensation for 
western farmers. I do not know what those of us from Quebec did. 
We asked for our share of compensation as well. Instead of 
compensation, cuts were made to our agricultural sector.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	As it is, we are not receiving our fair share, and they are cutting 
again. They cut $107 million in 1995-96; in 1996-97, it was another 
$30 million, in addition to the other cuts; in 1997-98, it will be 
another $113 million. This is unacceptable. Consumers thought 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9893"> 9893 </A></B>
<P>
they were in  purgatory. Now they are headed for hell. Things keep 
getting worse. We must speak out before the next election.
<P>
	The point can never be made too strongly. It is true that Reform 
Party members have spoken about farming because they are 
looking out for western voters, but I say to them that in Quebec our 
farmers are suffering as well.
<P>
	At the federal level, despite the fact we represent 24 per cent of 
the population, we are not receiving our fair share. As long as we 
stay in this system, as long as the people of Quebec do not opt for 
sovereignty, we in the Bloc Quebecois will continue to ask for our 
fair share, because we are paying taxes here in Ottawa.
<P>
	We demand the equivalent of the $3 billion for the Crow rate 
buyout. Unfortunately, although this bill will ease the pain a little 
for a number of farmers, it resolves nothing. Canada's agriculture 
minister should show some backbone and resolve the problems; he 
should reach an agreement with the Government of Quebec to 
avoid duplication among other things.
<P>
	Yes, I applauded the amalgamation of the three federal food 
inspection agencies a few months ago in the House. One came 
under the Department of Health, another under the Department of 
Agriculture and a third under another department. They were 
combined into one agency.
<P>
	The fact is that it is essential that a stop be put to duplication in 
this sector and that Quebec receive financial compensation because 
it is closer to the people. You do not farm in an office in Ottawa. 
Raising cows, fishing and so on cannot be done in an office in 
Ottawa. The government must be closer to the community. The 
closest government is the Government of Quebec. Why not work 
together more, instead of structuring and regulating, which is 
sometimes of no use to Quebec?
<P>
	I will conclude by urging my colleagues opposite, those who, 
knowing Friday would soon be here, have unfortunately already 
left, to give the matter some thought. We may not speak about 
those who are absent, but there are not very many of us here today 
on Thursday to speak about agriculture, although it is an extremely 
important sector. If they want to do some more work on the 
economy, if the Prime Minister is serious when he talks about the 
economy and ``jobs, jobs, jobs'', he would deliver speeches aimed 
at the agricultural community.
<P>
	There is a line that is funny but true. When it comes to 
agriculture, certain Liberal ministers are behaving, as Jean Garon 
used to say, like mosquitos in a nudist colony; they do not know 
where to start. I apologize for this bit of humour, when the situation 
is so grim.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to Bill  C-38. Before 
I get into my speech I must commend my Bloc colleague for trying 
to impress on the House how important agriculture is to Quebec. It 
has always been appreciated by myself and other Reform MPs that 
Bloc members take such a unique interest in agriculture. They 
realize that we have to eat before we do anything else.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-38 is a quick way of fixing a farmer's problems. It 
decreases the time of suffering, but I still do not like to see that 
kind of thing happening.
<P>
	The Farm Debt Review Act was established in 1986 in response 
to exceptional circumstances. The late seventies and the 
mid-eighties were difficult times in the agriculture sector. Family 
after family was forced to leave farming because it was not 
profitable. Why was it not profitable? Because of too much 
government interference.
<P>
	Some members of Parliament will remember that in 1970 or 
1971 the Liberal government of Prime Minister Trudeau was 
elected. The slogan at that time was we will create a just society. 
That sounded good. Everybody in western Canada felt that maybe 
conditions for western farmers would be improved, as well as 
conditions for western processors and the special crops industry.
<P>
	The first thing that Liberal government did was increase the 
wages for grain handlers by 68 per cent in one shot. That was very 
extreme, although at that time their wages were probably not what 
they should have been.
<P>
	That started a whole series of problems. The next thing the 
government of the day did, because of low grain prices, was to 
establish a program known as the LIFT program. I do not know, 
Mr. Speaker, if you were around at that time or if you remember 
that program. That program was designed to encourage farmers to 
summer fallow their land and to decrease the supply. They were 
paid $8 an acre to summer fallow their farmland.
<P>
	That was a bad mistake. There was a crop failure the following 
year and the billion bushel surplus that everybody talked about, 
which was depressing prices, was gone. It was not there because of 
mismanagement in estimating what was held in reserve. That 
happened because three or four different grain companies in each 
town and each grain company, more or less, surveyed how many 
bushels were in the area, added them together and came up with an 
estimate which was three or four times higher than it should have 
been.
<P>
	In 1972 we had grain prices the likes of which had never been 
seen before. Prices of $1.50 per bushel jumped to $5 and $6 a 
bushel. It was inflation. The farmers did very well. They started to 
be optimistic. People were encouraged to spend money.
<P>
	The worst thing that happened was that government officials 
tried to encourage farmers to specialize. If a  farmer wanted to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9894"> 9894 </A></B>
<P>
borrow money to improve his milk herd, or dairy operation or hog 
operation and wanted $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000, the Farm Credit 
Corporation would say: ``No way. You have to get your act together 
and direct your energies toward one operation''. If you did not 
borrow at least $50,000 or $100,000 you were denied the loan.
<P>
	That gave farmers the direction to specialize. We saw small 
operations being closed down and bigger operations starting. 
Before we realized it, many farmers had a debt load that was 
beyond servicing when interest rates started, all of a sudden, to 
jump because of the money supply.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	If I had not have been out of the country in 1981 and seen what 
inflation did in other countries, I probably would not have realized 
how detrimental it was to our country. However, when 24 per cent 
interest rates developed and farmers had debt loads of between 
$100,000 and $200,000, their debt load increased by one-quarter 
each year and they were unable to service that debt load.
<P>
	This was the just society. I do not know if it was a just society for 
the bankers, the financiers or for whom. At that time I know there 
was a big debate on whether we should do away with the Crow and 
whether we should do certain other things.
<P>
	I will never forget a program I was watching one night called 
<I>Front Page Challenge</I>. Members might remember Mr. Gordon 
Sinclair who was one of the specialists on the program. They were 
talking about the huge recession in the country. All of a suddenMr. Sinclair could not sit still any more and said: ``What recession? 
Twenty-four per cent interest rates. What recession?'' The financial 
institutions and investors were making huge profits. People did not 
realize we were losing farmers and business people left and right.
<P>
	I will never forget the comic made out of the huge Liberal milk 
cow. Mr. Speaker, you might remember that picture. It showed this 
huge Liberal milk cow and the western farmers were feeding it as 
fast as they could. They were scrawny, poor, overworked and 
looked almost like skeletons compared to the huge cow. While the 
farmers in the west were feeding this huge Liberal milk cow, they 
were really feeding the eastern interests. Those interests were 
collecting the money and getting their 24 per cent interest rates.
<P>
	The worst of it was that when one has a huge milk cow there is 
some organic material that has to be disposed of because otherwise 
it is environmentally unfriendly. Therefore, this organic fertilizer 
was dumped on the eastern provinces and it pretty well buried 
them. So we had three little problems. We had the western farmers 
starving to death. We had the eastern interests getting filthy rich 
and paying more income tax and the eastern  Atlantic provinces 
being buried by something they did not really like. That was the 
situation that got western farmers into a huge debt load.
<P>
	Looking back on the issue today, if we could have avoided the 
high interest rates at that time, we would have a lot more small 
business people still in business in western Canada and the family 
farm might not be in the position that it is today.
<P>
	However, I want to get back to the debt review board. When we 
had the old board, it was at least willing to look at farmers who 
were viable and give them support and try to get them to 
reorganize.
<P>
	Bill C-38 is only there, more or less, to get farmers out of 
business. Once you get to that point, I am a firm believer that just 
consultation and some advice is not sufficient. As members know, 
when banks or financial institutions are prepared to take over one's 
assets they have the best legal advice and the best consultation 
services available. They do not care about the cost. However, when 
a farmer is under that type of stress he does not have any financial 
power. He does not have the economic resources to get that type of 
advice.
<P>
	If the government was really diligent and wanted to do 
something for farmers, it would make funds available to them to 
get the expert advice and consultation service needed because the 
banks or financial institutions have the upper hand.
<P>
	During that time, I think during a Liberal government, I know 
there was a very big debate about the Crow rate. It think a prop of a 
crow being hung was brought into the House at that time. There 
was quite a bit of confrontation here. There was talk that 
governments were willing to bail out western farmers with the 
crow to a tune of $15 billion. That was its values then.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Some farm organizations were stubborn and did not realize how 
critical the issue was. They felt that it was not enough, was a very 
bad deal for western farmers and refused it. Fifteen billion dollars 
in 1978 or 1979 compared to $1.5 billion today is just a Mickey 
Mouse amount, peanuts. Big mistakes made in western Canada.
<P>
	When we look at the grain transportation system we see that we 
did something in the House in the last year. We bought out the crow 
with $1.5 billion and did not have the transportation system in 
place that should have been there.
<P>
	We heard from our colleagues from Peace River and Vegreville 
that farmers are in dire straits today because of the grain in their 
bins or out in the fields. Bill C-38 will be used probably more than 
ever before to liquidate farmers.
<P>
	This is a sad situation. In such a desperate situation some special 
provisions should be made like we see in many big businesses 
instead of only having good  consultation services available. They 
ask for bankruptcy protection for a certain time to see whether 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9895"> 9895 </A></B>
<P>
things can be ironed out. They do not have the financial assets to 
protect themselves.
<P>
	As the Bloc member pointed out, food is number one. If we 
cannot protect our food supply industry or our producers, sooner or 
later the country will fold. That is one point I have always 
appreciated. Even if we do not agree with a lot of the philosophy of 
Bloc members on the agriculture committee, this is one point we 
agree on. Agriculture is most important. A trip to a Third World 
country or an eastern bloc countries makes one realize the value of 
food very soon.
<P>
	I met a young lady who was in Canada with a Chinese trade 
delegation shortly after I was elected. I asked her what she liked 
best about Canada after having seen some of it. She said the thing 
she liked best was our cheap food. I asked her what she meant by 
cheap food. I had no idea what that meant for the Chinese. She gave 
an example of a McDonald's in the city where she lived that 
charged exactly double in Chinese dollars what she would pay for 
the same hamburger in Ottawa.
<P>
	I asked her how the amount of money spent on food compared to 
the earning power in China. She indicated that a high wage earner 
in China spent about 30 per cent to 50 per cent of his wages on 
food. We have a food basket cost that is about 11 per cent to 12 per 
cent of our earning power. That helps us see what kind of a blessing 
we have in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	As was pointed out by another member, when we talk of farmers 
being subsidized to produce a product it is a subsidization for the 
consumer to get a cheaper and better product. They are the 
beneficiaries.
<P>
	Let us look at the net income of farmers today. I am using 
Statistics Canada figures. They indicate that 48 per cent of net farm 
income comes from off farm jobs. We see what is happening to our 
food production system. If we do not change the system to a market 
driven, viable food production one, other systems will collapse 
along with it.
<P>
	It is very important to realize that we have gone from a system of 
specialization. It did not work. Then farmers were told they had to 
become more efficient. Now we have a system that says we have to 
diversify. How much can they diversify when 48 per cent of their 
net farm income comes from off farm jobs?
<P>
	We also hear that there must be value added industries. When 
farmers are financially strapped they do not have money to invest 
in value added industries. Somebody else will do it.
<P>
	To make the farm economy viable again we must take some 
strong measures. After the next election I hope we will have a 
Reform government that is interested in  making the system 
efficient, viable and self-reliant. That will transfer into other 
industries and we will have a country that does not need higher 
taxes or government support. That is the direction the country must 
go in.
<P>
	At the Forum of Young Canadians banquet yesterday I saw their 
energy, interest and dedication to making the country work. They 
need a system that will look after some of the huge debt put on their 
shoulders by the government. They could make the country as 
viable as it should be.
<P>
	We have the natural, renewable and human resources to do it. We 
need some expertise that we have not seen in the last 25 or 30 years 
of Conservative and Liberal governments. They have been 
directing our industry and have failed us every time.
<P>
	It is imperative the electorate in the next election looks at the 
platform of the Reform Party. It proposes huge changes that will 
give provinces the right direction to do what they do best and will 
give the federal government the tools to do what it should do to 
reduce taxes, to bring down the deficit and to make the country a 
better place to live. We have heard our leader say a number of times 
that we could provide a better Canada and a better future for 
Canadian youngsters, for future generations.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I enjoyed listening to the hon. member for 
Lisgar-Marquette commenting on Agriculture and Agri-food 
Canada since it is a very significant portion of our economy.
<P>
	We are second in the world with the lowest cost of food. We have 
29 million people in Canada, an economy of more than $700 
billion, an export industry of $17 billion and quite a phenomenal 
growth rate.
<P>
	With this bill and others the government has focused on the Farm 
Credit Corporation by providing extended finances, guaranteed 
loans, long term mortgage programs, vendor loan guarantee 
programs and agricultural equity development programs.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	The hon. member talks about Bill C-38 as putting farmers under 
faster. The bill is actually a review process if a farmer becomes 
insolvent. If he gets into financial difficulty it is a process to assist 
him to go through mediation, to go through review, and to have a 
stay of proceedings if there is action taken on his assets.
<P>
	If the hon. member's party formed the government and offered 
new policies to the public, would he repeal Bill C-38?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question from 
my hon. colleague across the way.
<P>
	I have been trying to say to the House that the farming industry 
should have never been put in this position. The bill will put 
farmers out of business. There is no place in the bill to help farmers 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9896"> 9896 </A></B>
<P>
rejuvenate or become viable  again. It is a last resort to make the 
pain a little less so they can get out of business.
<P>
	That is not what we need. We have seen over the last three 
decades the farm population decrease to an unbelievable 
percentage. When I started farming a half section was sufficient to 
feed a family. Today a two-section farmer cannot survive. He has to 
have his mate either employed off the farm or he has to be involved 
in some other venture to make the farm viable.
<P>
	We are taking jobs away from people who deserve then, The 
farm family should be on the farm making sure that it is running 
properly and is efficient and viable. That is why this piece of 
legislation is so bad. It will not give farmers any hope. It will just 
lessening the pain a bit of getting out of business. I do not know 
whether they will go on welfare or try to get into a new business, 
which is not easy today.
<P>
	What astounds me is in the 1970s a Liberal government told us 
day after day that we had to have high interest rates to bring down 
inflation. We had to kill inflation. We have killed inflation. We 
have low interest rates and farmers do not have the opportunity to 
be viable. The passage of Bill C-38 will get them out of the system. 
It just does not make sense.
<P>
	On the one hand a 24 per cent interest rate is inflationary. On the 
other hand the banks feel 24 per cent makes them viable. If it is not 
inflationary when the banks charge it, why is it inflationary when 
the farmer pays it? Those are the problems I have with some 
government policies. They like to interfere.
<P>
	First we had to specialize and it did not work. Then we had to 
diversify and it did not work. Now we have to get value added 
industries, and who knows if that will work? If farmers do not get 
their fingers into value added industries, other industries will 
benefit and we will have less farmers rather than more. As I said, 
farming should never have been put into the position where it 
required this legislation.
<P>
	Due to government policy over the last 30 years this has 
happened. It is not because of the way farmers have operated their 
farms. They have increased production. They have become more 
efficient. They have worked harder. The taxation system and the 
government bureaucrats have forced them off the land. That is very 
easily proven.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> It is my duty, 
pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for Mississauga South, health; the hon. 
member for Davenport, transport; the hon. member for 
Sarnia-Lambton, health.
<P>
	I have also received notice from the hon. member for North 
Vancouver that he is unable to move his motion during private 
members hour on Friday, April 18. It has not been possible to 
arrange an exchange of positions in the order of precedence.
<P>
	Accordingly, I am directing the table officers to drop that item of 
business to the bottom of the order of precedence. Private members 
hour will thus be cancelled and the House will continue with the 
business before it prior to private members hour.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to join in the debate this afternoon 
on Bill C-38, the Farm Debt Mediation Act.
<P>
	At the outset I would like to reply very briefly to the comment 
and question posed to my hon. colleague from Lisgar-Marquette 
from across the way a minute ago.
<P>
	The hon. Liberal member referred to the fact that we have very 
cheap food in Canada. Certainly that is the case and all consumers 
are very thankful for that. Everyone has to eat and therefore I am 
sure everyone is thankful in a way.
<P>
	I remind the member of something that MPs from rural ridings 
are constantly reminded of, that a cheap food policy is a two edged 
sword. For the consumers to gain by this type of policy, the 
producers of the food lose.
<P>
	She went on to ask if Reform would repeal Bill C-38. At the time 
we form the next government, we certainly will take a look at all 
the legislation passed by this failure of a Liberal government from 
the 35th Parliament and perhaps amend it.
<P>
	We suggested a number of amendments to Bill C-38, as we have 
to a lot of bills, most bills that were introduced in this place. 
Unfortunately those amendments, of which Reform had four, were 
defeated by the government. That is why we are opposed to this.
<P>
	The preceding speakers from the Reform Party, the hon. member 
for Vegreville and the hon. member for Lisgar-Marquette, 
remarked that we are not opposed to the intent of this legislation. 
There is no party that has a monopoly on good intentions and good 
ideas.
<P>
	As amazing as it sometimes seems, even the Liberal Party comes 
up with some good ideas once in a while.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Especially the backbenchers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Especially the 
backbenchers. All members in this place come up with good ideas 
from time to time, some good policy suggestions. Some good 
amendments to legislation are brought forward by people from all 
political persuasions at committee and in the House of Commons.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9897"> 9897 </A></B>
<P>
	It is unfortunate when we see time after time that the cabinet 
or the applicable minister cracks the whip and gets the 
amendments, either at the committee stage or in the House, 
defeated for purely partisan reasons.
<P>
	It does not matter that the amendment makes sense. The only 
reason is that if Reform suggests it, for example, in some cases the 
Bloc or the other independents, then it is automatically ruled that it 
does not make sense and it is voted down. ``We have the majority 
on the committees. We have the majority in the House of 
Commons. We will vote that amendment down''. Then they stand 
in the House of Commons and say ``those darn Reformers vote 
against everything we try to do and every good idea that we bring 
into this place, those Reformers vote against it''.
<P>
	Is it any wonder? It seems every time we try to introduce 
amendments to legislation they are voted down. They are ruled out 
of hand. It is ruled that they are not good amendments simply 
because they come from Reformers. That is a tragedy to the 
democratic process and I believe that it puts paid to the red book 
promise of restoring more free votes and more true democracy to 
this place. We have seen the exact opposite happen during this 35th 
Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party is supportive of the intent of Bill C-38. If there 
is sufficient time before the Liberals decide to go to an election, the 
bill will be passed because the Liberals have the majority, despite 
any amendments we bring forward which would be voted down.
<P>
	The bill is an act to repeal the Farm Debt Review Act, a decade 
old farm debt review board system with debt mediation service for 
farmers facing seizure of their property by creditors. As a farmer I 
was fortunate that I never had to go through that process but I have 
had many friends and neighbours who during the tough times of the 
last 15 to 20 years in agriculture unfortunately had to face that 
situation.
<P>
	Although they varied from region to region and province to 
province, the farm debt review boards did a lot of good work and 
certainly helped some farmers through some tough times with their 
creditors. They helped farmers as much as possible to meet their 
financial obligations. It is certainly a worthy and good intention 
that this bill is being brought forward to replace that old act.
<P>
	The new act provides for a review of the farmer's financial 
affairs, for mediation between the farmer and the farmer's creditors 
for the purpose of reaching a mutually acceptable arrangement and 
in order to temporarily suspend the rights of creditors to take or to 
continue proceedings against the farmer's assets if the farmer were 
to request it.
<P>
	Some concerns were brought forward not only by Reformers but 
also by a number of organizations and  individuals who appeared 
before the standing committee when Bill C-38 was before the 
committee. I will run down the list to indicate to the viewing public 
that many witnesses came forward with concerns about this bill. 
They suggested possible amendments at the committee stage.
<P>
	Included were the Alberta farm debt review board, the Canadian 
Bankers Association, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, the 
National Farmers Union, the Ontario farm debt review board, the 
Quebec farm debt review board and the Saskatchewan farm debt 
review board. A number of submissions were made and a number 
of concerns were raised at the committee stage about the content of 
the bill. My colleagues from Vegreville and Lisgar-Marquette 
raised some concerns as well.
<P>
	One concern is that the budget seems fairly substantial in the 
sense that the Saskatchewan farm debt review board is currently 
handling half of all the cases in Canada for a total of only about 
$700,000 whereas the estimated total mediation budget under this 
new legislation will exceed $2.2 million. This is clearly a case 
where the bureaucracy is looking after itself, ensuring it will have 
ample funds available, as we have seen in so many different 
departments and ministries, to ensure its longevity regardless of 
what happens in the upcoming election.
<P>
	Another concern, which we have had with a lot of legislation that 
has passed through this place, is with potential patronage under this 
new act. For instance, the appeal boards are to be appointed by the 
minister without being reviewed or approved by Parliament or the 
standing committee.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	As we saw with Bill C-72, which for some reason has been 
swallowed by a black hole, the wording in the legislation states that 
the minister would have the power to appoint the board of directors 
and that he in his infinite wisdom could hold an election for one or 
more of the board members.
<P>
	I did a survey, which I referred to a few hours ago, on Bill C-34. I 
referred to the fact that the Canadian Wheat Board had refused to 
allow me access to the mailing list of the producers who reside in 
the riding which I am honoured to represent in the House of 
Commons. I felt that was a bit of a tragedy in the sense that MPs 
want to serve their people accurately. That is the guiding creed of 
the Reform Party of Canada, to represent constituents accurately 
where there is the ability to deduce what the majority view of a 
group in a riding is.
<P>
	In this case I wanted to target permit book holders. They are the 
ones who will be the most affected by Bill C-72. I was unable to 
obtain the list. The Canadian Wheat Board even refused when I told 
it I would pay to have the labels printed. I said them I would send 
them the questionnaires. They could look at the questions. I was  
not trying to hide anything. It was not anti-wheat board propagan-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9898"> 9898 </A></B>
<P>
da. It was a straightforward questionnaire containing ten questions. 
I wanted to survey permit book holders. It refused.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What democracy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Exactly. What 
democracy. How is a person supposed to represent their 
constituents accurately?
<P>
	I did not want to dilute the results of the survey by sending out a 
larger mailing which would include people who would not have the 
same interest in Bill C-72 because it would not affect their 
livelihood.
<P>
	I mailed it out to a larger mailing list that I was able to obtain. I 
had 124 responses, which is fairly comprehensive for an area as 
small as the Peace River agricultural area. I do not know exactly 
how many permit book holders there are in my area because the 
wheat board will not tell me. I have heard that there are somewhere 
in the neighbourhood of 450 to 500 permit book holders. So a 
return of 124 is substantial.
<P>
	Unfortunately I do not have the time to go into all the survey 
questions asked, but I would like to explain the first question. The 
question I asked the producers was the following: ``There has been 
a lot of discussion on the future of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
Overall, how would you describe your attitude toward the Canadian 
Wheat Board?'' Then I gave them the choices: ``Eliminate. Major 
overhaul is needed. Minor overhaul. Unsure. Should the wheat 
board include other crops? Keep it as it is''.
<P>
	While 9 per cent of the respondents wanted to completely 
eliminate the Canadian Wheat Board, 70 per cent indicated they 
wanted a major or minor overhaul. I believe this indicates that 
farmers want to retain the Canadian Wheat Board but they want to 
see some substantive changes. They want choice.
<P>
	Unfortunately, as with so many pieces of legislation, the 
government simply does not get the message that the farm 
community is trying to send it.
<P>
	The minister did a mail ballot on the other legislation. I do not 
know how much it cost the taxpayers. Basically it was an all or 
nothing question: ``Do you believe that barley should be included 
as it is now under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Wheat Board or 
do you think that the Canadian Wheat Board should get out of it 
altogether?'' There were no other options for farmers to choose.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	What we saw, what we told the minister and what farm groups 
and individual farmers were telling him-I am sure they were 
because they were telling us this-was that it was a status quo 
question. It did not solve anything.
<P>
	The fact is that farmers are still being sent to jail for trying to 
market their own product. This does not solve  anything. Farmers 
recognize that. Likewise, Bill C-38 is not the answer. That is why 
we proposed four amendments to Bill C-38.
<P>
	We proposed that the bill be amended to allow the standing 
committee on agriculture to review the appointment of the 
administrators. What would be wrong with that? Would not the 
farm community support that? Obviously the committee would be 
the place. It has the expertise and knowledge and witnesses could 
be called, if necessary, to look at who was being appointed as 
administrators.
<P>
	We proposed an amendment to insert a new clause in the bill to 
make the government develop regulations or guidelines on 
performance evaluations for administrators and mediators. What 
could possibly be wrong with an amendment like that? It strikes to 
the heart of accountability.
<P>
	If there is one thing that members have heard Reformers repeat 
day after day, speech after speech, whether on justice, spending, 
defence, agriculture, health or aboriginal affairs, name the 
department, over the past three years it is that we have constantly 
used the word ``accountability''. The people at the top must be held 
accountable. Members heard it about the Somali inquiry. That was 
why we are so concerned about what appears to be a cover-up at the 
highest levels. Members have heard it about so many other 
departments that unfortunately for Canadians have been tainted by 
scandal and by suspicion of patronage and those types of things. 
We have insisted on accountability.
<P>
	We proposed a minor amendment that the government develop 
regulations on performance evaluations to hold the administrators 
and mediators accountable, and it is voted down. It is ruled that it is 
not appropriate by the Liberal majority.
<P>
	The third amendment we proposed was to clause 15. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That clause 15 be amended to allow the standing committee on agriculture to 
review the minister's appointments to the appeal boards.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What could possibly be wrong with that? What does the minister 
want to hide, that his appointments should not be reviewed?
<P>
	The fourth and final amendment that we proposed was:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That clause 28 be amended to allow the standing committee on agriculture to 
conduct a three year review of this act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That was also voted down also.
<P>
	When I start getting on to some of these issues I do not know 
where time goes. It just flies by. At any rate, I will sum up what I 
have in the little time remaining.
<P>
	As a former farmer, whose family is still involved in the farming 
business back home and as a person who used to be active in farm 
groups, I am fortunate to have a  lot of friends and supporters in the 
agricultural community in the riding that I am honoured to 
represent in this House. I can tell the House that the majority of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9899"> 9899 </A></B>
<P>
farmers in my area are thinking about trying to get last year's crop 
salvaged from under the snow. They are looking forward to trying 
to get that crop off or do something with it even if they have to burn 
it, accepting the huge loss that they are going to suffer and then try 
as hard as they can, weather permitting, to get this year's crop 
seeded.
<P>
	One thing that galls me to no end is that there does not seem to 
be a lot of recognition from the people on that side of the House of 
the struggles and travails facing the farming communities. I get 
pretty upset when people say we do this for the farmers and that for 
the farmers and why do we treat them so special?
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	A lot of Canadians forget where the food comes from and how 
many people owe their livelihood to the farmer who is struggling to 
get his crop off. They forget the person who sells the herbicides for 
spraying, or the people who owe their living to transporting grain, 
whether it is the man running the locomotive or others involved in 
the transportation of grain. They forget the people who sell the 
farm equipment, the person at the store who sells building supplies 
to build a new granary. They forget the hundreds of thousands of 
people who owe their livelihood directly and indirectly to the 
sustainability of agriculture.
<P>
	It is high time we had a government in the country, a Reform 
government, that puts some emphasis on agriculture.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I always enjoy listening to the member from the Peace 
River area because he knows how important agriculture is.
<P>
	Would he like to comment on an issue we addressed this 
morning when we were dealing with Bill C-34. This kind of flows 
into Bill C-38 which is more or less trying to dissolve farming 
operations which we hope can be avoided somehow. This morning 
we were asking for emergency cash advances of $50,000 interest 
free. That was denied because the government would not accept our 
amendments to Bill C-34.
<P>
	However, in the last couple of months the Liberal government 
has doled out about $250 million to a company like Bombardier, 
that is interest free and probably forgivable. How does that 
compare with his feelings of how the farmers are treated in the west 
and even in Quebec, as we heard from our hon. colleague from the 
Bloc.
<P>
	The Liberal government promised fairness, equality and 
democracy. I do not think we have seen any of that in the number of 
bills that have been passed lately.
<P>
	How does my hon. colleague feel about this?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the question and the comments from my colleague from 
Lisgar-Marquette.
<P>
	Farmers in the riding of Prince George-Peace River and 
farmers across the country are quite frankly appalled by the 
performance of the Liberal government in doling out money to 
corporate friends. However, when farmers in Quebec or western 
Canada, Nova Scotia or Ontario get into trouble, it turns a deaf ear. 
``There is no money. We are cutting to the bone. We are trying to 
get the deficit under control''.
<P>
	Nobody understands the problem of deficit and debt better than 
the members Reform Party. We were the ones who highlighted this 
problem for the Liberal government before there was even a 
Mulroney government. We know what nine years of Tory 
government did to the country. The debt was doubled. We are well 
aware of the problem of deficit spending.
<P>
	We have been saying for years and years that it has to be 
prioritized. I do not see how giving a handout to a corporation that 
is already making millions of dollars is a good or wise investment 
of Canadian tax dollars.
<P>
	But when farmers with their backs to the wall turn to the 
government and ask not for a handout but for an interest free loan 
to tide them over the short term, recognizing the thousands and 
thousands of people who owe their livelihood to the agricultural 
sector and farmers in the country, the government says ``no. You 
are not a priority. Sorry''. A priority is a boccie court in a minister's 
riding or a canoe museum in Shawinigan.
<P>
	I want to say that the farmers and the people of Canada are fed up 
with this kind of attitude from the government.
<P>

	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (for Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-77, an act concerning an order under the 
International Development (Financial Institutions) Assistance Act, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Godfrey (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Cooperation, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise before 
the House today to table the second reading of a bill that will 
authorize payments made to the multilateral fund for the Montreal 
Protocol and the Global Environment Facility.
<P>
	These organizations were established in 1990 as primary 
international financial mechanisms to protect the global 
environment. Since then the multilateral fund for the Montreal 
Protocol or the MFMP has served as the main financial mechanism 
for projects aimed at reducing ozone depletion in the developing 
world.
<P>
	Similarly, the Global Environment Facility or GEF is the 
principal international mechanism through which donors can 
support developing countries in the areas of biodiversity, climate 
change, the ozone and international waters. It was endorsed as such 
at the landmark 1992 Rio conference on the environment and 
development.
<P>
	As you know, Madam Speaker, we honour our commitments to 
international institutions in full and on time so that they can carry 
out their vital work unencumbered by financial shortfalls. To do so 
in this case it was necessary to add the GEF and the MFMP to the 
schedule of financial institutions under the International 
Development (Financial Institutions) Assistance Act. An order in 
council to this effect was approved on November 15, 1994 and 
published in the <I>Canada Gazette</I> on November 30, 1994.
<P>
	The international development act also stipulates that the order 
in council be tabled before Parliament no more 15 sitting days after 
it is approved. Due to an administrative oversight this obligation 
was not met within the specified time.
<P>
	The bill I am tabling for second reading today will correct that 
oversight. On this matter I am sure that I have the full support of 
members on both sides of the House who know the value of 
environmental protection and want to see Canada continue to meet 
its financial obligations uninterrupted.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
member for Terrebonne has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
you are right. It is still Terrebonne for a few weeks because, as I 
mentioned to your alternate a few days ago, after June 2, or 
thereabouts, it will be Repentigny.
<P>
	I made an omission I want to correct before addressing Bill 
C-77. The last time I rose, I thanked the residents of the five 
municipalities in the riding of Repentigny, but I forgot to also thank 
the residents of the two former municipalities in my riding, namely 
Terrebonne and Bois-des-Filion, for the good times spent together 
during the past three and a half years. These are people with whom, 
under Irénée Forget, in Terrebonne, and Paul Laroque, in 
Bois-des-Filion, we were able to co-operate, work and bring 
several issues to a successful conclusion, and thus improve the 
quality of life of the residents of these two municipalities. This was 
achieved with a great deal of enthusiasm, drive and interest.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	The last time I rose in this House to speak, I forgot to thank the 
mayors and the people of these two municipalities. I just wanted to 
correct this oversight.
<P>
	That said, as my hon. colleague pointed out earlier, the purpose 
of Bill C-77 is indeed to remedy an omission. In February 1994, the 
federal cabinet agreed to contribute to the Global Environment 
Facility Fund and the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of 
the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.
<P>
	The implementation of this decision required that the institutions 
in question be included in the International Development 
Assistance Act. An order in council to that effect was therefore 
approved on November 15, 1994, and published in the <I>Canada 
Gazette</I> on November 30 of the same year.
<P>
	By law, an order has to be tabled in Parliament within 15 days of 
its signing. Earlier this year, after the standing joint committee of 
which my hon. colleague is a member discovered the omission as 
part of its regulatory review, the Department of Foreign Affairs was 
notified. An order was indeed published in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>, but 
the legislation was never implemented so that the two 
organizations mentioned previously, namely the Global 
Environment Facility Fund and the Multilateral Fund for the 
Implementation of the Montreal Protocol, could receive the money 
it was supposed to get from the government.
<P>
	Oversights happen even in the best of families. Several very 
important issues are before this House, and we understand the need 
for urgent action to restore funding to these two organizations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9901"> 9901 </A></B>
<P>
	As the previous speaker said, he will ask the House to fast-track 
Bill C-77 so that the two organizations mentioned earlier can 
receive the money they need to improve the environment and even 
encourage developing countries to become more environmentally 
conscious.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-77. This act has been 
designed to correct an oversight that happened in 1994. I can 
understand how that can happen and we agreed to participate to 
support this bill and to correct that error.
<P>
	I want to take the opportunity to talk about the bigger picture in 
terms of Canada's foreign policy and the government's role in that. 
Foreign policy does not just belong to the government in power, it 
belongs to Parliament. There have been numerous incidents in 
which the Liberal government ignored Parliament and failed to 
inform it properly. In the area of foreign affairs Reform has raised 
many issues in the past years and almost all of them have been 
completely.
<P>
	In October 1993 a private member's motion was put forward to 
address the important issue of peacekeeping, which would go on to 
consume a fair amount of time of the House later one. What did the 
governing party do at the time? It voted it down because it was not 
interested in the opinions it seemed of other members on this side 
of the House. There have been other occasions when that has 
happened as well.
<P>
	This happened in spite of the fact that when the present foreign 
affairs minister was on this side of the House he was very critical of 
the Tories for showing a lack of respect for the parliamentary 
process. I would think he would be very sensitive as the foreign 
affairs minister to that very criticism he raised when he was on this 
side.
<P>
	We know that this Parliament has probably had more closure and 
use of time allocation than any other Parliament including the one 
the minister of foreign affairs was so critical of, the Mulroney 
government of nine years.
<P>
	When we look at the foreign policy of this government we can 
see that it has lacked vision and has failed in some areas. It is clear 
to us that the Liberals want to use foreign policy as their own 
political agenda, and that is a fairly serious charge.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	What can one think when the Prime Minister makes his first trip 
to our friends in Washington, to visit the president of the United 
States, our most important trading partner, three and a half years 
into the mandate? Some would say it was a photo op, a good chance 
for the Prime Minister to have his picture taken with the president, 
on the president's knee, shortly before the  election campaign. 
Canada and the United States have a very close trading 
relationship, which has grown to something like a billion dollars a 
day of two-way trade.
<P>
	I am a little cynical about his motives. However, I want to talk 
about an area that the Liberals have come full circle on. I give them 
full credit. That area is free trade.
<P>
	When the Liberals were on this side of the House in the 
opposition benches they were very critical of the free trade 
agreement with the United States. They fought it tooth and nail in 
1988. They were very critical of it in the 1993 election. They said 
they would rip up or renegotiate the accord unless it got a subsidies 
code and an anti-dumping code. Of course that did not happen.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has led a number of trade delegations around 
the world. That is a good move. They are the Team Canada 
missions.
<P>
	I wonder about our exporters, what they are thinking. It seems 
our exports to most of the countries that the Prime Minister and his 
entourage have visited in the last three years have actually fallen 
off as a result of these trade missions. How can that be? The reason 
I put forward is that Canada has done our homework at home to 
make possible the opportunities for our businesses to take 
advantage of these important trade missions that have developed.
<P>
	I would suggest that the Prime Minister concentrate more on the 
trade mission at home to correct some of the problems for our 
companies can take advantage of.
<P>
	The committee has certainly heard the high cost of doing 
business in Canada. We have payroll taxes, taxes, interprovincial 
trade barriers where we have made very little progress. These are 
very big problems to trade within Canada.
<P>
	We know that there are something like only 100 companies in 
Canada that are responsible for over 40 per cent of Canada's 
exports. We would like to see it be a great deal more than that. The 
Minister for International Trade has suggested that we should get to 
about 4,000 companies doing business. I agree.
<P>
	When we cannot even trade effectively across our own 
provincial borders, how can we be exporters around the world? 
How can our companies get the economies of scale that are 
required to get out there and compete in the world market?
<P>
	The federal government has to show leadership in breaking 
down the provincial barriers we have. That will resolve a lot of our 
problems.
<P>
	We heard at our committee in foreign affairs and international 
trade when we were doing a study on small and medium size 
enterprises what is holding them back from exporting. Some said 
they are moving into the United States. They have better access to 
the Canadian market from the United States than they have from 
their Canadian locations. That is a big problem.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9902"> 9902 </A></B>
<P>
	In any case, I am glad to see that the Liberals have been born 
again, if you like, free traders. It is the right approach. Canada 
is a trading country. Forty per cent of our GDP is derived from 
exports along with one job in every three. It will be a very 
important area for us in the future.
<P>
	The initiative that the trade minister has developed to try to bring 
more countries on in the southern hemisphere will be good for 
Canada. Let us concentrate on correcting some of the problems at 
home so that we can take advantage of these very important 
initiatives.
<P>
	Although they are born again, I welcome it. I hope their hearts 
are in the right place and that this will continue into the future.
<P>
	I want to talk about a couple of other areas that we have 
identified in terms of peacekeeping. The government has not taken 
into consideration the long term consequences in some cases of 
Canadian involvement. I cite Haiti as an area where United States 
went in with a lot of fanfare. Guess who gets to do the mop-up 
operation. Canada.
<P>
	We seem to continue to extend that mandate. We have RCMP 
officers there who are trying to help in training Haitians in terms of 
policing. We have the problem in Canada where we have lack of 
police forces. We seem to be taken in by United States. It makes the 
big initiative, gets the fanfare and then we do the mop-up 
afterwards. There are long term consequences that have to be 
anticipated.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	What is wrong with a full scale debate in the House, as one of 
our members suggested in a private member's motion in 1993? Let 
us involve the House a bit more to hear more of what other people 
are thinking in that regard.
<P>
	With regard to Bosnia, the government has allowed itself to be 
dragged into a mission it was not equipped for. We have to reassess 
the whole idea of whether we are in peacekeeping or peacemaking.
<P>
	There was the initiative to go to Zaire. Things changed pretty 
rapidly, but it was an ironic situation. Our peacekeepers were 
pinned down. They could not even get their weapons out of the 
airport. They were supposed to help police the area but they could 
not get their weapons out of the airport. It was a fiasco. It is a good 
thing there was a major turnaround in the situation and people 
started to return of their own accord.
<P>
	There are a lot of things which need to be changed. The United 
Nations has to go through a reassessment in terms of its 
effectiveness. We are concerned that the United Nations is being 
forced to downsize in terms of bureaucracy.
<P>
	I am concerned about some of the organizations which were put 
in place shortly after the second world war  which were well 
intended and have done good work such as the World Bank, the 
IMF and the United Nations. Many are trying to reinvent 
themselves to stay in existence. If there is no role for them or if 
there is a reduced role, we have to recognize that.
<P>
	Reform in many of these institutions is badly needed and Canada 
has to show leadership in these areas.
<P>
	We will support the motion to clean up this oversight, but let us 
involve all of Parliament when it comes to foreign policy because 
there are some good ideas which we should have an opportunity to 
debate.
<P>

	He said: Madam Speaker, in moving second reading of the bill, 
I think I should begin by thanking the Bloc Quebecois and the 
Reform Party for their co-operation in enabling us to move it 
through the legislative process in the House as quickly as possible. 
I look forward to co-operation of this kind through all stages of 
the bill, including committee of the whole and third reading. I say 
this because we are dealing with something very important.
<P>
	The bill involves a package of tough new measures to target 
criminal gang activity, activity of organized crime. The proposals 
developed through extensive consultations with police across 
Canada will give them and other law enforcement agencies better 
tools to investigate and prosecute those who participate in criminal 
gang activity.
<P>
	The proposals provide a new approach to fighting gang activity, 
in other words organized crime, by creating a new offence of 
participation in a criminal organization. This offence does not 
criminalize mere membership in a criminal organization. Rather 
the new offence along with new definitions in the Criminal Code 
will lay the groundwork for the targeted use of proposed new 
investigative tools and Criminal Code provisions.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	These include a new peace bond designed to target gang 
leadership and make it difficult for criminal organizations to carry 
out their criminal activities. New powers will allow police to seize 
the proceeds of organized crime activity and with a judge's order to 
access income tax information related to gang activity. New 
Criminal Code offences and penalties will target the use of 
explosives in criminal gang activity. New sentencing provisions in 
the Criminal Code will be aimed at criminal gangs, including the 
delay of parole eligibility for certain criminal organization 
offences, and measures will support increased police surveillance 
of gang activity.
<P>
	Last September there was a National Forum on Organized Crime 
hosted by the Minister of Justice and me. The proposals we see 
here today are based in large measure on the recommendations 
made to us by the participants in the forum including 
representatives of police organizations from around the country, 
legal scholars and lawyers who have studied the matter.
<P>
	Following through on a specific recommendation from the 
national forum that I have not yet mentioned, I will be setting up 
national and regional co-ordinating committees to address police 
concerns about the need for co-ordination and leadership on 
multi-agency enforcement operations. In addition to the national 
committee there will be five regional co-ordinating committees. If 
I am not mistaken, two have already been set up: a committee in 
British Columbia and one in Ontario.
<P>
	This underscores the point that the legislation is not aimed only 
at one part of our country. There have been  particular concerns in
<P>
Montreal and Quebec and surrounding areas about the operations 
of biker gangs, but I am told biker gangs operate in every province 
of Canada except for possibly Prince Edward Island. There are 
organized crime activities of other kinds all across the country. 
This is important national legislation to help add to and improve 
protection of the public.
<P>
	Again in response to a recommendation by police organizations 
at the National Forum on Organized Crime, the solicitor general of 
the day will make an annual statement on organized crime in the 
House of Commons. Likely the first one will come in late 1997. 
Time will tell who will give it. I have my views on who will form 
the government, but I will not get into that in this relatively 
non-partisan second reading debate.
<P>
	Working with the police we have achieved two objectives. We 
have given law enforcement agencies better tools to help in their 
efforts against organized crime.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the same vein, I can quote my hon. colleague, the Minister of 
Justice, Allan Rock, because he has said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks to collaborative efforts with the police, we have attained two objectives: 
we have equipped law enforcement agencies with better tools to combat criminal 
gangs, and we have developed a series of measures that ought to stand up better in 
court. These measures represent a first step in the right direction. The federal 
government had promised to inaugurate measures against criminal gangs, and the 
present government has kept its word; in order to be effective, however, the battle 
requires the federal government, the provinces, and the law enforcement agencies to 
join forces.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Organized crime gangs have increasingly become a threat to the 
safety of many communities all across the country. Police officers 
have made it clear they need improved tools and a mechanism to 
better co-ordinate and integrate their efforts to get the job done.
<P>
	I am confident this package can help. I am not suggesting it will 
end the problem overnight as soon as the measure becomes law, but 
it will give important and effective new tools to police authorities 
across the country to make some important breakthroughs in 
fighting organized crime wherever it is in the country.
<P>
	I am confident this package can be of great help to the police 
authorities in ensuring public safety. These proposals are the 
results of consultations with provincial and municipal officials 
across Canada, including the province of Quebec as well as law 
enforcement organizations across the country.
<P>
	I do not intend to go into these matters at length. I understand 
there is a disposition on the part of the Reform Party and the Bloc 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9904"> 9904 </A></B>
<P>
Quebecois to co-operate in  moving the bill through the House 
quickly. Again I thank them for that co-operation.
<P>
	By working together in the House we can help create greater 
safety for Canadians in their neighbourhoods, on their streets and 
in their business dealings across the country. I commend the bill to 
the House for second reading and early passage.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, at the request 
of the solicitor general, the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, 
will co-operate in expediting the second reading of this bill. We 
agree with the principle of the bill which, as the Quebec Minister of 
Public Security admitted today, is a step in the right direction and 
the kind of legislation he had in mind.
<P>
	However, he would have liked the bill to go a little further and be 
more specific, especially considering the problems in Quebec, both 
in the Montreal area and in Quebec City. In my own riding of 
Lévis, on March 16, the residents of Saint-Nicolas held a 
demonstration following an incident. When a jeep exploded, this 
caused considerable public reaction in the neighbourhood where 
the Hell's Angels clubhouse is located. Citizens said they were fed 
up with the biker war which was and still is a cause for concern 
among many residents.
<P>
	As long as this war was strictly between members of the gangs, it 
did not really matter, but when the quality of life and the very lives 
of citizens are at stake, public perception changes. We saw, for 
instance, the dedication shown by the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve in dealing with this problem, following 
an incident in his riding in which young Daniel Desrochers was 
killed.
<P>
	All this led the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve to 
ask for anti-gang legislation. On the initiative of the hon. member, 
the Bloc Quebecois examined these issues and, like the Quebec 
government, requested legislation to deal with biker gangs engaged 
in criminal activities.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	I remember that on several occasions in the House, the former 
parliamentary leader of the official opposition, who is now the 
leader of our party, asked the Minister of Justice and the 
government to act as soon as possible. Finally, the Minister of 
Justice went to Quebec City for a meeting with the Minister of 
Public Security, the Quebec Minister of Justice, mayors from the 
Quebec City area and representatives of the police forces 
concerned to look at ways to deal with this problem.
<P>
	The opposition reserves the right to engage in a more thorough 
analysis when the bill is considered in committee. However, at the 
second reading stage, a parliamentary tradition, we will support the 
motion and hope it is considered in committee as soon as possible. 
We will co-operate. You can count on us.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a 
few comments to make on this bill.
<P>
	We support the positive aspects of the bill and it does have 
positive aspects. We have concerns and we will be examining those 
concerns as the bill proceeds through committee of the whole.
<P>
	I would like to point out the new tools that have been presented 
to the police. The wire tap laws have been extended. That is very 
positive in dealing with this type of criminal activity.
<P>
	One of the most powerful aspects of this bill may very well be 
the breakthrough that has been made with regard to accessibility to 
income tax records that this bill provides in tracing the paper trail 
of criminal activities. Also something that may prove to be 
exceedingly important is the peace bond. Individual members of a 
criminal organization can be forced into a peace bond where they 
will be ordered not to communicate or associate with members of a 
criminal organization. If they do, no further evidence is required 
other than the fact that they have broken the bond in order to bring 
them into court. In the long term this could break up criminal 
organizations. Those are three of the very significant aspects of this 
bill.
<P>
	I will turn quickly to two areas in the bill that concern me. One is 
the creation of the definition of a criminal organization. How will 
this be done? Is it going to be possible to do it?
<P>
	We have seen bills come through the House before, and I think of 
Bill C-27, which dealt with child sex tourism where it looks good 
but it may be unenforceable. How is a criminal organization 
defined in this new bill? A criminal organization means any group, 
association or other body consisting of five or more persons, 
whether formally or informally organized, having as one of its 
primary activities the commission of an indictable offence under 
this act or any other act of Parliament for which the maximum 
punishment is imprisonment for five years or more.
<P>
	That is what the crown will have to prove in order to have an 
organization declared a criminal organization. How will that be 
done? There have to be at least five people in a group, association 
or other body and the crown will have to prove that one of the 
primary activities of members of that group is the commission of 
an indictable offence. What does that mean? Does it mean that the 
crown will have to have proof of a conviction of an indictable 
offence or just evidence that they are engaged in activities that 
could lead to the commission of an indictable offence that has a 
punishment of five years or more? There are an awful lot of 
questions I would like to have cleared up.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="9905"> 9905 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	Once the organization is defined as a criminal organization, we 
have to look at this new penalty. Section 467.1 reads: ``Everyone 
who participates in or substantially contributes to the activities of a 
criminal organization, knowing that any or all of the members of 
the organization engage in or have within the preceding five years 
engaged in the commission of a series of indictable offences under 
this act or any other act of Parliament, for each of which the 
maximum punishment is imprisonment for five years or more and 
is a party to the commission of an indictable offence for the benefit 
of, at the direction of, or in association with the criminal 
organization for which the maximum punishment is imprisonment 
for five years or more''.
<P>
	What is the crown faced with if it is able to prove a person is a 
member of a criminal organization? What evidence has to be 
gathered in order to convict? It has to prove beyond a reasonable 
doubt that the accused participates in or substantially contributes to 
a criminal organization with the knowledge that members of that 
organization have in the last five years engaged in an indictable 
offence that carries with it a punishment of five years or more.
<P>
	I hope that the government can explain to us and to the people of 
the country in a clear manner that the section of the bill that creates 
the new offence is not just simply creating false hope in the minds 
of the people, that this is enforceable, that this can be done by the 
crown.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier other parts of the bill which will be of great 
benefit to the police and will lead to greater intervention into 
organized crime. I am not going to hold my breath at this stage in 
the hope that we are going to see reams and reams of convictions 
under this new offence.
<P>
	The final point that concerns me is the subject of youth gangs. 
Does this bill apply to youth gangs? If it does, do the consecutive 
sentences apply to youth gangs? If they do, then how do we 
overcome the fact that an indictable offence committed by a youth 
under the YOA carries only a three year maximum penalty? What 
are we going to do there? Can it only apply if the youth is 
transferred to adult court?
<P>
	I hope in the next few days and hours before we enter the 
election period that those questions will be answered, not only for 
members of the House but for the people of the country who are 
hoping that this bill will move in a very positive direction, with 
positive force, to give the police the tools they need to break up 
organized crime in the country.
<P>
	We have reservations about this bill, but we support its direction 
because we think it is right. We know the police chiefs and police 
forces want it. They have been asking for it.
<P>
	I close on this dour note. I wonder why it has taken so long to 
bring this bill forward. It has to be rushed through the House and 
we do not have enough time to really establish its constitutionality 
and enforceability by hearing witnesses who would give us their 
viewpoints from both the defence and prosecution sides. I wonder 
why the government waited for two years after that little boy was 
killed as a result of organized criminal activity before the bill was 
brought in. Now it has to be rushed through the House.
<P>
	We have seen that happen too often over the last three and a half 
years. It is wrong and I do not think it is needed. Nevertheless, we 
will support the direction of bill. I am hoping the questions that I 
and other members will raise can be answered for the good of the 
people of this country.

	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should direct the National 
Parole Board that any benefit of doubt in hearings and deliberations on parole shall 
go to the victim, the victim's family and public safety and not to the prisoner.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Madam Speaker, I wish to inform the Chair that I will 
be splitting my time with the hon. member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan.
<P>
	I would like to draw the attention of the House to the motion and 
note that it specifically addresses the National Parole Board. It asks 
the parole board to have as its objective the rights of the victim, the 
victim's family and public safety over and above that of the 
prisoner.
<P>
	I feel quite sad in a way that we have to bring a motion of this 
nature into the House to recognize the rights of law-abiding 
citizens, especially victims. Their rights as citizens should be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9906"> 9906 </A></B>
<P>
respected before the rights of  prisoners, those people who have 
chosen not to abide by the rules of society.
<P>
	A number of issues will be reflected by this motion, such as 
sentencing and other issues. However, I would like to address my 
comments to the parole board as an evaluation tool.
<P>
	The parole board is a tool of the justice system. It comes into 
force once a person is convicted. Basically when we talk about 
parole hearings we are not talking about passing a judgment on the 
person with relation to the crime committed, instead we are talking 
about passing a judgment with respect to their rehabilitation over a 
certain period of confinement and whether that person is ready to 
return to society.
<P>
	As a society we have agreed to establish certain rules and 
regulations by which the majority of us agree to function. We set up 
those rules and regulations to establish our society through 
legislation and through the various other government agencies 
throughout the country.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	The fact that we establish these rules and regulations also sets 
precedents as to the kinds of rights and privileges the Canadian 
people will enjoy. If you choose to violate the rules and regulations 
established by the society, then it follows that you choose to 
relinquish those very rights and benefits that society establishes.
<P>
	We seem to have moved away from that to the point of view that 
we argue that rights and privileges bestowed on the law-abiding 
Canadian citizen by Canadian society should be applied to those 
who violate those as well. I submit to the House that is not 
justifiable. If you choose not to participate within the parameters of 
society you should not be eligible for the benefits and privileges 
that society has created for you.
<P>
	We can say that is not being compassionate and this type of 
thing, but when someone violates a law or breaks a law and actually 
causes damage to another Canadian individual, we see them as not 
being safe to go about in public. We decided that we would take 
these very people and put them away and incarcerate them in some 
facility which we have called prisons.
<P>
	There was a time in our history when that is all we did. We would 
remove them from society and put them into a building somewhere 
and the level of activity that occurred there was little better than 
custodial care. We have debates in our past which show how 
inhumane this was. Since that time we have progressed into what 
we have established within the prison system as a rehabilitation 
program. It would seem to me that once we take people and remove 
them from society because we fear them and what damage they 
may do to us, i.e. our public safety is at stake, and put them away, 
we should be guiding and directing them toward coming back into 
that  society and participating where they will not harm the public 
and harass previous victims.
<P>
	I argue that we have put in legislation along the way that gives 
these people an option to participate in the rehabilitation program 
and this kind of thing. That is another debate for some other time. 
Right now I am saying that when a prisoner goes before a parole 
board that parole board should be looking at their rehabilitation 
during the time period that we have put them away. Have they 
participated in some sort of a program that will change their 
behaviour so that they will function in society and not be a liability 
to public safety and to the victims they have in the past harmed?
<P>
	The way it is right now it seems that is not actually happening. 
That evaluation of the rehabilitation process is not happening. The 
focus seems more to be on the rights of the prisoner. I suggest we 
focus more on the rights of the victims and public safety or the 
Canadian citizen.
<P>
	When a person chooses to break the law and goes into a prison 
they should realize that they relinquish those rights and that the 
victim and the public come first. I often wonder where we lost track 
or where we went astray. I tend to think that sometimes in our 
legislation, and this goes back to the sentencing probably, we have 
lost focus of directing our judgment on the actual action that was 
committed. We started focusing on the intent behind the action. I 
suggest to the House that it was with that deviation in focus for a 
judgment decision that we tended to leave the victims and move 
more toward the prisoner. I think we should go back and address 
that at some point as well.
<P>
	It concerns me greatly that we have a movement for establishing 
groups. We now have a group for victims rights. We should have 
Canadian citizens rights and those rights should apply to all people, 
whether they are victims or not victims.
<P>

	I see the need for a victims bill of rights in the present direction 
we are heading because of the indiscretion of what is happening in 
our system. It seems to be favouring the criminal versus the 
law-abiding citizen. We are coming up with all these mechanisms 
such as victims rights and various victims interest groups. This 
type of thing seems to be growing which suggests to me that there 
is a lack of respect and confidence in the existing system.
<P>
	If the rights and privileges that law-abiding Canadian citizens 
enjoy were not applied to those who were incarcerated because 
they broke the law then we would probably not need victims rights.
<P>
	I suggest to the House that since we have to start somewhere we 
should look at the parole board. We should look at it from the point 
of view of evaluating what has actually happened once a person has 
been  confined to prison. There is absolutely no way that if a person 
does not participate in the rehabilitation program, is not capable of 
going back out into society and functioning as a productive citizen, 
that they should be released from prison at that point. They become 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9907"> 9907 </A></B>
<P>
a liability to public safety and will probably inflict either more 
physical harm to their victims or certainly emotional harm through 
such things as harassment and this type of thing.
<P>
	When we look at some of the things that victims are denied in 
relation to the National Parole Board when the situations are 
brought forward, we should be reviewing the whole process, the 
direction or the objectives of the National Parole Board as it stands.
<P>
	These people are incarcerated because they inflicted harm on 
specific individuals. I see no problem with these victims being 
aware of the progress of that person through the rehabilitation 
program. Right now once the person is convicted that is the end. 
They do not receive any other information unless they initiate it by 
writing letters to the parole board for information, and then it can 
be very limited as well.
<P>
	My motion is asking that the government direct the National 
Parole Board in its process of deliberating or evaluating the 
rehabilitation of a prisoner that if there is any doubt concerning the 
prisoner, i.e. that he may harm the victims or become a liability to 
public safety, that benefit of doubt should go to the victims and the 
public in general and not the prisoner. He can go back and go 
further through the rehabilitation process.
<P>
	I think my time is about up and so I will close in hoping that the 
government will look at this and will review the direction of the 
parole board and offer it some guidance that reflects its interest in 
the victims.

	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the

am looking for some guidance from the Chair. I believe you would 
find unanimous consent that notwithstanding the second reading 
vote that was taken on Bill C-95, that Bill C-95 be put back on the 
Order Paper for a resumption of second reading. I believe you 
called for the question, no one rose and the question was put and 
carried.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I will make a 
slight correction. The hon. member did not have consent to divide 
her time with her colleague. The rules do not provide that members 
can divide their time in private members hour.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, thank you for the 
opportunity to take part in the debate on Motion M-139 before us.
<P>
	If I understand, the hon. member feels that the government 
should order the National Parole Board to accord the benefit of the 
doubt, not to the prisoner, but to the victim, to their family and to 
public security at parole hearings.
<P>
	The motion expresses a legitimate concern that both the 
government and I share with respect to victims, their families and 
public security. However, we must recognize that a number of 
government measures already exist to respond to the concerns of 
crime victims and to ensure public security.
<P>
	I would begin by pointing out that protection of society is the 
primary consideration in any decision on parole. The National 
Parole Board grants parole only if, in its opinion, the offender will 
not present an unacceptable risk for society at the end of his 
sentence and that his release will contribute to protecting society 
by promoting his return to the community as a law abiding citizen.
<P>
	The Correctional Service of Canada and the National Parole 
Board are already directing all their efforts at protecting society by 
controlling offenders and helping them change behaviours and 
attitudes that have led them to crime in the past.
<P>
	The transition from imprisonment to freedom can be difficult, 
and offenders have a better chance of success if they are 
supervised, have suitable programs, have opportunities for training 
and are given support in the community to which they will 
eventually have to adjust.
<P>
	In helping offenders return to society, the government ensures 
public security and the security of the victims. The Correctional 
Service of Canada already directs much of its energy to helping 
offenders adapt and return to society.
<P>
	Similarly, the National Parole Board is helping to protect the 
public by taking judicious decisions in favour of the return of 
offenders to the community as law abiding citizens.
<P>
	I would add that the information provided by victims plays a key 
role in the decisions made by the National  Parole Board. A balance 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9908"> 9908 </A></B>
<P>
must be struck between the victim's concerns and the need to help 
the offender return to society without compromising public safety.
<P>
	The best way to achieve this balance is through risk assessment 
and management. Certain offenders represent a greater danger than 
others. In accordance with National Parole Board policies, board 
members systematically examine the risk an offender would 
represent for society if released.
<P>
	They look at all the relevant information they have available in 
order to conduct an initial risk assessment. They take into account 
such factors as the offence, prior criminal behaviour, social 
problems such as addiction and family violence, the individual's 
mental health and especially his potential to reoffend, behaviour 
during earlier releases, psychological and psychiatric records, 
motivation to change, and information provided by the victim.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	After this initial assessment, the National Parole Board looks at 
other, more specific factors such as the individual's behaviour in 
the institution, the information provided by case management 
personnel and other professionals that is indicative of changes, and 
the benefits derived from programs in which the offender has 
participated, such as detox or cognitive skills programs.
<P>
	After going over all this information, board members make a 
decision. If parole is granted, the Board can add conditions, in 
addition to those required by law, in order to help manage 
rehabilitation and ensure public safety.
<P>
	For example, it may require the offender to abstain from alcohol 
if this is deemed reasonable and necessary for risk management 
and the protection of society. It is common for an offender to be 
prohibited from having contact with a victim, if the victim so 
requests.
<P>
	The great majority of offenders are serving definite sentences 
and eventually return to the community. As you know, 
imprisonment is only a temporary measure that cannot guarantee 
the safety of the public.
<P>
	As a result, once an offender has been sentenced, correctional 
staff begin assessing risk and preparing for the day when the 
offender can be released. Personnel in the community gather 
information on the offender from a wide variety of sources: family, 
police, the court, victims, other members of the public. The 
information provided by the victim is an integral element of the 
risk assessment and the decision to release an offender.
<P>
	What I mean is that, based on all of the information at our 
disposal in order to make wise decisions about parole, by allowing 
gradual release and preparing the offender to return to the 
community, we are protecting the public and the victims at the 
same time.
<P>
	For the moment, I would like to talk about the rights our 
correctional system gives to victims. The year 1992  was a 
watershed year, when the Corrections and Conditional Release Act 
was passed. For the first time, victims' rights were officially 
acknowledged in federal legislation on correctional services.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to discuss the rights of victims as they exist in our 
correctional system. A significant step was made in 1992 with the 
enactment of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. From 
that time, for the first time, the rights of victims were formerly 
recognized in federal corrections legislation.
<P>
	The Corrections and Conditional Release Act clearly recognizes 
the role of the victim in relation to federal corrections. It provides 
for the sharing of information with victims and enables victims to 
have access to parole hearings.
<P>
	Under section 101(b) of the act victims may provide information 
to the National Parole Board which the board must take into 
account when reviewing the inmates on any kind of conditional 
release. This may be done in writing or in an interview with a 
National Parole Board staff member who makes the 
recommendation and a record of the discussion for inclusion in the 
offender's file.
<P>
	The legislation allows the correctional service and the National 
Parole Board to share upon request information about offenders 
with their victims. At the victim's request the correctional service 
and the National Parole Board have an obligation to disclose 
certain information about the offender such as the offender's name, 
the offence for which the offender was convicted, the eligibility 
dates and review dates of respective temporary absence or parole, 
the dates the sentence began and the length of the sentence. This 
information is also made available to the public.
<P>
	Victims, however, are eligible to receive additional information 
that is not normally disclosed to the public. Such information may 
include the location of the penitentiary where the sentence is being 
served; the date, if any, on which the offender is to be released on 
escorted or unescorted temporary absence, work release, parole or 
statutory release; the date of any hearing for the purposes of 
review; conditions attached to any form of release; the destination 
of the offender on any form of release; whether the offender is in 
custody; and, if not, why not; whether or not the offender has 
appealed a decision of the board; and the outcome of the appeal.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This specific information can be given to victims, provided the 
Chairman of the National Parole Board or the Commissioner of 
Corrections deems that the victim's interests clearly outweigh the 
breech of privacy that will result from disclosure.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9909"> 9909 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	The Corrections and Conditional Release Act also takes victims' 
concerns and needs into consideration by affording them the 
opportunity to attend parole hearings as observers.
<P>
	In the past they could do so only with the offender's agreement; 
now it is the National Parole Board's decision. As I said, victims 
can also provide information to the Board, and it must take this into 
consideration during the case study.
<P>
	The information provided by the victim which the Board must 
take into consideration during the case study includes the victim 
impact statement submitted to the Crown prosecutor, the police 
reports on the nature of the crime, and the information provided 
directly to the Board or correctional authorities by the victim or the 
victim's relatives.
<P>
	The Board also considers any reports of abuse or violence 
against the offender's family or against people in a relationship of 
intimacy, dependency or trust with the offender. The information 
provided by the victim is also important when assessing the 
relevant conditions in managing a specific risk.
<P>
	This is also a factor to be taken into consideration when 
preparing the offender's release plan, particularly if he is related to 
the victim, or will be living in the vicinity of the victim after 
release. The Board takes into consideration the victim's requests if 
he or she feels that certain conditions are necessary for protection.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak in support of the motion put forward 
by my colleague, the hon. member for Surrey North. It might be 
worthwhile repeating its wording:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should direct the National 
Parole Board that any benefit of doubt in hearings and deliberations on parole shall 
go to the victim, the victim's family and public safety and not to the prisoner.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	While the intent of Motion No. 139 is clear to me, I would like to 
expand on its objective for those who might criticize it for the use 
of the phrase ``benefit of doubt''. In that phrase we cam see both 
the strength and the reasonableness of the motion before us.
<P>
	Criminal court proceedings are structured so that persons 
charged with an offence go free if it can be established that there is 
a reasonable doubt as to their guilt. It is pretty fundamental in our 
justice system. It is therefore only fitting in the case of an 
individual who has been found guilty and imprisoned that his or her 
parole application be refused if there is a doubt as to their ability to 
be reintroduced in society. In other words the benefit of doubt 
factor has already been addressed in good part.
<P>
	Sadly there are those who would argue and try to convince us 
that is the way system works now. There are examples on examples 
that illustrate that people who so think have their heads in the sand.
<P>
	In my colleague's own riding of Surrey North there are a few 
horror stories of criminals who have been released only to violently 
reoffend again. For example, a 10-year old girl was taken from her 
bed, brutally assaulted and murdered by a criminal who was out on 
conditional release. Another individual was killed in her own home 
by a person who was out on parole for a string offences including 
car theft. The list of tragic incidents goes on and on in communities 
across Canada.
<P>
	The figures for 1994-95 show the following. Of those on 
conditional release 256 reoffended and were charged with criminal 
offences ranging from murder to armed robbery. Since 1987-88 and 
in almost any given year approximately 250 conditional release 
criminals have been charged with serious community offences. In 
1989-90 alone 39 were charged with murder and 63 with sexual 
assault. Surely this gives us some pause to doubt that the system is 
working.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	An article in today's Vancouver <I>Sun</I> read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A man serving time for attempted murder was charged Wednesday with sexually 
assaulting a young female corrections volunteer while out on day parole. The 
woman, in her twenties, was alone in her home with Clinton Dale McNutt, 29, 
Monday when the alleged offence occurred, said the Abbotsford Police 
Constable-``We can't overstate how concerned we are about the whole parole 
system,'' he said. ``Our concern is these people are out and our citizens can be put at 
risk''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what we are talking about here. Sometimes when we are 
pounding away on the justice system I hear members across the 
way saying that everything is fine and the justice minister is doing 
a great job. I think reality is the opposite to that. We on this side are 
heckled because we keep speaking out and pounding on the issue, 
particularly when we speak on behalf of victims.
<P>
	In my riding and across the country it seems Canadians are tired 
of a justice system which puts the rights of criminals ahead of the 
rights of victims. It is as basic as that.
<P>
	We get criticism from across the way. They will find out there in 
a couple of weeks knocking on doors. If they listen to what the 
people of Canada have to say they will get an earful. Ordinary 
people are saying it is not working. When Liberal members are on 
their doorsteps there will be no one to stop the constituents from 
saying what it is they think and feel about the government and the 
justice system.
<P>
	I wonder if Liberal members will try to berate their constituents 
when they raise the topic of criminal justice during the campaign in 
the same way as the Prime Minister tried to tell a waitress from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9910"> 9910 </A></B>
<P>
Montreal that she  did not read what she read and did not hear what 
she heard in relation to the government's promise to scrap the GST. 
So much for the criticism of members across the way.
<P>
	What will we do? We would advocate a fundamental shift in who 
are seen as the real victims of crime. It begins with a change in the 
shortsighted National Parole Board definition of who is a victim, to 
one more much encompassing. Reform would expand the existing 
definition and define a victim as anyone who suffers as a result of 
an offence, physical or mental injury, economic loss, or any spouse, 
sibling, child or parent of the individual against whom the offence 
was perpetrated, or anyone who has an equivalent relationship not 
necessarily a blood relative. That is an important change in the 
definition of victim.
<P>
	More important, Reform also recognizes the need to revamp the 
National Parole Board where the rights of victims in Canadian 
society are being well and truly ignored. Each of the following 
changes would need to be implemented by the government if 
Motion No. 139 is to have any meaning or significance.
<P>
	First, the National Parole Board must be reformed to ensure that 
release conditions are enforced in favour of the victim whom I have 
just redefined, the victim's family and public safety, and not in 
favour of the offender. In fact it is not just on the parole board, our 
whole justice system needs this basic reform.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	The parole board must be reformed and its responsibilities 
shifted to community merit release committees. The parole board 
must be reformed to ensure that sentences given to all violent 
offenders are served in full. The parole board must be reformed to 
ensure that dangerous offender status can be sought at any time 
during a criminal sentence and not just at the time of sentence. 
Finally, the parole board must be reformed to ensure that the parole 
is limited, earned and tightly monitored.
<P>
	In conclusion, the motion before the House merits every 
consideration. I am saddened to know that the motion is not 
votable. If it were I would want members to know that I would 
certainly be voting in favour of it and thus allowing for a fresh start 
on criminal justice reform for all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words about 
Motion No. 139 posed by the hon. member for Surrey North.
<P>
	I would like to pay tribute to my colleague from Surrey North 
who will not be a candidate in the next general election. She first 
came to this place in 1993 with many of us and I served with her on 
the health committee. I know she is a nurse by profession. I know 
that she has many fond memories of the many friends  she has 
made here. I want her to know, on behalf of many colleagues in the 
House, that we will miss her. We wish her well in her next career.
<P>
	I have found this member to be a very calm and rational and 
reasonable member in her representations in the House and in 
committee. She has come up with a motion in which she has asked 
the House to consider an aspect of the justice system, the National 
Parole Board. The concept she is raising, which I think is 
important, says that when there is a benefit of the doubt she is 
interested in making sure that the victim's interests are balanced 
and taken care of in situations dealing with people who have been 
convicted of criminal offences.
<P>
	I know from the member's speech that it is not just a wild grab to 
incarcerate everybody for life and throw away the key. Her 
statements and her rationale have been well thought out. She has 
articulated some of the ways in which she knows from her research 
that there are people, the families of victims and the victims of 
crime, who do not know what goes on in this process. This is not 
something in which we are trained. When families unfortunately 
are in a situation where a loved one, a friend, a family member or 
acquaintance has been the victim of crime and their families are 
thrust into that situation, it is terribly tragic. It happens so often and 
it is very regrettable but it is a reality in our society that there are 
people who have done some bad things.
<P>
	The important thing is that the member has been reasoned and 
constructive in her suggestions. Even the parliamentary secretary 
who spoke earlier has acknowledged that. It is to the member's 
credit that she raises them and has not tried to somehow take that 
position in a way which would be off the wall in its presentation.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	The member has acknowledged that people who are incarcerated 
for various crimes are not all the same. There are different 
circumstances and conditions. Imagine how many people there are 
in the criminal justice system who have committed crimes against 
family members, who have murdered family members, who have 
assaulted or otherwise committed some criminal offence against 
someone they know and love. Things happen, like spousal 
homicide, for instance.
<P>
	I was astounded to find out what a high percentage of homicides 
in Canada are cases of people who have killed people they knew. It 
is shameful. Those crimes do not occur because the perpetrators are 
devious people like Clifford Olson. Something has happened. 
There is more to it. There is something underlying the reason for 
that crime. Something has happened that has influenced the actions 
of people. They are not the kind of people who are going to kill 
anybody else. It is not a criminal mind but a mind which has-in 
the vernacular-snapped or reacted in the extreme at a point in 
time when something bad has happened.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9911"> 9911 </A></B>
<P>
	The member has basically said that maybe there are things we 
can do. Maybe we can identify that in the vast majority of these 
cases we are not dealing with the bizarre cases that are often raised 
in this House. It is important that Canadians are educated on the 
kinds of things that happen. There is a lot of misunderstanding 
or lack of information about what happens in the process.
<P>
	I am not a sociologist or a psychologist and I do not know very 
much about the theory and the philosophy of our penal and justice 
systems. However, I know that after they have served their time, 
people who have done bad things will eventually have to come 
back into society. They will have to reintegrate into society. They 
will potentially be my neighbours or my co-workers. They will 
have every right.
<P>
	That says a lot about the need to have an effective parole system 
which takes into account the need for rehabilitation and education 
of everyone about the things that should be done to make sure 
people have the incentive while they are incarcerated to understand 
what happened, why it happened and how to cope and deal with 
that so they can eventually reintegrate. For the vast majority of 
people that is the case.
<P>
	There is now legislation for habitual dangerous offenders and we 
know they may never get out which is probably the right thing as 
well.
<P>
	In the few minutes I have left I want to raise another issue. 
Young offenders make up quite a large number of the people who 
are incarcerated or who have committed crimes and may not have 
received a penalty.
<P>
	I know a lot of Canadians have an opinion on young offenders. 
Many would say that we have to lower the age because young 
offenders are committing crimes at a lower age than they used to. 
Many would say that young offenders should be treated like adults, 
that if they commit adult crimes they should be treated like adults. 
To some extent in some cases that is true. From the research I have 
done on family and divorce issues I know that about 70 per cent of 
young offenders come from lone parent families. That is 
significant. It relates to the member's motion. There are other 
factors to be considered.
<P>
	I am not sure whether all of the 70 per cent of young offenders 
should be herded into the same kind of mould which says here is 
what is going to happen because you are just a bad kid. I want to 
know where the parents were. I want to know what the conditions 
were, whether it was a situation of poverty or whether abuse was 
prevalent in early childhood or whether there were other situations 
about which we have no way of knowing.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	I raise that as another example of why we should not paint all 
criminals in the justice system with the same brush and say that 
they are all Clifford Olsons and here is what we have to do with 
them. In fact they are not all  Clifford Olsons. Some of them are 
neighbours, friends and young people who have had bad things 
happen to them during their lives. We have a responsibility not only 
to deal with the very bad criminals, we have a responsibility to deal 
in the preventive vein to make sure that some of these things do not 
happen in the first place.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for bringing this motion to the House 
and I thank her for being a friend and a colleague.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I too 
would like to mention that we are certainly going to miss my 
colleague. I would like to thank her for bringing in this motion 
today.
<P>
	Back in 1968 when the public was in the grip of Trudeaumania 
the Liberal government set out to revamp the justice system. Some 
of the revamping which resulted from Mr. Trudeau's just society 
we are dealing with today and have been labouring under it for 
quite some time. For instance, that Liberal government abolished 
capital punishment against the will of the majority of Canadians. It 
sanctioned 25 year life sentences which can be served in 15 years.
<P>
	As my colleague opposite has pointed out, there are different 
circumstances in every case and I will touch on that later.
<P>
	That government also gave us the Young Offenders Act. 
Punishment was replaced with a new buzzword: rehabilitation. 
Liberals, then and now, have failed to establish the worth of a life.
<P>
	Since arriving in Ottawa, the Reform Party has called for 
changes to the criminal justice system, changes which would 
support victims and punish convicted criminals. We have called for 
the complete elimination of the faint hope clause, which of course 
is section 745 of the Criminal Code. It allows convicted murderers 
to apply for parole after serving 15 years.
<P>
	Reformers believe that the only fair and just penalty for 
premeditated murder is life imprisonment. As previous speakers 
have pointed out, there are circumstances which would allow for 
parole before the criminal has served 25 years.
<P>
	Thanks to the weak-kneed Liberals, life means 25 years at best, 
which can be served in 15 years. By the time this minister was 
finally convinced that the law had to be changed, he left a loophole 
big enough for Canada's most notorious criminal, Clifford Olson, 
to slither through.
<P>
	The minister did nothing to prevent Clifford Olson from jumping 
on his soapbox. He did nothing to prevent Clifford Olson from 
forcing his victims' families to relive the nightmare which has been 
part of their daily lives since their children were so sadistically 
murdered. This calculated killer violated every one of his victims' 
rights. He did not give any of them a faint hope for survival.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9912"> 9912 </A></B>
<P>
	No one expects his bid for freedom to be successful, but he will 
have an opportunity to present his case to a jury of Canadians. 
Think of how repulsive that will be for those who draw the short 
straws and have to sit on his jury.
<P>
	Now because of the minister's inaction, Clifford Olson will not 
only have a venue, he will be given a forum in which to try to set 
the terms of his August parole bid. It is hardly surprising that he 
does not want the jury to hear the statements of the families of his 
victims, or to hear about specific police or prison reports about 
him, or to submit to the psychiatric examination requested by the 
crown. With his record it is not surprising that he would not want 
this information in the hands of a responsible jury.
<P>
	As well, flaws in the justice system make it impossible to revisit 
the plea bargaining agreement which Karla Homolka tricked crown 
prosecutors and police into granting her. She will be eligible to 
apply for parole this summer, having served a mere four years of 
her 12 year sentence.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	If she declines the opportunity to apply for parole now while she 
is in the spotlight she can and probably will exercise this option at a 
later date.
<P>
	This is the sort of case that the Reform Party is so opposed to. 
Certainly we believe that there are people who could be allowed 
early parole, but in these cases it makes absolutely no sense and the 
Canadian public is repulsed by the idea that they can get early 
parole.
<P>
	With an election call just 10 days away the minister and his 
colleagues have discovered that Canadians from coast to coast are 
concerned about the lack of justice in the justice system. Where 
have they been for the last 3.5 years? At the doorsteps they will try 
to convince Canadians that they were tough on crime and passed 
legislation to modernize the criminal justice system.
<P>
	Let us look at the changes this government made to the Criminal 
Code. Bill C-37 and Bill C-41 on sentencing did nothing to 
improve the plight of victims. Bill C-45, which dealt with section 
745, betrayed victims of crime. The Minister of Justice promised 
the families of murder victims a voice at parole appeals. They will 
get it but not for a long time. The minister fixed it so that this new 
law only applies to people convicted in the future, not to anyone 
currently serving a life sentence. He betrayed bereaved relatives to 
have an opportunity to speak at any hearing held 15 years from 
now. That is how committed Liberals are to victims rights.
<P>
	In December 1994 a private member's bill authored by the 
member for York South-Weston calling for the elimination of 
section 745 was passed by a majority of the members of the House 
of Commons, including 73 members from the government side. It 
was subsequently sent to the justice committee.
<P>
	What did the member for York South-Weston receive for his 
efforts? History will show that he was turfed from the Liberal 
Party. The member for York South-Weston lost his opportunity to 
bring about meaningful change to the justice system, and families 
of murder victims lost the chance to see the killers of their loved 
ones pay in years of lost freedom for the lives they took.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice uses the old adage that tough cases make 
for bad laws as his excuse for not taking a tougher stance. There 
might be some credence to this if we were talking about isolated 
cases. However, there are about 650 convicted murderers who are 
waiting for their chance to apply for this faint hope that has become 
a sure bet in lots of cases.
<P>
	If we had enacted tough laws in the first place we would be able 
to deal effectively with all the facets of criminal activity.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, his ministers and his backbenchers 
obviously do not believe that murder is a very serious offence. How 
can I say that? They sent a message to the victims of violence that 
their pain is just not that important. They sent a message to 
criminals that their crimes will be tolerated. They sent a message to 
all Canadians that their streets, homes and playgrounds are not 
safe.
<P>
	I suggest to the government that it is not too late. Instead of 
making meaningless promises in red book II, as it is likely to do, 
why not use this last week of the 35th Parliament to do something 
truly worthwhile and give victims the rights they deserve. If the 
government does that it can be assured of a warmer reception at the 
doorsteps of the nation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank 
you for the opportunity to speak on the motion of my colleague 
from Surrey North. Her contribution to this House has been 
tremendous and certainly it will be noted in history in terms of 
compassion for those in need, not only aboriginal families of this 
nation but many other people who need special attention and 
consideration in a very humane and humanitarian purpose. I would 
like to thank the hon. member for making that contribution.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	I hope into this next election that there is an opportunity 
somewhere in Canada that she may play a role, become a 
candidate. That would be an exciting possibility as well.
<P>
	Motion No. 139 lays out for us a motion that gives direction to 
the parole board of Canada, saying that the priority for that parole 
board should certainly be victims rights rather than criminal rights 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9913"> 9913 </A></B>
<P>
and that there has to be a better balance. Through this motion my 
hon. colleague has tried to give direction for that.
<P>
	That sounds like common sense for us. The question is why does 
it not happen. Why have we not over the years been able to 
recognize that victims rights must be considered before someone is 
put out into the general public or back on the streets with parole?
<P>
	I have spoken with ministers of justice, the attorneys general of a 
variety of provinces with regard to this question and lawyers as 
well, legal people. They often say ``The case before us is to judge 
this person who committed a crime as to whether he or she should 
be given parole or consideration or should be kept in prison for a 
longer period of time''. That is the consideration. It is that 
individual on which they focus. They say ``Our venue does not 
allow for the victims to come in and make some kind of 
presentation because it is not the victim we are judging''. They say 
that is the dilemma that they are facing in making these kinds of 
judgments and carrying out their role either as a parole member or 
a judge in a court and so on.
<P>
	Somewhere in that process we have to open our minds and 
recognize that if someone is paroled that person, prior to that, has 
committed some kind of a crime on the street, in somebody's 
home, in terms of somebody's private property or has invaded the 
privacy of an individual or hurt some individual in some way, 
serious or otherwise. That has happened and there is a victim there 
all the time.
<P>
	Now that we are going to put this person back out on the street, 
why do we not consider victims rights and some input for victims?
<P>
	This motion aims in that direction and tries to alert the parole 
board that it should happen, that we as members of the House of 
Commons, as the member says so well in her motion, should direct 
the National Parole Board that any benefit of doubt in hearings and 
deliberations on parole should go to the victim, the victim's family 
and public safety, and not for that person who has committed the 
crime.
<P>
	What have we had from the government since we came to 
Parliament in 1994? In the year 1994 not much. My colleagues laid 
before the government case after case that the Minister of Justice 
was too soft on the criminal and there was not a consideration for 
the victim. I heard my hon. colleagues from Alberta and British 
Columbia lay that out over and over again. Section 745 of the 
Criminal Code comes into question where someone who has 
committed first degree murder is allowed to have consideration of 
parole after 15 years when they were given a 25 year sentence. We 
cannot see the common sense of that.
<P>
	The many victims of the crime, as we laid the issue before the 
hon. Minister of Justice, were not considered.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	All of a sudden we are into 1997, three years later, and the 
government is excited. It will do something with the criminals of 
this country. It will come down hard on the criminals.
<P>
	I see a press release issued by the Minister of Justice and the 
solicitor general April 17. Again they are making the claim to the 
public of Alberta that they will come down tough on the criminal. 
They say they have introduced a package of tough new measures to 
target criminal gang activity.
<P>
	It is all part of a facade. It is all part of a process by which the 
government thinks it must do this today, not bring some common 
sense to the criminal justice system. If that were the purpose, it 
would be excellent. The purpose becomes ``I want to do this''. This 
is what the Liberal government says.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gallaway:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
believe you will find there is unanimous consent to proceed 
immediately to consider the motion respecting the Senate 
amendment to Bill C-216 and to adopt it without further debate or 
amendments.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Do we have 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, the government 
again and again tries to give the impression that it will now be 
tough on the criminal and have a criminal justice system that may 
be a little fair or which will consider the victims of crime as such.
<P>
	We will look at the motives regarding what is behind it. The 
motive is very clear. On Sunday, April 27 the Prime Minister will 
call an election and the government requires a criminal justice 
package to convince the people of Canada that they should vote for 
the Liberal Party because it is tough on the criminal and is doing 
something for the victim.
<P>
	The motives are wrong. They are absolutely wrong. If the motive 
were really to deal with the system and to take responsibility in a 
legitimate, reasoned way rather than doing something for only 
political reasons, we would have better government and better 
policy in terms of the criminal and certainly in terms respecting the 
victims of crime.
<P>
	That is not the way it is. We see this knee-jerk reaction from 
government which is supposed to be good policy.
<P>
	Now we look at the parole boards. How are they appointed? I 
know some of these individuals because I have been in active 
politics for about 34 years. I recall in Alberta Mike Maccagno was 
a good Liberal. He was leader of the Liberal Party of Alberta. He 
was elected to the legislature of Alberta and we became good 
friends even though I was a minister of the government.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9914"> 9914 </A></B>
<P>
	I remember talking to Mr. Maccagno one day. He said: ``Ray, 
I think I am going to quit as the leader of the Liberal Party because 
I am going to Ottawa heaven. I am going to be appointed to the 
Parole Board of Canada''. Forever after he lived very happily 
because he got that appointment.
<P>
	The problem is do we have people there with credentials? I do 
not think we have. We must appoint those people because they have 
experience and something to contribute. I know members will take 
that into consideration with regard to this motion.
<P>

now expired and the item is dropped from the Order Paper.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HEALTH">HEALTH</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, in 
1992 the Standing Committee on Health published a study called 
``Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: A Preventable Tragedy''. It describes a 
little about FAS. There is no question that maternal alcohol 
consumption can have devastating impacts on the fetus.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	The basic fact is that when a pregnant woman drinks her unborn 
child drinks also. The alcohol in the mother's bloodstream 
circulates through the placenta into the bloodstream of the fetus. It 
is possible the blood alcohol level of the fetus will remain at an 
elevated level for a longer period than that of the mother because 
the immature fetal liver metabolizes the alcohol more slowly.
<P>
	Research shows that fetal alcohol syndrome is responsible for 5 
per cent of all birth defects. It can reflect on the following: severe 
neurological disorders, social dysfunction, permanent behavioural 
problems, criminal problems, reduced life span, restricted brain 
development, learning disorders, hyperactivity, mental retardation, 
pre and post natal growth retardation, speech and vision 
impairment, and other physical deformities.
<P>
	There is no question that fetal alcohol syndrome, often referred 
to as FAS, is a growing problem in Canada. In Ontario recent 
studies showed that although all other causes or problems to do 
with alcohol have gone down, the only only problem associated 
with alcohol that has gone up is fetal alcohol syndrome. In the last 
decade the number of incidents identified has risen by some 400 
per cent.
<P>
	In June 1995 my private member's Bill C-337 which asked for 
health warning labels on the containers of alcoholic beverages. Part 
of that labelling was to caution expectant mothers about the risks 
associated with alcohol consumption. Subsequently the bill passed 
in the House and is before committee. I hope It will come to this 
place.
<P>
	A couple of weeks ago the Canadian Pediatrics Society and the 
health ministry finally came out with a joint statement saying the 
best decision for pregnant women was to abstain from alcohol. This 
is the new wisdom of the ministry of health. The minister outlined 
a couple of things they have done. We only have to learn once that 
drinking or alcohol consumption during pregnancy even in 
moderation can impair an unborn child.
<P>
	I hope the health minister will get the message. We need to take a 
dramatic step to alert women planning to have children or currently 
pregnant to abstain from alcohol consumption. We should do 
something to produce full page advertisements in every paper in 
the country to once and for all make it very clear that consumption 
of alcohol during pregnancy is a severe risk to the health of the 
child to be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the 
question on fetal alcohol syndrome by the hon. member for 
Mississauga South whose interest in the matter is unabated.
<P>
	Alcohol use during pregnancy is a national health concern. 
Alcohol can affect the health of the mother, the fetus and the ability 
of the affected child to lead a healthy life even throughout 
adulthood. Fetal alcohol syndrome or FAS is a medical diagnosis 
that refers to a set of alcohol related disabilities associated with the 
use of alcohol during pregnancy. FAS children may suffer from a 
wide variety of physical and behavioural problems including 
learning disabilities. These children tend to have poor school 
experiences and as adults are more likely to end up in the criminal 
justice system.
<P>
	The joint statement on prevention of FAS in Canada was 
developed by 18 national and grassroots health organizations and 
the Department of Health. The main message in the statements is 
that women are advised to avoid alcohol during pregnancy. The 
statement also calls for appropriate family centres and culturally 
sensitive treatment programs for women addicted to alcohol. These 
recommendations address primary prevention of FAS, that is 
preventing the problem from occurring.
<P>
	There is also the need for accurate diagnosis, treatment of FAS 
children and support services for their families. In addition, we 
need a better understanding of the rate of FAS in Canada and 
further research into the effect of follow up programs for affected 
children.
<P>
	Health Canada is working with the co-signatories of the joint 
statement to continue to identify effective strategies in addressing 
these needs. The problem of  alcohol use during pregnancy is a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9915"> 9915 </A></B>
<P>
challenge to all of us concerned with the health of women, children 
and their families.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TRANSPORT">TRANSPORT</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
March 7 I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Transport whether the minister would implement the Transport 
Safety Board's recommendations to ensure that tanker car 
standards are strengthened to protect the public during the transport 
of dangerous chemical substances.
<P>
<B>(1835 )</B>
<P>
	I thank the parliamentary secretary for his reply to the effect that 
work was already in progress to upgrade the strength of tanker cars. 
This is certainly progress on the road to protecting Canadians, their 
lands and water from toxic chemicals in the event of rail accidents. 
It also represents an important step in maintaining the confidence 
of Canadians in rail transport.
<P>
	While this is a step in the right direction the public interest 
covers a much broader picture. If we are to have a truly sustainable 
transportation policy in Canada, not only do we need to have a safe 
rail system, important as it is. We also need to examine the effects 
of air pollution caused by increasing car and truck traffic. We also 
need to tackle the serious problem of carbon dioxide emissions and 
their contribution to the onset of climate change.
<P>
	Let me elaborate on one of these items. In a 1995 study by the 
sectoral task force on transportation of the Ontario Round Table on 
the Environment and the Economy it was calculated that for every 
tonne of cargo hauled road transport produced seven times more 
carbon dioxide than rail. This fact must become a central 
consideration when making transport decisions in Canada. At 
present we are unfortunately headed in the wrong direction. The 
amount of freight being hauled on Canada's roads is greatly 
increasing while the amount of freight being hauled on rail is 
decreasing.
<P>
	For example, road transport has increased its share of surface 
transport in Canada from 30 per cent in the 1950s to 70 per cent in 
1991. At present, subsidies to rail are being cut while road 
subsidies continue to increase. Today our highways are clogged 
with trucks when in some regions railway lines are being 
underutilized or even abandoned.
<P>
	Then there is the public health component of a sustainable 
transportation policy which points to the health cost caused by 
urban smog in Canada. Hundreds of millions of dollars between 
medical and hospital care are being spent. Clearly there is a link 
between transportation policy and human health. Therefore we 
need to find ways of reducing automotive transport.
<P>
	Producing cars and trucks which pollute less is helpful but not 
sufficient an answer unless accompanied by decrease in vehicles 
and vehicular use. What is needed is  a gradual reversal of the 
present trend, a movement toward a greater reliance on rail, a 
movement toward incentives favouring public transit in cities and a 
movement toward reducing subsidies for road transport.
<P>
	I have a question for the parliamentary secretary. When can 
Canadians expect the federal government to produce a sustainable 
transportation policy which would address protection of human 
health through pollution reduction and reduction of carbon dioxide 
emissions by giving greater importance to moving freight by rail 
and by encouraging and quite possibly facilitating policies aimed at 
moving people by public transit?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, with your permission, I would like 
to answer in French a question raised by the hon. member for 
Davenport on March 7.
<P>
	At the time he mentioned the recommendations of the 
Transportation Safety Board that additional restrictions be put on 
the use of Class 111A rail tanker cars for hauling dangerous 
materials.
<P>
	I can assure him that safety has always been and will continue to 
be the first priority of Transport Canada. The department is 
constantly working on upgrading the safety of the transportation 
systems used in this country.
<P>
	Regarding the specific recommendations of the Transportation 
Safety Board to which the hon. member referred, I can inform him 
that Transport Canada had carried out a complete review of goods 
that could be shipped in Class 111A tanker cars well before the 
Board presented its report.
<P>
	At the time, there were specific restrictions on the shipping of 80 
dangerous goods which may now no longer be carried in this type 
of tanker car. Recently, two more dangerous goods were added to 
the list of restricted goods. Transport Canada is continuing its 
analysis of 14 other dangerous goods.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	I may also point out that Class 111A tanker cars are the 
workhorses of the freight car fleet, with 165,000 cars in service in 
North America. Although Transport Canada feels that these cars 
provide a safe method of confinement, the department continues to 
look for effective ways to improve the safety of all Class 111A 
cars.
<P>
	Work is being done on ways to improve aluminum and nickel 
Class 111A cars. From now on they will require a full protective 
shield to protect the outside of tanker cars from perforation when 
used to carry dangerous goods.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to repeat that safety always has been and 
always will be the first priority of Transport Canada.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HEALTH">HEALTH</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, on February 20 I raised a question in the House for the 
first time on a subject of great value and importance to many 
Canadians, that is their right to use herbs and other natural products 
for health and/or medical reasons.
<P>
	What these people are suggesting is quite simple. They are 
saying Health Canada in its health protection branch is being 
non-consultative to the extent that it ignores the freedom of choice 
of Canadians.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary will suggest as he did on February 
20 that products which are sold must be safe and effective. He will 
talk about Ephedra and how some people out west had a bad 
reaction to it, but he will not talk about pharmaceutical drugs which 
each and every day put people into emergency rooms at great cost 
to the system because they are not safe for the intended user.
<P>
	This issue is really about miracles of magic when through the 
wonder of the health protection branch something that grows in the 
garden or swims in water is no longer a food but becomes a drug, a 
drug that may be restricted or not accepted at all. What is a dietary 
supplement south of the border is a drug in Canada. What has been 
used for hundreds of thousands of years with positive effects is 
banned in Canada. What is naturally occurring and at worst 
innocuous is outlawed by nameless faces in the name of good 
medicine in Canada.
<P>
	In all of this we have lost sight of the consumer. Regulatory 
mania and cost recovery are driving this. Health Canada is putting 
the onus of proof on the individual consumer. Yet who is speaking 
for the consumer?
<P>
	It should be noted that British Columbia is investing more than 
$5 million to found a centre to apply alternative health products 
and procedures. Because of the influx of people from the Pacific 
Rim there is a realization that their ways, although we do not know 
why, are safe and beneficial. We know this to be the case because 
for thousands of years their methods have in fact worked. Yet the 
health protection branch says: ``This is all news to us. Prove it''.
<P>
	I am suggesting that consumer rights are greater than 
bureaucratic rights. I am suggesting that bureaucrats should accede 
to the right of Canadians to access natural products they believe to 
be of benefit to them.
<P>
	I am urging the minister to speak for Canadian consumers and 
not for business interests, rule makers and multinational 
corporations.
<P>
	On a parallel point, last Saturday the <I>Globe and Mail</I> carried an 
article on the apparent power of prayer to improve the condition of 
the sick. Why this treatment  works on a scientific basis, who really 
knows. Perhaps I could suggest the health protection branch should 
investigate and regulate this too.
<P>
	I realize this is really stretching the comparison. Yet why 
regulate daffodil bulbs, oil from parsley and lily of the valley, all of 
which grow in my garden? If I believe that consuming these will in 
a natural way correct a medical problem I might have, what does it 
matter to the health protection branch if perhaps like prayer they 
can in fact have a beneficial effect on my particular case?
<P>
	I have a prescription for Health Canada. Perhaps a dose of sense 
and sensibility before those two things are regulated would 
persuade the minister to rethink his department's position.
<P>
	What is effective such as daffodil bulbs and prayers may not 
always be scientifically quantifiable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I guess I should respond since we 
are in a definite linguistic mode.
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Italian.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I do not want to go back to what I said just a moment ago but the 
member is pre-empting what he thought I was going to say. I think I 
am going to surprise him.
<P>
	I want to respond to the hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton 
regarding the implication of herbal products in Canada. The 
mandate of Health Canada is to ensure that drug products on the 
Canadian market are safe, effective and of high quality.
<P>
	It is not our intention to restrict the right of free choice but rather 
to ensure that choices available can be made without concern for 
the effectiveness and safety of products. Any herbal product in a 
form used by the consumer that is intended for medicinal use 
requires a drug identification number. Canadians can be assured 
that if a product has a DIN it has been verified as safe and effective 
by the Canadian government.
<P>
	It is worth mentioning that it is the importer's responsibility to 
ensure its products are in compliance. There are thousands of 
legitimate products on the market. Health Canada is encouraging 
the herbal medicine industry to come forward with proposals 
regarding the acceptable use of various herbal products.
<P>
	In response to numerous requests for lists of herbs and herbal 
products that might be stopped by Customs from entry into Canada, 
the department is developing a system by which there can be a 
greater degree of certainty and transparency in terms of the 
products that are permitted in Canada.
