	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-45, an act to amend the 
Criminal Code (judicial review of parole ineligibility) and another 
act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure this morning to lead off 
second reading debate on Bill C-45 and to put forth the reasons of 
the government why this legislation deserves the support of 
members of the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	First of all, I would like to say that the purpose of this bill is to 
amend the scheme set out in section 745 of the Criminal Code the 
provision that provides for judicial review of the parole 
ineligibility period for life sentences imposed on persons convicted 
of murder or high treason.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In cases of first degree murder or high treason the parole 
ineligibility period is set by law at 25 years. In the case of second 
degree murder the parole ineligibility period is 10 years unless the 
trial judge sets it higher at a point between 10 and 25 years. An 
offender is not eligible to apply under section 745 until after that 
offender has served at least 15 years of the parole ineligibility 
period.
<P>
	The decision in a section 745 review is made by a jury composed 
of ordinary citizens drawn from the community. As the section 
currently reads, the decision can be made by two-thirds of the jury, 
eight of the twelve members.
<P>
	After hearing evidence called by the applicant and by the crown 
attorney in response, the jury decides whether to reduce the parole 
ineligibility period and to what extent. If it decides not to reduce 
the parole ineligibility period, the jury must decide when the 
offender may apply again, if at all, under section 745.
<P>
	In cases where the parole ineligibility period is reduced, the 
offender becomes eligible to apply to the National Parole Board 
when that period as reduced by the section 745 jury is up. The 
parole board then consider the case and may grant parole only in 
appropriate cases. In making its decision the parole board must 
consider whether the offender's release would pose an undue risk to 
public safety.
<P>
	I emphasize a point crucial to an understanding of the issues that 
arise with respect to Bill C-45, a point I do not believe is much 
discussed or well understood generally. The life sentence imposed 
on someone convicted of murder or high treason continues literally 
for the offender's entire life. In that sense, life does mean life.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	In those cases where such an offender is released on parole, the 
offender continues to be subject to the sentence and can be 
reincarcerated at any time should he or she breach the conditions of 
release imposed by the parole board. They are accountable for the 
balance of their lives.
<P>
	I would also like to stress for hon. members the legislative 
history of section 745. It is said by some that this provision was 
included in the Criminal Code by stealth, that it somehow resulted 
from trickery or deception.
<P>
	Section 745 became part of our Criminal Code 20 years ago in 
1976 as part of the amendments by which the House of Commons 
and Parliament abolished capital punishment.
<P>
	Section 745 was the subject of full and vigorous debate. It was 
not slipped into the statute books as a surprise to the unwary. It is a 
fundamental aspect of the resolution reached by the House on the 
very difficult question of the appropriate penalty for murder.
<P>
	It was enacted as a response to the recognition that a 25 year 
parole and eligibility period is significantly longer than murderers 
were serving before parole at that time.
<P>
	In cases of non-capital murder, the average time served before 
parole release was between 12 and 13.2 years. In cases of capital 
murder commuted to life, the average time served was between 6.2 
and 7.7 years.
<P>
	Section 745 was enacted in recognition that 25 years without 
parole eligibility was and still is longer than comparable periods in 
many of the western democratic  countries. I hesitate to draw 
comparisons with the United States because capital punishment is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3856"> 3856 </A></B>
<P>
still used there. Nevertheless, even in the United States of America, 
a country known for its firmness in response to crime, the average 
time served by murderers who are not executed is 18 years at the 
federal level and 15 years at the state level.
<P>
	If I may be permitted to paraphrase some of the language used in 
the 1976 debates with respect to this section, section 745 was 
enacted to offer a degree of hope for the rehabilitation of convicted 
murderers, as a protection for prison guards and in recognition that 
in some cases the public interest would not be served by keeping 
offenders in prison beyond 15 years.
<P>
	As many members will know, there are those who would repeal 
this section in its entirety. I have been presented with strong 
demands from some quarters for the repeal of this section outright 
based on the arguments about public safety, about the appropriate 
denunciatory statement for what is arguably the worst crime in the 
Criminal Code and about the prospect of victims' families being 
revictimized by the public review conducted in front of a jury 
where the offender might have no reasonable prospect of 
succeeding.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The position I have stated publicly is that I have been looking at 
ways to amend section 745 in order to re-focus the provision so that 
it is available only in deserving cases. In my view, the status quo is 
simply not on and Bill C-45 is proof of that.
<P>
	By the same token, I am not prepared to propose to this House, 
as others have done, that section 745 be repealed. In my view, as a 
matter of policy and as a matter of principle, this would not be the 
right thing to do.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Section 745 exists to recognize the possibility that offenders can 
change after serving 15 years of their sentence. Unless we are 
prepared to abandon all hope that people who have been convicted 
of murder can change, our challenge is to find a way to refocus the 
provision so that it is available only in those exceptional and 
deserving cases.
<P>
	The amendments proposed in the bill now before the House are 
designed to achieve that objective.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	Let me describe briefly the three elements of these changes. 
First, it is proposed to eliminate access to section 745 and the jury 
review entirely for all multiple murderers who may offend in the 
future. For this purpose, a multiple murderer would be understood 
as someone who murders more than one person, whether on the 
same occasion or not.
<P>
	The rationale for this proposal is very simple. It is based on a 
principle found throughout the Criminal Code and criminal law 
jurisprudence that repeat offenders should be treated differently. 
The fact that it is a second or subsequent offence should be 
reflected in the penalty that person receives.
<P>
	Second, it is proposed to create a screening mechanism whereby 
the chief justice of the superior court, or a judge designated by the 
chief justice, would conduct a paper review of the application 
brought by the person under section 745 to determine if there is a 
reasonable chance of success. That would be done before the 
application is allowed to proceed to the review jury. This proposal 
would apply not only to future offenders but to the present prison 
population as well, provided they have not brought an application 
before the amendments come into force.
<P>
	The purpose of the screening mechanism is to help ensure that 
only those meritorious cases get a hearing before the section 745 
jury. This is intended to address directly the concern of the families 
of victims that they may be brought into a hearing process by an 
offender who has no reasonable prospect of success.
<P>
	Finally, it is proposed to change section 745 to require that the 
review jury must be unanimous in coming to the decision that the 
offender's parole ineligibility period should be reduced. Again, this 
proposal is to apply to the present prison population as well as to 
future offenders. This new requirement of jury unanimity will 
strengthen the role of the community jury in the review process.
<P>
	Let me mention this on the subject of the role of the jury in the 
section 745 process. It is said by some that section 745 
demonstrates that the criminal law is out of touch with the common 
view, that it is out of touch with the perspective of the average 
Canadian, that it does not reflect the community's desire in 
responding to crimes of violence. To that, I say that section 745 is 
just the opposite. It is an example of the community being directly 
involved in the administration of the criminal justice system.
<P>
	In the amendments proposed under section 745, the first step 
would be that the offender has to persuade a judge, based on a 
written application, that the person has a case for a jury which has a 
reasonable prospect of success, based on the tests in section 745 
itself.
<P>
	The unmeritorious applicants will be screened out. Only those 
ones will go forward that in the eye of an experienced judge have a 
reasonable chance of success. Those cases that do go forward will 
not be considered and decided by a judge, will not be considered 
and decided by lawyers, nor by bureaucrats, nor by parole members 
or members of other administrative boards or tribunals.
<P>
	Those cases that are screened as meritorious and go forward for 
hearing will be decided by 12 members of the  community, often 
the very community to which the offender seeks to return if parole 
is eventually granted. Those 12 members of the community will be 
drawn from the streets, the coffee shops, the buses and offices, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3857"> 3857 </A></B>
<P>
very people who elected us to Parliament, the very people in whose 
name it is said that section 745 is out of touch with the community 
and its values. It is members of those communities who will make 
the decision under section 745 about whether there is any further 
public interest to be served by that offender remaining in prison, 
perhaps for a period of 10 years more.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	Jury members will have before them particulars of the offender 
and the offence. They will have before them any evidence that the 
victim's family may wish to give. They will have arguments from 
the applicant and also from the crown attorney who may oppose the 
application. Under the amendments proposed, that jury will have to 
be unanimous. All 12 of those average Canadians will have to agree 
that in this case, already screened by a judge, the offender should 
be given some reduction in the parole ineligibility period.
<P>
	It will not result in the offender walking free. It will simply 
result in the offender being permitted at that date, set by the jury, to 
make an application for parole. It then becomes a question for the 
parole board whether it is consistent with public safety that the 
person be granted parole. Even then the person, for the rest of his or 
her life will be subject to whatever conditions the parole board 
imposes, and if those conditions are not respected that person will 
face reincarceration. Those are the facts. Those are the 
circumstances. That is the role of the community.
<P>
	That is the way average Canadians reflect their values, 
participate in the process, and ensure that decisions in all these 
cases are firmly rooted in the views and the values of average 
Canadians. That is the strength of community juries and it is those 
juries that will be deciding these cases.
<P>
	Let me also point out that at the first stage, this screening process 
before the judge that we propose, the onus will be on the offender 
to prove on the balance of probabilities that the application has a 
reasonable prospect of success. It will be for the offender to 
persuade the judge. Where the judge says no, where the judge 
screens out an applicant and says there is no reasonable prospect of 
success in this case, the person may not have his or her jury 
hearing. The judge may decide if and when the applicant will be 
allowed to apply again, but in any event the applicant may not 
reapply before another two years' time.
<P>
	The net effect of the amendments proposed will be that section 
745 is not repealed. We do not believe as a matter of principle or 
policy that repeal is the proper course. Section 745, and the faint 
hope it represents, has been an integral part of the sentencing 
regime for  murder for 20 years. In those cases where applications 
have been brought and succeeded and offenders have been 
released, the record shows that the existence of this mechanism has 
not endangered the public's safety.
<P>
	After listening to all the stakeholders in the justice system over 
the last two years, from judges to crown prosecutors and police, 
offenders and victims' families, I am persuaded that the section 
should be changed. The section should be improved and it should 
be refocused. It should not be available automatically at the option 
of the offender. There should be a screen to take the unmeritorious 
cases out. The jury should be unanimous and in future offences, 
those who take more than one life should not be eligible to apply at 
all.
<P>
	Simply repealing section 745 would constitute this Parliament 
saying to the hundreds of people serving life for murder that in 
every case, regardless of the circumstances, there is an inflexible 
and invariable rule that the period without parole must be 25 years 
or whatever period is fixed by the trial judge for second degree 
murder, between 10 and 25.
<P>
	It would be an invariable and inflexible rule excluding the role of 
the community jury in taking a look after 15 years, ignoring the 
fact that 15 years is the average time now in the laws of many 
western countries to whom we like to compare ourselves, as the 
maximum for murder. It would be ignoring the fact that before 
1976 the average time served even for capital murder was less than 
15 years before parole. So we do not favour repeal.
<P>
	We say that it is an excessive reaction. We say that the principle 
of this mechanism is sound, it provides a role for the community, 
but we also propose improvement.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	The effect of the improvements is that these applications will be 
denied if the screening judge says there is no reasonable prospect 
for success, if the jury decides that the application should be 
denied, or the jury concludes that it is unable to decide 
unanimously to reduce the period, or a judge presiding over a jury 
concludes, after a reasonable period of time, that the jury will not 
be able to reach a unanimous decision to reduce the parole 
ineligibility period. The application will be denied by the jury in 
those circumstances or where the jury is unable to decide the 
offender will not be able to make another application at least before 
another two years' time or within such other period as the jury may 
fix.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am prepared to do this, partly because of the charter, but also 
for reasons of pubic policy. Let me return to the view I expressed at 
the beginning of my remarks. Section 745 represents the hope that 
offenders can change after serving 15 years of their sentence. I 
believe that hope must be maintained for exceptional and deserving 
cases.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I commend this bill to the House. I ask my colleagues to support 
it. With its enactment an important principle in the criminal law 
will be preserved. We will have respected the need for public 
safety. We will have encouraged rehabilitation which is a 
fundamental principle of the sentencing process. We will have 
shown sensitivity to victims. We will have reserved this procedure 
for the exceptional and the meritorious case. With that I invite my 
colleagues to support Bill C-45.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in his 
presentation, the minister has rewritten history as it relates to 
section 745 of the Criminal Code. I think that some clarifications, 
if not corrections, are in order.
<P>
	First of all, if memory serves, the last time a death sentence was 
executed in Canada was in 1962, on December 6 to be more 
precise. After that, the government, represented by the governor 
general in council, systematically commuted all death sentences 
until 1967, when Parliament decided to abolish capital punishment 
for five years, a decision which was renewed for another five years 
at the expiry of the first five years.
<P>
	It was in a debate held in this House around that time, in 1976, 
that was raised the matter of section 745 of the Criminal Code, 
which provides that, in cases of high treason-admittedly not the 
most common cases; we have to go a long way back in our history 
to find any-but essentially cases of first degree murder, that is to 
say planned and deliberate murders, and second degree murder, 
where the term of imprisonment is longer than 15 years, offenders 
be sentenced to life, but with a minimum sentence.
<P>
	In 1976, about this time of the year, the Trudeau government 
introduced a bill to abolish capital punishment permanently-if 
anything can indeed be permanent in this world. The bill did not 
specify any dates and the practice was not restored by this House, 
even if there was a debate on the subject during the 33rd 
Parliament. There was no mention of section 745 at the time.
<P>
	When did section 745 become an issue? When Mr. Trudeau, who 
was then Prime Minister, realized he did not have the majority he 
needed in this House to pass his bill on abolishing capital 
punishment. It was common knowledge at the time, and history 
also showed that, since the death sentence had been abolished on a 
temporary basis in 1967, a person sentenced to life imprisonment 
for murder usually was granted parole after a relatively short time, 
12 years or so. Several members were quite irritated by this 
situation, as were their constituents.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister was opposed to section 745; the solicitor 
general, who was the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, was 
opposed to section 745. In fact, most cabinet members were 
opposed to section 745, and it was not the cabinet that proposed 
section 745 in the original bill. Section 745, which deals with a 
minimum sentence of 25 years, was included when the government 
realized that its bill was not getting support.
<P>
	The six-vote difference that enabled the government to abolish 
the death sentence in 1976 was only gained through back room 
political negotiations between the government, its own members 
and members of the opposition, to secure the majority required. 
Otherwise, the bill to abolish the death penalty would have been 
defeated in July 1976, instead of being passed with a majority of 
six votes. As we can see, the balance of power is something very 
important.
<P>
	The comments made earlier by the minister must be put in their 
historical context. The minister talked about the legislative aspect 
of section 745. Everything was done through discussions that took 
place in informal settings. People negotiated among themselves: 
``If I give you a minimum of 25 years, will you support my bill? 
Will you be in your riding? Can you be away?'' The result, in July 
1976, was that the death penalty was abolished on the strength of 
six votes.
<P>
	It is wrong to try to rewrite history and claim this was a 
government policy. The issue must be put in its proper historical 
context, starting back in 1969, with the major criminal law 
reforms. The process began with a liberal approach, by this I mean 
small ``l'' liberal, in the non partisan sense, because nowadays the 
Liberals have a rather different approach. Criminal law underwent 
a reform. For example, the provisions of the Criminal Code which, 
until 1969, criminalized homosexuality and the prescription of 
anovulatory pills, were eliminated. Strange as it may seem, the use 
of such medication was considered a criminal act. Needless to say 
these provisions did not reflect the values of the time, or those of 
today.
<P>
	Other reforms took place in the ensuing years, including bail 
reform. It must be remembered that, at the time, people could be 
released on bail in Canada only if they had the money. If they could 
hand over a chunk of money to the clerk of the Superior Court, in 
the case of Quebec, or the Supreme Court, in the case of other 
provinces, they could be released on bail for major crimes. Others 
lacking the financial wherewithal could not be released.
<P>
	The more liberal approach I was referring to a moment ago led to 
release on bail subject to various conditions other than strictly 
pecuniary ones. Furthermore, essentially the same conditions have 
been retained, even though certain criteria for release on bail have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3859"> 3859 </A></B>
<P>
been amended, because it could be seen that with bills passed in the 
early seventies it was becoming extremely difficult to prevent 
release on bail. Adjustments were made in the periods that 
followed.
<P>
	Basically, the possibility that citizens accused of a crime today 
will be released on bail while awaiting trial does not hinge solely 
on their financial ability to post bail or have someone else do so on 
their behalf.
<P>
	Changes have taken place. Today, the government is 
backtracking, quietly rewriting history. Today we are presented 
with Bill C-45, which is not a bill that can just be tossed in the 
garbage. It still deserves a slightly more careful analysis, and it 
certainly deserves to go to committee for clause by clause 
consideration and also so that witnesses can be heard. This is not a 
bill that can be passed in two or three days. There are 
criminologists, social groups, victims' representatives, the 
Canadian Police Association and several other groups that will 
wish to comment on this bill.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Once again, the government is trying to play both ends against 
the middle. It knows very well that this House has already spoken 
on Bill C-226, introduced by the member for York South-Weston. 
The House has adopted in principle the abrogation of section 745, 
and the minister cannot ignore this.
<P>
	Now we find in the philosophy of this bill, if there is one, or at 
least in its principles, that, yes, the House did hold a free vote on 
abrogation of section 745 of the Criminal Code, and the Minister 
has obviously taken this into consideration.
<P>
	However, the minister does not want to be perceived as 
following the same political line as his former Liberal colleague, 
the hon. member for York South-Weston. He is therefore 
attempting to present something today, by juggling words or 
procedures, that differs from Bill C-226.
<P>
	Is there really such a great difference? Perhaps not really, 
because, when it comes down to it, the parole conditions under 745 
are made so difficult that, in future, if the bill is adopted as is, one 
wonders if it would not be better to merely propose its total 
abrogation.
<P>
	Let us recall that, under the present circumstances, a person 
convicted of first degree murder is sentenced to life imprisonment, 
without eligibility for parole until he has served a minimum of 25 
years of his sentence. If convicted of second degree murder, the 
sentence is life imprisonment with a minimum of 10 years. If the 
trial judge has set the minimum at 15 years or over, the individual 
may make use of section 745 as it now stands.
<P>
	In other words, after 15 years of imprisonment, the individual 
may apply to the Chief Justice of the superior court of his or her 
province, in certain provinces the supreme court, but at any rate 
judges at equivalent levels, requesting designation of a judge to 
hear the application. The judge merely notes the application, 
having no power of discretion, meaning that he or she does not hear 
the evidence at this point, merely noting that the 15 years have been 
served.
<P>
	The judge must then empanel a jury to hear the application, as if 
it were a court of criminal assizes. The jury hears the application, 
with a judge presiding, and determines by a two-thirds vote that the 
inmate's behaviour warrants his release.
<P>
	Although the two thirds criterion is there-and it is a pretty stiff 
one-the determination by the jury is final, unlike in a criminal 
proceeding where the decision of the jury is final on the facts and 
cannot be changed by the trial judge. Neither can it be quashed by a 
court of appeal or the Supreme Court. All a court of appeal or the 
Supreme Court can do with a finding of not guilty in a criminal 
case is order a new trial. It is no longer possible for a court of 
appeal-and I admit that this is one of the Liberals' major 
reforms-to substitute a verdict of guilty for a jury's verdict of not 
guilty.
<P>
	It can, however, do the opposite. That is, it can make a finding of 
acquittal after a jury has reached a verdict of guilt. The jury 
convened under section 745 determines by a two thirds majority 
whether an individual may apply for parole. In the end, it is not 
even the jury's decision, at the moment. The jury simply 
determines the inmate's eligibility to go before the National Parole 
Board to apply to present his case and his arguments. The jury's 
decision is not the final one.
<P>
	We might ask ourselves why, in a trial, is the jury's verdict of 
guilty or not guilty final when, in the case of release on parole, the 
jury's decision is simply a recommendation to all intents and 
purposes to the National Parole Board. It is not particularly 
fulfilling for a jury, despite what the minister said earlier.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	What then would be affected in section 745 if the amendments 
were accepted? First, the accused, actually the inmate, appears 
before the chief justice, who will designate a judge, and makes 
application. As regards the application, Bill C-45 provides a new 
step requiring the application to be made to a judge, who will hear 
the evidence. On the basis of the evidence, he will decide whether 
the inmate has a real or reasonable chance of success before the 
jury. This is therefore the first stage.
<P>
	Depending on whether he is powerful or destitute, on whether or 
not he has a good lawyer, on whether or not the judge is in a good or 
bad disposition that day, the defendant or the inmate may be treated 
differently. This step, which may be unnecessary, is worth 
reviewing. If the judge gives the inmate the right to appear before a 
jury, the inmate will be required to do so.
<P>
	This bill gives the jury a slightly different role by changing the 
rules of the game. The rule that any recommendation must be made 
by two thirds of the jury  no longer applies. The bill now says that 
the recommendation must be unanimous. The criteria used for 
granting parole are the same as those used to determine if a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3860"> 3860 </A></B>
<P>
defendant is guilty. All this is closely linked to the rule of evidence, 
according to which the crown has the burden of proving beyond a 
reasonable doubt and convincing 12 citizens that the defendant in a 
trial is guilty. This is no longer a matter of convincing a jury that a 
defendant is guilty. Rather, the crown must ask a group chosen 
among ordinary citizens if, in their opinion, the inmate ought to be 
granted parole. In fact, it is no longer asking for a decision, but for 
an opinion.
<P>
	Why set such a high criterion as the criterion of unanimity? 
There will inevitably be someone among the 12 jury members who, 
for his or her own reasons, will object to the inmate's applying to 
the National Parole Board. The two thirds criterion should, in my 
opinion, be maintained, and that is an amendment we will certainly 
put forward at the committee stage, as the jury's recommendation 
does not have the same weight as in criminal proceedings, in which 
the jury must be unanimous. The group dynamics within a jury 
must also be considered. A two thirds agreement represents a 
significant degree of consent on the part of the jury, and this 
standard can generally be recognized as valid in a free and 
democratic society.
<P>
	So a criterion to determine guilt must be seen quite differently 
from a criterion to grant parole. On what basis must the jury 
decide? Not on evidence beyond all reasonable doubt, but on a 
preponderance of evidence. Jury members hear the evidence and 
determine if they sincerely believe that the applicant deserves to be 
granted parole given his behaviour, his record, and so on.
<P>
	Demanding evidence practically beyond all reasonable doubt 
because every member of the jury must be convinced is much too 
high a criterion. Following a unanimous jury decision, the inmate 
could and should apply to the National Parole Board, which is the 
only authority with the power to grant parole.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	Contrary to what has been said by some members of the Reform 
Party and the Liberal Party, which has several wings-that party is, 
in fact, losing a lot of feathers lately-we are faced with some 
rather difficult situations. They are trying to have it both ways.
<P>
	So this militant wing of the Reform Party and the Liberal Party 
argues that section 745 automatically grants parole to inmates. The 
inmate must file an application, convince two-thirds of a jury, and 
then appear before the National Parole Board.
<P>
	We in the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs 
recently heard representatives of the National Parole Board, who 
explained to us that, under section 745, there were practically no 
subsequent offences. This clause has probably achieved its 
purpose.
<P>
	It may be worthwhile to review it. Is it too cumbersome or too 
complex? As the minister said, should a person convicted of more 
than one murder be given the same latitude as a person who has 
committed just one crime? I think that first offenders should be 
treated with all possible leniency, especially after spending 15 or 
20 years in prison.
<P>
	We recognize society's right to protect itself against career 
criminals. There are not only inalienable individual rights but also 
a collective right to protection for all of society. I am not in any 
way defending the idea that convicted repeat offenders should be 
set loose on society.
<P>
	We can still review the current criteria used to enforce section 
745, without going to extremes. We should certainly consider the 
age at which the inmate was convicted of a crime. If he is convicted 
of first-degree murder at age 20, there is not much information on 
his past. It may be normal to want to keep this individual in prison 
for 15, 20 or 25 years to see what happens. There is a problem when 
a 20-year-old is convicted of first-degree murder.
<P>
	But there are always exceptions, as we saw in the Quebec 
judicial district. This 62 or 63 year old lady, if I remember 
correctly, had been found guilty of first degree murder. In theory, 
she would not become eligible for parole until the ripe old age of 
88. There are always exceptional cases like that.
<P>
	This is a real-life story. Should persons who have been 
law-abiding citizen all their lives until the age of 65 or 70 be 
subject to the 25 year parole ineligibility criterion? This would 
certainly not be very consistent with the individualization of 
punishment principle, calling for the particular circumstances 
under which an act, fundamentally reprehensible in itself, was 
committed to be taken into account.
<P>
	For the foregoing reasons, the official opposition will support 
the principle of Bill C-45, especially since it is only normal to take 
a second look and a good hard second look at section 745 of the 
Criminal Code after 20 years of operation. There are very valid 
provisions in this bill dealing, among other things, with criminals 
who are utterly beyond redemption, in other words repeat 
offenders, those who murder more than one person. I have no 
trouble understanding this part of the bill.
<P>
	Where the jury is concerned, I think we should stick to a two 
thirds majority decision and hear more expert testimony on the 
need for the inmate to convince the judge before the application is 
allowed to proceed to the jury.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	There is something wrong with the way our criminal justice 
system is administered. People should not have to make their case 
first before a judge and then before a jury. This is not in keeping 
with the way our criminal  justice system generally works. Those 
who go before a jury have chosen to be heard by a jury and, in such 
cases, the judge is master of the law, but not master of the facts. 
Now it would all be jumbled. The bill would have the judge 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3861"> 3861 </A></B>
<P>
examine the facts first and then the jury do it again. If section 745 
and hearing by a jury are maintained, the judge should be only 
concerned with the law and let the jury deal with the facts, as in any 
other criminal matter.
<P>
	For these reasons, we will vote in favour of Bill C-45 at second 
reading and make sure it is examined carefully by a parliamentary 
committee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I realize I 
will not finish my address to Bill C-45 before we have to stop for 
question period. Nevertheless, I will touch on some of the points 
raised by both the justice minister and our colleague from the Bloc.
<P>
	The justice minister addressed this business as to whether 
section 745 was brought into the Criminal Code originally by 
stealth or without the full knowledge of the people. Our hon. 
colleague from the Bloc touched on the backroom shenanigans that 
went on back in 1976 when capital punishment was being removed 
from the Criminal Code and when this section was brought in.
<P>
	The people of Canada knew nothing about this, evidenced when 
the hue and cry arose across the country as these first degree 
murderers began to apply and receive a reduction in their parole 
ineligibility. There was not a great degree of awareness across 
Canada about what was happening in this area of the criminal 
justice system. I suggest the justice minister has not adequately and 
certainly not sufficiently or successfully addressed that point.
<P>
	He also spoke highly about the protection that comes to the 
justice system as a result of the use of juries and that it is people 
from the community who will be deciding on the acceptability of a 
section 745 application. That is fine and that is good. Juries are our 
safeguard, but juries can only act and decide based on the 
information they receive. Juries have not always made decisions in 
the best interest of society because they have been deprived of the 
information they needed to make a just decision.
<P>
	The Donald Marshall case, which was tried by a judge and jury 
and the decision was made by the jury, is an example of that. The 
Wilson Nepoose case, which I was personally involved with, again 
shows that if sufficient information is not presented to the jury it 
cannot make a decision in the best interest of society.
<P>
	I suggest as well if we examine the limited nature of the juries 
that are called to act under section 745, what kind of information 
are they receiving? Do they receive information pertaining to the 
specific acts the individual committed, the circumstances around 
them, the pain and the horror caused by that individual's action to 
not only the victim but the victim's family and to society in 
general? Are they given that kind of information? I suggest they are 
not. They can make a decision only based on the information 
provided to them according to the rules.
<P>
	If we look at the rules they fall far short. That has been the 
complaint from some of the vested interests in these section 745 
hearings, concerning all the information about the consequences 
the actions of this applicant who is there because of first degree 
murder had on society and on individuals and whether this whole 
question of retribution and punishment has been fulfilled, and 
whether just the question of rehabilitation has been addressed 
before these juries.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	Therefore when the justice minister suggests all is well simply 
because a jury of common people, picked from the community, will 
be addressing the issue, I suggest there is a weakness in that 
argument and that weakness is clear according to the information 
placed before the jury. The jury cannot act on any other information 
except placed before it. In most cases the rules are set, particularly 
in the 745 hearings, which leaves a lot to be desired in terms of the 
horror and pain caused by the applicant.
<P>
	I have about five minutes left and so I will get into the main 
thrust of my concern about this bill. Of course I rise to speak in 
opposition to it. Bill C-45 demonstrates the justice minister 
seemingly has no real understanding of the horror inflicted on the 
murder victims, on their families and on society. If he does it is not 
reflected in the bill.
<P>
	The truck driver who witnessed the horror on Melanie 
Carpenter's face as she sat captive in the front seat of her killer's 
car understands the terror endured by this victim. The jury which 
endured the vivid testimony of Karla Homolka and witnessed the 
graphic audio account of the torture inflicted by Paul Bernardo on 
Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy understands the pain and 
suffering of these victims. It understands the constant anguish the 
families of these young girls live with every day of their lives, lives 
that have been damaged and altered forever.
<P>
	Bill C-45 shows the justice minister has little empathy with the 
family of murder victims. If he has, it is not reflected in the bill. 
The victims and the families endure nightmares as a result of the 
heinous crimes committed against their children and 
grandchildren.
<P>
	The members of the Standing Committee of Justice and Legal 
Affairs witnessed firsthand the horror of Sylvain Leduc's 
grandmother whose grandson was viciously beaten to death. Listen 
to the horror of Sylvain Leduc's grandmother: ``The most painful 
thing in life is to live with the knowledge that your child lies naked 
and cold in a morgue. My grandson was in the morgue for three 
days. I was frozen to death. I could not warm up. I  was in a hot tub 
for three days. I could not stand it until I knew he had clothes on 
him. My

heart is a pump that keeps blood flowing through my veins. I have a 
special sacred place situated below my stomach. Some people call

question period.

	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Vancouver South, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in July 1995 Burma's military dictatorship, known as the 
SLORC, released pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from 
house arrest.
<P>
	While many of us were cautious in our optimism, we took 
SLORC's release of the Nobel prize laureate to be a sign of good 
faith. Under SLORC's oppression, Aung San remains powerless to 
bring about any democratic change. Given the limitations imposed 
on her, she remains in essence a prisoner.
<P>
	SLORC continues to thwart democracy by arresting its 
supporters, erecting road blocks and even disrupting train 
schedules. It will stop at nothing to prevent citizens from gathering 
in peaceful assembly or meeting to hear the democratically elected 
leader.
<P>
	SLORC's oppressive authoritarian regime has not changed. I 
urge my colleagues to continue to challenge the ongoing human 
rights abuses in Burma and to encourage democratic reforms.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley,

Quebecois try to convince the House Quebec suffers within 
Confederation.
<P>
	However, one example it has not used to demonstrate the 
suffering is the Canada-Quebec accord. Under the terms of the 
accord Quebec receives a minimum of $90 million per year for 
immigrant settlement services. This represents 35 per cent of the 
$256 million the federal government spends on these services.
<P>
	When the agreement was signed in 1991 the province of Quebec, 
with 25 per cent of the population, was accepting 22 per cent of 
immigrants. Today Quebec accepts only 13 per cent of all 
immigrants, yet under the terms of this accord it cannot receive less 
than $90 million.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	This accord has resulted in the province of Quebec receiving 
$3,300 for each immigrant while the other Canadian provinces 
receive on average $863 per immigrant.
<P>
	If the separatists really want Quebec to be treated in a fair and 
equitable manner, then I am sure they would agree to this accord 
being renegotiated.

	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am disturbed by the big banks' insistence on gouging their 
customers at every turn. Industry Canada reports show that the big 
banks are charging fees on their credit cards that average 10.5 to 12 
percentage points higher than the bank rate. Incredibly, even while 
prime bank rates decrease, credit card rates continue to rise.
<P>
	``Not fair,'' cries the chairman of one of the large banks. 
``Caucus isn't friendly to the banks,'' states another representative. 
The banks are nickel and diming their customers to death. The next 
thing you know a customer will need to pay an entrance fee to have 
access to his or her money.
<P>
	It is odd that the central bank rate goes up one day and the banks 
raise their rates the next day, but when the rate goes down, the 
banks might react in a week or never at all.
<P>
	I am asking the banks on behalf of all Canadians to act as good 
corporate citizens, to work together with us in partnership for a 
better Canada today and tomorrow.

	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this week 
Canada's national public broadcaster, the CBC, announced its new 
fall programming schedule for English television. I am pleased to 
see that Canadians will now have access to an all-Canadian 
programming schedule during prime time on CBC.
<P>
	Working with the best and the brightest talent in our country, the 
CBC will be offering more dramatic productions highlighting

programming that is educational, non-violent and entertaining; and 
current affairs programs that will tell Canadians about their country 
and its remarkable people.

<P>
	Last December, the CBC formally pledged to canadianize its

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans,

downplay Quebecers' blueprint for society, starting with the Prime 
Minister, for whom our determination is tantamount to wanting ``a 
flag on the hood''.
<P>
	The Prime Minister also says it is not a best four of seven as in 
hockey and he is right. It is much more than that. At stake is the 
survival of a people. By refusing to accept a simple majority vote, 
as is normally the case, he is playing with democratic principles. 
He does so because he feels the rug being pulled from under his 
feet.
<P>
	To go against this democratic principle and to ridicule our 
determination is evidence of a lack of ethics. A country is more 
than a parliamentary structure, but it is through its members of 
Parliament that the public can express itself.
<P>
	This is why Quebecers democratically chose to be represented, 
in Quebec City and in Ottawa, by two political parties advocating 
Quebec's self determination. This democratic choice alone clearly 
illustrates the will of our people.

<P>
	The unemployment rate has fallen from 11.2 per cent in 1993 to

increased our investment to $315 million to help young Canadians 
get their first job and have doubled our commitment to summer 
jobs for young people. We have introduced the Strategis Internet 
service, Canada's largest source of business and trade information. 
We have hired young Canadians to hook up over 50,000 small 
businesses to the Internet. We have amended the Small Business 
Loans Act to make loans more accessible. Team Canada trade 
missions to the Far East, Latin America and India have generated

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to take this opportunity to note the recent unanimous Alberta Court 
of Appeal decision striking down once again the gag law which 
disallows anyone other than a politician or political party to spend 
more than $1,000 during a federal election campaign.
<P>
	Supporters of the gag law among the Liberals, NDP and PCs 
have argued it exists to promote a level playing field. Rubbish. 
Elections law in Canada is riddled with clauses designed to prop up 
incumbents and traditional parties. The gag law exists to keep 
ordinary Canadians out of political debate, especially where the 
traditional parties have colluded on policy as they have on the MP 
pension scam.
<P>
	Before the government appeals this decision once again, it 
should remember that it is precisely such antidemocratic 
restrictions which are being employed under Quebec's referendum 
law and aimed primarily at federalist supporters.
<P>
	An appeal will probably be made in spite of this Liberal 
hypocrisy. In the meantime we can thank the National Citizens

Economic Development Corporation which have distinguished 
themselves regionally and nationally in the area of community

	It is fitting that these numbers come out during tourism week,

	When fish stocks are in danger, what does the minister do? He 
opens a native only fishery in the Alberni Inlet, a move which drew 
severe criticism of the minister from a federal court judge last 
Friday.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	The minister has repeatedly favoured the native fishery at the 
expense of the commercial and sports sectors. It is time for the 
minister to cancel all native openings and when that is done, to deal 
severely with all fishermen who defy the law and fish illegally.
<P>
	This government and this minister must first conserve fish 
stocks for future generations and then treat all fishermen equally 
regardless of their race.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on Wednesday, the Minister of Justice denied that there 
had been any formal offer or that there was any imminent 
settlement in the Airbus affair.
<P>
	Last evening, we heard on the CBC that there had been a meeting 
at 3 p.m. last Tuesday afternoon in Montreal, between the two 
attorneys, Mr. Petteras for the federal government, and Mr. Irosky 
for the plaintiff, to discuss the conditions of an out of court 
settlement.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Justice confirm that there was indeed a 
meeting Tuesday afternoon in Montreal, with a view to discussing 
an out of court settlement?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what the lawyers may do between 
themselves in discharging their obligations to conduct the litigation 
is up to the lawyers. It is best left to the lawyers.
<P>
	We have been sued; we have retained counsel. We are defending 
the action and let us see how the litigation goes. Whether or not 
there were meetings between the lawyers and what was discussed, 
the fact is we are defending the action and we are preparing for the 
next stage of litigation. What happens in the conduct of that 
litigation often is off the record and without prejudice. In any 
event, it does not serve anybody's interests to have an hour by hour 
report on what the parties or the lawyers are doing in the litigation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, according to the same source, the lawyer representing the 
government was indeed given a specific mandate.
<P>
	Will the minister acknowledge that the mandate of the counsel 
for his department included offers with a view to an out of court 
settlement?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not appropriate for me to go 
into what instructions may have been given in confidence to 
counsel in the course of litigation.
<P>
	We are defending the action. We are preparing for the next stage 
of litigation and we shall deal with the litigation as it comes.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would now like to ask the minister if he will 
acknowledge that his responses in the House for the past two days 
have been lacking in transparency, since he has repeatedly denied 
that there has been any offer and that, under the circumstances, it is 
really difficult to believe his repeated statements that he is not the 
one behind this investigation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. Speaker. I was asked on Monday or 
Tuesday of this week by a reporter, in fact I was told that a 
settlement of this case was imminent. I said that was not so, that 
indeed as far as I knew there was no concrete proposal on the table. 
I said that then and it was true. I have also said that the parties from 
time to time have feelers one toward the other. That is typical in 
litigation. There is nothing surprising about that.
<P>
	We are in litigation. We are defending the action. We are 
proceeding and preparing for the next stage. I shall report 
significant developments to the House when they occur.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday morning, the Prime Minister denied in a CBC 
interview that there had been any negotiations to settle the Airbus 
affair out of court. Yet, in a report presented yesterday evening, the 
CBC contradicted his statement.
<P>
	In this matter, which is taking on more and more the appearance 
of settling political scores and less and less that of a properly 
conducted court case, why under the circumstances has the Prime 
Minister denied that negotiations had been held toward reaching an 
out of court settlement of the Airbus affair, last Tuesday in 
Montreal?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Justice has just given a response on this. It 
is a matter that is in the hands of lawyers, and lawyers do speak 
together. I am not aware of everything that the lawyers talk about.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	This matter is the responsibility of the Minister of Justice. A 
plaintiff has instituted proceedings against against the government. 
Does he want to settle out of court? I do not know, and it is up to the 
lawyers to decide. Let them talk to each other.
<P>
	I practiced law for a number of years. Lawyers speak together 
every day, and very often they may talk about whether or not they 
can put an end to a case, during these conversations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3867"> 3867 </A></B>
<P>
	I would add that we are the defendants in this case, not the 
plaintiffs, and the Minister of Justice has given an explanation. 
I am not a direct party to this case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in a 
matter where it is obvious that the government's lawyers have been 
ordered to use strong arm tactics on the former Prime Minister of 
Canada, does the present Prime Minister find it normal, in these 
politically charged circumstances, for the Minister of Justice to 
seemingly not have kept him informed of his meetings with the 
RCMP or of the possibility of an out of court settlement, which 
might cost the taxpayers of Canada several million dollars?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this in an investigation which dates back several years 
now. The first time the police looked into the matter, we were not in 
government. It was during the days of the previous government. 
The investigation was reopened, and the plaintiff has instituted 
proceedings against the government. The Minister of Justice is 
acting as the government's solicitor, and he has delegated the case 
to a number of lawyers.
<P>
	As for me, I do not get mixed up in police investigations. It is not 
appropriate for a Prime Minister to get involved in police business 
when an investigation is being carried out. I have neither asked for 
nor provided any instructions in this connection. It is, moreover, 
my duty as Prime Minister to ensure that police inquiries can be 
carried out without any political interference by anyone 
whatsoever.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also 
have a question for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	The minister said in response to questions from the member for 
Beaver River on Wednesday: ``I can tell the hon. member that no 
matter what may have been reported last night, there is no proposal, 
there is no settlement imminent and there is no discussion of 
payment of money''. Furthermore he said: ``I cannot take 
responsibility for what the CBC may have reported, nor can I 
explain why it reported what it did''.
<P>
	Frankly, Mr. Speaker, how can he make statements like that to 
the House when he knows that the day before his lawyers were 
discussing a settlement? How can he possibly say there is no 
explanation for the story, give the House that kind of information 
when his lawyers are sitting down and discussing a settlement?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, when I was asked a 
question by a reporter from the CBC on Tuesday, I was told that a 
settlement was imminent. That was news to me. I said to the 
reporter that it was not right. The fact was that no settlement was 
imminent. There were not even concrete proposals on the table.  
That is what I said and that is the fact. There was no discussion of 
payment of money.
<P>
	Whether the lawyers are in the course of discharging their duties, 
having conversations or not, that is a separate matter, something 
over which I have no control. It is entirely within the ordinary 
course of a lawyer's work in litigation. I practised litigation myself 
for 20 years and I know how common it is.
<P>
	The hon. member should look at the facts. It was put to me that 
there was a settlement imminent. I responded that that was not so. I 
responded that there were no concrete proposals on the table and 
that remains the case.
<P>
	Let us focus on the facts here. The facts are as I have disclosed 
them to the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that 
kind of hair-splitting could only be done by a lawyer.
<P>
	I am citing an article in the Toronto <I>Sun</I> yesterday where it says 
that <I>Globe and Mail</I> managing editor Colin MacKenzie said that 
Rock approached parliamentary journalist Susan Delacourt for help 
in his behind the scenes probe of Mulroney one or two days after he 
first heard about allegations from another journalist.
<P>
	My question is very simple. Going back to the beginning of this 
affair, why was the Minister of Justice conducting his own private 
investigation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> First, Mr. Speaker, it hardly behoves the hon. 
member to challenge the facts and then when the facts are 
explained to him to describe it as hair splitting. The facts are the 
facts whether the member likes them or not.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	In so far as journalists are concerned, I have made it a matter of 
public record from the outset. I have been frank and direct in saying 
that I was fixed with information early on after I became Minister 
of Justice. In respect of that information, I sought advice. I 
consulted with the deputy minister. I consulted the solicitor 
general. On the basis of that consultation, I communicated the 
information to the authorities, discharging my moral obligation to 
do so, and for them to do with as they saw fit.
<P>
	The police eventually reported that they had looked into what I 
had said, that there was no reason for further inquiry and that they 
were closing the file.
<P>
	May I also say that is a practice that has been followed in the 
past. Indeed, it was revealed last week by John Turner that when he 
was minister of justice he followed exactly the same procedure.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to tell the House whether he thinks 
that if a Minister of Justice and Attorney General is told something 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3868"> 3868 </A></B>
<P>
about allegations of  serious wrongdoing that he ought not to pass it 
on to the authorities? That to me is a startling proposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, of 
course the Minister of Justice should pass on the information to the 
proper authorities.
<P>
	Now will he answer my question and tell us why he made 
additional inquiries with journalists to get more information 
himself?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, contrary to what the hon. member 
may have read in the newspapers, the fact is that I did no such 
thing. I have made it clear from the outset that two people provided 
me with information. I believe I acted entirely responsibly in the 
circumstances and provided the information to the authorities.
<P>
	I am gratified to see that the hon. member agrees that was the 
correct thing to do.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Yesterday, a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal rendered a 
decision that will force the federal government to stop all 
discrimination against same sex couples by giving them the same 
benefits enjoyed by common law couples.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Justice tell the House whether the 
Government of Canada intends to appeal this decision?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, this 
decision, made public yesterday morning at 9.30, contains some 
very complex points that will require a few days to untangle. We 
are not making any decision on the important issue of appeal until 
we have studied the consequences of the decision in detail.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the tribunal ordered the federal government to stop the use 
immediately, in a number of federal texts, of any definition of 
spouse that discriminates against same sex partners in a common 
law relationship.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Justice tell us whether he intends to 
comply with the ruling of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
can only repeat what I have already said. The decision made public 
yesterday raises extremely complex points requiring detailed 
consideration and consultation, in particular with our lawyers, 
before we take any sort of a position.

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as a direct result of an investigation by the justice 
minister's department, it now appears that Canadians could be on 
the hook for millions of dollars. Now the justice minister is saying 
he is leaving it to the lawyers to negotiate a possible settlement in 
this case.
<P>
	Is the minister seriously telling us that he is giving nameless 
departmental lawyers the authority to pay millions of dollars to 
Brian Mulroney in a possible settlement which he says he knows 
nothing about, or is he really aware of everything that is going on 
and he is just trying to hide it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the first place, the member errs 
when he begins by saying that this was an investigation conducted 
by the justice department. This was a police investigation 
conducted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for whom the 
solicitor general reports to Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	The role of the Department of Justice is also a matter of record. 
As happens 100 to 150 times a year, the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police went to the International Assistance Group and asked it to 
communicate to a foreign government a request for assistance in 
pursuing the investigation. That was the role of the Department of 
Justice. This is not a justice department investigation.
<P>
	As to settlement, the government has retained and instructed 
very competent lawyers to defend this litigation. We are preparing 
for the next stage of litigation. With respect to matters of 
settlement, if discussions for settlement occur they will be 
conducted by the lawyers who eventually will seek instructions. As 
I have said, I shall report to the House if there is anything of 
significance to report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Justice continues to tell the House that he 
really is out of the picture on this whole thing. This is a not a 
two-bit case. This is a case of such magnitude that it is on the front 
page of the press every day.
<P>
	The RCMP started this case before the Liberals came to power. 
They closed the case. When this government came to power and 
this minister was appointed, he initiated the opening of the case 
again, even though he may deny it. He talked to the reporter and he 
got the case going again.
<P>
	At this time he is telling us that he is now out of it. One wonders, 
whether there is a case or not, how much money is at stake because 
of the incompetence of this  minister and his government. Why is 
the minister telling Canadians on a daily basis that he really knows 
nothing about what is going on in this case and anything about a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3869"> 3869 </A></B>
<P>
settlement, when anyone and everyone with any kind of position on 
that government is talking about settlements on a daily basis?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I assume there is a question there.
<P>
	I can tell the hon. member that he is in grave error when he says 
that I initiated this investigation. The reality is the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police makes its own mind up when it initiates 
investigations and when it stops them.
<P>
	The hon. member will know from the answers I gave earlier this 
week in the House that there are just two principles involved here 
so the hon. member should follow them.
<P>
	First, so long as I am Minister of Justice and Attorney General, if 
someone fixes me with knowledge of serious wrongdoing, after 
making consultation of experienced and capable people, including 
in this case the solicitor general, I will communicate that 
information to the police to do with as they might. That is principle 
number one and a colleague of the hon. member has already 
conceded that that is the proper course.
<P>
	The second principle is that once that information is 
communicated it is up to the police to decide what to do. In this 
case they told me they were doing nothing after looking into it.
<P>
	If they then start an investigation on their own, or into a different 
matter because that information does not relate to Airbus to my 
recollection, if they then decide to initiate an investigation that is 
up to the police. Politicians should not be involved in directing and 
controlling police investigations. That is the second important 
principle.
<P>
	The hon. member will find that both of those principles were 
respected in this case.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	In their red book, the Liberals accused the Conservatives of 
weakening major cultural institutions such as the CBC by cutting 
off their funding. Yesterday, we learned that the CBC is preparing 
to have the French network assume part of the cost of 
Canadianizing its programming, estimated as some $27 million.
<P>
	In view of the fact that this will further widen the gap in the 
amount of financial resources accorded the two networks, is the 
Prime Minister willing to accept this discrimination against 
francophones in Canada and Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the CBC has a mandate to serve Canadians in both official 
languages. The hon. member should delight in the fact that 90 per 
cent of programming in prime time is Canadian. The network 
intends to increase that figure to 100 per cent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Having said that, the CBC English network has already factored 
in those cuts and no other network will have to pay for the 
Canadianization of the English network.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, given that the 
French network of the CBC was already very hard hit by budget 
cuts and is having a hard time meeting the needs of francophones in 
Quebec and Canada, would the Prime Minister ensure that the 
English network assumes its own deficit and does not further 
weaken the French services of the CBC?
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, that is what I have just said. The English network of the 
CBC will absorb its own cuts.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to draw attention to the 
spirit of co-operation between Radio-Canada and Radio-Quebec, 
which have just concluded an agreement ensuring maximum 
visibility for programs produced by Canadians for Canadians. In 
these times of budget cuts, this sort of innovative and creative 
partnership reflects judicious use of funds and promises more of 
the same.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal said the government must 
extend to gay couples the same benefits it gives to heterosexual 
couples.
<P>
	It said if discrimination is prohibited then benefits must be 
granted. However, in this House the justice minister said to us and 
to Canadians that his government was intent on fighting 
discrimination, not granting benefits.
<P>
	Since the justice minister assured Canadians that the goal of the 
government was not to grant benefits, does he intend to stand by 
that commitment? How will he respond to the tribunal's decision?

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3870"> 3870 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first let me make it clear that the 
judgment that came from the Human  Rights Tribunal yesterday 
was in a case that was commenced long before Bill C-33 was 
thought of, introduced or passed.
<P>
	The judgment was based on the law as it stood before Bill C-33 
added those words to the Canadian Human Rights Act. The 
enactment of Bill C-33 was irrelevant to the judgment. The 
judgment dealt with benefits. Bill C-33 did not. It dealt with 
discrimination.
<P>
	My hon. colleague, the President of the Treasury Board, has 
already told the House that we are going to have to look at the 
judgment. He will have to consider its implications and a decision 
will be made on the question of whether an appeal will be brought 
when we have had that opportunity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
minister can delay the decision all he wants, but for years courts 
and tribunals have been setting policy for government and even the 
private sector on this issue with no debate in government. That is 
an absolute outrage and is unforgivable. Parliament, not the 
tribunals, is where the laws of Canada should be written.
<P>
	The justice minister said that he tabled Bill C-33 so this issue 
would not be left in the hands of the courts and the tribunals. If he 
was serious about that promise, will he respond to this ruling in 
such a way to uphold the primacy of this Parliament?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in view of what happened last 
month I am astonished to hear that the hon. member would want to 
have another parliamentary debate on the human rights legislation.
<P>
	The hon. member suggests that Parliament should be supreme. 
Indeed Parliament is supreme. Parliament enacted the Constitution 
of Canada which is the supreme law of the land. That Constitution 
establishes fundamental principles of justice and rights.
<P>
	Parliament also enacted the Canadian Human Rights Act which 
establishes principles and rights. Under our system of government 
in which there is a legislative branch, the courts and tribunals are 
called on to apply those principles on the facts of particular cases 
and to interpret statutes on the basis of those principles.
<P>
	Parliament is supreme all right, but having laid down principles 
we then have to turn over to the legislative branch the interpretation 
and application of those principles. That is what has happened in 
this case, and that is part of the government of this country.
<P>
	As to the decision in this case, as we have told the hon. member 
we will look at it and decide in due course whether an appeal 
should be brought.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	In spite of the minister's commitment to provide a transition 
period made necessary by the implementation of the 
unemployment insurance reform, 11 of the 50 Quebec groups 
working to enhance the employability of greatly disadvantaged 
people just learned that their contract would end on August 31. 
This means that 2,000 greatly disadvantaged Quebecers will 
suddenly be without resources to enhance their employability.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	Why, in spite of his commitment to give these groups a transition 
period to adjust and to allow negotiations with Quebec to unfold, 
has the minister abruptly ended the contracts of these 11 
organizations without giving them time to find the necessary 
resources to continue to provide essential services to greatly 
disadvantaged people?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, there is a whole slew of 
organizations working in the area mentioned by the hon. member, 
including the Government of Quebec, the SQDM, the Government 
of Canada and various other groups.
<P>
	This is a difficult issue, since we are being asked to proceed 
rather quickly, to try to follow up on the Quebec consensus 
regarding active measures, training and so on. We are trying to 
ensure the greatest possible flexibility regarding the new 
management and the new arrangements which we will reach with 
Quebec and the other provinces.
<P>
	There is no doubt that some major changes will take place. Since 
January, when I became responsible for this portfolio, we have 
been asked to proceed quickly, to avoid getting involved in areas 
where the province should play a quasi-independent role, and I 
have agreed to do that.
<P>
	Now, we are being asked to stay put, to maintain the status quo. 
Let us not forget that these organizations knew all along there was 
nothing permanent about their funding. I hope the Government of 
Quebec, the SQDM and other stakeholders will look at the role 
played by these groups and will decide accordingly.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I take 
note of the minister's will to comply with the consensus in Quebec.
<P>
	Does the minister recognize that several of these groups are 
unique resources, that they are concentrated in eastern Quebec?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3871"> 3871 </A></B>
<P>
	As there is a transition fund expressly for such situations, does 
he not agree there should be a moratorium and will he impose one, 
so that the resources and the expertise developed can continue to 
serve useful purposes after the conclusion of the negotiations with 
the Government of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the transition funds will be 
managed in co-operation with the other governments. In Quebec, 
there is indeed a sum of money that will be available to the 
Government of Canada, in co-operation with the Government of 
Quebec. If Quebec wants to maintain some system outside its 
government administration, and certainly outside the federal

	<B>Mr. Derek Wells (South Shore, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	As the minister knows, the fishing industry has been very 
concerned about the new inspection fees imposed on processing 
plants. The matter has been reviewed by the standing committee 
and by the minister's staff.
<P>
	Will the minister advise the House of the result of that review 
and what changes he has agreed to make to plant inspection fees?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in consideration for the concern and comments of the 
committee, the hon. member and his colleagues, and the industry, a 
revised fee has been worked out that basically reflects the concern 
of the smaller industries and the smaller plants.
<P>
	For example, for a processing plant that would have an area of 
less than 300 square meters, instead of having a fee of $1,500 plus 
$500 per operation, which could amount to $4,000 or more, a flat 
fee of $1,000 has now been invoked. In addition, there is a cap of 
$10,000 on the annual certificates and a cap of $250 for the import 
certificates.
<P>
	We will review the fees after one year. I believe these measures 
will reflect a high standard of fish processed in Canada, exported 
and imported.

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in view of the 
recent bill tabled by the justice minister, I ask the minister if he 
would tell the House and the people of Canada what he believes is a 
fair and just penalty for planned and deliberate murder, the taking 
of an innocent life.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the present regime in the Criminal 
Code, which has been in place for 20 years, is a fair and just 
regime.
<P>
	For the last 20 years the penalty in the Criminal Code for first 
degree murder is life imprisonment with no possibility of parole for 
25 years subject to, after 15 years, members of the community 
coming together on a jury to determine whether the person should 
be given the opportunity before the 25 years, but after 15, to seek 
parole, which is up to the parole board.
<P>
	I have now proposed changes to that regime to make it fairer and 
more just. It will require that all applications be screened by a 
judge to determine they have merit. It will require that the jury be 
unanimous so that the people drawn from the street are unanimous 
in giving the person a shortening of the period. It says such a break 
should not be available under any circumstances to multiple and 
serial murderers.
<P>
	In short, that is a fair and just approach. As I said in my speech 
this morning in second reading debate of Bill C-45, the changes we 
propose will improve the present regime.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the justice 
minister has a strong propensity of bringing in contentious bills at 
the 11th hour. We saw that with the gun registration bill last year 
and with Bill C-33.
<P>
	I ask the justice minister why he stretches the ability of members 
to adequately examine and fully debate these bill. Why is he 
bringing in these bills at the last hour?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member himself has been 
calling for changes to section 745; he wants to repeal it.
<P>
	While I do not agree with that, I agree the matter should be dealt 
with and I have brought the bill forward. I would have thought the 
hon. member would have been critical of me for not bringing it 
forward.
<P>
	It seems that no matter when I bring the bills forward the hon. 
member finds them contentious and controversial. We are acting at 
this time. The House is in session. Let us debate the bill and send it 
to committee. Let us hear the evidence and let us bring it back and

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to

insurance in the event of a PCB or oil spill.
<P>

yesterday the Minister of Finance spoke about how recent changes 
to the GST had affected trade-ins on new cars. The vast majority of 
Canadians simply cannot afford to buy a new car. What what do 
they do? They buy a used car instead.
<P>
	By removing the tax credit on used cars, the minister has made it 
more expensive for the average Canadian to buy a used car. By 
eliminating the tax credit the government is saying: ``We do not 
care. You already pay tax on the car. We are more interested in 
getting more people to pay more tax on that car''.
<P>
	How can the minister justify taxing the same good over and over 
again? Why has he abandoned the red book promise of a revenue 
neutral tax?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has 
it wrong again. I know a system that would simplify taxes is not 
something the Reform Party understands, at least from looking at 
its tax proposals. This is a system that was put in to simplify.
<P>

<P>
	I would be glad to explain to the hon. member the full notional

<P>
	On November 24, 1989, the House of Commons passed a 
unanimous resolution to eliminate child poverty before the year 
2000. But UNICEF tells us that, of all the industrialized countries, 
Canada has the highest rate of child poverty, second only to the 
United States.
<P>
	Does this observation about child poverty give the Minister of 
Human Resources Development an incentive to put back on the 
table the $630 million he had available last December to fund day 
care in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is undoubtedly 
aware that the government has already recognized in the budget its 
obligation to try to come to the assistance of low income families 
and, in particular, to try to protect children living in such situations.
<P>
	With regard to the proposal to which the hon. member is 
referring, which was made last fall, before Christmas, as everyone 
knows, the provinces' reaction was very lukewarm. They were 
concerned that the Government of Canada was once again 
interfering in their affairs, that the proposal would have meant 
interference in a strictly provincial matter.
<P>
	Is this the only way we can intrude in situations where the 
provinces must take responsibility? Because, what happens? We 
see that in the employment insurance bill, for example, we have a 
proposal that could, in fact, provide relief for these people who 
need help with the cost of day care for their children, among other 
things.

<P>
	Tourism is the key growing economic activity in Canada. In 
1995 more than 777,000 people visited the wonderful province of 
Prince Edward Island, adding $178 million to the province's 
economy. This is a growth industry.
<P>
	Given that the Prime Minister committed $50 million to the 
Canadian Tourism Commission to promote tourism across Canada, 
can the minister report on the progress of this initiative and how 
these funds are being spent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of  Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the question. After the Prime Minister issued 
the challenge to the private sector to match the contribution of the 
government of $50 million a year, in the first year we raised from 
the private sector contributions virtually $40 million. In the second 
year we expect to make the target of $50 million, thereby doubling 
the contribution of the federal government.

federal, provincial and private sector contributions working

employment insurance. Has the minister yet determined what that 
should be? Is it $5 billion?
<P>

made discrete and not part of general revenues so it will truly be an 
insurance fund?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has raised a 
couple of questions.
<P>
	With respect to the nature of the obligations of the Government 
of Canada, it is one thing to have a separate fund when it is in a 
surplus, and it is another thing to have it separate when it is in a 
deficit.
<P>
	If the hon. member is suggesting that when the fund is in a 
deficit position which would ordinarily occur in a recession, 
premiums would have to rise to make it self-sustaining. I think that 
would be very counterproductive.
<P>
	As far as the upper limit amount of the surplus, I think everyone 
recognizes it is a question which has to be addressed. We have 
historical data demonstrating what happens when there is a 
downturn in the economy. We have only had a situation for the past 
few months where the fund has been a real surplus position.

Nelson and Fruitvale.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	The petitioners call on Parliament to recognize that as the 
legislature of Newfoundland has passed a resolution calling for a 
constitutional amendment to remove the rights of denominational 
classes of persons to operate their own schools and further, that if 
Parliament accedes to these proposals to amend the Constitution at 
the  request of one provincial government, it would set a precedent 
for permitting any provincial government to suppress the rights of 
minorities.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore call on Parliament not to amend the 
Constitution as requested by the Government of Newfoundland and 
to refer the problem of education reform in that province back to 
the Government of Newfoundland for resolution by 
non-constitutional means.

	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant to 
Standing Order 36, I have a number of petitions to present.
<P>
	The first petition comes from over 20,000 petitioners, all from 
within the Kamloops constituency in British Columbia from 
virtually every community and every part of the constituency.
<P>
	It states that Canadians, mainly women and children, are 
becoming increasingly fearful to walk on our streets and in our 
neighbourhoods, that they believe that many violent and sex 
offenders are being paroled prematurely or being released without 
proper treatment or rehabilitation, and they believe that those 
convicted of dangerous and sexual offences should remain 
incarcerated until they have successfully undergone treatment and 
can demonstrate unequivocally that they have been completely 
rehabilitated.
<P>
	Therefore, the petitioners call on the House of Commons and the 
Minister of Justice to take whatever steps necessary to amend 
Canada's Criminal Code and the parole system of Canada to ensure 
safety and peace in Canadian neighbourhoods.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUMANRIGHTS">HUMAN RIGHTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have two 
petitions that are in conflict.
<P>
	One petition calls on Parliament not to amend the Canadian 
Human Rights Act or the charter of rights and freedoms in any way 
which would tend to indicate societal approval of same sex 
relationships or of homosexuality, including amending the 
Canadian Human Rights Act to include in the prohibited grounds of 
discrimination the undefined phrase sexual orientation.
<P>
	I have another petition in conflict with the petition above which 
calls on Parliament to enact legislation to amend the Canadian 
Human Rights Act to prohibit discrimination against persons based 
on their sexual orientation and further calls on the government to 
pass the necessary legislation.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCE">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, another 
petition points out that HRDC funding focuses on services for UI 
recipients only. The petitioners point out that this will effectively 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3877"> 3877 </A></B>
<P>
eliminate most employment  programs for immigrants, new 
Canadians and visible minorities experiencing barriers to the job 
market.
<P>
	They point out that these programs have been very successful in 
helping individuals obtain long term and permanent employment. 
Therefore, the petitioners call on Parliament to continue funding 
programs with proven success rates for non-UI recipients.

good offices to ask the Hanoi government to: first, release all 
political prisoners; second, abolish the communist dictatorship and 
establish a democratic and plural political regime in Vietnam;

	The petitioners ask Parliament to amend the Divorce Act to 
include a provision similar to article 611 of the Quebec civil code 
to the effect that a mother or father without serious cause not be 
able to place obstacles between a child and his or her grandparents, 
and failing agreement between the parties that the modalities of the 
relationship would be settled by the courts, and further to amend 
the Divorce Act so that it would give grandparents access to

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-45, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code (judicial review of parole 
ineligibility), be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Crowfoot had the 
floor. There remains to him up to 31 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
continue with my opposition to Bill C-45.
<P>
	Bill C-45 demonstrates that the justice minister seemingly has 
no understanding of the horror inflicted on murder victims, their 
families and society. If he does, it certainly is not reflected in the 
bill.
<P>
	The truck driver who witnessed the horror on Melanie 
Carpenter's face as she sat captive in the front seat of her killer's 
car understands the terror endured by this victim. The jury that 
endured the vivid testimony of Karla Homolka and witnessed the 
graphic audio account of the torture inflicted by Paul Bernardo on 
Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy understands the pain and 
suffering of these victims. It understands the constant anguish the 
families of these young girls live with every day of their lives, lives 
which have been damaged and altered forever.
<P>
	Bill C-45 shows the justice minister has little empathy with the 
families of murder victims and the nightmares they endure as a 
result of the heinous crime committed against their children and 
grandchildren.
<P>
	The members of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs witnessed firsthand the horror of Sylvain Leduc's 
grandmother whose grandson was viciously beaten to death. I ask 
the House to listen to the horror of Sylvain's grandmother:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The most painful thing in life is to live with the knowledge that your child lies 
naked and cold in a morgue. My grandson was in the morgue for three days. I 
was frozen to death. I could not warm up. I was in a hot tub for three days. I 
could not stand it until I knew that he had clothes on him. My heart is a pump 
that keeps blood flowing through my veins. I have a special sacred place 
situated below my stomach. Some people call this intestinal fortitude, but I call 
it my soul. It is there that love, hate, courage, faith, humour, anger, compassion, 
happiness, conscience and God dwell.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The horrible murder of my grandson has made my soul very sick. At times it 
is numb and on other days it is just like jello. It has lost its desire for living. It 
does not care much about everyday things anymore. It has lost its desire for 
food, for sex, enjoyment, travel and books. There is an emptiness there, a hole 
that will never be filled. My grandson left this earth with part of it. Horror and 
fear live there also.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3878"> 3878 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Sylvain's murderers have done this me. When all is quiet, I cannot stop my mind 
from imagining the pain and horror Sylvain suffered before dying. I must take 
sleeping medication to dull those horrible pictures. I receive psychiatric care but 
find it difficult to speak of Sylvain in the past tense. It takes so much energy to get 
there. I find it also hopeless. I feel like a dead flower that has been trampled down. I 
feel like I have been robbed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Those are the comments of one of the family members of a 
victim of a first degree murderer. For the justice minister to allow 
the anguish to keep festering, to allow this grandmother's wounds 
to be opened and reopened is wrong, yet that is precisely what Bill 
C-45 allows.
<P>
	Each and every time a killer applies for a judicial review of his 
parole, the family and society relive the horrible memories and live 
in terror of the day these killers will be released early from prison.
<P>
	Section 745 of the Criminal Code demeans the value of a human 
life and so does Bill C-45 does. Both are examples of a previous 
and the current Liberal government's blatant disregard for human 
life, the families of murder victims and the safety of society. 
Section 745, which provides killers with an avenue for early 
release, makes a mockery of the term life imprisonment.
<P>
	The penalty for premeditated first degree murder is life 
imprisonment without the eligibility of parole for 25 years. A life 
sentence is not about rehabilitation. It is about punishment and 
retribution for the most horrible crime in society, the unlawful 
taking of an innocent life and the devastating effect it has on 
society.
<P>
	The justice minister does not believe in punishment or 
retribution, only in rehabilitation. That is what we have been 
getting from what some of his own party call the bleeding hearts 
for the past 25 years. They tolerate the most extreme crimes in 
society while mocking and ridiculing those who would bring a 
sense of sanity back to the justice system.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Section 745 of the Criminal Code nullifies the penalty for first 
degree murder. It provides murderers an opportunity for a judicial 
review of their parole ineligibility after they have served just 15 
years of a life sentence.
<P>
	Bill C-45 does not repeal section 745 of the Criminal Code 
despite strong opposition to that section existing within our statutes 
today. Victims groups, the Canadian Police Association and a 
majority of Canadians believe section 745 should be eliminated 
completely.
<P>
	Nothing except the full elimination of section 745 is acceptable 
to the Reform Party, and 98 per cent of our delegates at our national 
convention last week voted for the complete elimination of section 
745 after debating and voting on this issue.
<P>
	Bill C-45 is nothing but a meagre attempt by the justice minister 
to sugar coat this repulsive provision of the Criminal Code which 
bestows on killers an unjustified right for early release.
<P>
	Bill C-45 strips multiple or serial killers of the right to apply for 
early parole. However, this applies only to multiple murders 
committed after the passage of the bill. This creates categories of 
killers, good killers and bad killers. Good killers are being granted 
special status, a hallmark of the government. Good killers will have 
the right to appeal for early release from prison while bad killers 
will serve out their life sentence.
<P>
	Clifford Olson will still be able to apply for a reduction in his 
parole ineligibility, as will all multiple killers currently 
incarcerated in Canadian prisons.
<P>
	As of December 1995 there were 574 first degree murderers 
incarcerated in Canada. Of those, approximately 5 per cent were 
multiple killers. Multiple killers sentenced after the passage of Bill 
C-45 will not be eligible to apply for a reduction. This provision of 
Bill C-45 does not appease the Rosenfeldts, whose son was 
murdered by serial killer Clifford Olson.
<P>
	The Rosenfeldts, the Mahaffys, the Frenchs and many other 
Canadians will not be satisfied until multiple killers receive fair 
and just penalties, consecutive life sentences for each of the lives 
they took. Clifford Olson should be serving 11 consecutive life 
sentences. This is the only fair and just penalty for the taking of 11 
young, innocent lives.
<P>
	I often wonder when we debate this kind of a bill who we 
represent and who we speak for. Are we speaking for that narrow 
slice of community as represented by the justice minister this 
morning? Are we speaking for the Canadian Police Association, 
the chiefs of police, the victims groups and the vast majority of 
Canadians who have a real concern and fear about the growing 
laxity on the part of the government when dealing with such serious 
matters?
<P>
	Because of Bill C-45 Clifford Olson, as all other multiple 
murderers, cannot apply directly to a jury but must first satisfy a 
superior court judge that their application for a reduction in parole 
will have a reasonable prospect of success. What does that mean? 
We are not quite sure what a reasonable prospect of success means.
<P>
	If a superior court judge denies Olson or any of the other 28 
multiple murderers currently incarcerated the right to a judicial 
review by a jury they can appeal to a court of appeal. They can also 
make application to a superior court judge again. Therefore what 
we have are circles within circles where it seems there is an endless 
opportunity and process whereby first degree killers can continue 
to appeal using taxpayer dollars in order to do so in what seems an 
endless attempt to re-enter society early.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3879"> 3879 </A></B>
<P>
	As well, if the jury denies them a reduction in their parole 
ineligibility, provisions within section 745 allow them to appeal 
again and again. The same process will be applicable to all first 
degree murderers.
<P>
	Bill C-45 contains a royal recommendation which allows for the 
expenditure of additional funds for section 745 appeals. When 
questioned yesterday, the justice minister said the extra money will 
be allocated to Correctional Service Canada for longer periods of 
incarceration for those killers denied a judicial review by a jury.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	This is a misleading joke. The justice minister has set up another 
level of appeal for first degree murderers and this is what will incur 
the additional costs.
<P>
	I question the necessity for extra funding in this regard, given the 
number of criminals, including violent criminals, who will never 
see the inside of a prison as a result of the Liberal's Bill C-41, 
which grants alternative measures to violent offenders, and Bill 
C-17, which reduces indictable offences to summary conviction of 
offences which may include jail sentences or nothing but a fine.
<P>
	More money is needed for the added hurdles killers will have to 
jump before exercising their right to a judicial review of their 
parole ineligibility.
<P>
	Bill C-45 may delay but it will not prevent killers from getting a 
judicial review and ultimately a reduction in their parole 
ineligibility. According to the judicial review reports of March 31, 
1994, 128 first degree murderers were eligible for judicial review. 
Of the 71 who had applied, 43 had completed their judicial review 
while 28 applicants were outstanding. Out of 43, 19 received 
immediate full parole eligibility, 13 had a partial reduction in their 
parole ineligibility and 11 had been denied.
<P>
	Bill C-45 and the review of a killer's application by a judge will 
do nothing but add an expensive layer of bureaucracy to a growing 
justice industry. Bill C-45 is nothing but the government's attempt 
to tinker with the penalty for first degree murder.
<P>
	Bill C-45 is not the first attempt by a Liberal government to 
fiddle with or amend the penalty for first degree murder. 
Successive governments have tinkered to the point where our 
justice system has been skewered in favour of the criminal. As a 
result of this bleeding heart approach to justice, the rights of 
criminals supersede the rights of victims in this country.
<P>
	Murder was first classified as capital or non-capital in 1961. 
Before then one punishment was prescribed for murder, the death 
penalty. After 1961 only capital murder was punishable by death, 
capital murder being the planned and deliberate taking of a life or 
the murder of a police officer or prison guard. This was further  
reduced and only the killing of a police officer was punishable by 
death.
<P>
	Persons convicted of non-capital murder were sentences to life 
but were eligible for parole after seven years. However, this too 
changed but for the better and after 1967 all those serving a life 
sentence for non-capital murder could not be recommended for 
parole before serving at least 10 years.
<P>
	On February 24, 1976 the Liberal government introduced Bill 
C-84 to abolish the death penalty and create two new categories of 
murder, first and second degree murder, both of which carried a 
minimum sentence of life imprisonment. Those convicted of first 
degree murder were to serve 25 years before being eligible for 
parole, while second degree murderers would serve between 10 and 
25 years prior to release.
<P>
	The 25 year minimum for first degree murder was the Liberal 
government's trade-off for the abolition of the death penalty. 
Instead of the death penalty, society was to be protected by the 
incarceration of those for life who deliberately and premeditatedly 
killed with no consideration for parole until a minimum of 25 years 
had been served. However, the Liberal government betrayed 
Canadians by slipping section 745 into the Criminal Code. We 
heard today from a Bloc member about the shenanigans that went 
on behind the curtains and in the House during that debate.
<P>
	According to a former Liberal parliamentarian, section 745 was 
to provide ``a glimmer of hope if some incentive is to be left when 
such a terrible penalty is imposed on the most serious of all 
criminals''. I wish I had the opportunity to ask this former MP what 
he felt was a just and fair punishment for the deliberate taking of a 
human life. What murderer has ever given his victim or his 
victim's family a glimmer of hope?
<P>
	A killer does not deserve that which he denied his victim. 
Murderers should not be given a glimmer of hope or any incentive 
to ease the burden or the severity of their punishment for what they 
have done. The glimmer of hope advocates have made a farce of 
our penal system by extending to murderers rights they deliberately 
and viciously denied their victims.
<P>
	Convicted murderers, rapists and others who take it upon 
themselves to assault or take the life of another person, another 
human being, throw all their rights away the minute they launch 
their deadly attack. For the criminal justice system to provide a 
criminal with a so-called glimmer of hope or to restore their rights 
is a further injustice to the victim and the victim's family and is an 
offence to Canadians. I am confident all Canadians would agree 
with this statement, particularly the Potts family of Hamilton 
whose daughter was murdered 15 years ago by Norman Joseph 
Clairmont.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3880"> 3880 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	In 1978 Clairmont was handed the statutory life sentence with no 
chance of parole for 25 years for the brutal and savage murder of 
the innocent 19-year old Potts girl. After making application for 
early release under section 745 of the Criminal Code, Clairmont 
was granted a reduction in his parole ineligibility. On February 8, 
1993 a jury in the Ontario court deliberated less than three hours 
before granting this killer a chance at parole after serving only 18 
years of a life sentence. This decision allowed Clairmont to 
immediately apply to the parole board for unescorted temporary 
absences. Clairmont was eligible for parole in 1995.
<P>
	This is not an isolated case. A number of convicted murderers 
have been successful with their section 745 applications. Brian 
John Boyko of B.C., convicted in 1974 of non-capital murder, won 
a reduction in his parole ineligibility to 16 years under section 745.
<P>
	Convicted of the first degree murder of a Calgary policeman 
during a credit union hold up and hostage taking in 1976, William 
Nichols won a reduction in his parole ineligibility period to 20 
years at an Alberta hearing.
<P>
	Jean-Louie Rodrigue, convicted of second degree murder in the 
killing of a Montreal police officer, won a reduction in his parole 
ineligibility from 25 years to 15 years, as did Charles Simard who 
murdered two teenagers. Convicted killer Gilles Lavigne did as 
well.
<P>
	Murderers like Clairmont, Nichols, Rodrigue and Simard are 
lining up and will continue to line up to take advantage of the 
glimmer of hope provided by an irresponsible bleeding heart 
government and endorse the current government. Bill C-45 may 
dim but it will not extinguish that glimmer of hope.
<P>
	Reform, as a majority of Canadians, believes life means life. The 
only just and fair penalty for the taking of an innocent life is life 
imprisonment. Let us forget the glimmer of hope because that 
glimmer of hope was snuffed out in each one of their victims.
<P>
	If the justice minister had truly consulted Canadians on this 
matter as he has indicated, he would know a majority of people 
share this belief. The minister's own caucus believes section 745 
should be eliminated completely. This was evident last year when 
the House voted on private member's Bill C-226. Seventy-four 
Liberal members, including the then Minister of Transport, voted 
against the justice minister and voted in favour of repealing 
entirely section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Despite the results of the House of Commons vote and despite 
the fact that an overwhelming number of Canadians want section 
745 repealed, the justice minister has produced Bill C-45, a flawed, 
half measure piece of legislation which continues to demean the 
value of a human life.
<P>
	In closing, we are going to add to the list of pain, horror and 
sorrow as each year goes by. If the statistics hold true, we are going 
to see at least 40 people murdered at the hands of juvenile 
offenders. We are going to continue to add to that horror within our 
society, the sorrow, the suffering and the grief, and the justice 
minister and the government are adding to it by bringing in this half 
measure they call Bill C-45.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to add my words to the debate on 
Bill C-45. I wish to inform the Chair at the outset that I will be 
sharing my time with the hon. member for Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley.
<P>
	This bill shows that once again the justice minister has seen fit to 
bring forward a piece of legislation that is half baked, weak kneed, 
bleeding heart and which simply does not do the job where section 
745 of the Criminal Code is concerned.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	Millions upon millions of Canadians are telling the government 
that section 745 has to go. It is that simple. In reality what we have 
is Bill C-45 which is some 16 pages long and simply deals with 
categorizing murder. It is absolutely abominable that the 
government would try to categorize some murderers and therefore 
the victims and their families, as more serious than others, or that 
one murder is okay.
<P>
	The government leaves the impression that one murder is okay 
but if a person kills more than once, then perhaps section 745, 
known as the faint hope clause, should not apply. It leaves people 
and would be criminals with the impression that it is acceptable. It 
is not acceptable to Canadians at large. It is not acceptable to 
victims rights organizations across the country that have been 
speaking out on the side of victims and it is certainly not acceptable 
to the Reform Party of Canada.
<P>
	As I said, the bill is 16 pages long when in reality we only 
needed one short page of legislation to repeal section 745. I believe 
very strongly that all acts of murder are reprehensible in the eyes of 
Canadians. There are no good killers. Killers should not get special 
treatment because they committed just one murder.
<P>
	The categorization of murder by the justice minister is an insult 
to the families of victims of one time killers. That is becoming 
more recognizable as word gets out of what the justice minister 
intends to do with this piece of legislation. Yet it does not surprise 
me. We have repeatedly seen this type of initiative come forward 
by the Liberal government and this particular justice minister.
<P>
	I remember two years ago when we were debating Bill C-37, the 
amendments to the Young Offenders Act. Reformer after Reformer 
said that the legislation was insufficient, that it was inadequate and 
did not address the concerns of Canadians who were deeply 
concerned  about the rising incidence of violent crime by young 
people. I might add there is a very real concern by the young people 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3881"> 3881 </A></B>
<P>
themselves. Statistics show that they themselves more often than 
not are the victims of these young hoodlums.
<P>
	Bill C-37 did not adequately deal with the problem. We said it 
then and we maintain that now. It has become self-evident. The 
justice minister himself shortly after that bill was passed said that 
the Young Offenders Act was once again under review. Now we see 
the same thing happening. It is becoming consistent with this 
justice minister.
<P>
	We saw it a couple of months ago with Bill C-33, the legislation 
on sexual orientation to make it a protected category under the 
Canadian Human Rights Act. The justice minister as was indicated 
during question period today had maintained and had assured 
Reformers and the Canadian people that it was only to protect 
against discrimination and nothing more could be read into it. Now, 
just a few weeks later we see the results of that. Regardless of what 
the minister said today, that it had no impact on the ruling by the 
tribunal, I do not believe it. I do not think the majority of Canadians 
believe it. It reinforced what was there. That was a concern 
certainly expressed by the constituents of Prince George-Peace 
River and I believe by millions of Canadians across the country.
<P>
	By categorizing murderers in Bill C-45 by the number of 
victims, we are adding another level of bureaucracy to the justice 
system. One level addresses multiple murderers; another addresses 
what the justice minister would like us to believe are the less 
nastier one time killers.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	Instead of differentiating between multiple murderers and single 
murderers, the justice minister should have proposed consecutive 
sentencing. That is what people are calling for. For example, 
Clifford Olson should have received 11 life sentences. That would 
have been fair. That would have been justice. That is what 
Canadians are calling for.
<P>
	It is ironic that private members' Bill C-226 was introduced on 
March 14, 1994, and was reintroduced following the prorogation of 
Parliament in January. In the last session, the House of Commons 
voted at second reading to refer the bill to the standing committee. 
Seventy-four Liberals, including the then Minister of Transport 
who is now the Minister of Human Resources Development, voted 
against the justice minister and supported the repeal of section 745. 
Yet private members' Bill C-226 which would have seen the repeal 
of this section was buried in committee. The bill which has been 
reintroduced has not yet been dealt with. Instead, the minister 
brought forward this half baked, totally inadequate piece of 
legislation.
<P>
	To give a little bit of history, in 1976 Pierre Trudeau and the 
Liberal justice minister struck a deal with Canadians and the death 
penalty as a punishment for first degree murder was taken off the 
books. Even though the statistics and polling at that time showed 
that the majority of Canadians still wanted the death penalty for 
some of the more heinous crimes, the Liberal government did away 
with the death penalty but left Canadians with the assumption that 
life meant life.
<P>
	We want to make it clear that when we talk about first degree 
murder this type of murder is not committed in a fit of rage. Some 
thought has been given to it. It is cold blooded premeditated 
murder. We are talking about the Clifford Olsons and the Paul 
Bernardos.
<P>
	I am sure everyone understands how I feel about this issue. 
About a month ago I was fortunate to have my private members' 
Bill C-218 drawn which called for the reinstatement of capital 
punishment. I and a number of my colleagues spoke one evening on 
that and expressed our support for the return of capital punishment 
and for having a true free vote on it in the House of Commons. I 
stated that the Reform Party's position, which I strongly support, is 
that we should have a binding national referendum on the 
reinstatement of capital punishment. This was reconfirmed at our 
recent assembly. Let all Canadians decide on such an important 
issue.
<P>
	However, the justice minister, the Prime Minister and others on 
that side of the House have very clearly indicated that they will not 
allow the people to have a say on this important issue. Therefore, I 
drafted my private members' bill and submitted it to the House in 
the hope that as a second-best alternative we could have a true free 
vote. Members could get the wishes of their constituents and then 
vote accordingly. It would not be as we have seen in past 
Parliaments that have voted on capital punishment, first to abolish 
it and then to reinstate it and members voted their personal 
conscience on the matter.
<P>
	It is of interest that the first judicial review using this faint hope 
clause was in Alberta in 1992. William Nichols was in jail for 
robbery-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, the hon. member's time has 
expired. Does he wish to share his time or does he wish to use his 
full time? That is really what it comes down to.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
share my time.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I did not catch the entire portion of my colleague's speech. 
I wonder if he would tell the House the example of the gentleman 
from Alberta he was beginning to speak about. I think it is 
important that the House hear it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3882"> 3882 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
to inform the House about the first example, William Nichols. I 
believe my colleague for Crowfoot did refer to that example.
<P>
	After the review, although he was found guilty of robbery, 
kidnapping and killing a police officer, his sentence was reduced 
from 25 years to 20 years. This is the first example of how this 
clause has been used, and against the wishes of the vast majority of 
Canadians.
<P>
	I find it very interesting that one of the reasons, one of the 
excuses the justice minister has used to bring in gun registration, 
for example, with Bill C-68 was that he was responding to the 
wishes of Canadian policemen, those individuals across the 
country who lay their lives on the line to protect society every day 
and night.
<P>
	Yet what we find is that the Canadian Police Association has 
passed other resolutions the justice minister is ignoring. In other 
words, he picks and chooses what he wants to move on.
<P>
	I will read from Canadian Police Association resolutions passed 
at its convention:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the penalty for those persons convicted of murder is currently 
subject to varying parole eligibility, and this has produced a great measure of 
uncertainty amongst Canadians about the credibility of the justice system in 
Canada, be it resolved that:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>First, the Criminal Code be amended so as to allow a discretionary capital 
penalty for those persons convicted of first degree murder as currently defined;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, capital punishment should be brought back for 
some of the heinous crimes.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Second, all other persons convicted of first degree murder but not sentenced 
to capital punishment be imprisoned for life with no chance of parole or 
conditional release in any form, except for emergency medical treatment, until 
the expiration of 25 years;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Third, section 745 of the Criminal Code be repealed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, do what the government said about the GST; 
abolish, kill, do away with. It did not do that and it will certainly 
not do it with section 745 regardless of what the Canadian Police 
Association says and regardless of what millions of Canadians 
across the country want. I find that absolutely disgusting. That is 
why I will be voting against Bill C-45.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak against Bill C-45.
<P>
	I think it is clear in Canadian law what the juries and judges 
decide when a person comes to trial. When this government 
changed the rules to not allow capital punishment it gave a 
trade-off to the Canadian people who felt that was still an important 
part of the judicial system.
<P>
	The trade-off was that if a person is convicted of first degree 
murder they would be given a life sentence without eligibility for 
parole for 25 years.
<P>
	If there is any concern whether or not they can prove this 
individual committed first degree murder, premeditated murder 
with intent, then they are not convicted. They reduce the conviction 
to second degree murder. That is not the issue here.
<P>
	The issue here is that the trade-off for getting rid of capital 
punishment was life without eligibility for parole for 25 years. That 
is what Canadians thought they were getting. Nobody advertised 
that what they were getting was a faint hope clause added to that at 
a later date that says after 15 years they can apply to be eligible for 
parole. That was not the understanding when Canadians accepted 
reluctantly the removal of capital punishment.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	If the courts are not convinced without any doubt at all that a 
person is guilty of premeditated murder, then they do not convict 
them of first degree murder. We are talking about only those 
individuals who are given this sentence when there is no doubt they 
committed the crime.
<P>
	It is not that everybody who murders will end up with life 
without eligibility for 25 years. It is only those few individuals 
convicted of premeditated murder. The others are either convicted 
of second degree murder or of manslaughter if their crimes are 
considered to be unintended in the first place.
<P>
	Having given Canadians this assurance that somebody who took 
a life, who intended to take a life, who planned on taking a life, 
would get a life sentence, we are now faced with a justice minister 
who is talking about making a difference between those who 
planned and intended on taking one life from somebody who 
planned and intended on taking more than one life. That is 
irrelevant. Those are the kinds of decisions juries and judges make 
at the time.
<P>
	I find it abhorrent that we feel the decision made by a jury of 
peers and by a judge, people who heard all the current evidence of 
the day and made a decision, can be overturned at the whim of 
somebody else who was not there to hear the testimony.
<P>
	That in essence is what we are deciding when we deal with this 
bill, and what the individuals decided when they brought in the 
faint hope clause, to totally disregard a decision that was made in 
our judicial system which we uphold and which the justice minister 
and his colleagues say is a great system that does not need to be 
changed that much because it works really well.
<P>
	That is the system that decided whether these individuals would 
be tried and convicted of first degree murder, and that is the system 
that decided whether they would get life in prison without eligibil-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3883"> 3883 </A></B>
<P>
ity of parole for  25 years. Why is that system not being regarded? 
Why is their decision being put aside after 15 years? I and a lot of 
Canadians feel that is not right.
<P>
	Instead of the government talking about looking at that challenge 
to a decision made in a court of law by a judge and jury, instead of 
asking if it is right to have that decision challenged 15 years later, 
maybe we should remove this clause that questions the judgment of 
those people, the minister will tamper with it. He will decide and 
have judges and juries decide whether a person is a serious killer or 
not, whether he is a bad killer or a good killer.
<P>
	That decision was made years 15 years before, when the jury and 
the judge decided that person should be charged and convicted of 
first degree murder. When that judge handed down the sentence of 
no eligibility for parole for 25 years, that decision had already been 
made. Who are we to say they were wrong when they made that 
decision after they heard all the evidence?
<P>
	I suggest to the justice minister that he take the tactic Reform 
Party members of Parliament are taking and prevent these things 
from even occurring. I introduced a private member's bill which 
deals with dangerous offenders and which tries to keep people who 
are likely to kill off the street so we are not faced with making 
decisions about how we are to handle them after they have killed.
<P>
	We are trying to bring in legislation to keep those kinds of 
individuals who are likely to reoffend, likely to commit serious 
harm to other people or likely to kill other people off the streets of 
Canada. I suggest that is a much more efficient way and a much 
better way to deal with this issue.
<P>
	Let us not talk about how we are to deal with these people who 
have been convicted and sentenced for first degree murder. Let us 
try to keep them from committing murder. Let us try to prevent 
more victims.
<P>
	We are doing that. My hon. colleague talked about his private 
member's bill. I have my private member's bill that deals with 
dangerous offenders and I have a private member's motion that 
talks about people who show the propensity of doing these 
horrendous crimes. It says they be assessed by psychiatrists and if 
it is felt they are likely to kill somebody, it proposes the system 
deal with them before the event happens.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	This is the way it should be handled, not by tinkering with a part 
of the Criminal Code that should not be there in the first place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member's speech. She said 
initially-
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> That is a surprise. You have not been here that 
long.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I know it constitutes perhaps cruel and unusual 
punishment to have to, but I did.
<P>
	The hon. member said this government had changed the rules on 
capital punishment. I ask her to reflect and to set the record 
straight. She is an honest person who is interested in the truth. She 
will recall that the last time capital punishment was imposed in 
Canada was under Mr. Diefenbaker. He abolished it at that time, 
commuting every sentence. No government after that ever 
imposed it.
<P>
	A free vote of Parliament under a previous government 
abolished capital punishment. In the last Parliament there was 
another free vote initiated by the then Conservative government 
that resulted in the reiterating of the end of capital punishment.
<P>
	Would the hon. member not recognize that what I said now is 
true and that what she said prior was not?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will acknowledge that it was 
previous governments that dealt with this issue. It was a previous 
Liberal government under which section 745 was introduced into 
the Criminal Code.
<P>
	I will acknowledge there were what were considered to be free 
votes in the House of Commons. That is as far as I would go. Free 
votes in the House of Commons by government members are not 
really free votes.
<P>
	When dealing with the capital punishment issue, I suggest it was 
made very clear to government members before that vote was taken 
by the Conservative government what the expectation was.
<P>
	It is not Parliament that should be making this decision, it is the 
Canadian people who should be making the decision. It is the 
Canadian people who should have the opportunity through a 
referendum to decide whether punishment is something they want 
as the most severe penalty in their justice system. The justice 
system is the system there for the Canadian people, not just the 
members of Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the hon. member as well. It seems the position she and 
her party take really shows contempt for jurors.
<P>
	It is jurors who make these decisions. It is not done by lawyers, 
bureaucrats, psychologists, professional people. Decisions relating 
to reducing the ineligible period of parole are made by so-called 
ordinary Canadians. They are people from the community, down 
the street, neighbours and so on.
<P>
	Why does she show so little faith in fellow Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not I who shows little faith in 
jurors and in fellow Canadians. It is the people who support this 
legislation who will put aside a decision that jurors made in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3884"> 3884 </A></B>
<P>
initial charge of this conviction. It  is a trial by jury and by judge 
that tries and convicts people on first degree murder.
<P>
	A person cannot be convicted of first degree murder unless there 
is a jury there. I respect the jury and I respect the judge at the 
original time.
<P>
	Why would we need another judge and jury to decide the fate 15 
years later? That fate was decided with all the evidence presented 
at the time. I respect their decision. I and my colleagues ask why 
does nobody else respect the decision of that initial court?

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-45, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code (judicial review of parole 
ineligibility) and another act, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
get to something more important than wasting money down in 
Chicago and that is Bill C-45.
<P>
	The Liberals do not get it and it is our job to tell them what they 
are doing is not right. Let me continue to show the weakness of this 
bill.
<P>
	The screening review mechanism that the government has 
developed is a joke. I wonder, as do many Canadians, if this review 
process will be as effective as the National Parole Board has been 
under this new system.
<P>
	The crown and the criminal are able to submit evidence in the 
form of an affidavit. There is no examination of the inmate until a 
jury hears the case. While an affidavit is a legally binding 
document, why should anyone who has committed the most 
heinous crime there is, the cold and premeditated taking of another 
human life, be trusted? One time is enough. They are put away one 
time, not two, three, four times.
<P>
	Does the government's rehabilitation program suddenly instil 
honesty in these criminals? For the protection of Canadians we 
should have the right to question inmates before they are granted 
jury hearings.
<P>
	One of the most troubling aspects of this bill is why the 
government puts more value in the loss of 2, 3, 20 or even 200 lives 
while the loss of one innocent life is grounds for a sentence review. 
Why try to make a distinction?
<P>
	As reporter Licia Corbell wrote: ``Take, for instance the fact that 
Rock is distinguishing between multiple murderers and those who 
kill once as though a murder victim's death is only legitimized by 
someone else's murder''. That is ridiculous. That is sad. It is 
enough to make one sick.
<P>
	This is what the justice minister does not get. He believes a first 
time murderer, a premeditated killer, found guilty by a jury of his 
peers deserves a second chance. A second chance for what? To do it 
again? The punishment should match the crime. Some of us favour 
capital punishment, some do not. It is life imprisonment, but a 
murderer serves 25 years, and automatically gets paroled after 25 
years. Now the government wants to reduce that even more. That is 
totally wrong.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3885"> 3885 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	Corrections Canada's mission is to contribute to the protection 
of society by exercising lawful control. It seems ironic that the 
government willingly sends peacekeepers around the world to 
protect the lives of people in countries such as Bosnia, yet it is 
willing to release rehabilitated murderers on to Canadian streets.
<P>
	Why do two or more people have to be killed by one murderer 
before the government steps in to lock these criminals up? Where 
are the government's priorities? Has it forgotten that its first 
responsibility is to Canadians? We must do everything to protect 
their safety. Is is any wonder that people do not trust our justice 
system?
<P>
	It is time to place the rights of victims at the forefront. It is time 
to put law-abiding citizens ahead of the rights of criminals.
<P>
	Has the justice minister ever offered the Boyd or the Rosenfeldt 
families compensation for the horrific murders of their children? 
No, he has not. However, the government is willing to offer 
inmates compensation for slipping on a stairwell. The government 
is willing to offer Clifford Olson compensation to the tune of 
$100,000. It is even allowing him to publish books and make 
videos while in jail. What a slap in the face to these families. 
Where is justice? What a disservice and what an insult. There is no 
justice for the victims.
<P>
	Why is the government so soft on criminals? Make no mistake, 
the people who we are talking about are criminals. They have 
broken the law. They are first degree, premeditated killers. We are 
not talking about second degree, by chance, look at the review and 
the situation and maybe give them a second chance. Society wants 
these first degree, premeditated, plan to kill killers punished for 
those crimes.
<P>
	However, instead of punishing them, they are given 
compensation. They are made to feel comfortable. They are 
provided with the opportunity to be released early but, as the 
justice minister says, ``only in appropriate cases''.
<P>
	When was first degree, pre-planned murder ever an appropriate 
case for early release? Why use language like this? This is what the 
justice minister said: ``This is the right thing to do because it 
preserves the opportunity, but only in the appropriate cases''. Do 
we not want a deterrent? Do we not want to have a deterrent for 
killers that plan to kill, that plan to take another life? Do we not 
want to tell these people that if they plan and commit a murder they 
are going to pay the price which is 25 years in jail? And if they are 
not good after 25 years then maybe they will serve even more. I do 
not think this Liberal government wants a deterrent. It wants to 
appeal to some soft bleeding hearts, but I will save that for another 
part of my speech.
<P>
	The justice minister also said: ``I think it is impossible to say that 
of all the hundreds and hundreds of people serving time for murder 
that there is a purpose to be served either for the victim or society 
to have them serve all 25 years without the prospect of a review''. 
We are not talking about the hundreds and hundreds of second 
degree murderers. We are talking about first degree, pre-planned, 
premeditated murderers here. He is trying to whitewash the two 
situations. He is trying to mingle the two together. He believes they 
deserve a second chance. I disagree and I think the majority of 
Canadians do as well.
<P>
	If these measures are going to strengthen the justice system and 
make Canadians feel safer, why do we not release these one-time 
murderers, if they get released after 15 years, and put them into the 
neighbourhood of the justice minister and the solicitor general? I 
wonder if either one of these ministers would feel safe if we 
released these rehabilitated criminals into their neighbourhoods. 
Would they think twice about walking around in their 
neighbourhood at night? Would they worry about the safety of their 
children, grandchildren, friends and neighbours? I am sure they 
would.
<P>
	If they had a reason to be concerned then they need to listen to 
Canadians and give this bill some real clout. They should close all 
the loopholes like section 745. They should give Canadians some 
peace of mind and quit coddling the criminals.
<P>
	The public is scared. Our streets are no longer safe. Crime is on 
the rise. The minister tells us: ``Oh well, they are using statistics 
like `if I punch this guy in the face that is violent crime so therefore 
that is increasing crime'''. That is not a violent crime and not worth 
talking about. Violent crimes are increasing and young offenders 
crime is increasing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Don't move.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> As long as he does not move his head we are okay, 
Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Even the justice minister admitted a few days ago that Canadians 
want a country where they feel secure in their homes and 
communities and where men and women can grow without fear. 
Our society has been shaken by violent crime and a defective 
criminal justice system which this Liberal government has been so 
slow to fix.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	Despite the justice minister's claims, the public interest will not 
be served by keeping murderers in prison for any less than 25 
years. The justice minister is trying to suck and blow at the same 
time. He is trying to satisfy Canadians that he will look after the 
Clifford Olson's of this world by not allowing them a chance for 
early parole from this time forward.
<P>
	We are not concerned about Olson. He is not going to get out. I 
think most Canadians should feel safe about  that. Even under the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3886"> 3886 </A></B>
<P>
existing law he will not get out. We do not need to scare Canadians 
with that. That is not what the Reform Party is saying.
<P>
	However, we are saying that the justice minister cannot suck and 
blow at the same time, telling Canadians to fear no more and still 
please the bleeding heart liberals, the bleeding heart defence 
lawyers who try to go to the nth degree to make the law more 
lenient for criminals. They do not give a darn about the victims. 
They are so quickly forgotten.
<P>
	Look at Nicole Simpson. Look at the tragedy in Calgary where 
someone was shot six times in the back. The whole trial was not 
about the victim. The whole trial was about whether the offender 
was in a robotic state. That is where defence lawyers are taking this 
country. I am offended and tired of it all.
<P>
	The government cannot have it both ways. It must decide who it 
wants to please. The people the government and the minister 
should be trying to please is the Canadian public, not the bleeding 
heart liberal lawyers in our defence system.
<P>
	The Canadian public is upset with the soft, wrong-headed target 
of this intended bill. They want to show the justice minister they 
are upset. They want to show him that he has not solved the 
problem but that he has created more anxiety and more fear and 
concern. They can show their concern by calling their MPs if they 
like but that probably will not make any difference. But Reformers 
are here every day. We will be hammering the justice minister 
every day. However, he is perfect and he never makes a mistake. He 
will never listen to us. But he will listen to Canadians.
<P>
	Canadians want him to get with it, to get tough on young 
offenders. They want him to put in a proper Young Offenders Act, 
not one that is wishy-washy, where if a person is 15 or 16 they have 
to prove that they should not be tried in adult court. When 12 and 
13-year-olds are telling the police what their rights are, it is time to 
crack down. If you do the crime you pay the time. These kids need 
protection from each other.
<P>
	The minister is soft on section 745. He knows what the Canadian 
public wants. Why does he not just do the right thing?
<P>
	Let me get back to the Canadian people. I believe there are lot of 
Liberals who believe that the justice minister is being too soft. We 
believe he is too soft. He should remove the anxiety and the fear 
from peoples' minds and make our streets safer. If the Canadian 
people feel that way then send him a fax. I am asking Canadians to 
send Rock a fax at 613-990-7255.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before questions or comments, I would

<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the comments of my hon. 
colleague. I am really glad that extremism has been eradicated 
from the Reform Party. Imagine how the speech would have 
sounded under the previous form of extremism.
<P>
	Having listened to the more moderate Reform Party that now 
exists since their last convention-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> That is not 
extremism.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I am glad the hon. member told us that the speech 
we just heard is not extremist. There is worse than that in the 
Reform Party. That is the point I was getting at. I am glad he seized 
upon it.
<P>
	I agree with the member that this is not extremism, that there is 
worse yet within the Reform Party. We in the government 
understand that and all Canadians do as well.
<P>
	I want to get to the content of the speech of the hon. member for 
Calgary. I must say that he and I have a different concept of what 
justice is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Obviously.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> That is quite true. It is not a matter of who is a 
bleeding heart Liberal as opposed to a red neck Reformer or 
whatever. That is not the issue. The issue is what is just and that is 
what we should be concerned about today.
<P>
	My hon. colleague said that we were not concerned about 
Clifford Olson being able to leave jail under section 745 of the 
Criminal Code and I do not think I was either. Does the member 
agree with me, which he has just done, that such a probability was 
virtually non-existent? Will he make sure to chastise his colleagues 
who have been invoking that proposition in order to instil fear in 
Canadians on this very issue?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, the only people I am going to chastise 
are the ones in the Liberal government. The only person I am going 
to chastise is the member when he says imagine what kind of 
country we would have if Reform ran it. We would have a 
wonderful country. We would have a better country than what we 
have under the Liberals.
<P>
	The Liberal Party once stood for the little people. It once stood 
for the little guy. The Prime Minister used to campaign as the little 
guy from Shawinigan pretending he had no money, that he was a 
poor boy and he just worked his way up like everybody else and 
that he was making just $50,000, $60,000, $80,000 a year as a 
hardworking lawyer and a politician. He is not a little guy any 
more. He does not represent the little guys and the Liberal Party 
does not represent the little guys any more. The Liberals now are 
big business. They are worse than the Conservative Party.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3887"> 3887 </A></B>
<P>
	Talk about imagine. Imagine having a justice system that cares 
more about the criminal and the rights of the criminal than it does 
about the prevention of crime and the victims of crime. There is 
something wrong.
<P>
	We should be doing something about it. The punishment should 
match the crime. Whether someone is 12, 13, 14 or 100 years old, if 
they commit a crime, they should know beforehand what the 
penalty will be. They should know that the penalty for first degree 
premeditated murder is life imprisonment. That penalty might 
match the crime. Life imprisonment. But then it is softened by 
saying that they may be let out after 25 years, or is it automatically 
out after 25 years?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Automatically.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> It is automatic. So the penalty for taking a life is 25 
years.
<P>
	While serving the 25 years the person can appeal and file for 
earlier parole at 15 years. Now the Minister of Justice is trying to 
differentiate between one murder and multiple murders. That is 
what makes his amendment ridiculous.
<P>
	Why try to make this distinction? The reason he is trying to 
make section 745 seem tougher, or he is addressing it with a new 
bill altogether, is that he has received complaints. He knows that 
everything we have been saying is true. Canadians are concerned. 
Canadians want criminals punished more. They do not want them 
to make a mockery out of the criminal justice system. He has heard 
those comments but he is not listening to the people he should be 
listening to.
<P>
	Gosh, the prosecution lawyers are frustrated. Time after time 
they bring criminals into court and there is plea bargaining and then 
the criminals get off. The criminals are served a lighthearted slap 
on the wrist sentence and then they do the same crime again. All 
kinds of deals are done. They are given 12 years and then they get 
early parole after three years. The prosecutors, the police and the 
RCMP are not happy.
<P>
	Why do we not toughen up our laws? That is all we have to do 
and we are the ones who have the ability to do it. The minister is the 
man who is responsible for doing it and he will not. He is going 
soft. He is trying to give the impression and appearance that he has 
done something with the laws we have. Now I know why I always 
compare him with the finance minister; he is trying to create a 
myth too. He is the second minister of myth because he is trying to 
create the illusion that he is getting tougher and is doing 
something. Do not worry, serial killers will not get out after 15 
years, only after 25.
<P>
	I find it frustrating. Instead of listening to the people who are 
complaining, he is trying to please the lawyers that come from the 
litigation system and the defence system, the bleeding heart 
lawyers, the bleeding heart individuals, the bleeding heart Liberals. 
He is trying to please them.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	The minister cannot suck and blow at the same time. He cannot 
have it both ways. He is either blowing with the wind or against it, 
or he is sucking in the wind. Whatever he wants to do, he has to 
make a decision which way he wants to go. The minister has 
chosen to try to do both and he is satisfying neither. They are half 
measures that just anger both sides. I am sure he takes his lesson 
and his leadership from the Prime Minister who tries to do the same 
thing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like the public and members of the House to put 
themselves in somebody else's shoes.
<P>
	Imagine you are the husband, the father, the wife, the son or 
daughter of somebody. You come home one day and a police 
officer is at your door. The police officer asks you to sit down and 
he tells you that unfortunately and sadly your loved one has been 
murdered, murdered in cold blood, murdered in a premeditated 
fashion. An innocent person has been murdered. They have been 
ripped out of your life with absolutely no explanation.
<P>
	These individuals, these loved ones are left to pick up the pieces 
after this unspeakable tragedy, a tragedy we would not wish on 
anybody. It destroys their families and their lives forever. The 
impact and pain these people feel are immeasurable and last their 
entire lives.
<P>
	It is for this reason and in this context that we discuss Bill C-45, 
an effort to make amendments to section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	As we have discussed before in the House, this bill deals with a 
very narrow issue. It deals with individuals who have committed 
cold blooded, premeditated, first degree murder. These individuals 
wantonly, irresponsibly and without any regard for anybody else 
have taken lives, something they have absolutely no right to do.
<P>
	We disagree with the changes the justice minister is making on a 
number of levels. First, what kind of message does it send to 
murderers? It sends the message that if they kill one person, it 
could be okay; if they kill more than one, it is definitely not. 
Murder is murder and has to be deplored, period.
<P>
	Second is the concept of deterrence. Some people would say that 
having a first degree murder penalty of 25 years with no hope of 
parole is not a deterrent to committing the crime. Having worked in 
jails I can say that deterrence plays a very big role in people's 
actions. Deterrence does play a role.
<P>
	The prospect of a penalty of 25 years is not looked upon 
favourably by anybody. The penalty of 25 years without any 
exception has to be there for first degree murder. It is not there for 
second degree murder for a reason, but it must be there for first 
degree murder because first degree murder applies only to 
premeditated cold blooded murder, an act that is so reprehensible 
that  the majority of Canadians have said that people who commit 
this type 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3888"> 3888 </A></B>
<P>
of murder must be treated in the harshest way. This would send a 
message of deterrence and would also provide protection for 
society.
<P>
	We have seen a significant departure in our justice system since 
the early 1980s. At that time the Liberal solicitor general said to 
Canadians: ``From now on the focus of the justice system is not 
going to be on the protection of society. The focus of the justice 
system will be on dealing with the criminal. We are going to 
concentrate on the criminal, not the protection of the innocent in 
society''.
<P>
	That is the mindset which has pervaded our justice system over 
the past 14 years. It is something Canadians have been utterly 
revolted by. They feel that their rights as innocent civilians to be 
protected by the justice system are being abrogated from on high 
by the federal government in Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	That is why my colleagues from Surrey-White Rock-South 
Langley and Fraser Valley West, and my colleague from Crowfoot 
who was our lead speaker on this bill, have put forth constructive 
measures to ensure that the protection of innocent civilians is the 
primary goal of our justice system.
<P>
	It is not to say that we are not concerned about rehabilitation. It 
is not to say that we are not concerned about prevention. However, 
certainly the number one goal of our justice system has to be the 
protection of innocent civilians. That is why we feel the changes to 
section 745, which Bill C-45 brings in, do not properly reflect our 
desire to protect Canadian citizens.
<P>
	There are a number of measures the justice minister can take. I 
would suggest that he look at the following. Some interesting 
experiments have been done in the United States. They looked at 
inner city schools that had very high teen pregnancy rates, high 
crime rates, high drop out rates and high illiteracy rates.
<P>
	The school children were referred to the university which started 
to deal with the children early on, from kindergarten on. Not only 
did they teach these children their ABCs and the three Rs but they 
also taught them concepts such as self-respect, respect for others 
and appropriate conflict resolution. They informed them about 
drug and alcohol abuse and smoking.
<P>
	The parents were also brought in. They were usually single 
parents. That was the environment these children lived in. They 
brought the parents into the school system, and the parents took an 
active role in the classroom with their children and with the 
teacher. The parents often did not know how to be good parents. 
They did not themselves have the basic pillars of a normal psyche 
because they had grown up in an abusive environment.
<P>
	The outcome was very interesting. The parents learned how to be 
good parents. The parents learned what self-respect was. The
<P>
parents learned that slamming somebody's head into a wall was not 
appropriate conflict resolution. The parents learned about drug and 
alcohol abuse and the value of education. In the end, there were 
much lower rates of drop outs, criminal activity, drug abuse, 
assaults, et cetera.
<P>
	The hon. justice minister should bring together his colleagues, 
the ministers of education from across the country, to change the 
focus in our education system. The greatest impact we can have on 
the justice system later on, and the prevention of conduct disorders 
and criminal behaviour is through changes by focusing on early 
childhood education in the way I mentioned.
<P>
	I would bring attention once again to the bills my colleagues in 
the Reform Party have put together. There is the one on the victims 
bill of rights. I hope the justice minister does not let this very good 
bill die in committee. He should give it the same expeditious 
treatment that he gave to Bill C-33. There is also the bill of my 
colleague from Surrey-White Rock-South Langley on 
dangerous offenders. The justice minister should take a very close 
look at that because it will certainly make our streets safer.
<P>
	Revamping the Young Offenders Act is essential. It is an 
absolute sham right now. Changes need to be made. I implore the 
justice minister to deal with that. I know members across the party 
lines would be very happy to work with him to make our streets 
safer for Canadians.

	The House resumed from May 28 consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is an honour to rise in the House to speak in support of 
the motion put forward by my colleague from Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley. It is an honour because if the government 
acted on this motion, another loophole in our criminal justice 
system would be closed. With every loophole we close as 
legislators Canadians are safer and Canada is a safer place to live.
<P>
	What does the motion seek to accomplish? The motion would 
require that anyone convicted of serious sexual assault against an 
adult or any sexual assault against a child be examined by two 
psychiatrists. If the  psychiatrists conclude the offender is likely to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3889"> 3889 </A></B>
<P>
commit similar crimes in the future the attorney general would be 
compelled to proceed with a dangerous offender apprehension.
<P>
	Sexual predators would be identified by the system after their 
first conviction. Instead of getting back on the street after serving a 
specific sentence they would be held indefinitely until we can be 
assured they would not offend again.
<P>
	Before Reform is criticized for being too tough on crime, let us 
reflect for a moment. I imagine everyone in the House has had the 
experience during our lives of knowing or reading about a crime 
which if the system had worked the way it was designed would not 
have happened. All of us can recall incidents when a crime was 
committed by someone who but for our lenient parole system, a 
miscommunication between officials or failure to arrest a person 
on an outstanding warrant would have bee locked up.
<P>
	My friend from Surrey-White Rock-South Langley in a 
speech she delivered on this motion on March 25, 1996 cited 
several such examples in relation to rape and murder. The matters 
she described to House are not out of some murder mystery movie 
or some crime thriller paperback. They are real situations, real 
people, real Canadians who were raped and murdered by people 
who should have been in jail.
<P>
	Recently I attended a victims rally in Abbotsford of over 2,000 
people who were waiting for the government to do something to 
prevent many of these crimes from happening again. Canadian 
taxpayers, law-abiding citizens, cannot understand why their 
elected members of Parliament are not changing the system to 
correct the errors of the past and protect our children from crimes 
committed by those who should have been kept behind bars.
<P>
	Melanie Carpenter of British Columbia would be alive today if 
Fernand Auger, who kidnapped, assaulted and murdered her, had 
been identified after he had committed his first offence.
<P>
	Did our justice system fail Melanie? Yes. Auger had been 
convicted of two brutal sex assaults 10 years earlier of teenaged 
prostitutes. His sentence for those crimes was two years less a day. 
When Auger was closely observed by psychiatric professionals 
five years later after being convicted of a robbery charge and 
receiving a federal sentence, what was their finding? These 
professionals realized Auger was a danger to the public, that he was 
a walking time bomb. What did they do? Nothing. Under our 
current laws Auger had to be released.
<P>
	If Motion No. 116 had been in place at that time the legal system 
could have dealt with him and he would not have been out of the 
streets to look for yet another victim, in this case Melanie 
Carpenter.
<P>
	Should we have done something to prevent offenders from 
committing crimes again and again? Yes. That is part of our 
responsibilities as MPs, a major part of why we are elected and 
given the trust of Canadians to enact legislation, to make the laws 
which our professionals can then enforce.
<P>
	Debbie Mahaffy was at the victims rally I attended. I wish the 
members of the House had listened to her talk, listened to the pain 
and anger in her voice, listened to how her life and the lives of her 
family will never be the same again because of what a sexual 
deviant did to her daughter Leslie.
<P>
	What of all the parents and loved ones who became victims of 
such a madman as Clifford Olson? After a history of criminal 
activity this dangerous offender could have been identified and his 
killing spree which left 11 Canadian children dead might not have 
happened.
<P>
	What of Gary McAstocker, convicted of raping a 21-year old 
woman and sentenced to seven years in prison? He was released 36 
months later and while on parole rammed his car into a vehicle 
driven by a 48-year old widow. He grabbed her, beat her and 
threatened her before she escaped.
<P>
	In 1988 McAstocker was sentenced to four years and three 
months. In 1992 and 1993 the parole board concluded that if 
released McAstocker was ``likely to commit an offence causing the 
death of or serious harm to another person''. Nevertheless, in 
February 1994 he was freed again. Four months later, on June 14, 
1994, 14-year old Tina McPhee left her home in Edmonton to walk 
to school. She disappeared and McAstocker became the prime 
suspect. Just before he was to submit to police questioning he 
hanged himself.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	If Motion No. 116 had been in effect and two psychiatrists had 
examined McAstocker, Tina McPhee would likely be alive today.
<P>
	The justice system needs the tools to complete the job if it is to 
protect citizens in our country. That is what our laws are for, to 
protect the rights of law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	Motion No. 116, put forward by my colleagues from 
Surrey-White Rock-South Langley and Calgary Southeast, 
would simply ensure a dangerous offender description would be 
designated to those individuals who have already been convicted of 
sexual offences and who two professional psychiatrists feel will 
reoffend.
<P>
	These dangerous offenders would be kept in custody until the 
parole board is convinced the offender does not pose a serious 
threat to society. Parole eligibility would be after three years and 
then every two years. As my colleague said, if rehabilitation and 
treatment were successful, the offender would not be incarcerated 
forever.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3890"> 3890 </A></B>
<P>
	Yes, Reform has taken a tough position on crime and 
punishment. Somebody has to, and certainly there is no point in 
waiting for the government to act. Canadians demand action and 
that is what this motion will give them.
<P>
	Why do I not trust the government will move in this direction? 
Just witness the government's action this past week in response to 
the wishes of the people of Canada that the opportunity for early 
parole for murderers be eliminated.
<P>
	What does the government do? It says ``if you can keep it down 
to one murder, no matter how premeditated, no matter how 
gruesome, you can still get early parole''. Being soft on one time 
murderers and tough on repeat murderers is hardly my idea of 
strong, forceful leadership on this issue. That section of the 
Criminal Code should be repealed, and that is that.
<P>
	A government soft on murder can hardly be expected to be tough 
on those who may be repeat sexual offenders. That is why this 
motion has to come from this party, but hopefully it will win 
support among the Liberal backbenchers, among those who have a 
feel for the needs of Canadians and who care about the safety of 
Canadians.
<P>
	When this motion was debated on March 15, the Bloc member 
for Saint-Hubert, the justice critic, raised two arguments against 
the motion, which I would like to address now.
<P>
	She claimed the motion allows psychiatrists to usurp the roles of 
the prosecutor and of the judge. That is false. All the psychiatrist 
may do under the motion is determine whether the person 
convicted might reoffend. That is their role. Then the attorney 
general must bring in an application to have the person declared a 
dangerous offender. It is up to the prosecution how vigorously this 
is pursued. It is up to the judge to make the declaration.
<P>
	The Bloc justice critic believes this is tantamount to turning the 
justice system totally upside down. If protecting Canadians from 
the threat of sexual assault by repeat offenders is turning the system 
upside down, allow me to be the first to turn the crank.
<P>
	The other argument raised by the member for Saint-Hubert is 
that statistics show violent crime is on the decrease in Canada and 
therefore, in the member's opinion, there is no need for a change in 
the Criminal Code. This member is certainly selective in her 
statistics.
<P>
	We are talking today about how the law deals with sexual assault 
offences. I wonder if this member is aware of the poll done by the 
<I>Reader's Digest</I> Roper. The question was: ``How good a job do you 
think each of the following groups or institutions is doing to protect 
the public against violent crime and criminals?''
<P>
	It is interesting that the people of Canada have absolute support 
in their police; 68 per cent feel they are  doing a good job; only 23 
per cent feel the courts are doing a good job; 19 per cent feel the 
prison corrections system is doing a good job; 15 per cent feel the 
parole system, which releases all these reoffenders, is doing a good 
job. This means that 85 per cent of Canadians feel our laws are not 
good and do not save or protect Canadian people. In other words, 
we need Motion No. 116.
<P>
	Does the member for Saint-Hubert suggest the decrease in the 
number of rapes and murders, according to what she has reported, 
means we cannot improve the law that deals with these offences? 
We are talking about the law. Surely this is not the case.
<P>
	If a loophole or an oversight in the law is found which may result 
in harm to innocent Canadians, it is our duty to address that fact. 
That is why we were elected, why we sit in the House and why we 
receive our paycheques. We are supposed to be doing the work 
Canadians have asked us to do.
<P>
	We also cannot ignore the examples of those who slip through 
the system, who continue to wreak havoc as they search out new 
victims. I support Motion No. 116 and urge other members to 
support it as well. If we save one life through such a measure our 
time and efforts here will be worth it.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There being no other members rising to 
speak, under Standing Order 44 the hon. member for 
Surrey-White Rock-South Langley is permitted to briefly sum 
up. No one is to speak after her.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues who have 
spoken in support of this motion and I wish to clarify some 
comments made by members of the Bloc and the government.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mission-Coquitlam pointed out that 
opposition to the motion implies that the job of declaring 
dangerous offenders would be transferred from the judicial system 
to psychiatrists. That is definitely not the case.
<P>
	When an individual has committed serious, indictable, sexual 
assault against an adult or any sexual assault against a child, the 
individual must be tested by two psychiatrists. The reason I 
introduced the motion is that, like many other Canadians, I am 
concerned that our system does not take seriously individuals who 
have shown an inclination or a pattern for this kind of serious 
sexual assault against an adult or children and does not incarcerate 
or force them into treatment to make sure these situations do not 
arise again.
<P>
	The motion is putting into place that those individuals after 
being convicted of those crimes must be seen by psychiatrists who 
would determine whether the individual is likely to reoffend.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3891"> 3891 </A></B>
<P>
	After that determination has been made by the psychiatrists, 
who are really the only people who have the tools to make that 
kind of assessment, it forces the courts to look at a dangerous 
offender application. They do not have to declare them dangerous 
offenders, but simply that the courts have to determine whether 
the individual is a dangerous offender.
<P>
	We are not at all taking it out of the judicial system. We are not 
suggesting psychiatrists replace the judicial process. We are 
suggesting that because of past experience of people slipping 
through the system it is important to eliminate those areas where an 
individual may not be identified. We are talking about preventive 
measures, changing our laws in such a way that the emphasis is put 
on early identification of pedophiles and psychopaths, people who 
are likely to reoffend, and to deal with with them in a direct, 
upright and serious way.
<P>
	If my colleagues in the House are really concerned about the 
protection of women and children, as the red book promised, and if 
they are really concerned about the safety of Canadians on the 
streets and in their homes and about the commitment to protect 
society from predators who do not hesitate to use children as their 
victims or intimidate and threaten women, I urge them all to 
support Motion No. 116 and show Canadians the House is prepared 
to do something to ensure the safety of all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to order made earlier today, the 
question on the motion is deemed to have been put, a recorded 
division deemed to have been demanded and deferred until 
Tuesday, June 18 at 5.30 p.m.
<P>
	Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the 
motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
