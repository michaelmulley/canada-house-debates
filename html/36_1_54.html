</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, during the course of question period yesterday, I was 
ruled out of order on a question directed to the Minister of 
Finance pertaining to the relationship of the Liberal Party with 
the banks and so on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of my point of order was that I was ruled out of order with 
my question but the Minister of Finance was allowed to proceed 
with an answer to my supplementary question which was in order. I 
believe his answer cast aspersions on me in relation to whether 
or not I attended a particular committee meeting.  The Speaker 
would not allow me to finish my point of order yesterday so today 
my point of order is the following. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance suggested to the House that I attended 
or did not attend a particular meeting of a committee that I was 
not a member of.  I think he referred to both the industry and 
the finance committees.  I am asking the Speaker to make a 
judgment as to whether I have a point of order, whether the 
minister was in order to make reference to my attendance or 
non-attendance.  According to Beauchesne's rules and forms this 
is a matter which all members are asked to cautiously guard 
against making reference to. I would ask the Speaker to make some 
judgment on this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I reviewed <I>Hansard</I> as to the exact 
words.  All of the words themselves are somewhat ambiguous.  As a 
general rule I would appeal to all members of the House to cease 
and desist from referring to whether a member is or is not in the 
House or at a committee.  These are the rules and traditions we 
have always acknowledged among ourselves.  I would encourage all 
members, ministers of course included, not to make references to 
attendance one way or the other.  I thank you for that.

<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to take 
the opportunity before the House of Commons to express my support 
for Bill C-18, legislation which I believe will enhance the 
safety and security of all Canadians, especially those who live 
in border communities across this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will strengthen the enforcement role of customs 
officers by extending the scope of their powers so they can 
arrest and detain individuals suspected of Criminal Code 
offences.  I am familiar with the work of customs officers.  I 
have met many of these people across this country over my 
lifetime.  In the process I have been enormously impressed with 
the scope of their duties and the professionalism with which they 
carry out their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also aware of the fact that on many occasions their efforts 
to protect the safety of Canadians have been hampered by the 
legal limitations of our Customs Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation closes a longstanding gap in our ability to 
address at the border criminal activities such as impaired 
driving, child abduction and possession of stolen goods.  It will 
also allow us to deal with individuals who are the subjects of 
outstanding arrest warrants.  There is a clear need for our 
customs officers to be able to stop suspected criminals at the 
border before they have a chance to enter our country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My region of southern Ontario has four major land border 
crossings which process 40% to 45% of traveller and commercial 
traffic coming into Canada.  A lot of the criminal activity that 
has been observed by customs officers has occurred at these major 
ports and at others across the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Customs officers have witnessed behaviour such as impaired 
driving that has resulted in tragedy.  They and their union have 
pointed out that such tragedies are preventable if the scope of 
the customs officers' powers is broadened to enable them to 
arrest and detain suspects until the local law enforcement can 
properly and fully respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if you ask Canadians what distinguishes Canada from 
most countries, they will tell you that Canada is much safer and 
less violent.  This is the type of Canada that Canadians want and 
the type of Canada this government will strive to maintain.  We 
believe that all Canadians have a right to live in a peaceful and 
safe community and they expect us to do what we can to keep these 
communities safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 is one way that we can meet those expectations, by 
giving our customs officers the power to stop criminal activity 
before it reaches our communities.  Clearly this bill will allow 
customs officers to do more value added work that makes a real 
difference.  At the same time it will not diminish Revenue 
Canada's ability to continue with major initiatives that are 
allowing Canadians to seize opportunities created by liberalized 
trade and travel.  It will also enhance and protect from any 
threat to our social or our economic well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These initiatives are allowing the department to free up 
resources to concentrate on high risk traffic with more effective 
enforcement to control weapons and drug smuggling, as well as the 
illegal movement of people across our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Customs officers already have the power to detain and arrest 
individuals suspected of customs offences under the Customs Act. 
For instance our customs officers deal with serious offences such 
as the smuggling of drugs and weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 capitalizes on customs' unique position at our border 
points to act as a first response against crime.  This means 
customs officers will be able to legally hold suspects until law 
enforcement agencies can intervene.  Criminals will be dealt with 
at the right time, before they enter our country.  By expanding 
the scope of customs officers' powers, Bill C-18 will greatly 
enhance the safety of citizens of border communities and in turn 
will contribute to the protection of all Canadians wherever they 
live in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is not intended to replace police.  What it 
does is it closes the longstanding gap by enabling our customs 
officers to act as a bridge to the law enforcement community. 
Customs officers will arrest and detain suspects, who will be 
turned over immediately to the police authorities for follow-up 
as they see fit.  The provinces will continue to be responsible 
for the enforcement of the Criminal Code.  Now customs officers 
will be able to assist them by providing the first response 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is not about duplication.  Customs officers 
will not investigate Criminal Code offences nor will customs 
officers be responsible for processing individuals for Criminal 
Code offences.  Furthermore, customs officers will only be 
allowed to use these new powers while they are on duty at the 
points of entry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits of Bill C-18 to law enforcement in this country are 
very clear.  That is why police officers, police chiefs and 
attorneys general all know that this bill enhances the ability to 
fight crime.  As a result this bill has the support of police 
forces, police chiefs, provincial attorneys general, victims 
rights groups, the customs union and customs officers themselves. 
It has broad support because it makes sense.  It is the right 
thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 is not broadening the scope of powers to customs 
officers who are untried and untested.  Rather, the legislation 
entrusts these powers to a group of women and men who prove their 
value to this country every day as skilled, dedicated 
professionals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The power to arrest is not new for customs officers.  They have 
been arresting people for serious offences such as drug smuggling 
for decades.  They have been doing so with professionalism and 
with respect for the rights of those involved.  That will not 
change. Customs officers will continue to carry out arrests in a 
manner that respects the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
The fact is this bill supports the efforts of the police and 
those involved in both law enforcement and the judicial system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once Bill C-18 is passed it will take six to nine months to 
implement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time will be used to renovate facilities, to designate 
officers and train them on the identification of Criminal Code 
offences and also on important aspects of the law, especially as 
it relates to the charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Customs officers will have the training they need to ensure that 
they act fairly and responsibly and within the confines of the 
law in carrying out these new responsibilities under Bill C-18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The broader role of this bill envisions for our customs officers 
that these provisions will be carried out by probably about 2,500 
officers who will be specially designated and trained. They will 
be drawn from those officers who are in regular contact with the 
travelling public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Student customs officers will not have these powers. They will 
continue, however, to work with the permanent customs staff and 
designated officers who will be on hand to respond to the 
Criminal Code situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can also be assured that these designated customers 
officers will receive additional training to ensure that they act 
fairly, responsibly and within the confines of the law in 
carrying out these new functions and duties. No custom officer 
will be put in a position of having to carry out their new 
responsibility without the appropriate training. That would be 
unacceptable to this government. Our border communities and 
indeed all Canadians deserve nothing less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already train our customs officers in arrest procedures, the 
charter and other issues that relate to the powers of arrest. We 
will expand this excellent training program to cover areas such 
as the identification of Criminal Code offences and related court 
jurisprudence. In addition, this training will be coupled with a 
clear accountability structure which will outline situations 
calling for first response action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that for some there is still the issue of whether to arm 
customs officers. It is not an issue for this government. We are 
firm in our belief that our officers should not carry weapons. 
The safety of customs officers is something we care deeply about. 
Customs officers already encounter dangerous people such as drug 
and weapon smugglers. They have never needed guns to effectively 
handle these types of situations. This is because, like police 
officers, our officers are expected to assess the safety 
implications of any situation. We want to avoid violence, and the 
best way to do so is to use common sense, not more weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are committed to supporting the work of our officers by 
giving them the additional training on the use of force for 
personal protection and to compel compliance within the law. 
Furthermore, by the time this bill is implemented, the department 
will provide protective gear to officers who request it. On those 
occasions when customs officers have to confront a dangerous 
person, their training and common sense will dictate that they 
avoid placing themselves or the public in danger. If they assess 
a risk to their safety, they will be expected to contact the 
police and withdraw from the situation. In other words, common 
sense and training will work hand in hand to determine the smart 
and the smartest response in each case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal now with the cost of this initiative. We have 
estimated that planning and start-up costs will be approximately 
$5.5 million. This includes the cost for training officers and 
for renovating facilities so that we may properly detain suspects 
until law enforcement agencies arrive and can intervene. After 
implementation, the ongoing costs will be minimal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 will do a number of things. First, it will close that 
longstanding gap and strengthen customs officers' ability to 
assist in law enforcement in this country. Second, it will make 
use of the unique position of customs at the border to stop 
criminals before they enter Canada.  Finally, it will make 
efficient use of our law enforcement resources to enhance the 
safety and security of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill also has to date the support of all parties in this 
House, a rare situation and one that speaks to its importance. We 
are gratified, and I want to stress that, by this support. We 
also appreciate the input from members of this House as well as 
the groups and individuals who have offered their help and 
support. Your ideas and suggestions will be very valuable in the 
implementation of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Customs officers and their union deserve special praise. They 
identified an opportunity to improve the safety of Canadians and 
have worked very hard to make this bill a reality. 
On behalf of the minister I thank all members for allowing us to 
do what is right for Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to seek consent to split my time with the hon. member 
for North Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is it agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  I am pleased to rise on behalf of the 
official opposition to address Bill C-18 which the Reform caucus 
will be supporting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think this bill seeks to achieve some worthwhile and 
admirable objectives in empowering our customs officers with 
certain police style powers to detain people suspected of serious 
crimes when they are clearly breaking our laws as they cross our 
borders.  We support the intent of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the debate on second reading of this bill we raised numerous 
questions which had not at that time been adequately addressed by 
the government but which we think have since been adequately 
addressed by the government and were comprehensively addressed by 
the parliamentary secretary in her remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those concerns included the cost of improving and upgrading the 
facilities of our customs ports to permit the detention of 
suspected criminals.  The government advises us now that the 
costs entailed will be no greater than $5.5 million which we 
think is a reasonable cost for empowering these customs officers 
to protect our borders more thoroughly. We will of course, as in 
all matters, watch scrupulously the actual expenditures on this 
new program to ensure that costs are maintained within the amount 
estimated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also expressed concern about the training necessary to make 
our customs officers capable of exercising these new peace 
officer powers.  We were particularly concerned about the growing 
number of student customs officers and to what extent they might 
be empowered by this bill.  But we have been well advised by the 
government that adequate training will be in place for properly 
trained customs officers to exercise these powers and that 
student officers will not be permitted to exercise the powers 
granted by Bill C-18.  So we are satisfied with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were also concerned at the outset about adequate equipment. 
In particular, how is it that customs officers are not armed in 
order to enforce the law and protect themselves and to defend our 
borders against potentially aggressive criminals whom they may 
have to detain?  We still have an outstanding concern in that 
regard.  But the government has made a compelling case that 
immediate back-up support will be available with properly 
empowered peace officers, principally the RCMP, who can provide 
the kind of equipment needed to back up our customs officers in 
difficult and potentially violent situations.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we expressed a concern about the potential infringement 
of civil liberties of people who could be detained at the borders 
without due process. The government has satisfied us, as have 
organizations such as the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, 
that the bill is narrow enough in its scope that it is unlikely 
to lead to abuse of these new found police powers on the part of 
customs officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our principal concerns have been adequately addressed.  We are 
pleased to support this bill.  It is unfortunate, in one respect, 
that it has been so long in coming.  It is a bill which is really 
a gesture of common sense, a gesture to take the necessary steps 
to protect the integrity of our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me take this opportunity to say that I have an ongoing 
concern that we are not doing enough to defend the integrity of 
our borders against smuggling and the importation of contraband 
across our ports of entry.  I have raised in this House the 
matter of a certain senior, 25-year veteran customs officer named 
Dennis Coffey.  Mr. Coffey has made very troubling allegations, 
under oath, about corruption, fraud, nepotism and abuse at the 
customs branch of Revenue Canada.  He has indicated that there 
are tens of thousands of shipments coming through our major 
points of entry, particularly in Ontario, trucking points of 
entry as well as airports, where potential contraband shipments 
are not being adequately inspected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a concern which was confirmed by a document which the 
official opposition obtained from the security division of the 
Department of National Revenue, which we released in December. It 
is a document which indicates that Revenue Canada believes there 
is a reasonably large quantity of contraband narcotics and 
illegal drugs being imported into Canada, across our points of 
entry, without adequate inspection by customs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this report suggests is that some drug lords are actually 
couriering their shipments of hashish, marijuana, cocaine and 
heroin into Canada with 24-hour, 10 a.m. delivery.  I find it 
quite astonishing that a drug lord can get his shipment of 
cocaine to where he wants it in Canada more quickly than Canada 
Post can deliver a letter, and he can do so without fear of very 
serious inspection on the part of customs agents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are still some very large and troubling questions with 
respect to the administration of the various customs statutes. We 
must ensure that these contraband materials are not being 
imported into Canada.  The official opposition intends to 
introduce legislation at some point in the future in this place 
to address those concerns.  We understand that less than 1% of 
courier shipments from countries identified as major narcotics 
exporters are being inspected.  A foreign drug lord can make the 
reasonable calculation that if only 1% of his contraband is going 
to be inspected and detained by customs Canada, 99% will get to 
his customers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we commend the good work done by our customs agents in 
this country, while we are pleased that they will now have these 
new powers to exercise, we are concerned that the government has 
not taken seriously enough the issue of protecting the integrity 
of our borders and we intend to fully pursue that issue and 
demand that we take greater measures to ensure that shipments 
coming into this country are properly inspected.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also very concerned that the veteran customs officer to 
whom I referred, Mr. Coffey, a dedicated 25 year servant of the 
revenue department, was dismissed this week by the Department of 
National Revenue for making public his allegations about fraud, 
waste, nepotism and abuse in his department.  This is not how we 
should treat our customs agents.  We ought to honour the service 
they give to the country.  We ought not take this kind of 
draconian action against people who blow the whistle when they 
see corruption in their departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is scandalous that the Department of National Revenue has 
dismissed Mr. Coffey.  This underlines once more the need for 
tough whistle-blower protection legislation so that public 
servants can speak the truth and identify waste, fraud and 
corruption where they exist in the public sector without fear of 
intimidation or losing their jobs because of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will support Bill C-18 but we are not entirely pleased with 
the way the government has dealt with the protection of our 
borders and with the commendable service of our customs agents. 
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
also pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-18.  The 
purpose of the bill, as has already been mentioned, is to give 
customs officers the authority of a peace officer, which means 
that they will be able to arrest without warrant certain 
individuals trying to cross the border who are perhaps suspected 
of child abduction, impaired driving and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly I am pleased to see these sorts of actions being 
introduced.  It reminds me of a case not so long ago, I think in 
the Vancouver area, where an impaired driver came to a border 
crossing and because there was no power for the customs officer 
to detain the driver he had to be allowed through.  It is not an 
uncommon situation, I would say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The customs officers notified police but before the police were 
able to apprehend this person he had already driven off the road 
and down an embankment.  It was by pure luck that he did not hurt 
anyone.  It was a very good illustration of why this type of law 
is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Costs to implement these new requirements are a concern, as my 
colleague mentioned.  One of the letters of response to our 
questions which came from the minister indicated that they 
estimated the planning and start-up costs to be approximately 
$5.5 million and that it would take approximately nine months to 
complete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The history of the government is that it is woefully lacking in 
its ability to estimate costs.  I rather suspect that this $5.5 
million is more likely to be $11 million or $12 million.  I will 
use the example of the Nunavut legislation that went through the 
House during the last parliament.  Reform warned that the 
estimates for costs in that situation were nowhere near what it 
would actually cost.  Already, in the last month or so, the 
government is asking for more money for that Nunavut program.  We 
believe it will probably get to $1 billion before the dust 
settles from an original $100 million estimated by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding the estimates of the government of $5.5 million, 
I would be surprised if it happens in that cost range.  Despite 
that, we believe these sorts of measures are necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite obvious from the background material that groups 
like CAVEAT, Canadians Against Violence Everywhere Advocating its 
Termination, have been a long time lobbying for this type of 
legislation to be passed.  I wonder about the fact that the 
government is finally responding to public pressure for this sort 
of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this is a sign that maybe the Liberals are finally getting 
the message that they have to get tough on crime? I hope this is 
a sign they are finally recognizing that the public calls for 
changes to the Young Offenders Act, that the public wants rid of 
ridiculous conditional sentencing provisions, and that they will 
actually be acted on.  We are going to see some justice restored 
to what really has become just a legal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard I hope the minister will avoid any temptation to 
interfere and to thwart the activities of customs officers once 
they have this new power to be able to arrest and detain people 
suspected of criminal activities.  The minister does not have a 
very good history of allowing people in customs and immigration 
to carry out their duties.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give an example.  During the last parliament five or six 
people arrived from India at the border port of entry at 
Vancouver International Airport, claiming to be a film crew that 
was going to make a documentary film all about British Columbia. 
The immigration officials, upon asking questions of this film 
crew, discovered that they had no film making equipment and could 
not answer basic questions about the making of films, so the 
immigration officials detained them.  It was a Friday afternoon. 
They were put into the lock-up at the Vancouver International 
Airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Vancouver <I>Sun</I> and several other bleeding hearts jumped 
on the bandwagon and said that this was racist and that the only 
reason these people had been detained was that they were from 
India. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present Minister of National Revenue also jumped on the 
bandwagon.  He was quoted widely in the news media, claiming that 
the immigration officials were racist, that they had detained 
these people for no other reason than racism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of all this lobbying, on the Monday morning the 
Immigration Refugee Board allowed these people to go free in 
British Columbia.  Surprise, surprise.  Within three or four days 
they had disappeared.  Nobody could find them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About a week or 10 days later these people were arrested in 
Washington state.  They had used Canada as an entry point to the 
United States.  The immigration officials who were the front line 
people and had asked the right questions had certainly detected 
those criminals at the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present minister thwarted those efforts.  I would hope, now 
that he is minister of the department, he is treating his 
officials with a little more respect.  Once this act is in law I 
hope he will not keep doing things like the dismissal of Mr. 
Coffey, will start to appreciate the skills in the department and 
will allow the customs people to exercise their rights under the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting a little tough on crime would not hurt.  I saw a quote 
the other day that I think would apply very well to the 
situation, if customs officers are successful in detaining people 
who are subsequently convicted of offences.  It reflects very 
well the feelings of Canadians: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ought to require prisoners to work 48 hours a week and to 
study 12 hours a week. If we kept them busy for 60 hours a week 
doing something positive, they would be different people when 
they came out of prison and prison would have a different impact 
on them than watching movies and working out on weight machines. 
If you are not willing to work 48 hours a week and study 12 hours 
a week you shouldn't get any privileges. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a spectacular reflection of how people feel about the 
whole justice system in Canada.  I desperately hope the passage 
of Bill C-18 is the beginning of some sort of Liberal change of 
heart that will begin putting some teeth into the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Security concerns were expressed by the customs union with 
respect to Bill C-18.  It was a bit concerned that adequate 
training and facilities would have to be provided to ensure the 
safety of its staff.  In consultations with the union and others 
the minister has assured that new facilities will be built and 
that there will be adequate training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, they are expecting that to cost about 
$5.5 million.  Tied into that concern is an amazing figure.  The 
customs department employs 300 students on an ongoing basis to 
help with customs inspection and 900 students in the summertime. 
I was amazed when I read those figures.  An obvious concern is 
that the students be adequately trained to deal with the new 
types of responsibilities that may inadvertently come their way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister indicated that these students will go through a 
three week training course.  I see no mention, though, of any 
exam at the end of that course.  I hope the minister will ensure 
there is some sort of examination protocol associated with the 
course, to ensure the people who go through the course are 
adequately equipped to handle the responsibilities they are 
given.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I would like to mention that there has been some 
criticism of the gradual introduction of automatic ports of entry 
at some border crossings.  The unions say the automatic barrier 
system, which looks at licence plates and allows people in or 
out, is subject to some problems from time to time.  I am 
astounded that we should worry about it because our borders are 
so porous anyway.  We have this huge and lengthy unpatrolled 
border.  Quite frankly I do not understand why crooks even cross 
at border crossings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples in the Vancouver area where number zero 
road runs right along the border for about 30 miles or 50 
kilometres.  All that separates Canada from the United States is 
a ditch.  There have been many examples of smuggling across that 
border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A famous case just a couple of years ago involved a store in San 
Francisco smuggling parrots into Vancouver.  They would drive up 
to the border and put full cages of parrots in the ditch along 
the highway.  After dark someone on the Canadian side would come 
along and lift the cages out of the ditch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very easy to cross the border around the Vancouver area. 
There are several trails, like the west coast trail, which go 
across the border.  There is a sign asking one to report to the 
next customs station whenever it is reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It astounds me that so many crooks come across the border and 
get caught.  I hope they retain the same amount of intelligence 
they already have and continue to do so.  Maybe Bill C-18 will 
help us to intercept them as they come through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On balance, we support the bill with all its defects.  I look 
forward to voting in favour of Bill C-18. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Saint-Eustache—Sainte-Thérèse, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to speak on Bill C-18, 
an Act to amend the Customs Act and the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-18 is to broaden the scope of the 
present powers of customs officers as far as arrest and detainment 
are concerned. It is in response to the necessity for enhanced 
control and effective intervention at Canadian customs posts.  The 
proposed changes would affect about two-thirds of the 3,200 customs 
officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the other provinces sharing a border with the United 
States, Quebec is a target for dangerous individuals attempting to 
seek refuge there. 
There is an indisputably urgent need to reinforce border crossing 
points in order to intercept guilty parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent statistics from the Department of Revenue indicate 
that, over the past three years, 8,500 cases of suspected impaired 
driving, close to 200 presumed cases of child abduction, close to 
2,000 persons with outstanding warrants, and more than 500 cases of 
persons in possession of stolen property, vehicles in particular, 
were apprehended.  The department makes no mention of the number of 
people going through customs at the Canada-U.S. border with drugs 
and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighty percent of these occurrences involve highway border 
crossing points, not ports of air or sea entry. 
These statistics speak volumes and justify the reinforcement of 
border posts, as Bill C-18 will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Customs officers would facilitate the role of the police 
through immediate intervention at the border.  This would broaden 
the scope of custom officers' present power to arrest and detain, 
in order to fill a void between the time they detect an offence 
under the Criminal Code and the time peace officers arrive and 
intervene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments would also enable customs officers to 
arrest persons for whom an arrest warrant has been issued under the 
Criminal Code.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of individuals suspected of impaired driving, the 
designated officers would take a breath sample.  Individuals 
testing high would then be handed over to the police for a 
breathalyser test.  I wonder whether, at this point, whether they 
would be handed over to the RCMP or the to provincial police, in 
the case of Quebec.  The provincial authorities would then have to 
continue the investigation and initiate proceedings against those 
presumed guilty of breaking the Criminal Code at the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois and I support additional powers for customs 
officials. 
However, we first want Quebec's jurisdictions respected and then we 
want details from the minister on the provinces, cities and 
municipalities that would be affected by the changes proposed in 
the bill.  Then, although the president of the customs officials' 
union has indicated his support for the bill, we want details on 
the terms of selection and employment of the new category of 
customs officers thus created, including their new 
responsibilities, whether the officers would be chosen from the 
pool of existing employees and what changes would be made to labour 
contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Quebec, the one that interests us, we want 
details on the powers of these officials compared with those of the 
Quebec provincial police force, the RCMP and the courts involved, 
in particular on whether fines at customs posts in Quebec will be 
collected by the federal government or by the government of Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few days ago, the Minister of Revenue sent us the second 
progress report on the creation of the Canada customs and revenue 
agency.  I will take the liberty of making a few comments here, 
although it is related to C-18, because it is a serious matter for 
us Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was surprised to learn the following from the fact sheet. 
“—the Agency's mandate is being broadened to allow it to 
administer a wide range of provincial tax laws and measures—”, 
“agency status means—more flexibility to manage its resources and 
operations—”, “the agency would administer provincial programs 
should that prove cost effective—”.  This is blatant and direct 
interference in provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of this agency clearly shows that the federal 
government is try to encroach even further on provincial jurisdictions. 
It is not dealing with duplication and overlap as it should, but is 
grabbing more and more powers from the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec objected to the agency administering its programs and will 
stand by the position it has taken in the interest of Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as Bill C-18 is concerned, the Bloc Quebecois and I are in 
favour but we have serious reservations regarding the collection of 
fines. We will keep an eye on this government to ensure that this bill 
is not used as an excuse to interfere in provincial jurisdictions.

I would also like to mention a few concerns we have about the 
safety and concerns of our citizens and also the perspective the 
customs officers union presented to us. The customs officers were 
quite supportive that this bill would pass in order for them to 
do their job properly and in a more stringent matter so that they 
can protect especially the citizens in border towns.

are quite pleased that it will include more resources for customs 
officers in order to do their job better.

organizations which are fighting very hard in this country to get 
drunk drivers off our roads, I wish to thank the government as 
well as the official opposition and other opposition parties in 
the House for their support in passing this bill as quickly as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the New Democratic Party we do support this bill. 
We thank the government for its encouragement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise today in the House of Commons to speak on 
Bill C-18, an act to amend the Customs Act and the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated by previous speakers, this piece of legislation 
concerns the authority we are prepared to accord customs 
officers. Bill C-18 would grant designated customs officers the 
power to arrest without warrant and to release from custody any 
cases where an arrest without warrant by a peace officer is 
permitted. These designated officers can detain such individuals 
until they are able to hand them over to peace officers as 
defined under section 2 of the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill received unanimous support from members of the justice 
committee, which included my colleague from West Nova on behalf 
of the PC caucus.  On his behalf and on behalf of our caucus I 
would like to commend the representatives from the customs and 
excise workers union for their very informative presentations 
given in support of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of my riding of Madawaska—Restigouche runs along the 
Canada-U.S. border and is home to many customs and excise 
workers.  I therefore have firsthand knowledge of the many duties 
and responsibilities these federal employees discharge on a daily 
basis. Bill C-18 gives these border employees needed resources to 
keep our country safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ironically this government bill comes forward for debate from 
the justice committee without amendment less than a week after 
this House debated Bill C-211, a private member's bill sponsored 
by my Reform colleague from Langley—Abbotsford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That bill dealt with granting peace officers additional 
authority with respect to arrest warrants for offenders who have 
breached their conditions of parole. The Liberals unfortunately 
continued to reject this worthwhile bill.  Apparently what is 
good for the government goose is not good for the opposition 
gander. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case I will attempt to restrict my comments to the 
substance of this legislation, Bill C-18.  One of the most 
positive elements of Bill C-18 is the proposal to add a section 
to the Customs Act which would allow customs officers to handle 
impaired driving situations in the same way peace officers do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section of Bill C-18 is so important because it gives our 
customs officers more power to respond to individuals who enter 
Canada and who are suspected of being impaired drivers. As we 
discussed several months ago in the House, Canada has more than 
enough problems with its domestic drunk drivers.  This section of 
Bill C-18 would help clamp down on the import of drunk drivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 will also confer on customs officers any 
responsibilities which fall to a peace officer under sections 495 
to 497 of the Criminal Code, as well as under subsections 493(3) 
and 497(3) upon the designation by the Minister of National 
Revenue.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another section of Bill C-18 however clearly states that these 
designated officers may not use their new found responsibilities 
for the sole purpose of searching for evidence.  This appears to 
be a reasonable limitation on individual rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final portion of Bill C-18 is technical in nature, proposing 
two amendments to the Criminal Code which will ensure its 
correspondence with the new section of the Customs Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some concerns regarding the potentially negative 
consequences of Bill C-18.  At the justice committee my 
colleague, the hon. member for West Nova, raised the possibility 
of responsibilities being downloaded to customs officers without 
the appropriate resources being allocated by the federal 
government.  Officials from both Revenue Canada and the customs 
employees union happily reported that this would not be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to emphasize the non-partisan nature in 
which Bill C-18 was handled.  The government acted in response to 
an expressed concern from customs employees.  The opposition 
parties raised legitimate concerns at the committee level with 
respect to potentially negative consequences of the bill yet 
there was not any political grandstanding or obstacle placed in 
the path of dealing with this needed piece of legislation.  It 
was dealt with in a responsible and constructive manner.  Perhaps 
this is a lesson which we can draw on in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the interests of moving 
ahead with the debate, I wonder if we could call it 11 o'clock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is a good idea,

</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the words that I have been listening to in the lobby and 
in the House so far in this debate, it is important to emphasize 
the way this bill was handled.  It was handled in a non-partisan 
and constructive manner.  The input from all parties has been 
recognized and is appreciated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This serves Canadians across the country well.  It serves our 
employees well.  It speaks to the good work which MPs can do in 
this country.  When they see an initiative which makes sense, 
they move forward correcting irritating anomalies and bringing 
forth a consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to make a presumption before the debate is over, 
but I believe this bill will pass third reading with the support 
of all parties.  I look forward to continuing to work in this 
manner in the House.  It is appreciated by all members of 
Parliament.

during the last federal election the Bank of Montreal through its

cabinet members, including the Minister of Finance; that is 
$14,000 to Liberal cabinet candidates. The finance minister's

<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is good 
news about the Victoria bridge.  This morning, the Government of 
Canada and Canadian National jointly announced a $46 million 
agreement in principle to share the costs of repairing this 
infrastructure, which is essential to Montreal's south shore and to 
the whole island of Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All stakeholders are quite rightly pleased at this outcome, 
which is the result of the extraordinary mobilization of the 
communities concerned and the willingness of the Canadian 
government to find a solution in this matter of importance to 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pay tribute to the excellent work done by 
Liberal members. 
Particular praise is due the members for Brossard—La Prairie and 
Saint-Lambert for their extraordinary contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Bloc Quebecois looks for a raison d'être, and spends 
its time tarnishing the government's reputation and serving as 
nothing more than a mouthpiece for the pre-election strategy of its 
head office in Quebec City, the Liberal government and its members 
have once again delivered the goods and worked for Quebec's best 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Congratulations!

</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the minister for Indian affairs asked natives to write to her 
about problems on their reserves, whether financial or democratic 
irregularities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She promised that those letters would be kept confidential, but 
a clear and disturbing pattern has emerged here.  As soon as these 
confidential letters come into the minister's department, they 
get stamped and promptly leaked back to the chief whom they are 
complaining about. There is a big problem here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the minister of Indian affairs think she and the 
officials in her department are above the law of the Privacy Act? 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, the premise, as far as I am aware, of the 
hon. member's question is wrong.  We are aware of only one 
incident where a letter was leaked.  That is the matter of the 
Starlight letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is being thoroughly investigated by an experienced 
investigator from outside the department.  The minister does not 
consider herself above the law.  She takes the Privacy Act very 
seriously, as does the government, and the hon. member's premise, 
therefore, is totally unfounded. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is nice for the minister to talk about it, but it is certainly 
more than one isolated case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday we talked about Stephen Constant and I am sure there 
will be more coming because these people are feeling betrayed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A section in the Privacy Act says that letters that are to be 
taken in confidence possibly creates a breach. That is in the 
Privacy Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the minister could just toss this off.  These are 
serious accusations by people who live in grassroots aboriginal 
reserves.  The privacy commissioner has become involved now 
because he has had a request to look into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the government to stand up now and say that it is 
now not only announcing that this investigator who is looking 
into it already is looking in but that the RCMP will be called in 
to make sure— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. Deputy Prime Minister. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I think the minister of Indian affairs has already said 
publicly that the allegations in the Starlight letter are not 
only being looked into by her department but that a copy of that 
letter has gone to the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I further want to say that the hon. member must be asking her 
question without having listened to my previous answer.  I said 
the minister and her officials take the Privacy Act very 
seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are not trying to condone any breaches of the Privacy Act. 
They want to see it enforced and that is why there is an 
investigation under way now by an experienced— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Edmonton North. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the problem is there is a more disturbing pattern developing 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said there was only one case when he knows full 
well that there are at least two that have been documented on the 
floor of the House of Commons.  Rita Galloway, the president of 
the first nations coalition for accountability, says this kind of 
thing happens all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not good enough for a government to just sit there and say 
we are looking into it, we hope this one isolated case goes away. 
It will not go away.  Aboriginals are feeling betrayed by the 
government, by Indian affairs and by the minister himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are these betrayals that grassroots Indians feel part of this 
new partnership the department is bragging about? 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like the hon. member to bring forward the 
evidence she has, if any, about this alleged pattern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She has not done so so far.  I challenge her to bring forward 
the evidence of a pattern because this is a very serious 
allegation.  It deserves to be looked into very thoroughly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking into any cases brought to our attention, as I 
have said, but I ask the hon. member—I challenge her—to bring 
forward the evidence of a pattern.  This will be taken into 
account in the investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We take any possible breaches of the Privacy Act very seriously. 
As I said the other day, we intend to pursue this to the utmost 
to make sure the Privacy Act is being obeyed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know 
how much more evidence this government needs.  We get aboriginal 
after aboriginal giving testimonials that this is going on and 
the government denies it. 
As a direct result of this government's breach of privacy, Mr. 
Starlight is being sued by his own chief.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked a question yesterday and I did not get an answer. I am 
going to ask it again today of the Deputy Prime Minister.  Is 
this government prepared to pay Mr. Starlight's legal fees due to 
its breach of his confidentiality? 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am not aware of any precedent for this. Certainly this 
can be looked into by the Department of Justice. I am advised, by 
the way, that the second letter the hon. lady was referring to 
earlier was copied to the department and a Reform MP, and so far 
there is no evidence that second letter was leaked. So I think 
the hon. member ought to withdraw that allegation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again I ask 
the Deputy Prime Minister for his commitment here and now to pay 
Mr. Starlight's legal fees. This is a direct breach of 
confidentiality, a breach of the Privacy Act. We have got the 
Privacy Commissioner looking into it now. I am asking the Deputy 
Prime Minister on behalf of Mr. Starlight and his family to 
guarantee to Mr. Starlight that the government is going to pay 
his legal fees. Will he answer that, yes or no? 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have undertaken to have this looked into. I think that 
is a reasonable response and I ask the hon. member to accept that 
I will make sure his suggestion is pursued.

question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ninety-five per cent of the ceremony to present the Canadian 
athletes to the media, which was sponsored by the Canadian Olympic 
Association, was apparently conducted in English. The French that was 
used for only 5% of the time was of poor quality, if not mediocre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the heritage minister explain this situation, if not by 
saying that it reflects the inability of her department and her 
government to ensure that francophones in Quebec and Canada are 
respected? 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me make it clear that the COA's decision does not reflect 
the Canadian reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the hon. member, I fully disagree with the manner in which the 
event was conducted, and I certainly hope to have the opportunity to 
discuss it with Bill Warren and to ensure that Myriam Bédard, Gaétan 
Boucher, Jean-Luc Brassard and all Canadian gold medallists are treated 
with respect in both official languages. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the minister for her compassion toward the francophones of this country. 
However, I had several conversations with people in Nagano to check the 
facts, and my sources unanimously confirmed that, of all the Olympic 
events, this was the worst performance by the Canadian Olympic 
Association, which managed to project a “totally Canadian” image of our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Canadian Heritage may take cover behind the COA, 
but will she admit that this incident is the direct consequence of her 
policy to use the Canadian flag as a symbol of Canadian unity, which has 
the effect of increasingly marginalizing the French language in this 
country?

we were treated to a series of contradictions by the federal 
government and its top guns on the topic of the Supreme Court 
reference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the government is becoming increasingly 
isolated in its attacks on Quebec's democratic institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After this hard week, in which its main allies abandoned it, 
why is the intergovernmental affairs minister still stubbornly 
continuing with a reference which quite obviously will no longer 
have any credibility in the face of the broad consensus forming in 
Quebec? 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, because Quebeckers are entitled not to lose Canada through 
confusion, trickery and unclear procedures.  Nobody wants to force 
Quebeckers to stay in Canada against their will, should they ever 
clearly express their desire to leave, and Quebeckers are entitled 
to go on being Canadians as long as that is what they wish to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, speaking 
of confusion, we have just had a good example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the minister said, and I quote: “Sometimes

question is for the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago the minister's government announced a youth 
employment strategy.  Despite that strategy, there are now 50,000 
fewer young people working today than there were two years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the minister why that strategy failed.  Why 
are there 50,000 fewer people working today than were working two 
years ago despite that strategy which was announced at least 
three times, including in the budgets of 1996 and 1997? 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to tell the hon.

morning on youth unemployment, but we have made progress on most 
of the unemployment across the country.  He is quite right that 
the last month has not been very good on the youth employment 
front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as a government were disappointed to see that this morning. 
This has been a one month recul but it has not been that bad. 
Over the last few months we have had substantial progress.  We 
were able to lower the rate down to 15.8% with hard work and with 
the youth employment strategy which I think is working out quite 
well.  However, one month is not a trend. 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the minister being forthright.  I want to remind the 
House that the youth unemployment rate has gone from 15.7% two 
years ago to 16.5% today. In light of that figure, I think this 
is probably the most important negative crisis we have in Canada 
today in terms of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the minister what new initiatives the government 
is going to take now to try to put young people back to work. 
Are we going to have new money coming into training, research and 
development and into education to counteract the cutbacks by the 
Minister of Finance a couple of years ago? 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the 
NDP member for his very interesting question.  I am glad to see 
that some people in this House are interested in youth 
unemployment.  It has not been raised by the other parties. This 
is a very important situation and as a government we are very 
concerned about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first reports I have on the youth employment strategy are 
quite good.  Eighty-five per cent of youth who have participated 
in our youth employment strategy have obtained a full time job 
within a year after leaving our internship program and service 
Canada program.  They are working and 85% have had good results. 
However we need to do more.  As much as we can, we will be doing 
more because that is the most important element we have to face 
in the labour market now.

if the minister has been refusing since Monday to answer our

so huge that he is afraid, or ashamed, to explain to us that Bill

benefit?

the hon. member is making allegations which are, as I have just

enjoyed little visibility.

program. Indeed, Quebec's student loans and grants program is funded to 
a large extent by the federal government, and we are very happy with 
this. This, of course, is what a vibrant and dynamic federation is all 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member may rest assured that the Government of Quebec will 
definitely get its share of any improvements to Canada's student loans

Quebec equivalent. 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, given that the 
Government of Quebec has the necessary know-how and the infrastructure 
to effectively manage student loans and grants, which do come under its

Quebec its fair share of any new funds put into the program? 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development,

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member may be referring to the millennium fund. I received 
a letter from Minister Marois two days ago. What I can say is that we

act to amend the Customs Act and the Criminal Code, be read the 
third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure for me to rise this afternoon to 
speak at third reading of Bill C-18, an act to amend the Customs 
Act and the Criminal Code.  I am pleased to note that the party I 
represent, the official opposition, will be supporting this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say at the outset that I will be splitting my time with 
the hon. member for Surrey North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addressing this bill I would like to speak to the irony of 
the situation as I see it.  We are addressing a very serious need 
in our criminal justice system with Bill C-18, but at the same 
time I was more than a bit taken aback by a ruling of the supreme 
court on May 22, 1997, which was known as the Michael Feeney 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 will assist our customs officers in making arrests and 
in conducting searches.  As well it will enable them to assist 
police officers at the border as they will be able to detain 
people until police officers can intervene. Further, it closes an 
enforcement gap which has existed at the border by expanding the 
breadth of the powers of customs officers.  It will allow them to 
arrest individuals who they suspect have committed or may be 
about to commit a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very important distinction because the split decision of 
the supreme court in the Michael Feeney case accomplished the 
exact opposite.  That is where I find the irony in this 
situation. I would like to read from some clippings about that 
case so those watching the proceedings today will better 
understand what I am getting at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Feeney confessed to second degree murder in the brutal death 
in June 1991 of Frank Boyle at his home in Likely, a small 
isolated rural community outside of Williams Lake.  Mr. Boyle 
died following a fierce attack involving five blows to the head 
with an iron bar or similar object. The walls and furniture of 
his home were splattered with blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP went to a small storage trailer where Mr. Feeney 
normally slept, after a witness described seeing him walking away 
from an accident that morning involving the victim's truck. The 
Mounties knocked on the door and yelled “Police”, but Mr. 
Feeney was asleep and did not answer.  The officers entered, woke 
him up, saw that his shirt was splattered with blood and then 
arrested him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judge Sopinka ruled that the police did not have reasonable 
grounds to arrest Mr. Feeney when they entered the trailer 
without a warrant. Therefore, all of the evidence derived as a 
result of the arrest and subsequent search was inadmissible. This 
included the blood spattered shirt, his fingerprints which 
matched prints on the victim's refrigerator, some money found 
under the mattress and cigarettes of the same type that Mr. Boyle 
was known to smoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, it was a split decision of five to four.  The 
dissenting judges said that the investigators proceeded in a 
forthright and proper manner and had to act quickly before Mr. 
Feeney had an opportunity to destroy crucial evidence.  Indeed 
had the police not moved immediately to arrest, it is likely they 
would have been criticized for allowing a murderer to continue to 
remain at large in the community.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that on the one hand Bill C-18 will give more 
enforcement powers, more powers of discretion to customs officers 
and is supported by all parties in this Chamber regardless of 
political persuasion, yet on the other hand the supreme court is 
overturning traditional rights which have been granted to the 
police that when the police strongly suspect a criminal act and 
there is a fugitive from justice in a residence, they can enter 
and arrest that person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation because of that ruling is that Mr. Feeney may face 
a second trial.  It is possible he may not because that crucial 
evidence has now been effectively ruled inadmissible.  A clipping 
from the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> of May 24, 1997 states “Mr. Feeney 
faces a second trial but his lawyer said yesterday that it may 
never be held because the evidence is not admissible”. Mr. 
Charles Lugosi of Prince George, B.C. said that because his 
client had been drinking heavily, the appropriate conviction 
should have been manslaughter in the first place.  Now is that 
not interesting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of whether or not we favour capital punishment, it 
really pointed to the difference between the justice systems in 
Canada and our neighbour to the south. I am speaking of an 
incident that happened last week, the execution of Karla Fay 
Tucker, an individual who committed a horrendous crime similar to 
the crime of Mr. Feeney.  She brutally killed two people with a 
pickaxe in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had that crime been committed in Canada, I would suggest that 
because she was on drugs at the time she committed the offence, 
if she was not out today, she would be rapidly coming up for 
parole. She probably would have been convicted of manslaughter 
and not murder.  In the United States it was the exact opposite. 
She was held accountable.  Whether we believe in capital 
punishment or not she paid the ultimate price for that horrendous 
crime and she was put to death.  I wanted to point out the 
difference between the two systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During last year's election campaign there was an all candidates 
forum in my constituency.  Mr. Feeney's lawyer, Charles Lugosi, 
was the candidate for the Progressive Conservative Party and ran 
against me. During the all candidates forum he bragged about his 
victory at the supreme court. His line seemed to be that even the 
RCMP must follow the letter of the law. I am not averse to that 
and most Canadian citizens are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What struck me and the audience who listened to him that night 
was he defended the fact that he took this case to the supreme 
court and ultimately won it in Mr. Feeney's favour. Never mind 
that the guilty may go unpunished.  Never mind that our system no 
longer cares whether an individual is guilty or innocent.  Never 
mind that lawyers can have truth ruled irrelevant because of a 
technicality, he is still proud that Mr. Feeney will be granted a 
new trial and crucial evidence of his guilt may be ruled 
inadmissible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter of the law must be changed.  This is yet another 
ruling by the supreme court that makes a mockery of our justice 
system. Reality only serves to reinforce Canadians' view that the 
justice system is merely a legal system designed for the benefit 
of criminals and to guarantee income for lawyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House needs to give our peace officers the tools they need 
to do their job properly and to protect society, especially the 
most vulnerable, women, children, the elderly and infirm, and 
victims like Frank Boyle, the gentleman who lost his life to the 
likes of Mr. Feeney.  Is it any wonder that our law enforcement 
officers and crown counsels across the land are frustrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The irony is that while this House is debating and will 
undoubtedly pass this bill to give our customs officers a much 
needed tool to better do their job, the supreme court decision 
has shackled the hands of police officers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I speak for a lot of people.  Certainly a lot of 
constituents in my riding of Prince George—Peace River have 
relayed this to me.  Indeed Canadians from coast to coast to 
coast are becoming increasingly frustrated with what they view as 
ridiculous decisions by the Supreme Court of Canada which are 
shackling our law enforcement services, whether they are the 
police officers or the crown prosecutors.  I call today for 
putting an end to this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this legislation 
which is long, long overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constituency I represent, Surrey North in British Columbia, 
is situated between the city of Vancouver and the U.S. border. 
My home is a mere 15 minute drive from one of the busiest border 
crossings in Canada. I have had the opportunity to frequently 
come into contact with customs personnel at our border points to 
the state of Washington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that in just the past couple of years our 
customs officers have encountered more than 8,500 impaired 
drivers, approximately 200 suspected child abductions and more 
than 2,000 people wanted on warrants of arrest. I have a great 
deal of difficulty understanding how previous governments could 
be in possession of this type of information and not immediately 
act upon it in the interests of public safety both here in Canada 
and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine, 8,500 impaired drivers crossing our borders with the 
potential of wreaking havoc on our streets and highways. 
Meanwhile our customs officers, government employees and our 
first line of defence being fully aware of the danger posed by 
these impaired individuals find themselves in a position where 
they are virtually powerless to do anything about it. Astounding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This lends new meaning to the phrase “only in Canada”.  This 
bill will provide increased powers for the apprehension of those 
who would enter this country to break our laws.  As the justice 
critic for the official opposition, I cannot help but be in 
favour of this type of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Customs officers will now be able to effect Criminal Code arrest 
warrants and they will be permitted to administer the preliminary 
roadside screening test on motorists they suspect to be under the 
influence of alcohol.  Canadians can only be better off now that 
finally something is being done. In the past our customs officers 
were restricted to reporting incidents to the police who would 
hopefully arrive on the scene in time before offenders moved on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding there are approximately 2,500 customs 
officers who will be provided with these additional powers.  This 
is a significant improvement to what can best be described as law 
enforcement responsibilities within our country. But as usual, 
everything can never be all rosy with this Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year at the crossing near my home, customs officers 
confiscate large numbers of firearms of all descriptions.  Some I 
have no doubt are seized from travellers who are merely unaware 
of our laws regarding the transport of firearms.  However I 
suspect others are being brought into Canada for more sinister 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have previously stated, these officers will now be 
effecting arrest warrants and we all know that will, in all 
likelihood, involve unpredictable individuals and potentially 
dangerous situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government in its wisdom will in the process of adding to 
the duties and responsibilities of our customs personnel be 
putting them at increased risk when dealing with dangerous 
persons.  However, it will not be providing them with side arms 
with which to protect themselves when apprehending these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe at one point there was some mention of issuing 
bulletproof vests.  I suppose that is better than nothing but 
sometimes I wonder whether the ministers in this government and 
the bureaucrats in their departments are aware of the conditions 
that really exist for enforcement personnel who are actually on 
the line when it comes to protecting our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second concern is another common occurrence with this 
government which is the offloading of costs onto already 
overburdened areas of responsibility.  Our customs officers will 
require additional training to carry out their duties. Detention 
facilities at border crossings will have to be upgraded.  However 
this government has not seen fit to provide additional resources. 
Canada Customs will have to find the finances within existing 
budgets to accommodate these additional requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It causes me to wonder whether this government is trying to 
convince its employees to shut up and to not make any noise.  The 
government was forced to act because customs personnel complained 
loudly about crime proceeding unheeded through our border points, 
but the customs departments will have to pay the consequences and 
find the money to fund the added responsibilities from within 
already restricted and limited budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government really trying to coerce its departments into 
remaining silent, leaving citizens at risk all in order to 
protect their individual budgets?  I hope not because we 
continually witness the passing off of financial responsibility. 
I cannot help but be concerned that a hidden and perhaps a very 
dangerous message is being sent that at some time in the future 
will become apparent, to the detriment of us all.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a third concern.  It is related to the one just 
mentioned in that it is a result of the government's offloading. 
The customs department has been forced because of limited 
resources to automate some points of entry and to hire more part 
time employees.  Both these developments will seriously limit the 
ability of customs to properly effect the aims of Bill C-18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An automated customs port, by definition, means that customs 
personnel are not available to make arrests on site.  Part time 
personnel, by definition, means less experience and capability to 
detect the criminal element or to conduct a proper investigation 
or inquiry and to effect appropriate arrest when required. 
Inexperienced personnel will also be exposed to increased risk if 
and when dangerous situations arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, I will be supporting the legislation because it 
provides better security of Canada's borders.  Unfortunately once 
again the Liberals have taken years to do something which is 
relatively simple to accomplish but their efforts fall short. 
They go half way and then attempt to spin into the minds of 
Canadians that the problem has been fully addressed.  I do not 
know why they simply go through the motions and refuse to provide 
adequate legislation and resources which are sorely needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage my colleagues in the House to support Bill C-18 for 
the good of all Canadians, but I also call on the government to 
address the shortcomings regarding funding issues and the safety 
of customs personnel. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the legislation.  I 
also support it because I believe some steps are being taken here 
that need to be taken.  It is a good start but I do not think 
that is where it should stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is “to empower customs officers with 
the authority of a peace officer, in particular to arrest without 
warrant individuals who are wanted on criminal warrants or who 
are suspected of impaired driving”.  The first thing that 
crosses my mind is that I know police officers have the power to 
arrest people who are wanted by the criminal courts for certain 
reasons.  When they arrest them, police officers are pretty well 
protected.  They carry guns and have clubs and other equipment 
that assists them in doing that.  I do not see anywhere in the 
legislation where we are doing much in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to empower customs officers with the ability to arrest 
without warrant criminals who are wanted, we should certainly see 
to it that they in turn will be likewise protected.  To some 
extent this is true with respect to arresting people who are 
suspected of impaired driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have been around for a few years, Mr. Speaker, and so have 
I.  I do not know if you have ever had the opportunity try to 
persuade someone not to drive after drinking. Occasionally—and 
this happened to me a couple of times—some people take objection 
to that kind of persuasion.  It can get just a bit debatable 
between the two people.  If a customs officer tries to remove an 
individual from his vehicle because he is intoxicated, to prevent 
him from driving, he should be prepared for all situations.  I am 
not sure the bill allows for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate what was stated by the member for Peace River with 
regard to the Feeney case.  I am pleased to see the government is 
empowering some officers at the customs level.  I would like to 
see a little more empowering at the police level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have driven around, as have many of my colleagues from all 
sides of the House, in the back seats of police patrol cars 
observing what is happening, what the action is out there.  I 
found on many occasions that the abuse toward police is 
remarkable in the sense that they have no way to retaliate. There 
is nothing they can do about it.  They have to take the verbal 
abuse and give in to certain things. 
When they finally make an arrest they have to make sure they have 
witnesses to make certain they do not get into any trouble.  They 
have to make the arrest, make sure all the <I>i</I>'s are dotted 
and all the <I>t</I>'s are crossed.  If they do anything wrong 
they are in for it quickly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to empower our law enforcement people to a greater 
degree so they can better do their job.  It seems the government 
is adamant about making sure the rights of the criminal far 
exceed the rights of arresting officers and the rights of 
law-abiding people.  It is becoming more and more obvious.  I 
hope the government will address those issues some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about some of the things that happen at the 
borders in terms of treatment of normal travellers.  Many MPs 
have likely received some of the same complaints that I have 
received concerning the way travellers have been treated on their 
return to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been complaints of rudeness and a lack of 
consideration of the fact that they are visitors returning to 
Canada.  It may be a married couple returning from a vacation or 
whatever the case might be.  Many times its gets a bit out of 
hand.  I do not think Wild Rose people are much different from 
those anywhere else in Canada.  They like to be treated fairly 
and with courtesy at border crossings upon their to return to 
Canada, which they deserve.  Sometimes that does not happen so I 
would caution on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some time in the future I will bring the following incident to 
the attention of the minister.  The national rodeo championships 
are held every year in Las Vegas.  This year we sent a good 
contingency of cowboys from the west and some from the east to 
compete.  When they arrived there they received very nice jackets 
from the organizing committee to signify their status as national 
rodeo representatives.  They were awarded the jackets in honour 
of their presence at the event as Canadian ambassadors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one occasion one of the cowboys who was wearing his jacket 
was crossing the border into Alberta.  He was ostracized a great 
deal because he did not claim the jacket on his declaration.  It 
had actually slipped his mind that he had obtained the coat.  The 
customs officials went further and charged him a great amount of 
duty on the jacket that was given to him as a representative of 
Canada.  That is wrong.  We need to see what went on there and do 
something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think politicians, including the prime minister, who 
have visited other parts of the world have not received some sort 
of gift.  I am sure they did not have to claim them or pay duty 
on them.  Even you, Mr. Speaker.  I am quite positive you do not 
have to pay duty on any gifts you receive when you are on 
official business as a member of Parliament.  At any rate I would 
like that checked into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sooner than later one thing will hit the floor of the House of 
Commons.  I believe it has to be sooner.  There is a document 
that interferes a great deal.  It is a real stumbling block to 
people who want to do a good job at border crossings, to people 
who want to do a good job of protecting society, and to front 
line prison guards who are working for the benefit of all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That document is the charter of rights and freedoms.  It is 
forever throwing up a road block to prevent them from doing the 
kind of job they would like to do.  Someday that document will 
have to be brought into the House of Commons to be scrutinized by 
members to see if there is anything we can do to legislation 
which prevents peace officers of all kinds from doing the kind of 
work they want to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to make a few comments on the bill before the House 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can all take some instructive lessons from the bill.  It 
moves us closer to having the laws of the land more adequately 
enforced.  That is important.  It was talked about this morning. 
That is good.  It is something members of Parliament on all sides 
want to see.  We all want to see the laws of the land being 
enforced and the people who have taken on the task of enforcing 
our laws being given the equipment to do it effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we want that?  We want to protect the vulnerable.  We 
want to ensure that the laws of the land serve the best interests 
of the country and its citizens.  If we passionately care about 
Canada, which I know we all do, we have a strong desire to see 
the laws of the land upheld and officers equipped to do just 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament, as I understand it, is where the laws are shaped and 
the foundation of our legal system is set in place through the 
democratic process.  I heard today some members of my own party 
articulating that we have lost something in Canada.  The intent 
of the law is to protect Canadians, the vulnerable. Sometimes it 
is being negated by technicalities in the courts. This is tragic. 
It does not serve to strengthen the country.  It serves to tear 
it down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us are concerned about it.  We will continue in the days 
ahead to make sure the intent of law, protecting the vulnerable 
and the interests of the majority, will be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some other side effects when technicalities overrule 
the intent of the law and the courts.  One of the real tragedies 
is for the officers we are talking about to have new powers when 
after carrying out their duties and possibly putting their own 
lives at risk in difficult situations they see all their work 
blown away in a courtroom due to a technicality.  It is greatly 
demotivating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just customs officers.  In my own riding several 
constables on the police force have had every bit of their 
motivation and passion for their work torn out of their hearts by 
seeing again and again cases thrown out due to technicalities in 
an obviously guilty situation.  To see the guilty go free is not 
only devastating for them.  It totally shatters the intent of the 
law to protect the vulnerable.  We put more Canadians at risk 
when we let the courts run the land.  As has been said today, we 
have a legal system and not a justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it mean for the youth of the land when they see 
someone who is clearly guilty, and the evidence is greatly 
stacked to suggest that some sort of court action needs to be 
taken, being treated lightly or possibly freed?  Respect for the 
law by the young people of Canada is diminished when this 
happens.  This is not only tragic for today, but as young people 
grow up with that kind of an attitude toward the laws of Canada 
we reap very significant negative returns.  We need to instil a 
respect for Canadian law that has been set in place through the 
democratic process and the parliament in which we serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably my most important concern is that when guilty parties 
are treated lightly or set free, innocent, hardworking, 
law-abiding Canadians and Canadian families are put at risk.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the people I and the members of my party are very

<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will start by recognizing the good work the customs officers at 
the borders are doing for Canada.  They are our ambassadors. 
When visitors and businessmen come to our country they are their 
first contact. Their behaviour brings goodwill to Canada. 
Therefore I would like to recognize the good work they have been 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that Bill C-18 which gives them power to enforce our laws 
is a good bill and we are in support of this bill. The only 
caution I make is that while it is empowering them, our 
ambassadors of goodwill, we do not want them to be carried away 
with these powers and abuse them at the borders, creating 
negative feelings toward Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, as all Canadians know, our laws are lax 
specifically when it comes to our justice system in upholding our 
laws.  Everywhere across the country we can hear people who are 
supposed to uphold our laws asking for more powers to help them 
fulfil their duties.  I think this bill goes toward that intent. 
At the same time I would like to see that more laws like this are 
passed so that our officers who are upholding the law can carry 
out their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time after time in my riding and everywhere when I talk to law 
enforcement officers they say their biggest concern is the 
inability to enforce the laws of the land.  Police are strongly 
hampered by their inability to enforce the laws because they feel 
that when they do their hard work it is difficult for them to 
ensure that the final result is conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have travelled across the world and have come in contact with 
officers at border crossings in many countries.  At times I am 
ashamed by the treatment they give to people who are visitors to 
their country.  At times we can see that their rudeness and their 
practices of corruption are a detriment to their nation's desire 
to have visitors and businessmen come into the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our customs officers, the ones I have come in contact with, 
have actually performed their work very well and have a respect 
among travellers who are coming to Canada.  I would like to again 
say that I am proud and happy about the work that they are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are empowering them with something which we hold dear to 
ensure that the laws of this country are upheld.  I wish them 
good luck in this.  But I would also like to caution and bring to 
their attention that they are our ambassadors of first contact to 
bring goodwill to Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, what I see happening today is that a lot of times 
governments will use certain law enforcement officers to fulfill 
their mandate or to proceed with a mandate.  I know in my riding, 
and in Manitoba especially, customs officers have become known as 
the enemy of farmers.  They have begun to prosecute farmers for 
selling their grain at a better price than they can get in their 
marketing system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not blame the customs officers.  They do a tremendous job. 
They try to do what is right.  However, when they get orders to 
enforce an act such as the wheat board act instead of prosecuting 
farmers on the act itself, then they are manipulating these 
people and the act.  That is very dangerous for our country. That 
is not the way the justice system is supposed to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support this bill.  Customs officers are a very important part 
of our democratic system.  When we travel to places like the 
Soviet Union or Mexico we really know what a customs officer is 
worth, what he can do for you, what he can help you with.  He is 
very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say more power to the customs officers.  They should work at 
arm's length from government.  That will make them efficient and 
they will be a real benefit to Canadian society. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to 
say a few words about this whole question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are always told that Canada is a wonderful country.  It is a 
wonderful country for one wrong reason among all the extra fine 
good reasons.  The wrong reason is that it has become a haven for 
a lot of people who engage in different kinds of criminal 
activity.  There is too much trafficking in things like illegal 
credit cards.  We have people smugglers.  Some people come to 
Canada to work illegally.  People are trafficking in illegal 
substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anything that can be done to strengthen the enforcement of our 
criminal law at the border should be supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the areas that the government should look at very closely 
is the increased use of automation, whenever possible.  There are 
many high tech devices available to detect illegal substances.  I 
would like the government to do an honest assessment of the 
effectiveness of some of this equipment.  If it is effective, it 
should introduce it and use it in greater measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other concern I have is with the training of customs 
officers.  They have to be trained technically.  They have to 
know the law.  They should also have a good amount of training in 
how to deal with people.  This is a matter of considerable 
concern.  Clearly it is a large concern because a lot of people 
are moving across our borders, transporting goods.  It is very 
important for us to strengthen the integrity of our borders so 
that illegal activities are not attracted to this country.  We 
need to do that more efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, even though this bill has some flaws, I would be 
willing to support the positive changes in it.  I hope there will 
be more in the future.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the practice of vote pairing 
should be abandoned and the standing orders be amended to 
establish an absentee proxy voting system which would permit a 
party cast properly authorized proxy votes for no more than 25% 
of its members. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, thank 
you for explaining to those watching either from the gallery or 
on television why we have advanced the clock.  It is always a 
great source of amusement to people these strange and antiquated 
rules we have here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion I am putting forward today deals also with another 
one of these strange and antiquated rules that have come to be 
part of the procedures in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read the motion one more time because it is an 
important motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the practice of vote pairing 
should be abandoned and the standing orders be amended to 
establish an absentee proxy voting system which would permit a 
party to cast properly authorized proxy votes for no more than 
25% of its members. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a moment I will go into describing what vote pairing is and 
why we should change it.  First I would like to mention that 
unfortunately this motion is not votable. Even though it talks 
about amending the way this very House works and it would affect 
potentially every single member of this House it has been made 
non-votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a very good friend in the New Zealand house.  As many 
members know, I am from New Zealand.  The New Zealand deputy 
speaker, who also has the name Ian, is a good friend of mine. I 
was visiting New Zealand recently and I told him that some 
private members' business is non-votable.  He was astounded 
because in New Zealand they are all votable.  That gives a sense 
of accomplishment to members to at least get their material 
votable.  It is very sad that this motion is not votable, because 
I am going to read from a portion of a 1994 report of the 
standing orders committee from New Zealand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I introduced this motion is that it is a part of a 
package of motions that I put forward based on some changes that 
were made in the New Zealand house in 1994 which proved so 
successful that they have been adopted as permanent changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of proxy votes, I will read a paragraph from the 
report, because it describes for everybody what vote pairing is 
and why there should be a change: “Parties in New Zealand have 
for many years operated a system of pairing where the effect of a 
member who is absent from the House is cancelled out by a member 
from another party agreeing not to vote while the other member is 
absent.  Initially it was an arrangement entered into privately, 
but since 1951 in New Zealand it was recognized as part of the 
proceedings of the House. Paired members were recorded in 
<I>Hansard</I> for any division that is taken in their absence. 
The primary use of pairs was to ensure that members could be 
absent from the House to carry out public business in relation to 
their portfolios or constituencies and that ill members did not 
have to attend the House for close divisions”.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system worked effectively for the two main parties of the 
House but the committee believed in New Zealand that it would be 
good to introduce a proxy system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the recommended proxy system, instead the pairing members 
would be required to give proper authority for a proxy vote to be 
cast for an abstention to be recorded in their name. It must 
state, among other matters, who is to exercise that proxy.  In 
practice what happened in New Zealand was that generally members 
would give the proxy to their party whip and the whip was able to 
exercise that vote in their absence.  A member not wishing to 
vote with his or her party, in other words a dissenting vote, 
could be given to a member of any other party as long as it does 
not exceed the 25% limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The limits are policed fairly closely.  As I mentioned, after 
having run this now for close to four years it was determined 
last year that it should be made permanent because it had worked 
so well.  It has enabled members to fulfil their requirements in 
ridings and to attend conferences related to their critic roles 
or particular areas of interest.  It has enabled ministers, for 
example, in close governments which the New Zealand government 
has to attend important conferences like the Kyoto conference 
without having to worry that there may be some sort of urgent 
vote where they suddenly have to be told to race back because it 
could be a close vote.  It is just a very civilized way of 
handling necessary absences from the House that do occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no absolute requirement for the party to use its entire 
25% but that figure was adopted in New Zealand and found to be 
very satisfactory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, it is part of a package of changes that were 
introduced on a whole range of issues.  Another thing they have 
done in New Zealand—and I have put another motion in on it—is 
that they have compressed the sitting days of the House into 
three days, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, so that Mondays and 
Fridays are free days for members to have extended weekends in 
their ridings.  This is working very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For members of this House who are from Ontario and Quebec it 
would be extremely convenient.  Even for those of us who have to 
travel long distances, to have those extra days to do riding 
business would be very valuable.  That is another change that was 
introduced in 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We really should learn from houses that have gone through the 
process of studying these changes and have found that they are 
very good to introduce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Zealand House has also dealt with the issue of quorum 
and, one that interests me, question period.  The changes to its 
standing orders require reasonable answers to questions.  If the 
speaker rules that the answer to the question was not actually an 
answer to the question, the minister must appear at the end of 
the day and re-answer the question.  That has had the effect of 
tightening up the entire question period into something 
meaningful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get back to the basic motion I introduced today, it reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the practice of vote pairing 
should be abandoned and the Standing Orders be amended to 
establish an absentee proxy voting system which would permit a 
party to case properly authorized proxy votes for no more than 
25% of its Members. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I defy any member to say that it would not be an advantage to be 
able to have that percentage available to a party whip for 
members to be necessarily absent for some purpose.  It is an 
absolutely sensible position to take.  It is very distressing 
that the motion cannot even be voted on when it is something that 
is important to the operation of this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the House has the power to do anything I would like to 
ask at this time for unanimous consent of the House to make the 
motion votable so that members would at least have the 
opportunity to indicate whether or not they think it is a good 
idea.  I ask for the unanimous consent of the House to make the 
motion votable.

their whip or somebody else will at least work behind the scenes 
to have the issue considered in more detail.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Motion No. M-28 regarding absentee proxy 
voting.  I thank the hon. member for presenting the motion.  As 
he indicated, it allows us to discuss some of our fundamental 
responsibilities as members of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have elected us to represent their interests, to 
propose and debate motions and laws on how best to meet those 
interests, and to vote at the end of debate.  The Fathers of 
Confederation expressed this principle in the Constitution. 
Section 49 of the British North America Act states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—questions arising in the House of Commons shall be decided by a 
Majority of Voices other than that of the Speaker, and when the 
Voices are equal, but not otherwise, the Speaker shall have a 
Vote. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Voting is fundamental to what we do in the House.  As all 
members know, the pairing of votes noted in the motion refers to 
the practice whereby two members on opposite sides of a question 
agree not to vote on a specific issue.  As a result, paired votes 
cancel each other out and do not affect the outcome of a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pairing is essentially a convenience to members of Parliament 
which allows a member to be absent and have his or her vote 
protected.  The roots of paired votes go back to Great Britain in 
the time of Cromwell.  Pairing is a common international 
practice.  For example, the United Kingdom, the United States and 
Australia all have arrangements for pairing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first paired vote in Canada was recorded less than three 
weeks after the first parliament began to meet in 1867 under the 
terms of the British North America Act.  Pairing is therefore a 
longstanding practice in Canada although its use has varied over 
the life of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one recorded vote in 1946, for example, 124 members were 
paired.  On the other hand, between 1949 and 1957 pairing became 
a rare event.  One writer has suggested that this was because the 
government of the day had a very large majority so the issue of 
pairing became less of a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arrangements for handling pairing have also evolved since 
Confederation to protect the parties involved and to ensure the 
efficient functioning of the House of Commons.  Codes of 
procedure were developed including informal arrangements between 
whips.  This culminated in the introduction of Standing Order 
44.1 which was adopted as part of the changes to the standing 
orders made in 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 44.1 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(1) The Clerk of the House shall cause to be kept at the Table a 
Register of Paired Members, in which any Member of the government 
party and any Member of an Opposition party may have their names 
entered together by their respective Whips, to indicate that they 
will not take part in any recorded division held on the date 
inscribed on that page in the Register; provided that independent 
Members of Parliament may sign the Register in their own right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) On any day on which one or more recorded divisions have 
taken place, the names of the Members so entered shall be printed 
in the <I>Debates</I> and the <I>Journals</I>, immediately 
following the entry for each of the said divisions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of that procedure under our existing standing orders 
is so that pairing is transparent, so there is public 
accountability for members who pair, so the arrangement between 
two members on each side of the House is a matter of public 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee on House management stated in April 1993 
that these 1991 amendments on pairing were built on long 
established experience in Canada and other jurisdictions.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee observed that the introduction of a register of 
paired members at the table was an attempt to revive an earlier 
practice of the House where a procedure had existed for 
registering pairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee also noted that members often have other 
commitments which prevent them from being in the House on a 
certain day and pairing is an attempt to accommodate those 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to proxy voting which is the other arrangement 
for members who, as suggested by the member, cannot for one 
reason or another be in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While pairing is a common procedure among parliaments in other 
countries, some jurisdictions, as the member has indicated, have 
sought to address the issue of absence in other ways.  One of 
these ways is to vote by proxy whereby a parliamentarian who is 
present may cast his or her own vote as well as the vote of an 
absent parliamentarian.  This is the absentee voting suggested by 
the Reform member today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives of the French National Assembly, for example, 
can vote by proxy.  Indeed the French constitution itself 
provides that votes can be delegated in exceptional cases by one 
member to another member.  The cases in which members are 
authorized to delegate are laid down in law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, proxy voting was proposed in the Netherlands 
but was rejected because the terms of its constitution did not 
allow it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members look at the overall international experience with 
proxy voting they will find that proxy voting is an exceptional 
practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Voting by proxy, as far as I know, in addition to the case cited 
by the member is only allowed in Brazil, Cameroon, Comoros, 
France, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Luxembourg, Mali, Senegal and the 
United Kingdom.  In a number of these cases I would add that 
proxy voting is only allowed under certain conditions such as 
sickness or absence on official duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United Kingdom, for example, a proxy vote is only allowed 
if a member is incapacitated by illness and provided he or she is 
in the House precincts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international consensus is against proxy voting.  Why is 
this so?  The basic objection to proxy voting is that a member 
cannot exercise his or her fundamental duty if he or she is 
unaware of the issue being voted on, as frequently has been shown 
to be the case if the member is not present in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International experience shows that proxy voting encourages 
absenteeism.  I hope the Reform Party does not want to encourage 
members of the House to be absent while the House is in session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would point out that proxy voting has led to abuses 
in other jurisdictions which have undermined public confidence in 
parliamentary institutions.  One writer, in commenting on the 
widespread use of proxy voting in Great Britain's House of Lords 
during the Napoleonic wars, stated: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—any one whose conscience did not forbid him to legislate 
without listening to debate could delegate his power to a peer 
present at the voting, and it was customary for—indolent 
men—to assign their votes to the leader of their party. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Reform Party is not encouraging indolence in the 
House.  I urge members to look for other ways of improving our 
voting procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member again for raising these important 
matters.  I would suggest that in considering the motion members 
take note of the traditions and experience of this House of 
Commons.  I would urge that we look at issues related to voting 
in a larger context which would include the possibility of other 
options to address any concerns that members of the House have 
with respect to our voting procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that pursuant to another part of the standing 
orders of the House of Commons we are required to have a full 
debate on our entire standing orders between the 60th and 90th 
sitting days of any parliament.  Shortly there will be an 
opportunity in the House to address all our standing orders, 
including our voting procedures.  I hope the member opposite and 
all members here will use that opportunity to re-examine our 
standing orders.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is to be commended. I think he realizes that without 
regular reviews such as that provided for by the debate in our 
standing orders, the basic rules of this House of Commons could 
easily become, whatever his expression was, strange and 
antiquated.  It is important when the debate on the standing 
orders comes forward that we all participate fully. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to begin by simply reminding this House that democracy is not 
something static, something that exists unchanging.  Democracy is 
a principle which must be defended and cherished every day.  But it 
evolves. It is transformed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The democracy within which we operate here in Canada in this 
House of Commons is, in a way, the heritage of numerous generations 
of parliamentarians who passed through these hallowed halls before 
us and who made Canadian democracy what it is today.  Similarly, it 
is our duty to keep on with this work so that the evolution will 
continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that spirit, I believe that the suggestion from our Reform 
Party colleague is most worthwhile, but only if it serves as a 
point of departure for an in-depth examination of all of the rules 
governing this House, as the parliamentary secretary has suggested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the specific wording of the motion by the 
Reform Party, I cannot help but recall that, when this party first 
appeared in the House in 1993, it arrived with the avowed intention 
of changing everything.  They came here as the Reform Party and, as 
such, they wanted to reform everything.> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a while, they tried to operate without a whip, without a 
House leader.  For a while, they tried to change the rules for oral 
question period.  But, as I have just said, the British 
parliamentary system is not something that dropped out of the sky 
completely formed. It is something that has been built up over many 
centuries. 
It is an evolving process.  It is what I would call the outcome of 
lengthy reflection which had produced our institutions as we know 
them today, operating, functioning, in the way that they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note some frustration on the other side, but when I saw our 
Reform Party friends finally re-adopting practices that are very 
common in the British parliamentary system, such as having a whip 
and a House leader, such as maintaining oral question period as is 
in Canada, I said to myself they have somehow understood that this 
is how the system is, that they must operate within the specific 
framework the system calls for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not, of course, exclude the possibility of our 
looking at potential changes to the Standing Orders, but let us go 
back to the wording of the motion. 
As the text of the motion indicates, the proposal is to replace the 
pairing system with a proxy system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the parliamentary secretary rightly pointed out, the 
Constitution, which forms the basis of the institutions we are part 
of, speaks clearly on the subject of voting by members of 
Parliament.  In order to vote, a member must be in the House and 
cast a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pairing system was set up at the outset, as the 
parliamentary secretary mentioned, at the time of Cromwell in the 
United Kingdom, in England, to allow members with opposing opinions 
not to vote and be recorded as such in the record of divisions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advantage of this measure is that it preserves the 
inviolate aspect of the vote while allowing members who have not 
voted to indirectly express how they would have voted.  Voting by 
proxy could definitely have a detrimental effect on our democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this mean that a member wishing to vote in the House 
could do so some way from his riding office in New Brunswick, 
Ontario or the Yukon? 
What is the direct effect of such a practice?  The direct effect 
comes when the institution representing democracy in a country 
informs the public that proxy votes are permitted.  Will we end up 
with the public voting by proxy in an election?  If we allow the 
representatives of the people to vote by proxy, will the people 
have the same right as parliamentarians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to think about that, and I think we should consider 
the principle of voting.  Nevertheless, the problem remains for the 
time being.  It remains because allowing members to vote from 
outside the House could have the deleterious effect of weakening 
some of the dynamism of this House through the acceptance of less 
rigorous requirements for attendance in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member quite rightly pointed out that the duty of a 
parliamentarian naturally includes not just the work of a lawmaker, 
which must be performed here in the House, in the form of voting, 
but also the work of representing the public, of serving as the 
link between the public and government organizations.  As society 
evolves, this requires that parliamentarians spend more time in 
their ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, it was mentioned that parliamentarians in New Zealand 
sit only three days a week.  A bill is now in the works to consider 
whether it would not be possible to set aside one day a week for 
parliamentarians to spend more time in their ridings.  This is 
another matter that we must consider. 
But until then, does vote pairing not answer this very concern of 
the member that parliamentarians be allowed to do their work in 
their ridings, to perform parliamentary duties outside the walls of 
the House, and still have the opportunity to make their voice heard 
here in the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer is yes.  As I was saying earlier, when two members 
of opposing views do not vote and their absence is recorded in the 
record of the division, implicitly we know how the member intended 
to vote.  But to allow proxy voting would, I think, be to go 
against the notion that the vote is a solemn, sacred duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As things now stand, since no more thought has been given to 
this issue, and since we will probably be called on to reflect more 
generally on all the rules of the House, I can only urge my 
colleagues to reject this motion and to give careful consideration 
over the coming weeks and months to a possible reform of the rules 
of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on behalf of the New Democratic Party to say a 
few words on this Reform motion which calls for ending vote 
pairing.  The motion also asks that we establish an absentee 
proxy voting system which would permit a party to cast properly 
authorized proxy votes of no more than 25% of its members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the House of Commons, I am as open and embracing 
of new ideas as are most members in this House regardless of 
their party.  I am always anxious to hear new ideas particularly 
from my colleagues in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do not want to give the impression that I support 
this motion because it has some very interesting implications.  I 
agree with the member for Peterborough.  He said that with proxy 
voting, members voting from a distance on issues, on amendments 
to acts and amendments to motions and bills would be hard pressed 
to know what they were voting on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As whip of the New Democratic Party and someone who has been a 
member of this House for over four years, I can share the 
following with my colleagues.  Even when members of all parties 
have been in the House full time during the week and have paid 
attention to the debates, the amendments, the motions and the 
committee work, they sometimes still do not have a clue what they 
are voting on unless their whips tell them to their faces what it 
is they are voting on.  Sometimes there are 20 or 30 votes in the 
matter of an hour and a half in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is up to the leadership of the caucuses to make the decisions 
in co-operation with their caucuses and to advise others who were 
not at the meetings of how their caucus is going to vote or how 
their individual members might want to vote if they wish to have 
an independent vote from the caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposal would further weaken and diminish the authority of 
the member of Parliament.  It would certainly weaken and diminish 
the authority with which a member would be voting. I flag that 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite surprised with the Reformers.  They talk about 
democracy.  Reform members should learn the meaning of parler, or 
Parliament which is a derivative of parler.  It means to speak. 
We come as representatives of the thousands of people in our 
constituencies to speak in the House of Commons in Ottawa on 
behalf of our constituents.  We are here to parler, to speak on 
behalf of our constituents on issues that are important to them. 
Voting happens to be one of the responsibilities of a member of 
Parliament after giving speeches or listening to the debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised that Reformers would want to promote democracy 
and the opportunity for members to have free votes while they say 
that the House of Commons is not important to them, that they 
will go back to their ridings and visit with whomever they want 
and not come to Ottawa to at least earn their paycheques.  That 
diminishes democracy.  It diminishes Parliament.  It certainly 
blows into shreds their argument that they believe in democracy. 
Time after time the evidence shows that they believe in the 
contrary.  The record should clearly show that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Reformers want to stay home in their ridings to vote, they 
should resign from Parliament and run for office in municipal or 
provincial government.  They could stay in their cities, their 
towns or their villages or their rural areas in their provinces 
and they would not have to worry about coming to Ottawa.  They 
have options if they do not like coming here.  They can resign or 
they do not have to run next time, which I think is the option 
preferred by millions of Canadians for Reform members who believe 
in this sort of anti-democratic move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just another example of the Reform Party wanting less 
government.  Reformers do not have a great deal of respect for 
the institution of government.  They do not believe that 
government works. They say to everybody in this country “Vote 
for me and I will prove to you that government does not work”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Saskatchewan we have had the evidence of the Reform Party 
proving to Saskatchewan people that Reform policies do not work. 
In 1982 a Reform style politician, Grant Devine, said the same 
thing as this Reform member is saying today, that they do not 
want to have involvement in government. “Government does not 
work.  You vote for us, Saskatchewan people, and we will prove to 
you that government does not work”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan people were tricked and they voted for this Reform 
style politician, Grant Devine.  He had 10 consecutive deficit 
budgets in nine years.  He went from a zero debt to $16 billion 
in debt for the one million people in the province of 
Saskatchewan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twelve of his colleagues in that government have been charged 
and most of them have been found guilty for criminal acts while 
members of the legislature.  That is the Reform style kind of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers promise less government.  They say they believe in 
more democracy and of course they end up giving all the assets 
away in the objective of less government to all their friends who 
then take away the assets and leave the debt with the people of 
Saskatchewan. I am kind of surprised at this motion and why the 
they would promote this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My very major concern in the New Democratic Party is that 
technically this motion is preceding ongoing meetings and ongoing 
decisions being considered by the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs that the member for Peterborough ably chairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are discussing the very nature of modernizing parliaments. We 
are looking at electronic voting and all sorts of things that 
would modernize our system.  While modernizing, we are not 
looking at diminishing democracy or the role of members of 
Parliament.  We are actually looking at enhancing the role of 
Parliament and making sure that Canadians have a voice in this 
assembly regardless of their being in Ottawa or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final words are that the Reform Party also surprised me with 
the fact that it wants to let the government off the hook.  For 
the record, the NDP has never supported officially the pairing of 
votes.  To this day we continue not to support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that if elected, members should be here, be 
accountable and be responsible and should be on duty like many of 
my colleagues here today on a Friday afternoon.  I give them all 
credit for being here.  It is an honourable thing and a very 
important thing to be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised because the Reform Party, whose members want to 
hold the government accountable, now wants to allow 25% of the 
Liberal MPs not even to be here to ask questions.  I do not 
think that defines democracy or more accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Reformers are doing is encouraging the stampede away from 
the House of Commons.  They are encouraging the authority of the 
House of Commons to be so watered down that members may as well 
not come to Ottawa to vote.  They may as well all vote by proxy 
from their various constituencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure if I oppose this but the arguments that I put 
forward I think persuade me that this recommendation by the 
Reform Party member is not well thought out.  It is 
anti-democratic.  It reduces the effectiveness of the House of 
Commons and really is another effort by the Reform Party, very 
supportive of Liberal policies, to provide the Liberal government 
with yet one more opportunity to avoid being accountable, 
responsible and answerable to the people of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would first 
like to congratulate my colleague, who introduced this motion in 
the House.  I think it important to emphasize all the effort that 
goes into introducing a motion.  You will understand, however, that 
I am not necessarily congratulating his party.  I will come back to 
this in a few moments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to commend the parliamentary secretary to the 
Leader of the Government in the House, as well as our colleagues in 
the Bloc Quebecois and the New Democratic Party, on the quality of 
their speeches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it has done no more than clarify certain important 
principles, I think this motion was important. 
It gives us an opportunity to reflect on our role as 
parliamentarians, on the principle on which our fellow citizens 
rely and on which our work must be based if it is to meet the 
expectations of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am, nonetheless, a bit surprised at this motion, which 
alludes, among other things, to the formal disappearance of vote 
pairing and, obviously, to proxy voting.  It is a bit worrisome to 
recall, but sometimes it is important, that, during the last 
election campaign, the Reform Party wanted to see the seven million 
Quebeckers and the eight and a half million French Canadians across 
the country all but unrepresented in the House.  They practically 
wanted to exclude Quebeckers and French Canadians from the 
Parliament of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When there are suggestions such as this one about voting by 
proxy, we are aware that there are some things in life not properly 
done without direct contact with our colleagues, those within our 
own party first of all and then comments from MPs in other parties. 
A vote in the House of Commons represents a rather special dynamic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be reflection.  There must be exchanges with our 
colleagues.  In our caucus meetings I am glad to be able to 
exchange views with my Newfoundland colleague, a former minister in 
the Peckford cabinet, who makes a huge contribution on certain 
specific issues, particularly natural resources, fisheries in 
particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Reform Party colleague must realize that the formula we 
have at the present time, of having an official register of paired 
members, is a very acceptable formula.  If there is one important 
privilege for Members of Parliament, it is their attachment to 
their personal vote.  The MPs' votes are not the responsibility of 
the whip, the party leader, or the Speaker of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of Parliament must endeavour to be present here in the 
Parliament of Canada, both for the official vote and for all the 
proceedings leading to it.  A vote is not carried out without 
reflection, without exchanges with our colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Huge progress has been made in this House in the past 15 or 20 
years in speeding up votes.  New parliamentary habits have 
developed.  Thought is being given to electronic voting.  Let me 
point out immediately that electronic voting does not mean remote 
voting. 
MPs must be physically present on the Hill for the proceedings 
leading to a vote and for the recorded vote itself, and this is a 
process about which our fellow citizens have strong feelings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were not elected to this place to let our whip vote for us. 
What would happen if there were surprise votes?  Would the whip 
pull out his list of proxies and record the votes?  That is totally 
unacceptable.  I, as a whip, consider that this would be too much 
power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practice of pairing is a matter of honour and respect 
between MPs.  Even if our colleague's motion were formally adopted, 
I am convinced that this privilege could not be taken away from 
MPs.  That would be a change to the <I>Standing Orders of the House of 
Commons</I> which would be unenforceable and unacceptable.  Even if it 
were adopted, it could not have any legal force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that my colleague, who is a conscientious 
member of Parliament, will reflect upon this. 
There is no way that two MPs could be prevented from working out a 
pairing arrangement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that an MP is the only one responsible for his 
vote.  It is not transferable.  It would be quite unusual for a 
vote to come from a whip.  The vote belongs to the MP, not his or 
her whip.  It is a privilege conferred upon us by our fellow 
citizens.  We may not transfer responsibilities to others, 
particularly not the responsibility to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proxy voting reduces MPs' freedom to vote.  It could even go 
so far as to lower the quality of voting.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing is more effective than contacts between 
parliamentarians of all parties, except between parliamentarians of 
the same party in order to take a stand on an important issue or 
even a less important one.  I personally think that they are all 
important and that many members feel the same way.  Mr. Speaker, 
because I know you, I know that you share this viewpoint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very special dynamic on Parliament Hill.  Many 
meetings are held to ensure that members voting will do so in full 
knowledge of the facts of the matters, which are often very 
complex. 
Voting cannot be done at a distance, and, because of its 
importance, cannot be left to others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be easy to argue on the subject of voting by proxy 
that it could mean significant savings, since members would not 
have to travel from Vancouver or Whitehorse simply to come and vote 
in Ottawa.  If this is the intention of the motion introduced by 
the member for North Vancouver, I would submit that electronic 
voting would achieve the same result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And so, if one day electronic voting becomes acceptable, I am 
sure that voting from elsewhere will be out of the question.  This 
is where we vote.  We must certainly not vote electronically from 
somewhere else and especially not hand over the responsibility to 
the whips or to others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Be assured that I and my party will always be here to defend 
the importance of the privilege of pairing with a colleague. 
This is one of the members' important privileges.  We will be here 
to defend the importance of being physically present on the Hill 
and in Parliament in order to vote, to take a stand on behalf of 
our colleagues and especially on behalf of our fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one party that frequently speaks of its 
constituents, because they take a stand in voting, it is the Reform 
Party.  It is an honour for them, I admit, but it involves being 
physically present here in Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on this 
important issue, which will be followed with interest in the coming 
months by all my colleagues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am going 
to use just a few minutes to give a few of my thoughts because I 
want to give my colleague from North Vancouver ample time to sum 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of observations have come to my mind as I have been 
listening to the debate.  I find it rather ironic, and if I can 
dare use the term hypocritical, among members here.  I use 
hypocrisy here in the good sense where members are trying to 
portray something where really it is not an accurate 
representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the members who have spoken after my hon. colleague in 
the Reform Party on his private member's motion have spoken 
against this motion.  They claim that it is because of a 
diminishment of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If pairing does not diminish democracy, where you agree not to 
vote, how can one then argue that by giving your actual vote and 
simply asking someone else to deliver your actual vote is a 
diminishment of democracy compared to what we have now?  To me 
that is not a valid argument. I respect these other members for 
their point of view but I also respectfully say that is not 
accurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that in a sense our standing here 
this afternoon and debating this is a diminishment of democracy. 
We are trying to persuade each other of a point of view but there 
will not be a decision on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just before Christmas I had a motion in the House that all 
private members' business should be votable.  It is ludicrous 
that we should stand here and persuade each other but that the 
members themselves voted I think almost unanimously and said they 
do not want to vote. 
They want to put forward a private member's bill but they do not 
want to vote on it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would call it a total lack of democracy.  Freedom of speech is 
an important factor, which is diminished by the eight pages of 
words we cannot use, so I am very restricted now in being able to 
express myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one thing to be able to speak, but is it not the essence 
of democracy that we actually get to vote and make decisions? 
That is a very important missing link. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that we sincerely go about changing this Chamber.  I hope 
we change this place of democracy, this place of debate and votes 
so that it truly works on behalf of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in my second term as a member of Parliament.  I discovered 
very quickly that it is a full time job twice.  One should be 
here 100% of the time to look at the bills and the motions, 
analyse them, work together with staff and communications people. 
At the same time there is a full time job in the riding.  People 
want to be heard.  They want to have access to their member of 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever I go home I go to meetings.  People are eager to give 
me their ideas on the issues facing our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not being realistic when we pretend that everyone is 
going to be here all the time.  The House sits five days a week. 
Maybe we ought to look at that and make a provision so we can all 
do our jobs better by having more time to be in our ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot be here debating issues in the House and at the same 
time be in our ridings doing that work which is so very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears to me that the way it works right now is that the 
members, by pairing, are really abdicating their democratic 
ability because they are agreeing not to vote.  It is just like 
they said in the private member's motion I presented before 
Christmas, that they agree they do not want to vote on private 
members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to really think hard about these things.

<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I must say that, 
as a young member and newcomer here, this is the type of situation one 
must often deal with. Still, I cannot believe that members from other 
parties can possibly think that to vote under an absentee proxy system 
would enable them to do a better job and to better serve democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully support the comments made by my friend, the hon. member for 
Chicoutimi, by the parliamentary secretary and by Bloc Quebecois and NDP 
members. When I got elected, it was to represent my constituents and, of 
course, democracy must go hand in hand with voting. 
When I am here, when I am representing my constituents by voting on 
legislation, I have no intention of waiving this responsibility and 
letting my whip or someone else vote on my behalf. I believe that one 
serves his or her constituents by assuming one's responsibilities, and 
assuming one's responsibilities means to be present when a vote takes 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practice of vote pairing is totally irrelevant. We all know 
that, most of the time, there is no vote pairing. When we must vote, we 
are here in this House. As my friend, the hon. member for Chicoutimi, 
pointed out, vote pairing is a tradition based on an honour system 
involving two members, and we must respect and preserve that tradition.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also pleased that the subject of electronic voting has 
been raised, because, obviously, we will have to look at what 
enables us to do our work effectively as parliamentarians. But I do 
not think the two should be mixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents are happy to see that their member for 
Bourassa is not only present in his riding but also physically 
present in the House.  I think a lot of people follow our debates 
on television, and when I vote, the entire riding of Bourassa 
votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that this practice is hypocritical or that it 
undermines democracy.  On the contrary.  However, we should look 
very seriously at the time of voting. 
We should set aside a specific time for voting every Tuesday or 
Wednesday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that this is negotiable, that we could sit for four 
days rather than five.  I work Saturday and Sunday as well, so 
Friday, Saturday and Sunday we could work in our ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There exists a form of technology called the telephone.  It 
permits great efficiency on the days we have to be in Parliament to 
resolve certain issues.  I think everything lies in the way things 
are orchestrated.  There has to be a work plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I think we should be focusing on the number of 
days we sit in the House. 
I agree with my hon. colleague from the Reform Party that our 
constituents want to meet with us, to come and talk to us. They expect 
us to be physically present not only in the House of Commons but also in 
our ridings, because they need us. Proxy voting will not solve anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I add my voice to that of all my colleagues who opposed this 
motion. I think that not only is this a false debate but it undermines 
democracy and makes this institution appear even more cynical. Perhaps 
we could fulfil our duties differently and come up with a better system 
in the House, but there is no way I will give anyone a proxy to vote in 
my place. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As is customary, we 
will give the hon. member for North Vancouver, who moved the 
motion, an opportunity to sum up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, all 
the members who stood mentioned democracy.  The last member who 
stood also talked about opposing the motion.  However, the point 
we have been trying to make here is that we cannot even vote on 
it.  This place is so undemocratic that there is not even an 
opportunity to vote at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from the NDP got up and talked about democracy but 
all he could talk about was representing the NDP's position.  He 
talked about this motion as if it were a Reform motion.  This is 
Private Members' Business.  It is the business of individual 
members of Parliament.  If a well experienced member like the 
member from the NDP has not caught on yet that this is supposed 
to be a period of free voting for members then he has a lot to 
learn about democracy at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pairing is something also that Reform does not support because 
it does not work for a party like Reform which has written into 
its party constitution that we have an obligation to represent 
the majority will of our constituents in this place, as I have 
done on three separate occasions, voting against the line of my 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore it is impossible for pairing to work for new style 
parties.  It is great for the old line parties that refuse to 
change.  That is one of the problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the members who stand and say that a vote in this place 
actually belongs to the member and that he is representing his or 
her constituents is not only naive, it treats Canadians as if 
they are fools, as if they do not know what happens in this 
place.  Everyone over there is instructed by the Prime Minister 
how to vote and everyone down at this end is instructed by their 
leaders how to vote.  Every single one of them is instructed how 
to vote.  When we talk about democracy and freedom it is just not 
true.

to mix participation in debates with voting as if that made a 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair is not 
certain the Chair heard the accusation that the member was lying,

in that way under any circumstances at any time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if there is evidence that can 
be shown to me that people in other parties do not always vote 
their party line, I would be pleased to see it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The speaker from the government side tried to mix the 
participation in debates with the voting, as if somehow the 
debates were meaningful. The fact is even on government bills 
there is hardly anybody in this place. Members stood today and 
acted as if this place was full of people taking notice of the 
debate and not even a dozen people are here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The Reform private member is casting aspersions upon all 
members of this House by making reference to either presence or 
non-presence of members of Parliament, talking about naivety— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre is quite right in saying that we 
have a convention not to refer to the absence or presence of 
other members. He was perhaps stretching the notion of a point of 
order and went into debate. The hon. member for North Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are certainly hitting some 
nerves today.  And we understand why that certain convention is 
in place, don't we? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about tradition.  The member opposite on the 
government side talked about tradition and how we could not 
change anything because we have got to live up to tradition. The 
fact is, he just wants to find a reason not to do something. It 
used to be tradition in this place that there were not any women. 
It used to be tradition in this place that we sat for six weeks a 
year. The fact is it does not have to be a tradition. We can 
change anything we want to in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say or to imply that the only reason one would want to vote 
by proxy is to avoid ever coming here is also ridiculous. The 
proxy votes would be under the control of the whip. The whip 
would not have to allow a single person to be absent. But the 
whip would have the right, if necessary, to issue a proxy vote 
privilege to a member who had to be away for some reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just see it as a modernization of the procedures of the House. 
To say that the member has to be in the House to vote is just a 
crock frankly.  As anyone except the most naive will know, most 
members monitor the proceedings of the House on television from 
their Hill offices or their riding offices when they have to be 
away. There is absolutely no earthly reason why a member could 
not provide an intelligent proxy vote on any type of bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member myself who has the opportunity to speak many times 
in this House, I take ever possible opportunity to do so. Every 
day that I am here on duty I get up to speak in this House.  I 
recognize the value of speaking here. But to pretend or to claim 
that I would not be able to vote intelligently if I was not 
standing in here every day is totally ludicrous. In these days of 
telecommunications, members simply do not have to be here in 
order to make intelligent voting decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should wrap it up here. It has obviously created a 
fair amount of emotion among the members.  If I have been 
successful in anything today, I would be thankful that I have 
done that because we should be discussing these things, and 
frankly, we should be doing it openly and publicly.  We should 
not be pretending to the public out there that certain things 
happen here when they do not.  And the public already knows they 
do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public knows that people vote the party line in this place. 
The public knows that MPs for the most part do not represent 
them.  They represent the parties. We really have to do something 
to put real democracy into this place instead of constantly 
pretending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> There being no 
further members rising for debate and the motion not being 
designated as a votable item, the time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired and 
the order is dropped from the Order Paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 1.58 p.m, this House stands adjourned until Monday next 
at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 1.58 p.m.)
