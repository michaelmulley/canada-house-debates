</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (for the Minister of Finance)</B> 
moved that Bill C-8, an act to establish the Financial Consumer 
Agency of Canada and to amend certain acts in relation to 
financial institutions, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here in this 
crowded House to take part in the third reading debate on Bill 
C-8, an act to establish the financial consumer agency of Canada 
and to amend certain acts in relation to financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we can all agree that the financial services sector 
plays a critical role in the Canadian economy.  It underpins all 
other sectors in the economy by providing the means to channel 
savings into investment, resulting in economic growth and wealth 
creation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role the financial institutions play in the life of 
Canadians is equally important.  In fact, these institutions 
protect Canadians' assets well and meet the needs of consumers 
and businesses as far as major financing, purchases and 
investments are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that half of Canadians are shareholders of our 
financial institutions, either directly or indirectly, so this 
represents an important source of revenue for Canadians now and 
in the future. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As legislators, we have an important responsibility to encourage 
the health of this sector.  According to 1999 Statistics Canada 
data, 863,000 Canadians were employed in the financial services 
sector, including finance, insurance, real estate and leasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's federal financial institutions operate within a 
legislative and regulatory framework defined by parliament. These 
legislative acts require the government to periodically review 
this framework and to bring before parliament any amendments 
needed to ensure that it remains current and relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to call the attention of the House to the four 
fundamental principles that underpin the legislation and which 
guided the government's decision making on the specific measures 
in the policy paper “Reforming Canada's Financial Services 
Sector”. 
It was released to the public on June 25, 1999, as the 
government's response to the MacKay task force report. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1005"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT2"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT2"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1005
<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first principle is that banks, trust companies, credit 
unions, insurance companies and other financial institutions must 
have the flexibility to adapt to the changing marketplace and to 
compete and thrive, both at home and abroad.  Upholding this 
principle is necessary if the financial sector is to maintain its 
contribution to economic growth and job creation in the face of 
increasing globalization and rapidly changing technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end the bill provides additional flexibility for banks 
and insurance companies to organize themselves under a new 
holding company option that would be available to them, thus 
permitting them to explore opportunities to improve efficiency 
and grow their businesses by reducing the regulatory burden, 
among other things. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, we are raising the limits on widely held ownership of 
financial institutions in order to permit the exchange of 
considerable shares which is required for the conclusion of 
strategic alliances and joint ventures.  This important business 
strategy is becoming increasingly common in other industries and 
ought also to be available to Canada's financial institutions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill substantially expands permitted investments for 
financial institutions and makes these available to both the 
holding company and the parent subsidiary structures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second principle guiding the bill stresses the importance of 
competition.  Specifically, we believe that vibrant competition 
in the financial services sector is necessary to allow consumers 
and businesses alike to benefit from a wide range of choice at 
the best possible price.  With this objective in mind, the 
government is acting to remove unnecessary barriers for a bank 
start-up.  We want to encourage new entrants.  To that end, we 
are lowering the minimum amount of capital required to start a 
bank to $5 million from $10 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also proposing a new three tier, size based ownership 
regime that allows for the single ownership of small banks. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Banks with equity of $1 billion to $5 billion are also allowed 
to be widely held, provided at least 35% of shares are widely 
distributed among the public.  There will, however, be no 
restrictions on the ownership structure of small banks with 
equity of less than $1 billion.  These measures will make it 
possible to increase competitivity in the banking sector and to 
encourage new players. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Large banks with more than $5 billion in equity would continue 
to be widely held.  Furthermore, commercial enterprises would 
also be allowed to establish new banks.  This may be potentially 
attractive to retail companies that already have a network of 
stores or outlets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also includes measures to strengthen credit unions and 
caisses populaires.  It contains measures that could accommodate 
their plans to restructure themselves in a way that reduces 
structural fragmentation and increases efficiency.  It also 
provides the government with the regulatory flexibility to 
respond to new initiatives that may be forthcoming from the 
movement.  The end result could be a stronger and more 
competitive credit union movement in Canada, better placed to 
challenge other financial service providers across the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also propose to open up the Canadian payments system to life 
insurance companies, securities dealers and money market mutual 
funds.  We believe that a broader range of participants in the 
payments system would foster competition because these firms 
would be able to offer services akin to chequing accounts. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, we will implement measures to align access rules for 
foreign banks in Canada with those governing domestic banks, so 
as to provide greater flexibility to foreign banks that wish to 
settle in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All in all, these measures will promote competition in the 
financial services sector, thus contributing to ensuring that 
Canadians get the best possible deal from suppliers of financial 
services.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the House is interested in the third guiding principle 
underpinning this legislation and that is to empower and protect 
consumers of financial services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that end, this bill would provide better access to basic 
services.  It would allow us to specify in regulation what are 
reasonable identification requirements for an individual to open 
a bank account.  The legislation also would provide regulation 
making authority regarding the provision of a low cost account 
and would oblige banks to follow a fair and reasonable process if 
they decide to close a branch. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for low fee retail deposit accounts, memoranda of 
understanding have already been signed by the eight largest 
banks. While such accounts may vary from bank to bank, they must 
all comply with standards that will allow us to ensure that all 
Canadians have access to an account at an affordable price. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also establish two new organizations to promote 
and safeguard consumer interests in the financial sector.  The 
Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, or FCAC, would consolidate 
related functions currently housed in Finance Canada, Industry 
Canada and OSFI.  This agency would uphold the consumer 
protection provisions of our financial institution statutes, 
monitor institutions' compliance with their pledges to 
self-regulate, and provide consumer information and promote 
consumer education about financial services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would also work with financial institutions to 
launch the new Canadian financial services ombudsman.  This 
office would provide an independent, objective and impartial 
third party who would review complaints from individual consumers 
and small business owners who believe that their financial 
institution has treated them unfairly and have not been able to 
resolve these matters with the management of the financial 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we are also mindful that regulations are not without 
cause, which brings me to the fourth and final guiding principle 
underlying this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that our government should initiate improvements to 
the safety and soundness of the sector, but we should also take 
every opportunity to lighten the regulatory burden when we can. 
Bill C-8 would do just that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today seeks to implement a streamlined 
approval system for numerous operations that must be approved by 
the superintendent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also proposing to improve the payments system, to ensure 
that the public participates more fully in the decision making 
process, and to ensure that the standards, regulations and rules 
of the CPA reflect the public interest. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also enhance the powers of the Superintendent of 
Financial Institutions to deal with firms that do not meet the 
regulatory requirements.  It would also bolster the 
superintendent's power to intervene in the affairs of a financial 
institution that is heading for trouble.  This would ensure that 
the prudential safeguards for the financial system are consistent 
with the new reality of stronger competition which we are trying 
to bring about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the measures embodied in the bill we are debating 
today uphold and advance all four of the guiding principles I 
have just enumerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's financial sector has an excellent reputation.  Our 
financial institutions are extremely successful, both at home and 
abroad.  To retain this excellent reputation and to keep our 
financial institutions strong, we need this new policy framework, 
a framework for the future.  We need it because it recognizes the 
change around us, it permits our financial institutions to seize

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again let me say how gratifying 
it is to see so many government members in the House.  We have 
important business to discuss today, as we did yesterday when the 
ranks were a little thin on the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members from all opposition parties attempted to discuss 
important issues, such as the Shawinigate affair and the issue of 
the junior minister of multiculturalism, issues for which the 
Canadian people demand answers, and there was an absence of 
response in the House, to put it kindly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to be here on a Friday to discuss government 
business, such as Bill C-8.  I know you were waiting for me to 
get back to that, Mr. Speaker.  I wish government members, 
including some of the cabinet ministers and the Prime Minister, 
took their roles as seriously as we in the opposition take our 
roles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the presentation made by Parliament Secretary to 
the Minister of Finance earlier.  The Alliance Party will support 
the bill because it would bring Canada's financial institutions 
to a more progressive level. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, since the government took office in 1993 precious 
little, if anything, was done to put Canada further ahead as a 
progressive financial institution country despite calls from the 
official opposition in the 36th parliament.  We have stayed on 
par with countries such as Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has taken the government seven and a half long years to 
realize that one of the most important sectors and pillars of our 
economy is the financial institution sector which includes banks, 
insurance companies, securities companies and credit unions.  The 
progressiveness of this pillar of our economy was lagging behind 
all our global competitors, placing our institutions at a severe 
competitive disadvantage.  Why it took the government so long one 
can only guess, but given its record over the past eight years I 
suppose it was the status quo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance said a 
number of things with which we agree.  However he did talk about 
some things that left us rather confused, considering the motions 
in amendment that were put by the official opposition and that 
were voted down at report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal with statements made by the parliamentary secretary 
and the Prime Minister, as well as those made by his colleagues, 
indicating that the government wants to run its business in a 
very open and transparent fashion so that Canadians, the official 
opposition and other opposition parties can judge how it is 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government did in reference to our amendment was ask 
that the financial consumer agency report to the Standing 
Committee on Finance on a permanent basis.  The committee is part 
of parliament, which includes all opposition parties and 
government members.  That is openness and transparency.  Yet in 
the bill it says that the agency would report to parliament 
through the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who knows me knows that I am not cynical when it comes to 
the government.  What that may mean, though, is that the Minister 
of Finance would allow only what he wants to report to parliament 
out of the reports he gets from the financial consumer agency. 
When it comes to Liberal governments, and the door is opened to 
allow them to withhold certain information that they do not want 
to be made public, we have seen time and time again that they 
have taken every advantage of that opening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A case in point is the current Shawinigate affair.  The ethics 
counsellor, who is supposed to be the watchdog of how cabinet 
conducts its public and private business, reports directly to the 
Prime Minister, the very person who appointed him to the job; in 
other words his boss.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been enough questions raised about this relationship. 
The question of the year and maybe of the century is why would 
Canadians and opposition members sit by when there are questions 
about how the Prime Minister has conducted his private business 
and his so-called blind trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again the Prime Minister has stood up and said 
that the ethics commissioner, the guy that he hired and that he 
authorized in that position, says that he is okay and that 
everything was above board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same situation we have with the financial consumer 
agency where it reports directly to the very person who will be 
appointing them to that position.  There is a bit of a perceived 
conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick:</B>  A master-servant relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Harris:</B>  Yes, as my hon. colleague just said, 
a master-servant relationship.  That is simply not acceptable to 
the official opposition nor to the other opposition parties.  We 
have since 1993 demanded that the government be open and 
transparent.  When the parliamentary secretary talks about the 
openness and transparency in the bill, here is one area in which 
he may be a stranger to the actuality of the relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government voted against the amendment which would have 
allowed that openness and transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary also made a statement saying that it 
was the wish of the government, and it is in Bill C-8, that it 
would lighten the regulatory burden wherever it could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to another amendment that the official opposition put 
forward with regard to the payment system.  The members of the 
payment system said very clearly that they knew there were a set 
of regulations and that they wanted to comply with them, but that 
in the course of doing business, they now and again need to make 
some rule changes to streamline their business in order to give 
better customer service to the people using the system.  They 
said that their association wants to use the most unobtrusive 
method within a framework.  They asked, through the Canadian 
Alliance, for the Minister of Finance to lay out a very clear and 
transparent framework under which they could operate, one that 
would be self-regulating and allow enough flexibility that they 
would not have to report every single rule change as it occurred. 
Having to do that is a regulatory burden that is unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They wanted a clear and defined framework under which they could 
operate, which is what is in the amendment, but the Liberal 
government, despite wanting to lighten the regulatory burden 
however it could, voted that amendment down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last point about the amendments that we put forward deals 
with a statement made by the parliamentary secretary.  He said 
“Credit unions must have the flexibility to compete and thrive 
at home and abroad”.  How coincidental. Credit Union Central and 
members of its association want to have the flexibility to 
compete and thrive at home and abroad but it was not provided for 
in Bill C-8.  We knew how important that was to Credit Union 
Central so we put forward an amendment respecting its wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a government that believes that credit unions must have the 
flexibility to compete and thrive at home and abroad, as the 
parliamentary secretary said, it voted against that amendment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are three distinct areas where the government is saying 
one thing yet doing another.  Far be it for the government to say 
one thing yet do another.  I am hesitant to bring up the red book 
wherein it promised to scrap, kill and get rid of the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will draw a comparison.  During the election the Liberals went 
door to door, doorstep to doorstep, and over fences into 
backyards.  They went to public meetings, to little restaurants 
and coffee shops, and said that they hated the GST.  They hated 
it since the Tory government brought it in, and to show how much 
they hated it, they said that if they were elected they would 
kill that nasty GST.  I know you would have been re-elected in 
any case, Mr. Speaker, because those are words that you never 
uttered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the majority of Canadians believed that promise to 
kill, scrap and abolish the GST and elected a Liberal government 
in 1993.  To their great surprise, the GST was neither scrapped, 
killed nor abolished.  There was a name change, though, in 
Atlantic Canada where it is now blended and called HST. I am 
comparing that to the Liberals' continuing readiness to say one 
thing yet do another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those three areas the parliamentary secretary has been caught 
up in his own words because the bill does not reflect some of the 
things he said.  We now have a bill that will give banks and 
financial institutions an opportunity to become more competitive 
at home and abroad.  It will give them an opportunity to become 
more efficient and flexible in their operations, with the 
exception of the areas I outlined in the amendments the Liberal 
government voted against.  These were amendments members of the 
financial sector wanted put through, but they were voted down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall the bill would allow banks and financial institutions to 
become more competitive, particularly in the global economy.  Due 
to the Liberal government's inaction over eight years, financial 
institutions have lost ground in the global economy. Their 
competitive position has gone down, so I am sure they will 
welcome the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the financial services sector will have this progressive 
bill to allow it to become more competitive, one wonders why the 
Liberals have not addressed some other issues that equally need 
to be recognized as areas where we are lagging behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was reported in the news last night, the outdated medical 
equipment in our hospitals needs to be recognized.  There is even 
talk about health dangers because some of the medical equipment 
is old, outdated, and possibly becoming a danger to patients who 
use it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government embarked on many new spending programs such as: 
the millennium project, fountains, golf courses and any kind of 
vote buying scheme that it could come up with.  It has increased 
spending every year on brand new programs.  It has raised taxes 
every year in the neighbourhood of $3 billion to $7 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet there are areas of our country that are suffering because 
the Liberals have not considered them important enough to make 
them progressive, as they have finally done with Bill C-8 for 
banks and financial institutions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring to the attention of the House the trouble farmers have 
when they go to financial institutions to apply for financing. 
Almost every farmer in Canada has either tried to get financing 
or is considering doing so and is not able to.  They cannot do so 
because their farms are at risk, and their farms are at risk 
because of the government's refusal to help them compete with our 
American neighbours.  U.S. farmers receive all kinds of subsidies 
and assistance because their government recognizes the important 
role agriculture plays in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government has refused to recognize Canada's agricultural 
industry to the same extent that our biggest trading partner does 
with its farmers.  As a result, we are just an imaginary border 
away.  American agricultural products come into Canada and sell 
at lower prices than we can produce them at in Canada.  This is 
because the government has failed to recognize the importance of 
agriculture.  It has failed to recognize the great disadvantage 
our farmers have when competing with our trading partners in the 
United States and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick:</B>  Golf courses are more important 
than farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Harris:</B>  That is right.  The government is 
certainly willing to finance golf courses and hotels and highway 
projects in the maritimes.  One former cabinet minister from Nova 
Scotia built a highway to nowhere for about $30 million.  That 
brought a bit of shame on to the government, but shame does not 
last long with this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One need only look at the current situation with the junior 
minister of multiculturalism who has brought shame, embarrassment 
and dishonour to her office.  The government has not recognized 
that shame, embarrassment or dishonour.  The Prime Minister and 
the Deputy Prime Minister have stood in the House every day and 
said she was sorry and that we on this side should recognize 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said that one of our members had done something and 
apologized and that they had accepted the apology.  However there 
is a difference.  The minister of multiculturalism is still 
sitting in her chair in the role of junior minister after giving 
an unrepentant and half-hearted apology.  Our member for 
Edmonton—Strathcona is sitting in the backbenches after having 
been duly disciplined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I do not like to interrupt the hon. member for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley, but I would like to know the relevance of 
what he is speaking about.  When we started this debate we were 
discussing Bill C-8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The parliamentary secretary is quite right. 
I was seeking to draw the attention of the hon. member for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley to the bill.  I know he has drawn several 
parallels to various things, but this has gone so far off topic I 
am not sure we can get it in parallel any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is a direct 
parallel here.  I was comparing the way the government treats 
farmers to the way it treats financial institutions.  The 
government feels that the way it treats our financial 
institutions is important, and I agree.  However it has forgotten 
about farmers.  It has forgotten about how its lack of interest 
has affected our farmers.  It has no shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are happy that the government has put forward legislation to 
allow banks to develop their holding company structures.  That 
will be progressive. 
We are also happy that we have a competitive, thriving and 
vibrant insurance industry in Canada.  We are happy that the 
government has seen the wisdom of disallowing banks from 
retailing insurance products through their branches.  That day 
may come, but the insurance industry now has a five year window 
to prepare for any impact it might cause.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alliance members also know there is a competitive, vibrant auto 
leasing industry in Canada.  We know that Canadian consumers who 
are considering buying automobiles can get leasing from a number 
of different areas, in some cases down to 0.9%, 0.19%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are happy that the government has seen the wisdom of telling 
banks they cannot retail auto lease products in Canada, and that 
it recognizes the great deal for consumers that now exists in the 
auto leasing business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to keep down the actuarial risk in auto leasing there 
must be good risks to offset people who are not such good risks. 
Overall, one can keep lease rates down and recognize that the 
automobile companies, which produce automobiles and have 
subsidiaries like GMAC, Ford Credit or Chrysler Credit, have an 
interest in selling automobiles.  All that seems to work together 
pretty well to keep interest rates down when it comes to leasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a conflict when we see the government doing something 
pretty good that we can support and then doing all the other 
things that it does.  It makes us wonder who is in charge over 
there.  We can draw many examples.  I can draw one in my own 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 is as very progressive bill.  It will allow one of the 
pillars of our economy to be more competitive globally.  That is 
a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members must ask the question:  If the government can put 
through a bill like this, how can it be so neglectful of other 
important issues?  In my riding of Prince George—Bulkley Valley, 
in Burns Lake, B.C., there is the Burns Lake Indian Band.  The 
band has had an agreement for the last number of years in which 
the village of Burns Lake, which parallels the band, provides 
water and sewer facilities to the band.  For the last seven and a 
half years the band has decided that for some reason it would 
stop paying taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The village of Burns Lake has a very small tax base and to lose 
$150,000 a year in taxes has a big impact.  The federal 
government would not want to lose tax dollars either, as 
evidenced by the paltry tax cuts it has given Canadians. 
However, I digress a bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of a sudden, after seven years of non-payment of taxes, the 
village of Burns Lake said it would cut off the band's water, 
sewer and other services because it was not paying its bill. Hon. 
members would think the department of Indian affairs would be 
concerned about this and try to make up the back taxes and get 
the thing rolling again.  The shutoff date for the band's water, 
sewer, fire protection and emergency services is April 30, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mayor of Burns Lake and his officials were here a few weeks 
ago and I met with them and the minister of Indian affairs.  We 
said that the issue was a problem and we agreed to get an 
independent negotiator to work it out and—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
As we are trying to get a parallel it is only fair that we 
clarify.  We all have a tendency to stand in caucus and say 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member earlier referred to certain commitments that were 
made.  I will quote for the record what the Liberal government 
said, because the member was a bit misleading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I know the hon. member will 
have an opportunity to participate in the debate later.  It 
sounds to me as though he is raising not a point of order but a 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  And he should know better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis:</B>  He should represent the people, the 
facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Different members' views of the facts, 
sometimes of the same facts, are seen through different eyes or 
maybe different glasses.  However the hon. member for Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley has the floor, and if he kept his remarks 
more directly relevant to Bill C-8 perhaps there would be less 
controversy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
attention Liberal members are giving my presentation.  That has 
certainly been lacking in the House over the last few days and as 
a result they lost their position yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After an agreement there is still no negotiator and no extension 
of the services planned.  As we speak, the Liberal government 
and the Indian affairs department know very well that there is a 
full blown infrastructure program on the reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To set up a stand alone system on a temporary basis would cost 
$600,000 or $700,000 plus $60,000 a month to maintain.  That is 
just a temporary system.  The Liberals are looking to embark on a 
permanent system that would cost in the neighbourhood of $4 
million to $7 million over the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this could have been avoided if they had paid the back taxes 
and kept current.  They could have saved themselves about $5 
million over the next five years.  However the government and the 
minister of Indian affairs do not see the wisdom of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy they saw some wisdom in our financial services 
sector.  If the member was wondering when I would get back to 
that, I had to draw that comparison.  There is wisdom in Bill 
C-8.  I know that the banking industry, insurance companies, 
securities companies and the payment system are applauding it to 
a large extent.  It has a lot of deficiencies.  We wish the 
government had been 100% progressive rather than 97%.  The other 
3% represents the three amendments we put forward that the 
government voted down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this has been interesting for Liberal members.  We have 
had a chance to talk about a lot of important issues and I 
appreciate the attention of my Liberal colleagues across the way.

the manner in which the government accessed this money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did it through the issue of special warrants, 
which, according to long established House of Commons procedure

Indeed, the questionable practice does not escape the watchful 
eye of Canada's auditor general, who leaves office tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Desautels has suggested that upon assuming office his 
successor should investigate how the government accessed the 
money without parliamentary approval and whether there is a 
precedent for using special warrants to approve new programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the government's haste to implement the program resulted 
in a significant waste of taxpayer money.  It appears that not 
only were Canadians duped with their own money in last November's 
election but it was accomplished in a highly questionable and 
perhaps unauthorized manner.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

opposite of what the Deputy Prime Minister said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday he evaded a question about the possibility that the 
Prime Minister not only had an interest in the golf course in the 
form of a debt owed on his shares, but also that he had retained 
some of the actual shares not covered by the 1993 note with Jonas 
Prince. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will ask the question again.  Did the Prime Minister or any 
member of his family personally hold any shares in the Grand-Mère 
golf course after November 1, 1993? 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first, the debt is not an interest in the golf course. 
Second, I think the documents are clear.  Neither the Prime 
Minister nor any member of his family held an interest in the 
shares.  They were all sold to Mr. Prince on November 1, 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again the hon. member is letting Canadians down, as is her 
party.  It is failing in its duties as an opposition party by not 
asking questions of interest to Canadians as they affect the 
lives of Canadians in areas like health care, the environment, 
the economy, agriculture and softwood lumber.  She and her party 
ought to go back to dealing with real issues of concern to real 
Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister is clearly 
letting Canadians down by not answering simple questions that 
would clear up an ethical cloud over the Prime Minister's head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's company held 25% of the shares of the 
Grand-Mère Golf Club.  We know that.  Yet the note with Jonas 
Prince clearly refers to only 22% of those shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened to the other 3%?  Did the Prime Minister or a 
member of his family retain, after November 1, 1993, those 3% of 
shares representing an interest in the golf course, yes or no? 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, she has misquoted the agreement of purchase and sale of 
November 1993.  It spoke of approximately 22%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement by which Mr. Prince sold all the shares he had 
acquired from the Prime Minister in November 1993 said that in 
fact he had sold all the shares he had acquired.  There are no

</I></B></P><P align=left>When reference is made to the sales agreement of September 1999, 
the Deputy Prime Minister refers to standard clauses.  Yet there 
is nothing standard about these clauses, because it is the Prime 
Minister and not Jonas Prince, supposed owner of the shares, who 
renounces all interest in the golf club and provides guarantees 
to the new purchaser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Deputy Prime Minister admit that the evidence has been 
provided that the Prime Minister had a financial interest and 
placed himself in a conflict of interest position when he used

<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
is no conflict of interest.  The Prime Minister's shares were 
sold back in November 1993.  When the lawyers prepared the 
documents, they did so prudently.  It is a matter of the 
lawyers' decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the hon. member's own parliamentary leader is the 
one she is attacking with her lack of confidence in asking these

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the documents released this week did not solve anything in the 
Auberge Grand-Mère issue. These documents show that, more than 
six years after the alleged sale of his shares in 1993, the 
Prime Minister got involved again in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a seller gets involved in the resale of his house six years 
after its alleged sale, does it not mean that he still has an 
interest in the property? Is this not the real position in which 
the Prime Minister found himself in 1999, that of a person who 
had an interest in the transaction? 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member is wrong. The Prime Minister did not get involved. 
The shares were sold by Mr. Prince to Mr. Michaud. That is the 
whole story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, another member is showing his lack of trust in the Bloc 
Quebecois leadership by asking such questions. In spite of the 
commitment made by his parliamentary leader, when he asked that 
the bill of sale be tabled, they continue to ask similar 
questions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker,

this one: How can the Prime Minister justify his involvement 
more than six years after the alleged sale of his shares in 
1993, if it is not because he still owned these shares in 1999? 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
again, the Prime Minister did not get involved. He no longer

parliamentary leader of the Bloc Quebecois said “Table the bill 
of sale and we will stop asking questions”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, while Quebec has 
made considerable efforts to meet its objectives for decreased 
greenhouse gas emissions, Canada is dragging its feet, and this 
affects Quebec as well.  Yesterday, the United States decided 
not to ratify the Kyoto protocol, and this too is likely to 
affect Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the beginning of this week, the government keeps on 
telling us it wants to get back to real business.  If this is 
so, can the Minister of the Environment explain his lack of 
reaction to the American decision?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Canada is very seriously pursuing its international 
obligations.  We negotiated with respect to the Kyoto protocol. 
We have been very active in the years since Kyoto in not only 
elaborating upon the international implementation mechanisms but 
taking action at home in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year in the budget of February and the mini budget in 
October we committed $1.1 billion over the next five years, which 
will eliminate 65 megatons of carbon dioxide from our atmosphere.

question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the minister said “We are going to ask them what can 
work for them, if this does not”.  The minister appears to be 
giving up on the Kyoto protocol, while because of our geography 
the American decision will inevitably impact upon Quebec and 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government was serious about wanting to deal with real

member for Windsor—St. Clair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 is really a reincarnation of a bill that was introduced 
in the last parliament and died on the order paper following 
second reading.  It purports to implement 57 measures contained 
in the June 1999 finance policy paper entitled “Reforming 
Canada's Financial Services Sector—A Framework for the Future”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The paper was the finance minister's response to an extensive 
and expensive two year consultation by the MacKay task force on 
reforming Canada's financial services sector.  The consultation 
culminated in the fall of 1998 with a report entitled “Change, 
Challenge and Opportunity”.  There was a subsequent response by 
the Standing Committee on Finance. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the positive aspects of this bill is that it expands the 
access to the payments system, which is one of our long held 
positions in the NDP. This is a measure that increases 
competition by allowing insurance companies to offer chequing

nobody from any other party stood at that time.  I thank you for 
the clarification.

wants to take advantage of the 40 minutes he can, but he cannot 
share his time. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B> Madam Speaker, I will go on with my speech. 
This legislation will help credit unions, designate a financial 
services ombudsman, something the NDP has been asking for for a 
long time, and create a consumer protection agency, that is 
called the financial consumer agency. It will launch a 
consultation process whereby the banks could legally be forced 
to provide a low fee retail deposit account. This is a position 
we have held for a long time in the NDP; however, nothing will 
happen in the short term. The bill will formalize a process of 
collecting data on small business lending but will not expand 
the banks' business powers into the areas of auto leasing. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the positive things in the bill.  There are 
also in the 900 pages many things with which we disagree.  Among 
those negatives is the wide ownership rules which lead to the 
concentration of banking powers in the hands of very few 
individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provides too much power to the Minister of Finance.  Unlike 
parliament, the minister would then have the final say in 
virtually every major change that dealt with financial 
institutions, including mergers, acquisitions, regulations and 
ownership levels.  It also fails to provide a real framework of 
accountability between large financial institutions and their 
local communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no community reinvestment act similar to the one in the 
U.S. which works very well.  There is no effective improvement in 
accessing basic banking services, especially in rural areas. 
There is no right to lifeline, no cost accounting and no 
effective way to stop bank branch closures.  Banks are only 
required to provide a four to six month window of notice to close 
under the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no teeth for the independent banking ombudsman and it 
reduces requirements for small banks.  The Office of the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions has been given more 
powers to deal with the potential for increased risk in the 
system, but there is no guarantee that the OSFI would be able to 
use these powers effectively because of the complex structures 
introduced in the bill, for example bank holdings and new 
ownership regimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing on the control and regulation of high risk 
derivative products and off balance sheet liabilities or on new 
monetary policy tools for the Bank of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have dealt with some of the positives and the negatives.  We 
note as well that it is a highly complex 900 page omnibus bill 
which changes eight major financial industry acts and is probably 
the largest bill ever to come before a Canadian parliament.  Its 
main thrust is to increase competition, foreign and domestic, and 
flexibility through deregulation and re-regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is easing entry requirements in the 
financial services market.  He is purporting to broaden the 
powers of financial institutions including credit unions, 
increasing the flexibility and the complexity of ownership 
regimes, and allowing access to the payment system by non-bank 
entities, for example insurance companies. 
The legislation also creates a financial consumer agency, an 
independent financial ombudsman.

improve access to basic banking services and guidelines for a 
bank merger review process which were made available with the 
bill but are not included in the current version of the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party opposes the bill.  We emphasize that 
there is some support, as I have indicated in my remarks.  We 
support parts of the bill, including the modernization of 
financial services, expansion of powers to credit unions, a 
potentially better deal for consumers, a better competitive 
position for insurance companies, and status quo on the 
distribution of insurance and leasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would support the bill at third reading stage if changes to 
the wide ownership rules were rescinded, if it provided for more 
power to the House of Commons to review megabank mergers and if 
the government adopted an effective framework of accountability 
among banks, their communities and fully regulated bank holding 
groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, there is quasi-unanimity among major financial 
industry players to speed up the passage of the bill which has 
incorporated the majority of the MacKay recommendations and has 
virtually gone through an invisible committee of backroom 
lobbyists.  Bill C-8 is a done deal which the government is 
selling as a progressive financial consumer package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
wonder whether there would be unanimous consent, since the member 
used only 10 minutes of his 40 minute allocation, to allocate the

also has the potential for a significant impact on the 
competitiveness of our financial services sector globally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in an increasingly competitive financial services sector 
that from a global perspective has become hyper competitive. The 
amount of change in the financial services sector in the last 10 
years has been greater than the level of change that has occurred 
in the entire 150 years preceding that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this rapidly changing hyper competitive environment the 
government has dragged its feet since 1993.  It has avoided 
making the necessary updates and improvements to reflect this 
reality and the new realities in the financial services sector. 
There is very little in the legislation that could not have been 
introduced in 1994-95.  Instead, the government used every 
delaying mechanism at its disposal to wait as long as it possibly 
could to introduce the legislation, and that is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, the MacKay report of about a year and a half ago 
provided an extraordinarily comprehensive and well thought out 
long term visionary plan for the financial services sector that 
has been butchered by the government.  It has selectively chosen 
based on political palatability certain elements of the MacKay 
task force to recommend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has chosen to ignore and to turn a blind eye to many of the 
other recommendations which may have been more politically 
contentious but would have contributed significantly to improved 
competitiveness in our financial services sector and to an 
improved environment to create more jobs and opportunities for 
Canadians in this sector.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has treated the MacKay task force like a buffet 
where it could selectively choose from the menu of public policy 
options.  It chose the various options based on political 
criteria, not on economic criteria or on achieving what was best 
for Canadians and the financial services sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has delayed and dithered on this issue for a long 
period of time.  It is with a pinched nose that the PC Party 
supports the legislation because it does not reflect the type of 
measures and policies that we believe would harness the power of 
the financial services sector in Canada.  While it does have some 
of the elements that could help to improve the environment for 
the financial services sector and create greater levels of wealth 
and opportunity for Canadians, it does not go nearly far enough 
in many ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 Canada was ahead of the U.S. in terms of deregulating 
our financial services sector.  Today we have fallen behind the 
U.S.  With the last vestiges of the Glass-Steagall act gone from 
the U.S., American financial services, such as banks and trust 
companies, are better positioned to participate in the 
opportunities of the 21st century than their Canadian 
counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's approach to the financial services sector has 
forced Canadian banks to grow in the U.S. and to limit their 
growth here in Canada.  This is unfortunate because many of the 
jobs and opportunities could be here in Canada.  I fear that the 
government is driving people offshore and limiting opportunities 
within our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a significant amount of lost opportunities in the 
last couple of years.  The last time the issue of bank mergers 
was pursued, the finance minister's response in December 1999 
closed the door to bank mergers.   There was an opportunity for 
dialogue between the banks and parliamentarians, and between the 
banks and people served by the banks about some of the issues of 
concern to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of the finance minister taking opportunity to address 
those concerns in a constructive way by sitting down with the 
banks and negotiating terms that would protect the interests of 
Canadian consumers, borrowers and small business people, he 
slammed the door shut for short term political reasons.  He not 
only denied an opportunity for a more efficient financial 
services sector, he also denied Canadian consumers the 
opportunity to have better, more competitive services well into 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that time, the Bank of Montreal and the Royal Bank agreed 
to several long term commitments which would have given improved 
services to consumers.  These included doubling the amount of 
lending to small businesses and the setting up of a separate bank to 
do that, reducing bank service charges, protecting services to 
smaller communities and increasing staff in branches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of taking advantage of these opportunities on behalf of 
Canadians, the minister, for political reasons, made a 
shortsighted decision.  Part of that was to appease the Liberal 
caucus witch hunt on banks—I am sorry—the Liberal task force on 
banks which constructed the most partisan, poorly written and 
researched, short term document ever in the history of 
parliament. 
Instead, he capitulated to the forces of evil on that side of the 
House with its short term, populist, pandering perspective which 
denied Canadians the long term opportunity of a stronger 
financial services sector and better levels of services to 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals opposite are convenient free marketeers.  It is 
focus group economics on the other side of the House.  It is 
whatever is popular this particular week, or month or year. 
There was a time when those members opposite campaigned 
vociferously against free trade until of course they were 
elected.  At that point they saw the benefits of free trade and 
embraced it.  Some would say the government claimed the invention 
of free trade in the same way that the former vice president of 
the U.S., Al Gore, claimed invention of the Internet.  We also 
saw that with the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be great to be able to go through life unburdened by the 
yoke of principle and consistency.  Fortunately we on this side 
of the House are burdened with the yoke of consistency, principle 
and values that may not always be popular but are consistently 
well thought out and based on sound values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation would give the Canadian government a 
greater level of intrusion and regulation of the financial 
services sector than any other sector or industry in the country. 
The government will say that this growth of regulations is good 
for consumers, but I would argue this would in the long term cost 
Canadian consumers more in the following ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Canadian bank service charges are competitive globally. 
None of us like to pay service charges but the fact is our bank 
service charges are competitive.  In fact they are lower than 
those of American banks.  Sometimes it does make sense for us in 
this place to deal with reality and not simply perceptions when 
we are voting public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, this growth of regulation is going to cost a great deal 
for financial services players to participate in and to comply 
with.  Ultimately those costs will be borne by someone.  Will 
they be borne by shareholders?  Perhaps they will in part.  I 
would argue that ultimately those costs will be borne by 
consumers, the very people who the government is claiming to be 
trying to protect.  Consumers will be paying higher service 
charges in order for the financial services institutions to 
comply with the government's egregious, oppressive levels of 
regulations in this particular area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan:</B>  Egregious and oppressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  I heard the Minister of Justice 
opposite agreeing with my comments and echoing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan:</B>  I did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  I recognize that in a sea of ambition 
over there she may represent a thimble full of principle.  Her 
roots are in Hants county, Nova Scotia.  She and I share similar 
roots.  I guess that is where her sudden regaining of the good 
common sense of people from the Hants shore prevails here today. 
It is great to have her support on my position on this very 
important piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, the legislation and the government's position and 
perspective in dealing with this very important financial 
services sector ignores the seven million Canadians who are 
shareholders in the Canadian banks.  The overwhelming majority of 
adults in Canada today in one way or another, either through 
their pension funds, unions or mutual funds or through direct 
investment, have an ownership in one or more Canadian banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not only denying Canadian bank consumers and 
the financial services sector consumers the opportunity for 
sustainably competitive services, it is also shackling investors 
in Canadian financial services entities with a regulatory burden 
that is unacceptable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says that it is very important that we regulate 
and ensure there is a low cost account provided to Canadians, and 
force the banks to provide services to Canadians regardless of 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In theory nobody would argue with what the government is trying 
to achieve in that sense.  If the government is going to actually 
embrace this from an ideological perspective, the logical 
corollary of this argument would be that the next step for the 
government would be to regulate the food companies.  That is 
Loblaws, Sobey's, et cetera, should have to introduce a new low 
cost food provision service to Canadian consumers regardless of 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, because of the fact that the government is 
forcing Canadian financial services institutions to provide 
services to Canadians regardless of their ability to pay, it is 
only logical to expect the next step will be that the government 
is going to be forcing Canadian grocery distributors and stores 
to provide food to Canadians regardless of their ability to pay. 
Surely food or the availability of food is more important to 
individual Canadians than simply the ability to obtain financial 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shelter is very important too.  I would fully expect that the 
government is going to be introducing legislation in the coming 
months to force real estate developers to provide free apartments 
to people, regardless of income, because clearly the government 
determines that that is in its best interest based on this 
legislation, if we look at it from a logical perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to go along this route and abdicate any free 
market principles that we may still have left, perhaps we should 
start at the top with a crown agency.  Canada Post should be 
giving away free stamps to people if they do not happen to have 
the amount of money required to buy a package of stamps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the government is going in the wrong direction on this 
piece of legislation in many areas from the regulatory 
perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being the case we recognize some of the positive elements 
of this legislation, including the ability for greater 
flexibility in the financial services sector and greater 
opportunities for our Canadian financial services players to 
compete and grow.  We would like to see those opportunities for 
jobs to be created and for shareholder value to grow for 
Canadians.  We would like to see more of those opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the government in this hodgepodge legislation, 
this buffet style of picking and choosing from those 
comprehensive reports like the MacKay report and focusing on the 
politically palatable while ignoring any long term consistency or 
vision from an industrial strategy perspective for the country, 
is giving us a piece of legislation that we will be supporting 
with pinched nose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Minister of Justice agrees with me on this.  I know 
she as well would like to see a more competitive, stronger 
financial services sector in the 21st century, and not one 
shackled by the Liberal incompetence in this very important part 
of the Canadian economy.

perhaps a confused view of the role of government in protecting 
the rights of people who deal with banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He used an analogy of grocery stores and people who own 
apartment buildings being forced to provide facilities.  If I am 
not mistaken, the legislation does not address that question with 
respect to the low cost accounts.  It does not state a specific 
amount.  It simply says that the bank shall provide a low cost 
account for people who have limited financial means.  He has 
perhaps to some degree not fairly represented the purpose of the 
statement that was put in the bill in this particular regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he care to clarify that and perhaps correct his small 
error?

the word irony in the dictionary and at the same time to look up 
the word humour as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the legislation provides an unprecedented 
opportunity for the Canadian government to intrude in a private 
sector environment and tell financial services players what to 
charge for various services.  My point is, which I would expect 
the hon. member would agree with in a more whimsical moment, that 
it is analogous and comparable to telling grocery stores what to 
charge for their produce or telling real estate developers in 
private settings what to do.  There is no difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan:</B>  Hogwash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  I hear again more support from the 
Minister of Justice opposite on my point, and I thank her.  The 
fact is banks are not a utility.  That is the first thing we have 
to realize.  When governments start telling private entities what 
to charge for products and services, it is embarking upon a very 
slippery slope.  I do not think it bodes well for the future of 
the free market in the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I must rise in response to 
some of the things that I have heard my hon. colleague say here 
this afternoon.  He has accused the government, I think “of an 
oppressive regulatory regime”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to explain to us what he means by 
suggesting there is an oppressive regulatory regime in the 
country as it relates to financial services?  Is the hon. member 
suggesting that there should be no regulation in the name of the 
public good of financial institutions?  If so, I would ask him to 
stand in the House and tell the Canadian public who use those 
financial institutions that he does not support regulation 
thereof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the hon. 
minister's question and her continued support.  She mentions 
oppressive regulatory burden, and I think that is the key.  That 
is what I am going to be focusing on in my response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give her another example of oppressive regulatory burden 
from the government.  That is a gun registration that does not in 
any way protect Canadians in their homes or elsewhere.  It in 
fact adds an immense amount of costs to the Canadian taxpayers' 
burden and at the same time treats law-abiding citizens in this 
country of ours as if they are criminals, and yet does not 
provide any level of protection.  That is a position that I am sure 
she would like to speak further on and try to defend, but one 
cannot defend the untenable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member talks about helping rural communities, I would 
remind her of what I, the member for Kings—Hants, did on behalf 
of people in Kennetcook in working with the credit union to 
ensure there continued to be banking services after the Bank of 
Nova Scotia closed its branch there.  That is the type of 
progressive and co-operative effort that I would urge her to 
engage in with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure she would appreciate the comparison of the banks' 
oppressive, egregious regulatory burden with that of her own 
department with Bill C-68.  I am certain she would see that this 
is a fair comparison because in fact the government, that party, 
believes in big government telling Canadians how to run their 
lives.  My party believes in Canadians' ability to run their own 
lives and make their own decisions.

this question.  I know he has looked at Bill C-8 quite 
extensively.  He knows the government has been talking the talk 
about giving more flexibility to the credit union movement in 
Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member give us his opinion on why the government 
voted down a very key amendment which would have provided this 
flexibility to credit unions in Canada in spite of the fact the 
government has talked about its wish to make this more flexible? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  I, at committee, and our party, in the House, 
did support that amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government talks about wanting to encourage 
competition, to encourage the credit unions and the co-operative 
movement to compete more fully with banks, this is only a 
half-hearted initiative by the government to enable the credit 
unions and co-operative movement to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental tenet of the co-operative movement is very 
different from that of the banks.  There is a democratic 
cornerstone to the co-operative movement that is not reflected in 
the government's failure to support that very important 
amendment, which would allow credit unions and the co-operative 
movement to compete more fully and at the same time not have to 
betray the principles of democratic management which have been a 
tenet of the co-operative movement since its inception in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that it was a significant mistake for the 
government not to support the credit union and co-operative 
movement more fully by recognizing the importance of that 
movement and allowing and in fact supporting that amendment which 
would have made a huge difference in a realistic sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have to rise again 
to respond to what I can only describe as the outrageous response 
to my earlier question.  In fact, I think what we see is why the 
hon. member's party and other parties are destined to stay in 
opposition for a very long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As opposed to dealing with and responding to my legitimate 
question about his outlandish assertions regarding oppressive 
regulation, what does he do?  He attacks a program committed to 
public safety, a program that derives support from well over 75% 
of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member to get his head out of the sand and 
respond to my earlier question.  Does he or does he not support 
reasonable regulation in the financial services sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to thank 
the minister for her question.  She is a pretty good questioner 
and I hope she is practising, because in four years she will have 
an opportunity to be asking members, including some of us here, 
questions more regularly, although she will have to hone her 
questions significantly to less than 30 seconds.

again.  I would like to caution hon. members about impugning 
motives in terms of questions and answers.  The hon. member for 
Kings—Hants still has 49 seconds to answer the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do thank the minister 
for her question.  It is interesting, and perhaps unprecedented 
in this parliament, to have members of the government looking for 
answers to questions, because we have been trying to get answers 
to questions on some very important fundamental issues and the 
government has not provided us with any answers on these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister mentioned regulations again.  I think it is 
important to get back to Bill C-68, the gun legislation that is 
costing the Canadian taxpayers now upward of $1 billion that 
could be going into health care, that could be providing rural 
services, that could provide the money to—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a great pleasure to take part today 
at third reading stage in the debate on Bill C-8, an act to 
establish the financial consumer agency of Canada and to amend 
certain acts in relation to financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have before the House is a major piece of legislation 
concerning the overall structure of the banking system in Canada 
and all the operations of our financial institutions. 
This bill deserves our full attention. It is the result of a lot 
of hard work that started when the Minister of Finance announced 
the mandate and membership of the Task Force on the Future of 
the Canadian Financial Services Sector on December 18, 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is the result of an extensive consultation process. We 
finally have a bill we find acceptable after making significant 
representations and winning on a number of points concerning the 
implementation of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill deals with major issues such as the banking sector. It 
deals with changes to the rules governing bank ownership, with 
bank holding companies and with the whole issue of foreign 
banks. 
With globalization, deregulation and new developments, it was 
important to review the bill. This is what this legislation does 
in a major way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Bloc Quebecois had major concerns regarding the 
treatment of banks with assets of less than $5 billion. We have 
one of those in Quebec: the National Bank. It may not be the 
biggest bank in Canada but it is the biggest one in Quebec. We 
wanted to ensure it would be adequately protected under the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first version of the bill, introduced before the election, 
contained no provisions to this effect. I believe our 
representations helped, since we were opposed to Bill C-8 which 
gave 
the Minister of Finance too much power over the future of banks. 
In the first bill, there was no guarantee that he would take 
into consideration the specificity of Quebec's financial system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve rose to say that we wished 
there were in this bill important additional provisions 
allowing community reinvestment by the banks. The United States 
has such legislation, and it has yielded interesting results. 
We do not have this type of adjustment. People living in regions 
have seen in recent years a reduction of the number of bank 
branches. We have noticed that the services provided to 
customers, namely credit services, are not always those we 
should expect from a competitive system. We would have liked the 
bill to provide for greater competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After several representations, in particular by my colleague the 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, who kept a close eye on the 
federal government, the finance minister and the parliamentary 
secretary with respect to this issue, the government established 
guidelines on the reclassification of the banks previously 
listed in schedule I with an equity capital of less than $5 
billion. This is the case of the National Bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have liked to see these guidelines in the bill. At 
least, they now exist. They have been published by the 
Department of Finance and will have to be taken into 
consideration when decisions are made about the ownership of 
this type of bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under these guidelines, the Minister of Finance may reclassify 
such banks in restricted ownership categories. The guidelines 
set out the framework for the review of transactions requiring 
reclassification. 
A certain number of factors are identified, which will have to 
be taken into consideration by the minister when he has to make 
a decision following a transaction dealing with the ownership of 
a bank.

proposal would be analysed. Consideration would also be given to 
the impact of protecting the proposed transaction on the 
security and soundness of the bank, on direct and indirect 
employment, on the location of the centre of decision making and 
management of the bank, on the needs of consumers, on the 
business and activities of the bank and on the future prospects 
of the bank in world markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, there are a series of criteria which will oblige 
the Minister of Finance to consider all these issues when making 
his decision. 
This means that the people working at the National Bank, its 
owners and shareholders, will have to ensure that these 
guidelines are observed because Quebecers want this bank to 
continue to serve Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of transactions the Minister of Finance will have 
to ask questions to determine whether there is sufficient 
protection for direct and indirect employment and where the 
bank's centre of decision making and management is located. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, I will digress for a moment.  Our arguments 
have also contributed to a debate within the National Bank, 
which has adopted administrative rules to protect itself against 
a hostile takeover, a takeover not wanted by its shareholders. 
These people took a stand on this issue and on the issue of the 
bank's head office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, in this respect, not only through Bill C-8 but also 
through the way the bank has responded to adopt a responsible 
attitude, it now seems to us that the necessary protections are 
there to protect this type of bank and particularly the 
National Bank in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other major criteria that are particularly a cause 
for concern for me and that the minister will have to consider 
when he determines the value of the transaction, is the 
interests of Canadians and, when the institution is operating 
mainly in a region, the interests of the people in the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what the word region means to the federal government. 
Usually, it means Ontario, Quebec, western Canada or the 
Atlantic. 
In this regard, it will have to consider the interests of the 
people of Quebec, if ever there were a transaction relating to 
the National Bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wish this had been included in the legislation, instead of 
being covered simply by guidelines, since we do not know who the 
finance minister will be in a few years. We do not know what 
pressure he will be under. We know the value and the strength of 
lobbies here in Ottawa, particularly in terms of our funding 
rules. This allows for very strong lobbies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, we have seen banks make very large contributions, 
especially to traditional parties. We hope that through these 
guidelines the bill, once enacted, will provide adequate 
protection to small and medium size banks within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, this is major legislation because it deals 
not only with the banks but also with all other financial 
institutions. As concerns the protection of savers and 
investors, this bill contains interesting features. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have proposed many amendments but they have not been 
selected. I want to put them on the record so that people will 
know that the Bloc Quebecois took to heart the protection of 
their interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say a word later about community reinvestment. In the 
last parliament my colleague for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve 
introduced a bill on community reinvestment, and he also tried 
to have the content of his bill included in Bill C-8. 
Unfortunately, the government refused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is always room for improvement and I am sure my 
colleague, with his great tenacity, will find other ways to 
ensure that financial institutions assume their social 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear about the profits our banks make throughout Canada, 
I think we should look at what they do and see whether financial 
benefits in the regions where they operate are high enough. In 
the same vein, I think we should legislate in order to have the 
power to make an assessment of the situation and to require of 
the banks that they correct the problems, or perhaps establish 
criteria, a code of conduct or procedures that would go beyond 
what exists now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bank branches have disappeared year after year in my area. 
Having made a lot of money with our people for 
many years, when they do not meet the levels of profitability 
demanded by the shareholders, not because they are in deficit 
but because they are not meeting the levels of profitability 
anymore, the banks get rid of their staff, their facilities and 
their branches. This is always hard on the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we want to negotiate a loan for a small or medium size 
business at the regional level, it is always better to talk to 
somebody we know, somebody who understands our business. 
I do not think that we can say that we are really happy with the 
Canadian banking system in that respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go back to the proposed amendments. For example, we 
suggested limiting the number of boards a director is allowed to 
sit on at any one time. The House certainly understands from the terms 
of this amendment that we want to ensure, in all logic, that 
power and financial decision making capacity is not excessively 
concentrated in the hands of a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were also talking about an amendment on the suppression of 
potential conflicts of interests between board members and those 
who supply goods and services to the institution. This is also 
self-explanatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments also provided for the requirement to submit financial 
statements for review and discussion during the annual 
shareholders' meeting. 
Hon. members know that the banks' small shareholders are more 
and more interested in having a say in decision making.  They do 
not want to just sign proxy letters; they want to be able to 
influence decisions, even if they are only minority 
shareholders.  We want them to be able to have a voice.  The 
purpose of this amendment was to enhance their powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also talk of making shareholder presentations for 
approval of the officers' remuneration policy. 
This too is in line with the banks' social vocation.  When we 
heard of inordinately high salaries being paid to people who may 
have generated substantial financial profits, but did so at the 
expense of the bank workers, with more than 1,000, 2,000 or 
5,000 jobs cut to maximize profits, while officers were getting 
considerable salary increases, we figured it would be extremely 
appropriate to bring in an amendment.  It did not make its way 
into the bill however.  There was one but it was rejected.  We 
feel it ought to have been part of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also talk of proposing a code of procedure for 
shareholders' meetings, a requirement for companies to make a 
full report of each and every shareholders' meeting to be sent 
to each shareholder, all with a view to improving the 
transparency of the banking system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these amendments would have made this bill even better 
and given it more transparency.  They were rejected, and the way 
it was done strikes us as improper.  We do not question the 
pertinence of the bill, but the amendments would have made it possible 
to make the bill a more significant one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say a bit more about community investment. 
It is based on the banks' social responsibility to the 
community.  It is still not a part of C-8, despite the comments 
by the Bloc and, as I was saying earlier, the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He proposed important objectives for the bill, including having 
the banks analyze their operations, their systems, their rules 
and their practices and measure the spread between deposits and 
loans to designated persons in a given community. This way one 
can see the economic impact a bank has on a community, its 
relevance, and assess whether it has fulfilled its social role 
and table a report on the remedial action to be taken.  The 
superintendent of financial institutions should have been 
required to propose assessment criteria to promote 
implementation of the concept of community reinvestment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is therefore a positive contribution that could have been 
made to the bill but that the government rejected.  It still 
seems relevant to us but unfortunately it was rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind members of something my colleague from 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve said: “There are whole communities where 
banks are pointedly absent and, when they are present, there is 
a real problem of availability of banking services for low 
income individuals that only the passage of legislation will 
correct”.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate him on his very accurate view of what goes on 
throughout Quebec.  The member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve is from 
an urban centre, where the problem of people with limited 
incomes accessing banking services must certainly be an issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This quote shows as well that he is informed on the situation 
throughout Quebec, in the regions, and that a member from the 
Montreal area can be very much aware of the situation throughout 
Quebec.  This quote reflects that.  This is what I was saying 
earlier.  In Quebec, the problem is often one of not finding 
bank branches any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that Bill C-8 will at least solve the competition problem 
to provide for good competition and adequate services in our 
regions. However, it will not solve the issue of community 
reinvestment because the government refused to act on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, we could say that market forces do not support 
economic growth. The community is less competitive when there 
are community disinvestment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, a community where investment ceases to flow is a 
community where there is no capital movement. When capital 
movement slows down because banks invest the money from the 
checking and saving accounts of the people in other regions, the 
population of the affected community loses out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall, the bill will change and update the banking system and 
all the other financial institutions. I think that it includes 
many positive aspects. It results from relatively broad 
consultations. We had major concerns regarding the protection of 
banks like the National Bank, but thanks to our pressing 
demands, the Minister of Finances produced guidelines to protect 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though they are not included in the bill, these guidelines 
represent an improvement that will ensure an adequate level of 
protection. We also think that the banks themselves can take 
steps to improve the situation. 
However, we think that the government could have taken this 
opportunity to make the administration of banks and the 
functioning of boards of directors more transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are sorry that these amendments were rejected. We are also 
sorry that our amendments on community investment were not 
accepted. However, we believe that overall it is a good piece 
of legislation which deserves our support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When proposed 
measures seem positive the Bloc Quebecois is happy to support 
them. In the last parliament I think that we, in the Bloc 
Quebecois, were the ones who most often supported the 
government when we deemed it appropriate to do so. We know how 
to address the real issues people are faced with in their 
everyday lives. When we disagree, we say so, hoping to find 
interesting solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To end the week on a bill such as this one is a lot more 
interesting than the general attitude shown by the Liberal 
government this week. For example, we had to set the record 
straight on Thursday. During statements by members the member 
for Laval East said that we had not spoken about the vast police 
offensive against criminal biker gangs when the previous day, 
the same day the police operation was carried out, the member 
for Berthier—Montcalm had made a statement on that very subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the Liberal majority is not paying much attention 
to the debates, as evidenced by the fact that yesterday 
afternoon, throughout oral question period, the majority kept 
telling us that the opposition was not interested in the real 
issues, that its only concern was the Auberge Grand-Mère. 
Half an hour later, when the question was put on a motion, the 
Liberal majority was unable to find enough members to ensure 
continuation of House proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I am concerned, this clearly demonstrates how 
irresponsible the Liberal majority is. We taught them a good 
lesson. Even from the opposition side, the Bloc Quebecois can 
address the real issues like the integrity of the Prime 
Minister. We are also able to consider any other problem coming 
our way, and we do so. We make representations. We make our 
points forcefully. We believe the House of Commons should be 
taken seriously, should hold real debates.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I think we should conclude consideration of Bill C-8 
this afternoon. It will give some sense to the House business. I 
hope Liberal members will go home this weekend and acknowledge 
that they made a serious mistake in believing that they could 
determine for the House of Commons what the important issues 
are. However, I think that the people of Quebec and of Canada 
need to be sure that their Prime Minister is honest but also 
that other problems are being dealt with. So I hope the 
Liberals have learned their lesson for the week.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Yves Roy (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I heard 
my colleague from Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques 
talking about community reinvestment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my region and my riding, we have just experienced the closing 
of two branches of a major financial institution in two 
important centres, Matane and Amqui. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him a question on a point that I am very 
interested in, because these two regions are going through a 
crisis at this time. What happens when a financial institution 
leaves a town with bank accounts, with depositors' money, and 
transfers this money to another town? What does it mean for a 
town to lose a significant amount of money, a lot of capital, 
when it is already in a difficult financial situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my colleague to elaborate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I am happy that the hon. member 
for Matapédia—Matane is actually giving us a very specific 
example of the reality I was describing in my speech. Matane and 
Amqui are small towns, and when a number of jobs are lost 
because a bank branch is closed, there is a major impact. In a 
large city, this could translate into the loss of hundreds of 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the solution was to be found partly in the proposal of 
the hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. He wanted to ensure 
control of community reinvestment by banks. I believe this could 
have been an objective of this bill. It could have led to an 
interesting solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also hope that Bill C-8 once passed will allow greater 
competition in the banking system, thus forcing banks to finally 
have more respect for their clients. 
I would also challenge people as shareholders, as bank clients, 
not to be afraid of making representations to see where their 
capital is going and how it is used, to really be actors more 
than spectators, in the development of the financial situation 
in their region.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
in our caucus and in the House, the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques is an asset. He 
makes a brilliant contribution to our debates. I hope the 
Minister of Justice has understood these recommendations, and 
that she also understands what I am saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two questions for my colleague. Does he think it is 
possible that the pattern of lack of banking services in Canada 
is a reflection of the geographic distribution of poverty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very disappointed with the Chair, Madam Speaker, but not 
with you in particular. I am very disappointed that my 
amendments, which had been accepted previously, have not been 
accepted this time. Some day, in fact, we should discuss with 
the Chair about the excessive role given to traditions from the 
United Kingdom. But that is another matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague agree with me that as parliamentarians we 
cannot really fight poverty if we do not secure access to 
financial services for all Canadians? I am sure that in Alberta, 
where the Minister of Justice was re-elected with a comfortable 
majority, banks are also closing some branches.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this morning, I tabled an antipoverty bill, which brings me 
to my second point. I hope we will be able to count on the 
support of the Minister of Justice—who is spending a lot of time 
in the gymnasium with me—to amend the role of the Canadian Human 
Rights Commission and to recognize that social condition must be 
included in the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague believe that including “social condition” as a 
prohibited ground of discrimination could make a difference for 
the poor in this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the unanimous consent of the House, the justice minister 
could be given two minutes to answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Bakopanos):</B> I am sorry, I believe the 
question was for the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to the 
question from my colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve.  There is 
indeed a direct connection between the presence of banks and 
economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should perhaps hearken back to what happened in the early 
20th century.  Mr. Desjardins, a former clerk of the House, came 
to the realization that small investors had no way of maximizing 
their savings, and this led to the creation of the Dejardins 
movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its creation was prompted by the inability of the banking system 
of the day to meet the needs of small investors, people with 
only a small amount of capital.  Now, in the early days of 
another century, the solution to the problem lies perhaps in the 
proposal we have made relating to community reinvestment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have not managed to convince the Liberal majority to 
include this in the bill, the banking system might perhaps 
develop a code for itself, to show the public that they can 
achieve the same result on their own.  I have some doubts that 
this would be something it will impose on itself.  I think the 
hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve needs to continue his 
action, to continue to call for legislation to be put in place. 
Nevertheless, I call upon those in charge of the banking system 
to do it for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the second question, on making social condition one of 
the grounds for discrimination prohibited the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission, this strikes me as a good approach to ensure a solid 
foundation which any subsequent legislation will have to take 
into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we saw with the human rights charter and with basic documents 
of that type, this can have an impact. Sometimes it suits our 
needs and sometimes it does not. If the suggestion of the hon. 
member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve was implemented, we as a society 
would ultimately benefit. Social condition is an important issue 
that deserves to be taken into consideration to ensure that it 
is not an accepted grounds of discrimination, but rather 
something that drives us to amend the legislation and provide 
equal opportunities to everyone in our society.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have worked extensively with the credit union movement 
in Windsor and across Ontario.  Looking at the legislation I 
cannot help but wonder if more could have been done to facilitate 
the development of the credit union movement outside Quebec in a 
way that mirrors the success the Desjardins movement has had in 
that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could my hon. friend from the Bloc suggest improvements to the 
legislation that would help the credit union movement across 
Canada duplicate the successes that have occurred in Quebec with 
that movement?

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, the Desjardins movement is 
indeed a very good example of how to provide adequate services 
to people, through co-op or credit unions, as they exist in other 
regions of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would invite the hon. member to take a look at the relevant 
legislation prepared by the Quebec National Assembly. For years 
now, this legislation has allowed the Desjardins movement to 
develop, to become increasingly competitive and to face the bank 
network; thus helping to create a better balance between the 
financial interests that govern the banking world and the more 
social or personnel interests of community groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us, the Desjardins movement is a good policy insurance. 
Again, the hon. member should take a look at the legislation, 
and he should also meet officials from Desjardins to help them 
improve their contacts with co-operatives in the other provinces, 
so that all Canadians can benefit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am both pleased and somewhat distressed to speak on 
the bill today.  The reason I am distressed is that after a long 
week of sleep deprivation I am not my usual bubbly self.  I am 
struggling with a sore throat and other things.  I feel sorry for 
myself and I am sure the Speaker does too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are dealing with Bill C-8.  I have estimated that to 
read the bill would take 15 hours.  If one were to read it with 
meaning, in other words read it to understand what is going on 
and actually verify some of its claims, it would take many more 
hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a huge undertaking for us today to go through Bill C-8, an 
act to establish the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada.  The 
bill would basically set up the way financial institutions in the 
country are run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On balance I support the bill, although I definitely have 
concerns.  Ever since 1992 when the then Conservative government 
changed the rules for banks, there has been a need for revisions 
and for our banking sector to, if I can use the phrase, get with 
the times and be able to compete in the international market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a sense the bill is much overdue.  The government moved very 
slowly in that regard.  To make matters worse, in June 2000, not 
quite a year ago, the government introduced Bill C-38 in first 
reading.  The bill then sat there and the government basically 
did nothing about it.  It did not call for a debate on the bill in the 
House.  It was a very slow process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, to our chagrin, there was a totally unnecessary election 
in the fall which caused a great number of bills to drop off the 
order paper.  The bills were enveloped into nothingness with the 
call of the election.  The election was called for only one 
purpose, and that was a political purpose.  The business of the 
country and helping our financial institutions with a new bill 
took a secondary position to the Prime Minister's overriding goal 
of getting yet another mandate.  That seems to be so important to 
the Liberals, hanging on to power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In retrospect we see that it was a good strategy, politically 
speaking.  It is very much in keeping with a cartoon I saw in 
which the Prime Minister is shown reading a newspaper that says 
“Liberals have overwhelming third majority government”.  The 
Prime Minister is saying to the people reading the cartoon “That 
is the best $200 million of your money that I ever spent”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incredible that the government could drop all the business 
of the country and hold an unnecessary election one and a half 
years early, an election which cost the taxpayer $200 million and 
was conducted strictly and totally for political reasons.  The 
Prime Minister wanted to win and did not care what it cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill along with many others was dropped and has now been 
resumed.  It is interesting that Bill C-38 became with a few 
technical changes Bill C-8.  If I wanted to reluctantly 
compliment the government I would thank it for bringing the bill 
back to the House with some urgency and allowing us to debate the 
issues in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previous speakers, including my colleague from Prince 
George—Bulkley Valley, have spent quite a bit of time talking 
about the structure that is involved.  It comes under the broad 
topic of having a bank we can trust.  I really think that is 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From my life experience and from having been on 
the finance committee studying this bill and other issues, it is 
my view that 
Canada is richly blessed with a financial system that is strong 
and trustworthy in the big picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, we do not have a great deal of fear about our 
banks collapsing or about financial transactions not being 
completed in a timely fashion.  As a matter of fact, and I do not 
believe this should be addressed in legislation, we should have a 
website where people can post their complaints about the banks 
for everyone in the country to see, unfiltered by the press. That 
would give huge accountability to the banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament I receive complaints, not many but 
some, about the banks.  It says something about our post office 
that these days I receive more complaints about the banks than 
about the post office.  Neither type of complaint is huge in 
number, although some are of significance to the people who visit 
their members of parliament on an issue.  However by and large 
our banks are trustworthy and we can count on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a banking system in which we can conduct financial 
transactions and know that everything will work 
clickety-clickety-click.  It is all very smooth.  It is a well 
structured organization.  That is due to the combined efforts of 
the Bank of Canada, which has been well run during the last 
number of years, and the individual banks that have taken their 
responsibilities very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the banks if any of them happen to be 
listening.  If I get a cash advance on a Friday it is posted 
within two seconds, but if I make a payment on that same advance 
I do not get the credit until the next banking day.  Sometimes it 
takes two days if it is a weekend.  I wonder why that is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks should be consistent.  If I bring a cheque to the bank 
I know it has the capability of cashing it and doing the 
electronic transaction immediately.—

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>HEPATITIS AWARENESS MONTH ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK200">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP)</B> moved that Bill C-243, an act to provide for a 
Hepatitis Awareness Month, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure after three 
and a half years of researching, studying and working with 
activists to finally bring the bill for debate before the House 
of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to thank the following people for their tireless efforts 
in promoting hepatitis awareness throughout Canada and the world. 
Mr. Bruce DeVenne and Mr. Neil van Deusen of Nova Scotia have 
been tireless in their efforts to bring an understanding of the 
effects of the disease to parliamentarians and to all Canadians. 
I also thank Mr. Joey Haché from Ottawa who is one of the bravest 
young men I have ever met and the House of Commons has ever met. 
Joey and his father, Joe Haché, are with us today and we thank 
them very much for coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joey Haché has been very effective in raising the profile of 
hepatitis throughout the country on his bicycle tour across 
Canada.   He has sent numerous e-mails and faxes to high schools 
and school groups advising children about the terrible effects of 
hepatitis and how it can be prevented. The House and the country 
owe young Joey a debt of gratitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also thank the hon. Pat Binns, premier of Prince Edward 
Island.  Through the efforts of young Joey Haché and myself to 
bring this issue to the attention of Mr. Binns, he and the 
legislature, without further ado, moved an enactment to make the 
month of May hepatitis awareness month in P.E.I.  We are now 
trying to do that in the entire country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have breast cancer month, cancer awareness month and various 
months that are designated to bring awareness to the population 
as a whole.  Hepatitis is a disease that is serious enough that 
parliamentarians at all levels and of all political stripes 
should do what they can to raise its awareness so that people 
will not be inflicted with it as they go through life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now give more information about hepatitis.  There are 
seven forms of hepatitis in the world today.  Canada's first 
nations are at the highest risk of contracting hepatitis either 
through blood contact, sexual contact or, what is most 
frightening, drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows what happened in Walkerton.  Had the people of 
Walkerton been aware that they may contract hepatitis through 
their drinking water, the fear would have been even greater. 
Everyone is concerned about contracting hepatitis from drinking 
water, from sexual contact or from blood contact.  Seven 
different forms of hepatitis can be contracted through these 
means.  It is estimated that almost half a billion people in the 
world today may have one form of hepatitis or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I began the debate on hepatitis three and a half years ago, 
my neighbour came over and told me that she had hepatitis.  When 
I lived in the Yukon, some personal friends of mine called me and 
said that they had hepatitis.  It makes me wonder how many other 
people in Canada have it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that over 700,000 Canadians are inflicted with 
one form of hepatitis or another.  It is one of the most widely 
spread diseases and yet it is very rarely debated or talked 
about, except for hepatitis C which has been discussed at great 
length, not only in parliament but throughout the country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there are six other forms of hepatitis.  What is 
frightening is the number of people who have hepatitis.  There 
are approximately 50,000 people who are unaware that they have 
hepatitis.  Some people find out when they go to their doctor for 
a blood check or medical treatment.  It is very frightening that 
over 50,000 Canadians are unaware that they may have hepatitis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not asking the government for any money or to stop all 
the business of the nation and just concentrate on this one 
issue.  We are asking to make the month of May hepatitis 
awareness month and proclaim it through the House of Commons. 
That is not very difficult.  The reason is that it is only 
through education and awareness that the disease will stop being 
spread as easily as it is now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all the things we do in life, awareness of a particular 
disease and education about the particular disease are extremely 
beneficial to unsuspecting people throughout Canada and the 
world.  There are about six billion people on the planet and half 
a billion of them have one form of hepatitis or another.  It is 
spreading because many people are basically ignorant of the 
disease itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely frightening.  Some people find their daily lives 
hardened by this terrible disease, hepatitis C or the other 
forms.  They really have to struggle.  I consider myself 
extremely healthy.  By the grace of God, I am very lucky because 
I do not have a disease like that.  Nor do any of my family 
members.  However I cannot help thinking about the over 700,000 
Canadians who do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the previous parliament I passed around the bill and received 
100 signatures in one day.  I had over 60 members on the 
government side sign the bill willingly because they knew people 
who have hepatitis in their ridings.  The official opposition 
signed it willingly, as well as the Bloc, the Conservatives and 
ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not a political motive.  We are not discussing this issue 
because of politics.  We are discussing it so that all 
parliamentarians can say to the nation that we recognize 
hepatitis is a terrible disease and thus will make the month of 
May hepatitis awareness month, just the same way we do with 
breast cancer month in October. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not a person in the House, either elected or working, 
who is not proud to wear the pink ribbon for breast cancer.  We 
all know some women and we all have a mother in our lives.  Some 
of us are fortunate to be married to a lovely woman like I am.  I 
have two beautiful daughters and I am very concerned about them 
ever getting breast cancer, so the attention we pay to it is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern out there is hepatitis, and that is why I bring 
it forward.  Many people over the years have contacted me through 
the e-mail system or knocked on my door and said that they have 
hepatitis.  They ask me what they can do to promote awareness and 
education in terms of this terrible disease.  I tell them to 
contact their members of parliament and their members of the 
legislature or house of assembly, wherever the case may be.  I 
ask them to tell their counsellors, neighbours, doctors or anyone 
they speak to in order to get the idea across that hepatitis can 
be easily transmitted through blood, sexual contact or drinking 
water.  Everybody should know about the effects of this terrible 
disease.  Maybe then we can stop it from spreading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too late for the over 700,000 Canadians who have it now. 
It will be too late for the over 50,000 Canadians who do not 
suspect they have it.  However through awareness and education we 
can eradicate this disease.  I have been an optimistic person all 
my life and we have the technology to help eradicate this 
disease.  Several drugs companies have contacted me and said that 
they would like to help to assist in eradicating this disease. 
They would like to disseminate promotional materials throughout 
the country 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government to assist in terms of proclaiming the month 
of May hepatitis awareness month. 
If we do that it will show Canadians that we recognize hepatitis 
is a terrible disease, especially after what happened yesterday. 
I am just as guilty as anyone for entering into the fray and for 
showing Canadians how silly parliamentarians can be sometimes.  I 
apologize to my constituents and to the House for my own 
behaviour.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a chance to put that behind us and to move forward.  We 
can say to those people who are inflicted with hepatitis that 
this House of parliament has a heart.  It does care and we can 
proclaim the month of May hepatitis awareness month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the bill is not votable as I have to wait my turn 
and it was not made votable.  I welcome comments from fellow 
colleagues at the conclusion of my remarks and I hope to make the 
bill votable.  I will be moving that motion at the end of the 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank colleagues who have come to me and discussed this issue 
with me, especially the former health critic for the Alliance who 
is extremely aware that this disease is very frightening.  All 
members are aware of what we can do by educating people to be 
more aware of this terrible disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was Mr. Bruce DeVenne of Lower Sackville, one of my 
constituents, who brought it to my attention.  He came to me, not 
in a panic, a rush or condemning me or anyone else, but to 
educate me.  I cannot thank him enough for that.  Mr. DeVenne, 
Mr. van Deusen and Mr. Joe Haché have diplomatically shown me 
that there are ways we can work together to put political 
differences aside and move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I even thank the hon. Mike Harris, premier of Ontario, who 
addressed this issue very quickly.  I thank the other provincial 
premiers who addressed the issue as well, but we need to do more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite simple.  If we can make the month of May hepatitis 
awareness month, then quite possibly we can eradicate disease in 
the near future.  We have to think of the children because if we 
do this for them then we can give them a better life and a world 
free of diseases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that sounds holistic and it may not happen.  The 
government has been active in terms of financial contributions to 
the department of health.  It has been working on one form of 
hepatitis, but we need to go a bit further and it does not cost 
any money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All it takes is for members to stand and say that they support 
the bill and that they will make May hepatitis awareness month. 
Then we can tell Joe Haché, Neil van Deusen, Bruce DeVenne, their 
families and friends, and those 700,000 Canadians who have the 
disease that we recognize they have a terrible disease.  We can 
tell them that education and awareness is the way to go and we as 
parliamentarians will do what we can to assist them in trying to 
eradicate this disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been over three and a half years since I first introduced 
the bill.  Many members have signed the bill to make it votable 
and to move it forward.  I will ask again at the end of the 
debate to make the bill votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome remarks from my colleagues in this non-political 
debate.  If we do this we will be doing a world of good for over 
700,000 Canadians who are afflicted with hepatitis. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I take this opportunity to 
speak about the important issue of hepatitis.  I commend the hon. 
member for Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore for his 
efforts to declare the month of May hepatitis awareness month.  I 
support the principle behind the bill notwithstanding that it has 
been deemed not votable.  I am sure all members appreciate the 
value of various awareness months. 
All hon. members would agree that awareness months raise the 
profile of a particular issue and thus public education 
opportunities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Greater awareness about hepatitis will help to create a 
compassionate and caring public environment for those infected or 
affected by this disease. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree entirely with the member who said that awareness months 
for different causes or illnesses are a very effective way of 
raising public awareness on those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to talk about some particular aspects of 
hepatitis. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver, mostly 
caused by one of the five viruses called virus A, B, C, D and E. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was noted that about 90% of acute hepatitis cases in Canada 
are caused by viruses A, B or C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hepatitis A can cause a liver inflammation, which can become 
serious but is mild in most cases and disappears fairly rapidly. 
This inflammation is propagated by contamination of hands, food 
and water. This is why the virus spreads more easily in areas 
where sanitary conditions are poor. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike hepatitis A, hepatitis B is not spread by contaminated 
food or water.  In Canada, as in western Europe and the U.S., 
the majority of infections are acquired during young adulthood by 
injection drug use and sexual activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although acute hepatitis B continues to be an important clinical 
problem in Canada, the majority of acute cases will clear 
spontaneously.  Chronic infection accounts for the greatest 
burden of disease.  There are an estimated 250,000 persons who 
have chronic hepatitis B infection in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take the rest of my time to talk about hepatitis 
C and the initiatives taken by Health Canada to deal with this 
serious public health problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hepatitis C is a virus that can be transmitted by blood; it 
infects the liver and can cause serious damage. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although some people may experience symptoms such as fatigue and 
jaundice, many others have no symptoms following initial 
infection.  The hepatitis C virus progresses slowly in the body. 
Symptoms can take 20 to 30 years to appear after initial 
infection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, the federal government, specifically Health 
Canada, committed $50 million over five years in September 1998 
to develop and design a prevention, support and research program 
for Canadians living with hepatitis C. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, over the next 20 years, the government will transfer 
$300 million to provincial and territorial governments so that 
they provide these people with the medical care they need. That 
financial assistance will ensure that no Canadian, wherever he 
or she may live, has to pay for the health care and treatment 
required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hepatitis C program encompasses support for health care and 
treatment. This component is aimed at increasing awareness about 
hepatitis C by providing a better understanding of this disease 
and the related risk factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prevention and community support are also components of the 
prevention, support and research program for Canadians living 
with hepatitis C. 
The community support component includes dozens of programs, 
hundreds of initiatives aimed at supporting both a strong 
community response to the needs of persons infected or affected 
by hepatitis C and a substantial role for community 
organizations involved in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the program supports targeted projects aimed at 
preventing transmission of hepatitis C to people not currently 
infected, particularly those with a high risk level, especially 
injection drug users and young people, for whom risks are high. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This component has funded 27 research projects and 11 training 
and salary awards through the Canadian Institutes of Health 
Research and has contributed toward the endowed research chair in 
liver diseases at the University of Manitoba health sciences 
centre foundation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada already supports the Canadian Liver Foundation 
declaration of “Help Fight Liver Disease Month” for the month 
of March.  Hepatitis C is one of the viruses that can cause liver 
disease, and Health Canada is a major sponsor of the first 
Canadian conference on hepatitis C which will be held in Montreal 
in May 2001. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Hemophilia Society, the Hepatitis C Society of 
Canada, the Canadian Liver Foundation<B> </B>and other non-profit 
organizations all work in co-operation with Health Canada to 
ensure that this conference will be beneficial for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, members will no doubt have realized that the 
cause of hepatitis in general, and of hepatitis C in particular, 
is among the first priorities of Health Canada and of this 
government. The government devotes much attention to this 
disease and its various forms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wish to congratulate the member for Sackville—Musquodoboit 
Valley—Eastern Shore for having taken the initiative, over the 
years and again now, to promote this bill and hence this 
debate, which will have helped once again, at least I hope, to 
focus public attention on the risks of this terrible disease and 
on the damage it can cause.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-243, 
an act to provide for a Hepatitis Awareness Month, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

C-243.  I appreciated the remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Health today.  I hope his remarks mean that he 
will support my colleague's motion to make this item votable so 
that we can get on with the job of increasing awareness of 
hepatitis and all the problems it can cause.  It is a preventable 
disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Awareness is very important if we are to get to prevention.  As 
my colleague mentioned, we have with us today Joey Haché and his 
dad Joe.  We acknowledge the work of members of the Hepatitis C 
Society, including the Hachés who have worked tirelessly and put 
a great deal of their own money, time and credibility into moving 
forward public awareness of this very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been pointed out, hepatitis is preventable, but 
prevention hinges on education and education brings awareness. 
That is why my colleague has been asking that May be designated 
hepatitis awareness month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a non-partisan issue.  It touches any family, any 
Canadian.  We need to work together to try to address the 
situation.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people are not aware of the great deal of information about 
hepatitis.  For example, there are a number of kinds of 
hepatitis: hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.  We know 
about hepatitis C particularly, but a lot of people do not know 
that there are also hepatitis D, E, F and G. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that chronic viral hepatitis in the 
United States, and we assume the figures are somewhat comparable 
here, represents the 10th most common cause of death. We are 
talking about a very big issue for Canadians and one which is 
appropriate for us to address in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hepatitis A can occur from contaminated water or foods being 
ingested.  It can also be passed from person to person and from 
hand to mouth.  That is why the kind of education that would take 
place in an awareness campaign such as my colleague is proposing 
would make people aware of these dangers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hepatitis A can also result from poor housing, poor water 
supplies and sewage treatment.  These are major factors in 
periodic outbreaks of hepatitis A.  Again that is why we need 
awareness.  Then the public and legislators would be more aware 
of the need to deal with the issues of water safety, housing 
quality and poor sewage treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If our citizens are not made aware of the ramifications of some 
of these issues and some of these public policy matters, they 
cannot apply the kinds of demand and pressure that provide checks 
and balances in our system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Minister of Health it is likely that 
considerably more than 100,000 Canadians have chronic hepatitis 
B.  That is also a big issue for Canadians.  We also have the 
situation with hepatitis C, which is passed on by the unsafe use 
of needles especially in drug use and to people who receive blood 
transfusions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 donor screening for hepatitis C began.  However, as we 
know and as we have talked about at some length in the House, 
there was a real problem with innocent Canadians becoming 
contaminated through blood transfusions that were not properly 
screened.  Had we had the kind of awareness campaign my colleague 
is proposing, there would have been a great deal more knowledge 
that could have prevented some of the tragedies we have been 
talking about in the House and for which the government is being 
asked to compensate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health also pointed out in his public documents 
that the cumulative burden of hepatitis C was large and its 
future societal and medical costs were likely to be high.  This 
is another reason all of us should care very much about the 
hepatitis problem.  The cost to society, to our families, and the 
demand on our medical system are high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People with hepatitis C are at risk of consequences such as 
profound fatigue.  At least half the people with hepatitis C 
experience profound fatigue.  Some 25% experience sclerosis of 
the liver and liver cancer after having the disease for a number 
of years.  Liver disease is related to hepatitis C infection and 
is the leading reason for liver transplantation in Canada.  This 
is another costly procedure that could be prevented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have hepatitis D.  Although 90% of active hepatitis 
cases are A, B and C, there are others.  Hepatitis D tends to 
enhance the frequency and severity of the symptoms of 
hepatitis B.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Hepatitis E is often transmitted through contaminated water, and 
although it is not a huge problem here, it is both endemic and at 
times epidemic in the developing world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More awareness can help us provide the assistance and the aid to 
people in other parts of the world, which could save a lot of 
lives and a lot of human misery.  There is no specific treatment 
for hepatitis E.  Again, prevention is very important.  There is 
only a handful of hepatitis F cases, but again, it is a part of 
the disease of which we need to become more aware. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hepatitis G is another uncertain phenomenon.  There is 
uncertainty about risk factors.  There is uncertainty about means 
of prevention.  Its transmission through blood transfusion has 
been documented.  We also know there is an increase in the 
prevalence of hepatitis G among groups that have frequent 
exposure to blood and blood products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of aspects of this disease of which most 
people are not aware, and that awareness can be a key to 
prevention and to taking proper steps to deal with this disease 
and this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, we have had so many concerns about people with 
hepatitis C, which is the most common form of hepatitis.  We need 
to be aware of the cost to society.  When people have hepatitis C 
they have a very difficult time not only earning a living but 
getting the kind of insurance they need to protect their 
families, such as mortgage, life and medical insurance.  It is 
very debilitating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also is something that is not properly provided for in our 
health care system.  For example, in the Atlantic provinces there 
is a real shortage of trained medical personnel.  There is money 
allocated for only one hepatologist in an area where there are 
12,000 people infected with hepatitis, one doctor who has a 
specialty in a disease that affects 12,000 people in only one 
part of our country, the Atlantic provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of other examples of funding shortages.  If 
members of the public were aware of the need for better treatment 
and a better emphasis on prevention, these issues could be dealt 
with.  I support my colleague's bill to declare May hepatitis 
awareness month and I urge the House to support it as well. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to start by congratulating my colleague on his 
excellent initiative. I understand this is the second time he has 
tried to raise our awareness of this issue through the means 
available to him, namely a private member's bill. Should he ask 
for unanimous consent for his bill to be deemed votable, 
therefore allowing the debate to continue in the House, he will 
have the support of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been the Bloc Quebecois health critic for three years 
now. I was appointed during the Krever inquiry. 
I believe it should be recognized that Quebecers and Canadians 
were made aware of hepatitis C, among others, through the Krever 
inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we must reflect on the importance of an awareness month. 
It is not simply an academic exercise when we have an awareness 
week, month or day, or when parliamentarians want to declare an 
awareness month just as we have World AIDS Day. Earlier the 
parliamentary secretary reminded us that there is also a liver 
disease awareness day and a cancer awareness day. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1405"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just academic, since an awareness day, we hope, will 
lead people in the various communities in Quebec and Canada not 
only to discover the various forms of hepatitis but to work 
together to support those who have the disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been pointed out that there are various types of it.  I 
think we are more familiar with hepatitis C, which is transmitted 
by body fluids, by the blood.  We are more familiar with 
hepatitis C, of course, because of what happened in Canada's 
blood supply in the early 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first recommendation of the Krever Commission was that there 
be a no fault compensation package.  A person with hepatitis C 
may have contracted it not only because of what they have done 
but through circumstances over which they had absolutely no 
control, such as in the case of a blood transfusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the person receiving the transfusion is not responsible for 
anything other than for needing a transfusion, for needing blood 
at one time or another in their life, we do not understand why 
the compensation package is not universal.  However, different 
types of hepatitis are transmitted in different ways, and in 
these cases, prevention is necessary.  This is the case with 
food, water and certain health conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there were awareness days and programs, if the media got 
involved, if people in the various communities mobilized to get 
this information out, we as parliamentarians are betting that 
the more people are informed, the less they will be at risk. 
This was what we counted on in the early 1980s, when acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome, better known as AIDS, was first 
discovered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I well recall how, in the early 1980s, the various forms of 
AIDS, its side effects and methods of transmission, were 
unknown. There were international conferences. Canada hosted 
two: one in Montreal, in 1992, and the other in Vancouver, in 1996. 
Once again, awareness is needed, because awareness leads not 
only to less risky behaviour, but also to the reflex that is 
necessary in a certain number of cases of transmission of 
hepatitis C, where one can be a carrier without knowing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House was reminded earlier that there are 700,000 Canadians 
with hepatitis C; this is also the figure I had.  It is 
staggering.  This means that hepatitis, particularly hepatitis C, 
is the 10th most frequent cause of death.  There is also 
another reality which governments face and for which awareness 
is important.  That reality is that there are close to 50,000 
Canadians who, as we speak, are perhaps at work, perhaps playing 
sports, are perhaps in a classroom, in a park or with their 
parents or friends, and who do not know that they have hepatitis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why governments must support any initiative that will 
promote awareness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technology is changing. There are more 
sophisticated technologies that help to track these people. If 
my information is correct, the Government of Canada announced in 
1999 or in 2000 that $300 million would be provided in the next 
years to help track, through the blood banks and the hospitals, 
people who have had blood transfusions.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments must implement mechanisms for reaching people and 
tracking those who, at some stage in the medical chain, may have 
had access to blood products and may be carriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, there is no point in panicking, in thinking 
that the blood system is not safe. I remind members that the 
Krever commission, in its report, had come to the conclusion, 
after the various corrective measures it had proposed were 
taken, that right now, in Canada, there is one chance in a 
million that a blood product is not safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada and in Quebec, we have a very safe system of blood 
transfusion, supply, collection and distribution. But as a 
physician reminded us, there is always some danger associated 
with a blood transfusion just as there is with an operation. 
However, statistics show that the blood supply and distribution 
system in Canada is just as safe an anywhere else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, community awareness can be increased. The example set by 
young Joey Haché is quite something. Members will surely agree 
with me that it took a lot of courage to cycle across Canada and 
visit every community along the way. This young man, still a 
minor, represented our best hope and gave us our most solid and 
real example of how community awareness and support can be 
increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we not be asking ourselves if someone in the House will 
continue the remarkable work started by Joey. In a sense, our 
colleague, the hon. member for Sackville—Musquodoboit 
Valley—Eastern Shore, is asking us to complete the work started 
by Joey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite proud that I was able to remember the whole name of the 
member's riding. It is more complicated than 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. What our colleague is asking us to do is 
to continue the work started by Joey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I hope that this bill will be made votable and that 
we will be able to increase community awareness and support, 
because that is where our best hope lies. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is a real pleasure to support the bill brought forward by my 
colleague from the NDP, the member for Sackville—Musquodoboit 
Valley—Eastern Shore, a beautiful area of Nova Scotia that I 
visit quite often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to congratulate him on his initiative in bringing forward 
this bill and I wish to congratulate individuals such as Joey 
Haché and his father, who have shown great initiative in this 
field.  I look forward to their visit to Newfoundland.  Hopefully 
we can join the hon. member and spend some time there in the near 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of hepatitis is certainly not a new one for our party. 
I would like to remind the House that the Conservative Party was 
the leader on this issue in November 1997 when the member for New 
Brunswick Southwest raised the issue and debated it for quite 
some time, as members are aware.  The file is now carried by our 
health critic, the member for Richmond—Arthabaska. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in our party are proud and pleased to join in supporting the 
bill, which creates an awareness month for a disease that so many 
of our friends and neighbours have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my remarks I will try to concentrate on hepatitis C.  We have 
been told today that there are many types of hepatitis, but 
hepatitis C is perhaps what has initiated this bill and is the 
type that most concerns us. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1415"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major concerns we have, despite the agreement of 
support on the government side, is the government's slowness in 
reacting to the needs of people affected by hepatitis.  People 
are affected by the government's inability to recognize that many 
people are outside the four year time frame, from 1986 to 1990.  The 
government should assume responsibility for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the health committee is doing a very good job of moving 
the file forward, all those people who were not involved in 
the positive side of the government decision are again facing, as 
many people have pointed out, great hardships in their lives. 
Perhaps the government should expand that file and recognize the 
people who are outside the minuscule time frame that it has set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us have friends and relatives affected by different 
diseases.  We recognize the pressures on them, on their families, 
on the communities which quite often support them, on the 
agencies that are directly and indirectly involved and on the 
country generally.  If a disease limits our ability to be a 
contributing partner in society or within our own families and 
despite the fact that while we are contributors the costs of 
trying to deal with our afflictions are above and beyond what we 
can master ourselves, then the rest of society is involved and 
has a major concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the country is all about.  That is what 
confederation is all about.  The rich provinces help the poor 
provinces, the pendulum swings every now and then and those who 
were helped find themselves the healthy ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same way in society.  Many of the people affected by 
diseases, especially a disease like hepatitis C, are some of the 
strongest willed individuals.  They show us through their 
determination how to fight such afflictions and are important 
players in society.  It is an example to the rest of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should recognize that and look for avenues where 
this should take place, not continue to look for ways of 
escapism. The word escapism as it relates to hepatitis C should 
not be a word used by government or by any of us.  The government 
should recognize the fact that people need assistance, they 
deserve assistance and it should be there to help them.  Not only 
should the government be there to help but to help expeditiously. 
That is a word the government does not recognize either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people have waited too long for too little.  Unfortunately, 
the amounts that were set aside to help them have eroded through 
the process, whether it be through the legal process or just by 
dragging it out.  Let us concentrate on the fact that there is a 
major problem and people are being affected by that.  The needs 
and the wants are there.  As a government, let us fulfil our 
responsibilities, move up to the plate and address it quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wish the best for those who are involved in this initiative. 
I say to my hon. colleague that we certainly support the bill. We 
support his call to make it votable, and hopefully in turn we 
will see government do its part also. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, first, I wish to thank all my 
hon. colleagues who spoke on this important initiative which I 
brought forward on behalf of many people throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will allow the words of Joey Haché to speak through me to the 
House. 
He said that awareness equals prevention.  That can save lives, 
and as parliamentarians we have an obligation to all Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joey Haché is a young man fighting a terrible disease.  He knows 
it is too late for him.  However he is trying to get some good 
out of the disease by saying to people throughout the country, 
especially to teens his own age and kids who are younger, that 
the disease can be prevented and that it can, with hope, love and 
optimism, be eradicated.  However that cannot happen unless there 
is awareness, education and prevention.  That is all we are 
asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members have spoken about the various issues, and I am sure 
we can all relate not only to hepatitis but to other diseases as 
well.  We implore the government to look into itself and to 
understand that this is not a political or monetary issue but an 
issue of love, caring and sharing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is especially true for the sectors of our society which are 
most at risk.  These include aboriginal people in coastal and 
rural communities without proper water and sewer facilities, poor 
people, and the functionally illiterate who are unaware of the 
dangers.  It is our responsibility to let them know this disease 
is out there.  Again, as young Joey Haché would say, if we can 
make them aware of it we can prevent it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not take up much more of the time of the House.  If I 
could get on both knees to ask this I would, but I would be 
hidden under the desk.  I ask for unanimous consent to make the 
month of May hepatitis awareness month.  If that were made 
votable and passed on to the health committee, I would be forever 
in debt to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  The House has heard 
the suggestion of the hon. member.  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  The time provided for 
the consideration of private members' business has now expired. 
As the motion has not been designated a votable item, it is 
dropped from the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 2.23 p.m., the House stands adjourned until Monday next 
at 11 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
