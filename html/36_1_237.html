Bill C-518, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (deduction of

areas of double taxation in this country, where we pay taxes on 
taxes.

<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have double 
delight in presenting a petition today because the very first 
name on it is the name of my daughter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is a parent who chooses to be a full time mom, who is 
discriminated against by our Income Tax Act.  Her family has to 
pay more taxes because of the choice that she makes to stay at 
home with our two wonderful grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to present this petition on behalf of some 60 
voters from Regina, Saskatchewan.  She got all of those people to 
sign this petition and I am very pleased to present it today to 
call for fairness in taxation for those families who choose to 
have one parent stay at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to indicate 
to the Chair that it is my belief that either reading the names 
into the record of those signing a petition or saying whether an 
MP agrees with the petition he is tabling have both been ruled 
out of order countless times by the Speaker in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I was listening to the hon. member 
for Elk Island and, while he sounded sympathetic, I do not 
believe he expressed his support or otherwise for the petition. 
Had he done so he would have been properly admonished by the 
Chair as the government House leader knows because the Chair does 
tend to admonish members who do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, I think the hon. member for Elk Island did 
slightly step over the line in saying who had signed the 
petition.  Normally the names of the petitioners are not 
revealed.  However, in the circumstances, since it was his 
daughter, the Chair overlooked it.  The government House leader 
is quite correct in pointing out that it is not proper to read 
the names of the petitioners into the record.  Had the member for 
Elk Island named anyone else, the Chair would have admonished him 
and rebuked him properly for this breach of the rules.

financial institutions.

<A NAME="LINK24">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House recognize that there is significant public concern 
in British Columbia with respect to how modern treaties and Aboriginal 
self-government initiatives may affect individual rights, including 
Aboriginal people; and given the recent controversies, such as the Musqueam 
Leaseholders controversy and the Kamloops Indian Band's intention to ban 
trade unions, this House urge the Government of Canada to refer the Nisga'a 
Treaty Agreement to the Supreme Court of Canada and ask for a judicial 
ruling clarifying: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) whether the terms of the Nisga'a Final Agreement constitute 
an amendment to Canada's Constitution, and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) whether the self-government provisions of the agreement could 
be used to usurp, diminish or subrogate the individual rights of 
Nisga'a people as defined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And, further, that all activity leading to the introduction of 
legislation to ratify the Nisga'a Final Agreement in the House of 
Commons be held in abeyance pending judicial clarification.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I think you would find consent for the following motion: 
<A NAME="LINK25">&nbsp;</A>

</I></B></P><P align=left>That at the conclusion of the present debate on today's 
Opposition Motion, all questions necessary to dispose of this 
motion be deemed put, a recorded division deemed requested and 
deferred until the expiry of time provided for Government Orders 
Tuesday, June 8, 1999.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. deputy government whip 
have the unanimous consent of the House to propose this motion?

honour to rise to speak to this motion today and to apprise the 
House of the seriousness of the nature of this motion and why 
Reform has advanced it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to say that after 130 years of waiting this 
should be a great time of celebration for the Nisga'a people.  It 
should be a time of putting history behind us, for the Nisga'a 
people to put their history behind them and to step forward with 
the new arrangement with the Government of Canada and the 
province of British Columbia.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This treaty is also the source of much controversy in British 
Columbia because both the provincial government and the federal 
government have not bothered to listen to the people of British 
Columbia and the other people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact there is another modern treaty in British 
Columbia known as the Sechelt agreement.  It is very instructive 
to note that the Sechelt agreement does not generate nearly the 
same controversy as the Nisga'a agreement because of the 
self-government provisions in the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1987 the Sechelt people entered into a self-government 
arrangement with the province of British Columbia and the federal 
government.  It was done through an act of legislation, but it is 
specifically not included as an aboriginal right within section 
35 of the constitution.  Therefore it is not protected by the 
constitution.  It is not a constitutionalized third order of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty, or the Nisga'a final agreement as it is 
known, is primarily a self-government deal.  This is interesting 
when we take it against the backdrop of other treaties, the 
numbered treaties as they are called or the historical treaties, 
because those treaties are not about self-government at all. They 
are about the exchange of land, resources, cash consideration and 
other considerations in return for the surrender of lands for the 
benefit of all Canadians.  That is the history of the numbered 
treaties in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty is not about that.  It is primarily a 
self-government arrangement.  It is a relatively new initiative, 
this self-government initiative.  The concept of it has been 
around for about two decades now.   It came to flower in the 
Charlottetown accord in 1992.  It was one of the five key 
components of the Charlottetown accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada, and I might add the people of British 
Columbia, defeated the Charlottetown accord.  In British 
Columbia, members might be interested to know, it was defeated by 
almost 70%.  It is also instructive to note that aboriginal 
people in British Columbia defeated it at about the same 
percentage level.  This was not an aboriginal-non-aboriginal 
divergence of views.  This was a common view that was held in 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of Canada's most pre-eminent scholars or experts on the 
constitution, a man who was well known to this side of the House, 
had some very instructive points to make about the Charlottetown 
accord and about the aboriginal governance provisions in that 
accord in 1992 in a speech to Cité Libre in Montreal, and that 
man was Pierre Elliott Trudeau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He warned of the dangers of unfettered aboriginal 
self-government where there was no provision for charter rights 
for aboriginal people and where there would be such a division of 
powers between governments and the creation of a new third order 
of government that we would eventually end up with a chaotic 
system of governance right across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a man who was leader of the Liberal Party for almost 
two decades.  Whether or not people on this side of the House 
agreed with all of his policies, we certainly respected his 
ability to understand, discern and speak about the constitution. 
He made that his life's work.  He was a professor of law and a 
constitutional expert before he ever became a parliamentarian and 
before he became prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the defeat of the Charlottetown accord we would think that 
the Liberals and other political parties in Canada would have 
understood that Canadians did not agree with this concept because 
they specifically voted no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not get it.  It immediately adopted an 
inherent right policy.  It was in its red book.  Everybody 
remembers the infamous red book in 1993: 200 pages of small print 
that very few Canadians actually ever read.  The Liberals have 
used that red book to justify an inherent right policy.  That 
inherent right policy means that it has adopted a policy of 
recognizing an aboriginal inherent right to self-government. 
Until Nisga'a came along we really did not know what it meant.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall writing letters to the Minister of Justice and the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development back in 1993, 
1994 and 1995 asking what was meant.  We never got an answer.  We 
got a bunch of mumbo-jumbo, airy-fairy, pie in the sky motherhood 
answers, but we did not get a specific answer as to what they had 
in mind.  Now we see it in the Nisga'a agreement and what we see 
goes against the express wishes of Canadians including aboriginal 
people from coast to coast and for what they voted in 1992 on the 
Charlottetown accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to get into some of the specifics.  The federal and 
provincial governments in the Nisga'a treaty have agreed to cede 
legislative authority in at least 14 specific areas for all 
times.  I remind the House that the Supreme Court of Canada in 
1950 in the Lord Nelson Hotel case had the following to say about 
the division of powers in Canada's constitution vis-à-vis 
legislative authority of the provincial and federal governments. 
I quote Chief Justice Rinfret: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliament of Canada and the Legislatures of the several 
Provinces are sovereign within their sphere defined by the 
British North America Act, but none of them has the unlimited 
capacity of an individual.  They can exercise only the 
legislative powers respectively given to them by sections 91 and 
92 of the Act, and these powers must be found in either of these 
sections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constitution of Canada does not belong either to Parliament, 
or to the Legislatures; it belongs to the country and it is there 
that the citizens of the country will find the protection of the 
rights to which they are entitled. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chief Justice Kerwin further wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British North America Act divides legislative jurisdiction 
between the Parliament of Canada and the Legislatures of the 
Provinces and there is no way in which these bodies may agree to 
a different division...To permit such an agreement would be 
inserting into the Act a power that is certainly not stated and 
one that should not be inferred. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada's ruling, which was unanimous and 
unequivocal, says one order of government could neither give away 
to nor receive from another order of government its rights and 
jurisdictions as defined under sections 91 and 92 of the 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government did not consult Canadians on this matter. 
It did once in 1992 but it did not listen to the answer. British 
Columbia as a result of the federal government's unilateral 
decision has agreed to give up this legislative jurisdiction and 
authority, going precisely against what the Supreme Court of 
Canada said in 1950 in the Lord Nelson Hotel case that it was not 
permitted to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does this affect real people on the ground in British 
Columbia and in the rest of Canada?  This will have implications. 
This will reverberate back and forth across the country before 
all is said and done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The charter rights of Nisga'a people have been put in peril as a 
result.  Even though it says in the agreement that the charter 
applies, it also says in the charter when speaking about rights 
and freedom, that the guarantee shall not be construed as to 
abrogate or derogate from any aboriginal treaty or other rights 
or freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By constitutionalizing the self-government arrangements the 
government has made the Nisga'a treaty an aboriginal right.  It 
has therefore put the aboriginal right ahead of the charter 
rights of Nisga'a individuals.  There is no doubt about that 
whatsoever and there will be profound implications for Nisga'a 
people down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be talking about this subject more today, but our 
concern is the unconstitutional initiative the government has 
taken against the Supreme Court of Canada ruling in 1950 and the 
diminishing of the charter rights of Nisga'a people.

that we have not listened to or consulted people.

of Skeena?  How will he respond to their belief that this is a 
good treaty?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the hon. member talked to the mayor and the council of the 
city of Terrace who, I would note, made a particular week in 
April Nisga'a appreciation week in honour of the Nisga'a treaty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has he talked to the 133 businesses in his riding that support 
the Nisga'a treaty?  In fact they made financial contributions to 
the latest general assembly of the Nisga'a.  Has he listened to 
those people?  If he has, how will he respond to them when they 
strongly support the Nisga'a treaty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the minister asks if I have 
talked to the Nisga'a people.  Yes, I have talked to the Nisga'a 
people on many occasions.  It might interest the minister to know 
that Chief Joe Gosnell and I had a two hour televised debate on 
treaty making back in 1996, I believe it was.  It was carried all 
across northern British Columbia.  I have also talked to many 
small business people in my community.  As a matter of fact I am 
talking to them all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point something out for the minister's benefit.  She 
seems to think that Nisga'a people are a homogeneous group who 
all think the same way and all want the same things.  She should 
recognize that 40% of the Nisga'a people did not support this 
agreement.  Sixty per cent is hardly a big mandate to proceed 
forward with this kind of treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also asked about the support of the mayor of 
Terrace.  In our community we recognize that the mayor of Terrace 
is a good Liberal.  We would expect that he would fall into line 
and support whatever the minister and the government come up 
with.  That is hardly a surprise.

Alice was right: things get curiouser and curiouser here in 
Wonderland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the resolution introduced by the Reform Party and I 
must say it is a conversion of faith in the supreme court that is 
worthy of the conversion of Paul on the road to Damascus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been in the House for two years.  I have been on the 
justice committee for two years.  Repeatedly members of the 
Reform Party have said that parliament is supreme.  They have 
repeatedly criticized applications to the supreme court allowing 
the judiciary to interpret the charter of rights.  Here they are 
today quoting the former prime minister and leader of the Liberal 
Party as a constitutional expert. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the resolution today signal a profound change of direction 
on the part of members of the Reform Party and indicate faith in 
the judiciary of the supreme court and its interpretation of 
proposed laws and laws that come before parliament, or have they 
abandoned their idea that parliament is supreme? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to note 
that this government and the government before it deferred to the 
Supreme Court of Canada every time.  When the Supreme Court of 
Canada comes out with a ruling we know that the government will 
not have the backbone to use the notwithstanding clause or to 
take firm action to protect individual rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this instance we are not asking the Supreme Court of Canada 
to chart us into uncharted territory in terms of social policy or 
anything else, which is our primary concern with the courts.  We 
are asking it for a judicial interpretation of the charter of 
rights vis-à-vis the collective aboriginal rights the Nisga'a 
people will have in advance of this treaty being implemented. 
Then the Nisga'a people and other Canadians will know how the 
Supreme Court of Canada views that potential conflict.  No doubt 
there will be conflict.  We would like to know now and we think 
it is the responsible thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also like to have the supreme court's interpretation of 
whether this is even a constitutional agreement.  There are four 
separate legal challenges in British Columbia right now.  Three 
of them speak to the very heart of the issue of whether or not 
this agreement is even constitutional.  How can the government be 
responsible and proceed until it has the supreme court's ruling 
on that very critical issue?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my hon. colleague from Skeena just spoke quite eloquently about 
the history and the potential consequences of the Nisga'a treaty. 
I would like to take this opportunity to address how the 
government has shut Canadians out of the treaty process with the 
Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. minister just mentioned how she feels she has talked 
long and hard and consulted with everyone.  I certainly beg to 
differ. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion the Nisga'a Treaty has been a disaster from the 
outset. The federal government, along with the Government of 
British Columbia, negotiated, signed and are now ratifying a 
treaty rife with controversy.  I submit that the provincial 
government, by shutting down debate and ramming it through the 
legislature in Victoria, did nothing but add to the stigma 
already attached to this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are hundreds of questions that politicians, scholars, 
journalists and citizens, both aboriginal and non-aboriginal 
alike, would like to ask and answers have always been in short 
supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Responsible government is a term that has been used throughout 
our nation's history.  It has many connotations but boils down to 
being accountable to the citizens for the administration of their 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Responsibility and accountability have been absent in the 
Nisga'a treaty process from the outset.  The treaty sets an 
enormous precedent for past and future treaty negotiations.  It 
creates a third level of government that is outside the 
jurisdiction of the Constitution and the charter of rights.  My 
hon. colleague just addressed that.  It allows taxation without 
representation.  It divides rights and freedoms based on 
ethnicity.  It abandons the marital property rights of Nisga'a 
women residing on Nisga'a land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are very serious consequences that require explanation. 
When we ask the government to answer these questions we are 
called racists and fear-mongers.  Tell us a name and the members 
across the way call us it.  These diversion tactics are a 
disservice to the thousands of Canadians, both Nisga'a and 
non-Nisga'a, who are directly affected by the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the responsibility of the government to inform Canadians, 
in particular in northern British Columbia, of the details of the 
treaty and to allow them a say in how their land is to be used, 
not just for a year, not even for a decade or so but for all 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several bands surrounding the Nisga'a claim have overlapping 
claims which need to be settled before the treaty is ratified. 
The Indian affairs minister has been anything but accountable 
throughout the treaty process and has been irresponsible in her 
use of words like “self-government” and “aboriginal nations” 
in response to our questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the minister is in the House, I will draw to her attention 
an Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> article of May 31, 1999 by Dan Gardner 
where he wrote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the feds habitually describe aboriginal peoples as “nations”. 
As Pierre Trudeau has warned, “nation” is a dangerous word 
because it has two meanings: a discrete ethnic group or a state. 
Politicians have the ethnic meaning in mind when they speak of 
aboriginal nations, but their audiences often hear aboriginal 
states...What is needed is frank public discussion of what is 
really on the self government table. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always refrained from using the term first nations for a 
couple of reasons.  For one, it suggests that these bands are 
separate countries within Canada.  If one listens to the 
president of the Nisga'a band, that is exactly what he is 
seeking.  There are no mechanisms within the Constitution to 
create states within a state.  In fact it has been the 
government's position for questioning Quebec's argument for its 
independence, and rightfully so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason I do not use the term first nations is that it 
suggests supremacy.  As a member of the Reform Party, I adhere 
strongly to the principle that all Canadians are equal. Although 
I recognize that the term “first nations” refers to the fact 
that the aboriginal people were here first, the connotations can 
be used to argue supremacy over our constitutional and charter 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty delves into areas where the Canadian people 
are unresolved.  The Charlottetown accord addressed aboriginal 
self-government in the same obscure manner as this treaty and 
Canadians rejected it soundly.  Rather than consulting Canadians 
on the issue, the Liberals do what they always do and either slip 
contentious issues in the back door or they ram them through 
regardless of the consequences.  They feel they know better than 
the millions of Canadians who voted against Charlottetown.  To 
the Liberals, government knows best and the simple-minded public 
should just fall in line with the changes that are made to their 
lives without their consent.  Canadians are tired of it.  If they 
were not, the Reform Party would never have been born. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Reform Party undertook to consult and inform the 
people of British Columbia.  We shared our concerns with them and 
in return received hundreds of questions and comments back.  What 
we heard most often was that there was not enough information. 
Based on the information they have received, the majority are 
against the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March of this year I commissioned a survey in my riding on a 
number of issues including the Nisga'a treaty. 
The respondents were asked:  First, should the people of British 
Columbia have a voice on the principles of the Nisga'a treaty 
through a province-wide referendum?  Of my constituents, 75% said 
yes, 14% said no and 11% were undecided.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question was:  With the information you now have 
about the treaty, how should your federal MP vote when it comes 
before parliament in Ottawa?  Of the respondents, 17% wanted me 
to vote for the treaty, 50% said they wanted me to vote against 
and 33% were uncertain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These results tell me a few things:  My constituents want to 
have a say in this treaty, they are opposed to the passage of the 
treaty and fully one-third of my constituents are uncertain 
because they have received nothing but whitewash and propaganda 
from both their governments in Victoria and Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The B.C. legislature recently ratified the Nisga'a treaty. In 
one of the most anti-democratic manoeuvres outside of Ottawa, the 
NDP government shut down debate with over half the treaty left 
untouched.  Fully 200 clauses were not even discussed in the B.C. 
legislature.  We know all about shutting down debate in this 
place.  The federal Liberals have shamefully used it 53 times 
since coming to power in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would any democratic government deny open discussion on a 
bill that changes forever the way land claims and treaties are 
negotiated in Canada?  I cannot think of a legitimate answer that 
comes close to justifying it.  Only that it is too politically 
sensitive to risk exposure.  That must be what the New is all 
about in the New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The negotiations were closed, the provincial ratification 
process was a disgusting farce and off to Ottawa comes the treaty 
for a rubber stamp and a photo op.  The Indian affairs minister 
thought she could sweep the treaty under the carpet and have it 
through the House in no time flat.  After all, it only affects 
British Columbia.  Where have we heard that before?  Oh yes, when 
the Liberals left B.C. children unprotected against child 
pornographers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Indian affairs minister's plans were spoiled when the 
members for Skeena and Delta—South Richmond started asking hard 
questions that were tugging at the cloak of secrecy around the 
Nisga'a treaty.  What happened?  The minister signed the treaty 
for her own vanity before being shuffled and has delayed the 
process until the fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings us to the debate today.  The House is about to 
adjourn for the summer, along with the much rumoured prorogation 
of the House.  While the House is in recess we want the 
government to refer the Nisga'a treaty to the Supreme Court of 
Canada for its interpretation on the constitutionality and 
application of the charter of rights and freedoms as they pertain 
to this treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as the issue of the unilateral declaration of independence 
of Quebec was referred for interpretation, so to should the 
Nisga'a treaty.  This interpretation would clarify most of the 
constitutional questions we have raised before debating the 
ratification of the bill hopefully when the House resumes in the 
fall.  Is that not simply responsible?  What could be more 
reasonable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, I would like to move an amendment to our motion.  I 
move: 
<A NAME="LINK30">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by inserting before the word 
“urges”, the word “strongly”.

listened carefully to what my colleague from the Reform Party 
has had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has quoted some interesting statistics, including the fact 
that public opinion in British Columbia seemed to be against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two questions for my colleague.  Are the Reform MPs not 
acting somewhat as agitators, conditioning public opinion in 
their respective ridings to believe that the treaty and coming 
legislation on the Nisga'a are terrible things? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the many press clippings from British Columbia I have read, I 
have not seen one single positive comment from a Reform member 
on the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also heard my colleague say that the people of British 
Columbia had objections, that the Reform Party represented these 
people very well and that he was very representative.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can he draw a parallel with Canadians' voting intentions 
concerning the Reform Party, with only 9% of people now 
indicating that they would vote for his party?  Is this not 
proof that the Reform Party is quite simply barking up the wrong 
tree as far as aboriginal issues go? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not believe we have been 
filling the role of agitators, as the member put it.  I would 
challenge the hon. NDP member from Kamloops to talk to the people 
in his riding about this particular treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pretty universal throughout British Columbia, and 
especially strong in rural British Columbia, where people 
understand the issue of land claims, native self-government and 
all the problems inherent with the existing reserve system in 
Canada.  People have some very strong opinions on this matter. 
They certainly do not take a back seat to anyone when it comes to 
expressing those opinions.  All we have to do is tune in to some 
of the radio talk shows in British Columbia to hear those 
opinions expressed very strongly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These opinions were certainly expressed strongly by the Liberal 
opposition in Victoria in the short amount of time they had to 
debate this legislation before the NDP government shut it down. 
The Liberal opposition, headed by Gordon Campbell, were very 
strong in denouncing the treaty and the way it had gone through 
the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were a number of mini referendums conducted in different 
municipalities.  I do not have all the details nor the time, but 
an overwhelming number of people in British Columbia are opposed 
to the treaty at this time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be brief because I know my colleague from Manitoba would 
like to ask a question as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the Charlottetown accord and the five point plan that the 
member for Skeena properly referred to, he is wrong again in his 
numbers.  The Angus Reid polling throughout 1992 during the 
Charlottetown accord showed that the component of aboriginal 
peoples, that particular component of the Charlottetown accord, 
received the strongest support across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member had 2,500 members in his riding, which he of 
course does, and in any particular town, would he, being a Reform 
Party member who has pledged and vowed publicly before the 
Canadian people to support them, oppose 2,500 of his own people 
under those circumstances as the member for Skeena now does? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should know 
that it is often difficult to represent all the people in our 
ridings, especially on contentious issues.  What we endeavour to 
do is identify the majority point of view, something that the 
Liberals never care to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always been appreciative of the fact that I was elected 
by two-thirds of the people who took the time to go and cast a 
ballot.  That is the level of support I had in the last election 
when I came to the House.  Very clearly the majority of those 
constituents are opposed to this treaty as it is presently put 
together.  That is why I stand here and speak out against it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, after having the 
responsibility over the last two years of being Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development, I have spent considerable time 
talking to British Columbians about the Nisga'a treaty.  This is 
an extraordinarily important undertaking, not just for the 
Nisga'a, not just for the people of British Columbia, but indeed 
for all of Canada.  It is critical. 
As the Reform Party points out, it is critical that we talk about 
the legitimate concerns and issues, the challenges and the 
support that exists for the Nisga'a treaty.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Typically as we have conversations about the treaty itself, the 
questions revolve around three particular areas.  People ask why 
treaties.  They want to understand the treaty process and why we 
are engaged in that. They ask why self-government and what 
particularly is in the Nisga'a treaty. I would like to briefly 
make comments on those three questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why treaties?  Let me say that it was not I as the minister of 
Indian affairs who came up with the notion of treaty writing.  It 
was not the province of British Columbia, nor was it Joe Gosnell, 
the president of the Nisga'a council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treaties have long been part of the history of Canada.  In fact 
they date back to 1763 when in the royal proclamation King George 
said that we had to find a fair and practical way of working with 
indigenous people in the colonies, in the Canadas. Fortunately 
chiefs and aboriginal people felt the same way. They wanted a 
fair and practical way of working together in the lands we now 
know to be Canada.  Rather than conquests through war, they chose 
compromise through negotiation.  Treaties have been written in 
Canada since that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>History has continued.  Indeed the obligations and 
responsibilities that have been set out in certain treaties 
across the country now find protection in our constitution.  In 
section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 those treaty obligations 
and rights are protected.  The constitution also protects future 
treaty rights that would be written, as anticipated, with first 
nations individually or severally over the course of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In writing treaties we are not changing the constitution.  We 
are giving modern life to section 35 of the constitution. We are 
providing an opportunity for first nations who have not had that 
opportunity to be welcomed into Canada as citizens in the fullest 
sense under our laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about laws, that takes us to the second issue.  Why 
self-government?  Why are we taking this approach?  What is it 
all about? Very clearly in those early days when Europeans sat at 
the negotiating table with first nations, with chiefs, they knew 
they were dealing with legitimate governance.  George Vancouver 
when he entered Nisga'a lands was surprised to see Nisga'a living 
in two storey dwellings in a very complex society. There was 
governance and quite effective governance in first nations 
communities long before we ever arrived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the course of time, I guess as we became the majority, we 
started to think differently. We started to think that we knew 
best. We started to take the approach that Ottawa should be 
making the decisions on behalf of first nations people.  We 
started recognizing that decisions on behalf of aboriginal people 
should be made by the minister of Indian affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have the Indian Act. Surely to goodness the Reform Party 
does not agree that the Indian Act is the way we should build and 
can build a positive future for aboriginal people.  It is not and 
it needs to be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We should get rid of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  Right, let us get rid of it.  How do 
we do that?  We can do it by moving back to an original 
relationship based on the understanding that there should be 
community government for first nations people as there is for 
other Canadians. This is tremendously important to us. It gives 
us an opportunity to move forward together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To talk about governance, Canadians understand governance.  They 
want clarity of jurisdictions and authorities.  They want to set 
tables where they can come together to resolve problems.  Believe 
me, no one understands the Indian Act.  No one accepts that the 
minister of Indian affairs should be approving the wills of 
aboriginal people and should be telling them how to use their 
lands. That is antiquated.  It is wrong and we can do better. The 
Nisga'a treaty gives us an opportunity to do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us turn to the Nisga'a treaty. What is in the treaty? It 
sets out very particular obligations and responsibilities that we 
have to the Nisga'a people and in turn that they will provide to 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be providing them with 2,000 square kilometres of land 
which they will own not as reserves—and members want to change 
the reserve system—but as fee simple. As such on those lands the 
exemption from taxation will not apply. 
The Nisga'a will be paying provincial sales tax, provincial 
income tax, federal sales tax and federal income tax.  Their 
corporations will be paying corporate tax.  We are moving away 
from the old reserve system and modernizing our relationship in a 
very positive way.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other aspects, obligations and responsibilities that 
will be returned to the Nisga'a.  They will have authority to 
manage their resources such as timber, fisheries and wildlife. 
They will be able to make decisions about those resources and use 
them more effectively than they have ever been able to before. 
This makes sense.  It is set out in the treaty clearly.  People 
can read it and understand the relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about governance, it is set out in the treaty.  It 
is complex, perhaps too complex for the Reform Party, but it is 
set out there and it is explained. Fundamentally there are three 
categories of jurisdiction.  Let us understand them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, federal laws will continue to apply, such as 
the constitution, the charter of rights and freedoms and the 
Criminal Code.  In our enabling legislation be assured that we 
will confirm that the charter does apply to Nisga'a people. Those 
will exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there is another category of legislation on 
province-like jurisdictions such as education and health that the 
Nisga'a will take jurisdiction for.  Let me be clear that when 
that occurs, the Nisga'a must meet or beat provincial 
legislation, meet or beat.  There is nothing to worry about. 
People will understand it.  It will be clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those citizens who are not Nisga'a members who live in the 
Nisga'a territory and receive services from the Nisga'a for 
education and health will have the right to stand for election to 
the education boards and the health boards.  There is an appeal 
process that will allow them to fully participate in those areas. 
This is tremendously important to understand.  The treaty sets 
that out.  It makes it clear and it moves us ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third area of jurisdiction is associated with aspects 
fundamental to the Nisga'a themselves, their heritage, culture 
and language.  There are no provincial or federal laws dealing 
with that and why would there be?  We do not know how to protect 
their language, what the history and culture is, certainly not 
better than the Nisga'a.  These are the areas where the Nisga'a 
will have jurisdiction to ensure that their history is strong and 
that it continues to vibrantly develop today and tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have worked very hard to negotiate this agreement.  We have 
talked to the citizens of British Columbia about it.  The AIP has 
been available for a number of years.  Public meetings have been 
held.  The communities in the Nass Valley are supportive and view 
this to be an important step in the modernization of our 
relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have the opportunity to continue the debate here in this 
House, in parliament, where it should be, to discuss the details. 
I will continue to talk to British Columbians about their 
legitimate concerns and issues because they can be answered.  The 
treaty provides those responses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say in conclusion that as we settle these outstanding 
obligations we do a number of things.  We bring certainty to the 
lands.  We bring an opportunity for communities to work more 
strongly together, for first nations to have the opportunity to 
build their own relationship with the private sector, with 
surrounding municipalities and to fully engage in this great 
country of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We bring economic development into the province, into the Nass 
Valley and provide new opportunities for prosperity and 
development. Finally what we do is say to some first peoples in 
this country that Canada welcomes them.  They want to be part of 
Canada.  This is not about leaving our great country.  This is 
about being part of it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not 
know where to begin.  The minister makes a very nice emotional 
appeal.  This is what the minister always does when she is 
answering questions about the Nisga'a treaty.  It is the 
emotional appeal. 
Is it not time that we resolved this?  Is it not time that we 
formed a new relationship with aboriginal people?  Is it not time 
that we put the dark history of our country behind us and got on 
with a new relationship?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously everybody agrees with that but she is not answering 
the questions.  She is not answering the constitutional 
questions.  She is not answering the charter questions.  She is 
not responding to our question with respect to section 25 of the 
charter being able to trump the individual rights of Nisga'a 
people.  She is not responding to the challenge that has been 
raised in British Columbia that the government has violated 
sections 91 and 92 of the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot for the life of me understand why the minister does not 
respond to the specifics.  She only deals in the emotional 
appeal.  That is all she is interested in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister why would this government be opposed to 
sending the agreement to the Supreme Court of Canada for a 
clarification on the constitutionality and the charter of rights? 
These are two very important issues.  Why is she opposed to 
referring this to the supreme court in advance of ratification? 
What is another few months after 130 years to make sure that we 
have it right, to make sure that the charter rights of the 
Nisga'a people are not diminished and to make sure that this 
agreement actually conforms to the constitution?  What is she 
afraid of? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on this side we believe 
we have an obligation to fulfill the statements in our 
constitution.  The constitution protects treaty rights as they 
have been negotiated for first nations in the past and it 
protects the treaty rights that will be negotiated with first 
nations or groups of first nations into the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been to the courts on a number of occasions.  They have 
said to us “Would you please take the responsibility and 
negotiate. You can keep coming back to us and we will tell you, 
yes, there are aboriginal rights in Canada, but it is only you 
that can sit at the table with first nations and exhaustively set 
those rights out, put them in a treaty and move on”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what we are doing.  There is no constitutional 
issue here.  What there is is an obligation on the part of Canada 
to fulfill the protection and identification of aboriginal rights 
as set out in section 35 of the constitution. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
would the minister agree that what we are seeing here today is 
the last death rattle of what boils down to a two year campaign 
on behalf of the Reform Party to try to discredit aboriginal 
leadership and on a much broader issue than just the Nisga'a deal 
to try to speak against the whole idea of self-government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sat here and listened for almost two years to a day where 
time after time Reform members have tried to thread together 
isolated incidences of mismanagement on various reserves.  They 
have tried to paint a broader picture that aboriginal people are 
neither able nor capable or should have any control over 
self-governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people think that by broadening rights to a larger group of 
people somehow diminishes their own rights.  They have this 
concept of human rights as one finite pie and if one group takes 
too big a slice that somehow there is less of it to go around. 
This is the message we have been hearing over and over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the minister aware that the Reform Party has really been the 
spokesperson for the whole anti-Indian movement in western Canada 
where I live, the architects of the anti-Indian movement of 
western Canada, with connections that I would love to point out 
if I had more time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are a couple of 
things I would like to say in response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, without question there are legitimate 
questions that people have about the Nisga'a treaty.  Those 
questions need to be identified and responded to.  We will 
continue to do that I know with the help of all other parties in 
the House with the exception of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing I would like to point out is that very often the 
Reform Party takes the approach in fact in everything it does, of 
identifying issues and problems.  However it seems to be 
absolutely impossible for it to present alternatives, united or 
otherwise.

<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
begin by saluting the Nisga'a who are listening to today's 
debate in the House, particularly Grand Chief Gosnell, to whom I 
spoke yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not dwell too long on the content of the agreement, 
because next fall we will have time to take an indepth look at 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's debate on a motion on which we will be voting, it is 
important to focus instead on the democratic process. 
Was the democratic process legal and legitimate? My comments 
will primarily focus on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This process, which probably began in 1880, has been a long one. 
In 1996, I heard Mr. Gosnell say that the canoe had finally 
arrived, when the agreement in principle was signed. I think a 
few strokes of the paddle were still necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we also have to do some paddling with the Nisga'a, 
precisely to allow them to reach the land that they have been 
trying to take possession of for over 100 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a courageous democratic course. These people have also 
been very peaceful. They have always wanted to reach that land 
through negotiation. They have been very courageous and 
persevering and, today, they need a helping hand. 
Naturally, we in the Bloc Quebecois are fully prepared to give 
them such a hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1880, the chiefs began to say “We have been living on these 
lands forever”. For almost a century, they made representations 
to assume ownership of these lands. The Calder decision, in 
1973, brought about many changes.  It was agreed that there were 
probably some aboriginal titles that should be recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the great privilege of meeting Mr. Calder here, a few 
years ago. I was able to see what an extraordinary person he is. 
He is a Nisga'a and he has done a lot to further the cause of 
his people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, in 1976 the federal government began the negotiation 
process. It was only in 1990 that the government of British 
Columbia got involved in the negotiations. The agreement in 
principle was finally reached in 1996. 
At this point Joe Gosnell said “Finally, the canoe has come in”. 
However, he did not count on the Reform Party, which, in my 
opinion, is blasting the Nisga'a canoe with cannon fire. They 
really do not want this canoe to reach its destination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the procedure to be followed with this treaty before 
us, which was definitively signed in August 1998, in order for 
it to be enforceable, the three parties must follow very 
specific steps. A referendum is to be held among the Nisga'a. 
The treaty must be signed by a member of the provincial cabinet 
and be ratified by the British Columbia legislature. It must 
then be signed by a member of the federal cabinet and ratified 
by the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a moment to look at the result of the 
referendum the Nisga'a held on November 10, 1998: 1,451 Nisga'a 
voted in support of this definitive agreement; 558 voted 
against; 356 did not vote, and 11 ballots were spoiled. That 
means 61% of the eligible voters supported the treaty, and 23% 
did not. I would remind the hon. members that, as in any good 
democracy, the rule was 50% plus one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Nisga'a, the job is over. Seventy per cent of those who 
voted supported it. It is important to know that not only was 
the action quite legal, but it was also quite legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia's requirement has also been fulfilled. A member 
of cabinet signed the agreement on behalf of the provincial 
government of British Columbia. The British Columbia legislature 
voted in favour of it. 
At the federal level as well, a member of Cabinet signed the 
treaty, as we will recall, last week. The Reformers made a big 
issue over of it.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that, in legal terms, so long as the bill has not been 
passed, the treaty cannot come into force. So even though a 
minister has signed it, the treaty cannot come into force until 
the underlying issue has been resolved in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards the Reform Party's motion, no one will be surprised 
when I say that the Bloc Quebecois will oppose it. Referring a 
matter to the supreme court involves one in it. Not too long 
ago, the Minister of Justice made a reference to the supreme 
court in order to prevent the democratic, legal and legitimate 
action of the people of Quebec. 
The Minister of Justice did the same thing in a reference to the 
Supreme Court of Canada, asking for guidelines as to whether 50% 
plus one would be enough, for instance.  There were several 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see exactly the same attitude in this motion to refer the 
matter to the supreme court in order to foil a democratic action 
by the Nisga'a people.  Naturally, we cannot agree with such a 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion also refers to delaying tactics.  They want another 
postponement in order to stir things up even more in British 
Columbia and attempt to sink the famous Nisga'a canoe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also opposed because we think this is a red herring.  The 
motion refers to the Musqueam and Kamloops bands, but these 
bands do not come under the treaty signed with the Nisga'a. 
The Reform Party undoubtedly wants to use these examples to 
derail the treaty, but I think they are separate issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Reform Party to follow my lead.  I am going to visit 
British Columbia this summer and check out the Musqueam band. 
My colleague tells me to come.  I do not know whether it is in 
his riding, but I would be delighted to meet not only the band 
council but also the people who are facing substantial tax 
hikes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this is not a good enough reason to scrap the treaty signed 
with the Nisga'a.  It is not fair to use examples of things that 
are not working well in certain places, in British Columbia or 
elsewhere in Canada, as an excuse for now scrapping the treaty 
with the Nisga'a. 
This is another reason the Bloc Quebecois cannot support the 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor do we agree that a constitutional amendment is required.  A 
number of legal experts have commented on this.  There is one I 
would like to cite, for the record.  I am referring to Mr. Hogg, 
of York University, who says, and I quote: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of policy, in my opinion, it would be undesirable to 
hold a referendum every time a treaty is entered into with 
aboriginal people.  These treaties are intended to provide 
clarity and certainty to aboriginal rights that have been held by 
aboriginal people since before European settlement.  The treaties 
are long complicated documents reflecting years of negotiation 
and much compromise on both sides.  It would be very difficult to 
communicate all the issues in a balanced way in a province-wide 
referendum campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a referendum were held and the treaty was defeated, the 
problem of achieving clarity and certainty would not go away. 
The aboriginal people would have to use the courts to vindicate 
their rights to land, resources and self-government.  The Supreme 
Court of Canada said in the Delgamuukw case that it was willing 
to do that, but that it was better for governments to reach 
negotiated agreements with aboriginal people.  I agree with the 
Court. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore very clear.  Once the court route is taken, 
there will be no end to the appeals to postpone this type of 
treaty.  The democratic progress of the Nisga'a can no more be 
thwarted than can the democratic progress of the people of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democratic action to liberate peoples cannot be blocked by the 
courts, any more than by armies or, I would even argue, by 
parliaments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To achieve greater autonomy is a basic desire of any people, and 
I find that the Quebec people and the Nisga'a people are very 
similar in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to tell the Nisga'a, and those who are watching us today, 
that the Bloc Quebecois is going to support this undertaking for 
complete freedom of this people, so that they may in future be 
masters of their own destiny and no longer have to depend on 
legislatures and courts to settle their fundamental issues.

against this motion.  They at least are being consistent and true 
to their beliefs, unlike certain members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what the hon. member's comment would be with respect to 
the creation of a mini-state within our state or what he feels 
Mr. Bouchard would say if he were to be accorded, on a silver 
platter, all of the possibilities of government, all of the areas 
of overriding power which are going to be granted to the Nisga'a 
in this treaty, such as fisheries, wildlife, the adoption of 
children, citizenship, culture and language, expropriation of 
lands, health services, family services and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member believe that if the province of Quebec were 
handed the same deal which this government is proposing to hand 
to the Nisga'a it would not only be happy but absolutely 
overjoyed? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a very good question 
and I am glad it has been raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty is a modern treaty.  The James Bay agreement 
paved the way for it.  All that the hon. colleague has just said 
about the powers to be given to the aboriginal people, we 
already handed over in 1975, and then a few years later again 
with the Naskapi. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, there are certain areas of jurisdiction which passed 
from a provincial or federal level to the aboriginal level. 
But it is all done through agreements, like the agreements that 
now exist between the three levels of government, the aboriginal 
government, the provincial government and the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal or provincial government decides what it will give 
to aboriginals and this is simply a recognition of their 
distinct approach or culture.  Pan-Canadian or pan-provincial 
programs are not the way to satisfy these people, with their own 
particular approach to their culture, their health and their 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the information of my hon. colleague, we have already done 
this, and we see many similarities with the Nisga'a situation 
today.  As I see it, the James Bay agreement was a 
groundbreaking model that people rely on today when drawing up 
modern treaties, which resemble it in many ways.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there must have been an error in translation because I kept 
hearing the member opposite use the word liberate, as though the 
Nisga'a want to be liberated in the same sense that some 
sovereignists want to separate from the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Nisga'a want in this treaty is to join.  The treaty is 
all about giving the Nisga'a a sense of cultural unity with the 
rest of Canada at the same time as their culture is respected. 
This country is the creation of three great founding peoples: 
those who speak English, those who speak French and those who are 
of the aboriginal heritage who speak many languages.  They were 
the ones who welcomed us and made it possible for the English and 
French speaking people to survive in the wilderness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the member opposite that he consider the Nisga'a in 
the sense of belonging to this country.  I reject his premise 
that the Nisga'a need to be liberated.  That is not the point at 
all. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to tell my colleague 
that there has been no interpretation error.  I maintain that 
the Nisga'a, through their government—because there will be a 
Nisga'a government—are now going to be liberated from their 
previous great dependence on the federal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
reading the Reform motion before us today, the first thing that 
struck me in reading it was that the Reform Party is pursuing the 
exact same agenda as the B.C. Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is that agenda?  It is an agenda about dividing people.  It 
is an agenda about creating fear and uncertainty.  It is an 
agenda that actually sabotages the progress that is being made in 
bringing about an historic agreement with the Nisga'a people.  It 
is an agenda that creates red herrings and smoke screens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be very clear.  The Reform Party does not want 
clarification of this treaty by the supreme court.  Reformers 
have the same access to legal opinions as any other member or 
political party.  They do not want clarification.  They want to 
destroy the democratic process that has been in place, to bring 
about a 111-year struggle, to finally have a modern day treaty 
with the Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Reform members are surprised by the strong response which all 
members of this House, other than themselves, have to this 
motion, it is not just because of the motion that is before us 
today, as my NDP colleague pointed out earlier, it is because day 
after day, week after week, month after month we have heard 
members of the Reform Party stand in this House and in public to 
undermine, attack and reinforce any negative examples they can 
find. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there any doubt that we would come to the conclusion that 
they have a political agenda?  It is not about clarification or 
doing the right thing, but about undermining a democratic process 
and creating fear among people.  I find that appalling.  I have 
watched it in B.C. with the B.C. Liberals and now we are seeing 
it with the Reform Party, whose agenda is identical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that this is about clarification of legal questions, 
a very thoughtful approach.  There are ample legal opinions 
available which tell us that section 35 of the constitution 
states that the treaty rights of aboriginal people have to be 
respected.  We know that section 35 covers previous treaties and 
we know that it has provision and room to cover treaties in the 
future.  It is very clear that the Nisga'a treaty is not 
something that constitutes a constitutional amendment.  Legal 
opinions, including that of the dean of Osgoode Hall and many 
others, have very clearly outlined this, and the Reform Party 
knows this full well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note the following in today's debate in 
looking at other positions the Reform Party has taken.  Why is it 
that in this particular instance Reformers want to go to the 
supreme court, but in other instances, for example the child 
pornography issue, they were jumping up and down, saying that we 
could not go to the supreme court, that it was the powers of 
parliament and the action of parliament that counted?  All of a 
sudden we have a double standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that members of the Reform Party challenge this, a 
domestic treaty which is clearly within the context and the legal 
confines of our constitution, the charter of rights and all of 
our laws, but when we have international treaties like the MAI or 
NAFTA, which do constitute a massive transfer of power from 
democratically elected governments to multinational corporations, 
there is silence?  There is not a word.  They are out there 
campaigning and upholding that kind of direction.  It is no 
wonder there is a very strong response to this motion.  This is 
an issue of credibility on which the Reform Party has no leg to 
stand on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the debate earlier today and I heard the member 
for Skeena say that the charter of rights of Nisga'a people have 
been put in peril.  I thought, what does that mean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the member never spelled it out, so I do not know what he 
meant, but I thought it was quite a patronizing comment.  We have 
the Nisga'a people who, through their duly elected 
representatives, have been full partners in a democratic process 
to bring together this treaty and we have a Reform Party member 
saying that it is the charter of rights of the Nisga'a people 
themselves that is in peril. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hypocrisy and the patronizing attitude that has come 
forward from the Reform Party after so many months and years of 
campaigning against rights and self-government for aboriginal 
people is really something that is quite appalling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be very clear.  The Nisga'a treaty does not create new 
constitutional rights for the Nisga'a or anyone else.  No one's 
rights are affected.  I would challenge the Reform Party to 
dispute that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will this treaty do?  For the very first time important 
provincial laws will now apply to people who used to be exempt 
from them because they were governed by the federal Indian Act. 
This treaty does not create a racially based order of government. 
On the contrary, it moves us away from what has been a very 
dependent relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty provides powers within the constitution similar to 
the powers that a municipality may have.  It is very clear that 
Nisga'a laws must conform to the charter of rights and freedoms 
and to federal and provincial standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary again to what members of the Reform Party and the B.C. 
Liberals have been saying, non-Nisga'a who own land on Nisga'a 
territory will pay property taxes to the province and the Nisga'a 
can only tax their own people living on Nisga'a lands.  The 
Nisga'a will pay federal and provincial income taxes and sales 
taxes.  Let us get the record straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also see in the motion that there is a reference made to 
labour standards and that somehow these are undermined.  I 
thought that was a curious thing to be coming from the Reform 
Party.  I did a little research.  I have a letter from the B.C. 
Federation of Labour, dated April 21, 1999, from the then 
president, Kenneth Georgetti, who stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Labour movement in B.C. endorses wholeheartedly the 
provisions respecting labour relations in the Nisga'a Agreement. 
All labour rights under federal and provincial law are 
maintained.  This means that trade unions will continue to be 
able to organize on treaty settlement land. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than that, D.C. Haggard, President of I.W.A Canada, stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of Parliament, and the general public, should be aware 
that the B.C. Federation of Labour met frequently with the 
Nisga'a during the period of intense negotiations.  I attended 
many of those meetings. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the laws and precedents under which those tribunals will 
make decisions remain unchanged, the B.C. labour movement, and 
I.W.A. Canada in particular, support those provisions and the 
proposed Treaty. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That comes from the labour movement itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be very clear about this motion today.  It is members 
of the Reform Party and the B.C. Liberals who are in cahoots on 
this, and on many other things I might add.  If they get their 
way, what would happen?  This is what we would have if we 
followed their agenda.  We would have more economic uncertainty. 
We would be leaving land claim costs unresolved that amount to 
billions of dollars in investment and development.  We would also 
have a situation where important land claims issues would be 
settled by the courts, with all kinds of wrangling, instead of 
through democratic, open, above-board negotiations where third 
party interests are recognized and where public hearings are 
held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I refer to what Reform members said earlier today, that no 
one bothered to listen, that there was no consultation.  They 
have to be joking.  They should look at the record in B.C.  There 
were thousands of public hearings, there was public debate, and 
committees of the legislature travelled around the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be very clear.  The Reform Party knows full well that the 
Nisga'a agreement is not a constitutional amendment.  I urge the 
House to soundly reject this motion.  Let us move forward on 
human rights, on reconciliation with first nations people and on 
settling land claims through goodwill, through negotiation; not 
through court battles, not through roadblocks.  Let us move 
forward and let us reject this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it takes some constraint to be able to express oneself after a 
speech like that, in the face of the attitude from the Liberals 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member might be interested to know that later today I will 
be delivering a speech to show exactly how the labour movement in 
British Columbia, and indeed Bob White when he was retiring from 
the Canadian Labour Congress, completely, totally, utterly fouled 
up because they did not understand the implications of this act 
with respect to the whole issue of the union movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to ask one specific question.  The member has 
chosen to continue to extend the myth that was created by the NDP 
in Victoria that this act is nothing more than extending powers 
similar to those of a municipality.  If we were talking about the 
Sechelt agreement, that statement would be true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member tell me which other municipality, if 
indeed that were true, has the ability to establish citizenship? 
Which other municipality has the ability to extend taxation 
without representation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad that the member 
was restrained.  I think that is something that the Reform Party 
is well known for, being restrained.  Reform members are full of 
restraint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It surprises me that the line that is being pedalled is that it 
is only members of the Reform Party who understand this 
agreement.  It is not the Nisga'a people, it is not the NDP, it 
is not the Liberals, it is not the labour movement, it is not Bob 
White, it is only members of the Reform Party who have seen the 
problems, the alleged problems, of this agreement.  We are all 
intelligent people.  We can read these agreements.  We can come 
to our own conclusions.  I would again assert that the Reform 
Party has a different agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of myths being perpetuated, I would suggest that it is 
the Reform Party which is perpetuating myths about this 
agreement.  The fact is that the laws that would be conferred 
under this agreement in no way violate the constitution, in no 
way violate provincial law.  They have been agreed to through due 
process.  They are within the context of the constitution.  In 
fact the myth that there is taxation without representation is 
also false and totally incorrect.  It is very clear that there 
will be taxes paid and, if it is non-Nisga'a on Nisga'a land, 
those taxes will go to the provincial government and the Nisga'a 
laws will apply to Nisga'a people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to thank the member from British Columbia for that speech. 
I note how refreshing it is in this House of Commons to see 
somebody from British Columbia speaking clearly on this issue, as 
is my colleague from British Columbia who is sitting beside me 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of British Columbia and those Canadians who have 
watched this debate over the last number of months have 
constantly heard members of the Reform Party referring to 
themselves as speaking for the people of British Columbia, which 
is absolutely false and untrue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the member has spoken well.  There are many members 
of parliament from British Columbia who support this deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member began her statements by making some presumptions 
as to why the Reform Party is doing this.  We have listened to 
this for some time.  The member from Winnipeg made that point. 
What are the motivations behind the Reform Party in British 
Columbia in opposing this deal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the agenda of the 
Reform Party is not really about dealing with substantive issues 
around self-government and modern day treaties.  I think the 
Reform Party has an opportunity to play a very positive role in 
that regard.  Reform members have an opportunity to be at the 
table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as the member has suggested, I think there is a 
different agenda.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They understand there is uncertainty in what they do with many 
other issues, whether taxation, social programs or the income tax 
system.  They play on that uncertainty and fear which divides 
people.  They play on peoples' emotions and set people against 
each other.  We have to stand up and say that we will not 
tolerate it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to discuss the Nisga'a treaty and to 
address the motion before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make one prefacing remark on what the minister said, and 
I think we should all remember it.  All debate is legitimate. All 
of us may not agree on debate in that we may have different 
points of view coming from different areas of the country, but 
all debate is legitimate.  I welcome this debate even though I do 
not agree with everything that has been said today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion deals with a number of issues affecting not only the 
Nisga'a treaty but also other tangential aspects that have been 
discussed in relation to the treaty, issues such as the Musqueam 
first nation in British Columbia, a subject I want to touch upon 
later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the opportunity to meet with members of the Nisga'a 
first nation on two occasions to discuss this treaty.  It is my 
intention to travel to British Columbia this summer to look at 
the situation on the ground in B.C. and to speak not only to 
members of the Nisga'a Tribal Council but to Nisga'a members 
themselves and to the non-native population in and around the 
Nass Valley.  I am hoping to have the opportunity to meet with 
all members in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty is the first modern day treaty to be signed 
in British Columbia and represents the end of a long process by 
which the Nisga'a people want to have their own land claim 
recognized.  The treaty will provide the Nisga'a people with an 
opportunity to gain greater self-reliance and self-sufficiency. 
Moreover, it recognizes their inherent right to self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party supports initiatives that advance these objectives. 
That is why we have supported legislation like Bill C-49, the 
First Nations Land Management Act.  That bill will allow 14 first 
nations to take control over the management of resources on 
reserves.  It removes them from the overbearing and restrictive 
requirements of the Indian Act, something that is taken even 
further in the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty covers a wide range of issues since it will 
provide the Nisga'a people with not only 2,000 square kilometres 
of land but a Nisga'a only commercial fishery and salmon 
allocation, jurisdiction over the judicial system, a police 
force, and an environmental assessment and protection authority. 
At the same time the Nisga'a people will begin to pay taxes on a 
phased in approach over eight and twelve years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today specifically mentions the Musqueam 
first nation and the problem which has erupted between the 
tenants and the first nation regarding third party leases.  This 
problem is obviously contentious and has been generating 
significant amounts of attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and 
Northern Development I have had the opportunity to listen to the 
concerns of representatives of the Musqueam park tenants.  Their 
problems are to a great extent due to the lease rates established 
in their lease agreement.  This is the kind of problem that could 
occur anywhere in Canada and is not restricted to first nation 
agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anytime someone enters into a lease agreement it is important to 
understand the implications of the terms of that agreement.  On 
the other hand, the Musqueam park tenants are now faced with 
significant financial obligations.  Obviously no one wants to see 
the same situation repeated on Nisga'a land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A dispute like the Musqueam one hurts all parties involved since 
the negative publicity decreases the value of the land.  This is 
a problem for both the tenants and the landlord because it is a 
source of revenue for first nations to be able to lease land to 
third party members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the Nisga'a people facing unemployment levels of around 
60%, I assume all options for revenue generation will be 
considered.  In fact that is one of the advantages of the treaty 
not only for the Nisga'a people but for the surrounding 
communities.  With a compensation package of $190 million there 
should be economic spinoffs for neighbouring communities as well 
as for the Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at specific aspects of the Nisga'a treaty, I have some 
concerns about things like the salmon allocation and the 
commercial fishery for the Nisga'a people.  This was something I 
raised at the meeting with the Nisga'a people.  I understand that 
they have a vested interest in ensuring that a sustainable and a 
healthy fishery exists. 
At the same time, however, I question the impact it will have on 
future treaties which will be negotiated in British Columbia and 
on the commercial fishing industry in general.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty may not be a template for future treaties but 
it will nevertheless set a benchmark against which to compare 
agreements.  The Sechelt first nation has recently reached 
another step toward its own final agreement and it is different 
in many aspects from the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be future treaties that will look at what the Nisga'a 
treaty has and has not accomplished and be negotiated based on 
that information.  The impact this will have on the commercial 
fishery in British Columbia is something that will be determined 
some time in the future but should be considered now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion suggests that the question of the Nisga'a treaty 
changing the constitution and therefore requiring a referendum in 
British Columbia should be addressed by the supreme court. While 
I do not have the legal background to address this issue and do 
it justice, I suggest that past events would point to other 
avenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has been criticized for giving greater power to the 
judiciary.  It is interesting that the Reform Party in particular 
has been quick to state on a number of occasions that the 
judiciary is too involved in the shaping of public policy in the 
country.  It has stated that judges should not legislate yet the 
motion today calls for a reference to the supreme court.  Is this 
a double standard?  It criticizes using the supreme court on 
issues of public policy yet when it is something it does not like 
it is quick to propose using the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying that the Nisga'a treaty is a step in the 
right direction.  The supreme court made it clear in the 
Delgamuukw decision that negotiated settlement is the way to 
proceed with land claims.  This is an example of such a process, 
one that the Conservative government recognized in the 1980s when 
the process was ongoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be an interesting debate when the legislation for this 
treaty is introduced to parliament.  I look forward to addressing 
it at that time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if my hon. colleague believes that the pursuit of the 
current treaty negotiations is a good thing, how does he account 
for the fact that treaties have been negotiated in hundreds and 
hundreds of reserves for people east of the Rockies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one compares the situation of reserves east of the Rockies 
with the reserves in British Columbia, one finds little or no 
difference between the condition of the people in both those 
reserves.  Therefore one can assume that the negotiation of 
treaties in and of themselves is not a way toward political and 
economic emancipation for these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Clark, the Premier of British Columbia, mentioned before 
enacting closure in the legislature that indeed a new third level 
of government was be creating and that this level of government 
would be required to negotiate the treaties with the new levels 
of government?  This new third level of government and the 
ensuing increase of bureaucracy in the provincial government will 
swallow up a lot of money that could better be used to help the 
aboriginal people on the ground.  Does the hon. member agree with 
those comments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will answer the second 
question first.  Both questions of the hon. member are excellent 
questions.  They are exactly the types of questions we need to 
ask in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the third level of government, I agree we are establishing a 
third level of government.  It is something beyond what has been 
discussed in the Parliament of Canada or in the treaty process 
previously.  It is not a municipal style of government similar to 
what the Sechelt agreement or the Musqueam agreement brought in. 
It is a step further that we all need to look at very carefully 
and cautiously.  We must all recognize exactly what it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the first question, I do not think we can judge the treaties 
signed or not signed in eastern Canada.  All of eastern Canada 
does not have a treaty process in place.  We cannot judge treaty 
8, treaty 6, treaty 4 or treaty 2, but we can look at first 
nations communities across the country.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member whether the problem is the treaty process 
or the lack of some type of completion in the treaty process. Has 
it been the restrictions of the Indian Act, which at best has 
been a piece of prejudiced legislation and at worst probably 
supported an apartheid type of regime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would tend to put more blame on the Indian Act and less on the 
treaty process.  If we bring in treaties that have some finality 
to them and we give some empowerment to first nations that allows 
them to carry on in some economic regime and build some power 
base for themselves to benefit from the fruits of their labour, 
as all Canadians benefit from the fruits of their labour, then I 
think we have done something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would agree that both questions are good questions.  I am not 
answering completely the first one because I think it is a part 
of future debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
for his concise answer.   Does the hon. member feel that we can 
scrap the Indian Act and pursue a process of economic 
emancipation and independence without necessarily pursuing 
political independence? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure we can scrap 
the Indian Act by snapping our fingers.  I think it is much more 
complicated than that.  The exact reason the P.C. Party supported 
Bill C-49 is that it takes first nations out from under the 
Indian Act and allows them to have control of their own resources 
on their own reserves without going to the minister and without 
going through the Indian Act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to the motion.  It affects 
the people in my province of British Columbia, but the fact is 
that it will affect Canadians from coast to coast.  This is the 
template that will be used to negotiate more than 120 agreements 
within my province and to negotiate agreements across the country 
as treaties will be renegotiated as a result of the Nisga'a 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for Skeena, the member for Wild Rose 
and other colleagues who have done much to bring the plight of 
aboriginal people to the forefront. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been engaging in a situation that has kept the political 
foot on the necks of the most impoverished people in the country. 
Through political manoeuvring for 140 years the Indian Act has 
kept a political foot on the necks of aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our common objective is to change the egregious situation which 
affects aboriginal people from coast to coast on and off reserve. 
They suffer from the highest rates of suicide, murder, 
tuberculosis, diabetes, social impoverishment and child abuse in 
the country.  These terrible situations are symptoms of a much 
larger problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that aboriginal people have been made wards of 
the government and the country.  We have pursued a course of 
segregation and separation which has kept aboriginal people 
separate and apart from the rest of society.  We are very happy 
that within the constitution there are requirements to ensure 
aboriginal people have their culture, language and lives in the 
traditional ways expressed and entrenched within that document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot, nor should we, ever go back to the situation that 
existed years ago when the culture, language and basic rights of 
these people were trampled upon.  However, what we are doing 
right now through the Nisga'a agreement will not make things 
better.  It will make things worse.  For that reason the Reform 
Party is opposing the Nisga'a deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day our common objective is to improve the 
terrible situation which exists on aboriginal reserves.  However, 
how we will do it is where we differ, and I will get into that a 
bit later.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen people who have been raped, abused, murdered. 
Children have been abused, shot, knifed.  People are impoverished 
and live in terrible conditions and circumstances which I have 
not seen since I worked in Africa.  These circumstances exist in 
our country, a country that we believe and are told by the United 
Nations is the best country in the world.  That may be so for a 
part of our population, but clearly it is not so for aboriginal 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to engage in a process of economic and political 
emancipation and political integration for aboriginal people. 
Economic emancipation is not conditional upon political 
independence.  That is what the Nisga'a agreement puts together. 
It is political independence to a degree because it creates a new 
level of government.  One of the primary proponents of the 
Nisga'a deal, Mr. Glen Clark, premier of British Columbia, said 
in the legislature that the Nisga'a deal is going to entrench a 
third level of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also oppose this because the deal entrenches political and 
economic power in the hands of a few.  It entrenches it in the 
hands of the leadership of the Nisga'a people.  It does not 
entrench it in the hands of the rank and file people.  What we 
have seen in our country for 140 years, and what we see today and 
will see tomorrow if the deal goes through, is that the rank and 
file aboriginal people are excluded from the power and the wealth 
that has accrued to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are examples of aboriginal reserves that operate very well 
because they have a very powerful, strong and fair leadership 
that works for the people.  Unfortunately that is not so in many 
cases across the country.  The auditor general has repeatedly 
mentioned the plight of grassroots aboriginal people, their 
suffering and the abuses in some cases by aboriginal leaderships. 
The aboriginal leaderships in too many communities are taking 
the resources and the wealth that have accrued to them through 
our system and are not sharing them properly with their people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to change and improve the health and welfare of 
aboriginal people, rather than pursue a Nisga'a deal, let us work 
with them and give them the tools to take care of themselves. It 
does not matter whether we are aboriginal or non-aboriginal, we 
have to be able to contribute to our families, to ourselves and 
to our society if we are going to have the pride and self-respect 
necessary to carry on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were wards of the federal government, the provincial 
government and the aboriginal leaderships and resources were 
given to us by virtue of who we were without working for them, we 
would not have the pride and self-respect which is necessary to 
change the terrible dislocates within these communities.  Pride 
and self-respect come from being able to contribute to ourselves, 
to our families and to our communities. Rank and file aboriginal 
people have not had that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than pursue the Nisga'a deal that is going to cost the 
taxpayers more than $500 million and which will drain limited 
resources to develop a bureaucracy within provincial governments 
and within an aboriginal structure, would it not make more sense 
to use that money for health care for these people and to give 
these people skills training to become productive employable 
members in their society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not just talking about the people on reserve. We cannot 
forget the large numbers of aboriginal people who flocked to the 
city to look for hope.  They fled the reserves where they had no 
hope yet in the cities and without the skills and tools to 
survive they find themselves in the same situation they were in 
or worse.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have pleaded with the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development to please look into the situation occurring on the 
reserves today.  Please act on behalf of these people.  Do not 
ignore their pleas for help.  Do not continually tell the 
grassroots aboriginal people to go to the police or their 
leadership, who in many cases are strangling their own people. 
She must help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over $7 billion is poured into aboriginal affairs, yet what do 
these people have to show for it?  In many cases their situation 
now is more pitiful than it was five, ten or twenty years ago. 
Money is not the cure.  Political independence is not the cure. 
The Nisga'a deal is not the cure. It is in ensuring that 
aboriginal people have the power and the responsibility to take 
care of themselves and their families in their communities. 
Therein lies the opportunity, the hope and the chance for them to 
end a situation that is an embarrassment for everybody in the 
House, but more important is a terrible tragedy and a pain for 
the people who endure it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a deal fails on many counts, as my hon. colleague from 
Skeena and others have mentioned.  It fails to provide for the 
people.  It fails to ensure that the people have the power.  It 
fails to ensure that we have a workable situation for both 
aboriginals and non-aboriginals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, we must work together to build a stronger 
society.  Separated we will sink; together we will survive and do 
well. The Nisga'a deal unfortunately segregates aboriginals and 
non-aboriginals. It moves them apart. It will only further the 
prejudice aboriginal people endure.  That is not good and it 
needs to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that the government looks at this deal again.  We hope 
it does not pass the Nisga'a deal.  We hope it invests in 
aboriginal people.  We hope it listens to the grassroots 
aboriginal people and not necessarily to their leadership.  We 
hope it puts the obligation, responsibility and accountability on 
the leadership to make sure the resources for the people are 
going to be used for the betterment of them and not merely put 
into a huge sinkhole that is not going to benefit the aboriginal 
people at all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to thank the hon. member for his comments.  I know he has 
spoken on these issues before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take note of his broad sweeping approach to the 
discussions.  He talked about economic emancipation for 
aboriginal people and said that if they are just given resources 
it is not helpful to them, that it creates poor character, as it 
were. He also mentioned that as a result of all this the 
aboriginal people flock to the cities as economic refugees, as it 
were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like some clarification.  Could the hon. member tell the 
House precisely what he meant when he said that just giving 
resources to the reserves somehow diminishes the character of the 
aboriginal people, that something happens to them and they become 
lazy and so on and so forth?  Could he perhaps clarify for the 
House precisely what he meant by that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is a physician and one who has spent time 
working with aboriginal people.  If he could quickly outline just 
two points on that second matter, what would his plans be for 
economic development for some of our first nations communities? 
What would he advise the Canadian people to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
parliamentary secretary for his questions. Unfortunately, he 
misinterpreted my statements but I will be happy to correct that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of a person's race, giving things to people creates 
an economic welfare state.  We have created an institutionalized 
welfare state for aboriginal people by giving them things. 
We need to give people, aboriginal or non-aboriginal, the power 
to provide for themselves.

there be an obligation to move forward from that.  I suggest also 
that we scrap the racist Indian Act, that we treat aboriginal 
people and non-aboriginal with the same rights and 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have addressed the two points.  Scrap the Indian Act.  Invest 
in economic opportunities.  Also we must ensure that there are 
political opportunities along the lines of the municipal powers 
that non-aboriginals have. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, my 
understanding is that in the fresh start booklet the Reform Party 
advocates that aboriginal communities should resemble or be 
structured more or less in the same way as a municipality.  My 
understanding at least in my reading of the Nisga'a deal is that 
is exactly the goal the negotiators of the Nisga'a deal set out 
to achieve.  The Nisga'a will have a government comparable to a 
municipality and subject to the Canadian constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the member point out where the Nisga'a deal fails to set out 
a structure like a municipality which would be in keeping with 
Reform's fresh start manual? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, the powers in the words 
of the premier of British Columbia create a new third level of 
government.  Clearly this is not a municipal government. 
Municipal governments are given powers by the province.  The 
province has the right to take the powers away.  This is not the 
case in this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The powers the Nisga'a government would have would fall under 
provincial and federal levels.  Furthermore, where there is a 
conflict between federal, provincial and Nisga'a powers, the 
Nisga'a powers would supersede the federal and provincial powers. 
Those are the two clearest examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is not the pursuit of political independence. 
The pursuit should be to create economic independence for 
aboriginal people by aboriginal people, political emancipation 
not political independence, but political integration with 
non-aboriginal people.  Only if we engage in political and 
economic integration while ensuring that aboriginal people have 
their traditional rights preserved as is done under section 35 of 
the constitution, will we be able to move forward with a liveable 
and effective society for everybody in the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the challenge for me in speaking to the official 
opposition motion on the Nisga'a agreement is how I address 
something in 10 minutes that I have been talking about since 
1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that both levels of government in their eagerness to 
embrace the Nisga'a agreement have manipulated the facts and 
misrepresented the public interest.  The federal government is 
imposing on British Columbia a deal it was not prepared to impose 
on itself in the Yukon or the Northwest Territories.  The federal 
government is imposing on Canadians a deal with the Nisga'a that 
the separatists in Quebec would welcome with open arms.  Contrast 
this with the federal posture toward Toronto, a city state that 
Ottawa refuses to recognize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The B.C. government through its eagerness is leaving hundreds of 
millions of dollars worth of federal transfers on the table by 
virtue of a poorly configured, poorly negotiated and one-sided 
federal-provincial cost sharing memorandum for treaties.  The 
B.C. government is a willing participant in an agreement that 
threatens the fiscal integrity of its citizens.  The official 
opposition, federally and provincially, oppose the current 
configuration of the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The great irony is that upon either party forming a government, 
their hands are tied.  The final agreement states that no party, 
federal, provincial or Nisga'a, may challenge any provisions of 
the agreement and any amendments require the consent of all three 
parties.  That is a veto. 
The Nisga'a agreement is to prevail over federal or provincial 
law in the event of inconsistency or conflict.  We must remember 
Meech Lake and Charlottetown.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1995, I presented my analysis of the Nisga'a deal at 
that time largely from an evaluation of the forest resource.  I 
projected the costs of settling land claims in British Columbia 
at $8.5 billion.  The provincial aboriginal affairs minister said 
that I was extrapolating figures from various sources in order to 
scare people.  Just seven months later the same minister stated 
that the total B.C. compensation package would exceed $10 
billion.  Let us remember that I said $8.5 billion just months 
earlier.  It was a very puzzling admission given his earlier 
statement and not a statement to inspire confidence in the 
negotiators.  Now some analysts are forecasting costs to exceed 
$20 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department of Indian affairs bureaucracy has used treaty 
making as an excuse to avoid responsibility and to cover its 
total failure at representing the interests of rank and file band 
members.  It has had a fixation on chiefs and high visibility 
events and politics has continued to take precedence over 
competent management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Native Indians have the worst statistics in the country.  They 
deserve better.  Canadians in general and the rank and file 
native population clearly place priority on solving social 
problems.  Instead, the agenda has been hijacked by academics, 
lawyers, advisers, consultants and self-serving interests in 
large part so that the focus has been on seeking unconstrained 
self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of 1996, the negotiators for the Nisga'a stated that 
their negotiation costs to date were $31 million.  Many people 
will say that would have been better spent in giving several 
aboriginal communities clean drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, I offered some specific recommendations to both 
senior governments.  Contrary to statements by the minister, 
Reform is in the business of offering constructive alternatives. 
Federal and provincial negotiators are non-stakeholders in the 
results of the local negotiations in rural British Columbia 
because they are from Ottawa, Saskatchewan, Vancouver or 
Victoria.  They should be at least regionally based individuals 
with some connection to the area under consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is finality.  Contrary to public expectations, 
the arrangement entrenches special aboriginal interests on crown 
lands outside the Nisga'a settlement lands.  The public 
expectation is that aboriginals would have equal rights with 
other Canadians outside the settlement lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point is that the agreement should clearly state that 
Nisga'a members will be covered by the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
Although this may follow from removing most provisions of the 
Indian Act, a clear statement that the Canadian Human Rights Act 
applies would be helpful.  Currently, Indians living under the 
Indian Act cannot pursue a case of discrimination through the 
provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act.  They are excluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now talk about some specifics regarding the Nisga'a 
government.  The agreement authorizes the Nisga'a to formulate 
and adopt their own constitution, which is exactly what Lucien 
Bouchard wants to do and this government rejects, at least 
for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lawmaking powers of the Nisga'a legislator are extensive and 
include:  to decide Nisga'a citizenship, Nisga'a culture, 
environmental assessment projects on Nisga'a lands and assets; 
to protect public order, peace and safety; the administration of 
justice; taxation; forest, lands and resources; fisheries and 
wildlife; subsurface rights; provision of social services to 
Nisga'a citizens; health services on Nisga'a lands; adoption of 
Nisga'a children; child and family services; preschool to grade 
12 education of Nisga'a citizens on Nisga'a lands; post-secondary 
education within Nisga'a lands; controlled possession, sale or 
consumption of intoxicants on Nisga'a lands; Nisga'a police 
services, including a Nisga'a police board; a Nisga'a court to 
administer Nisga'a laws and corrections centres.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If Lucien Bouchard was offered all this, would he say, “No 
thanks?”  This list represents a major divestiture of 
legislative power from the Parliament of Canada to what is to be 
in effect the parliament of the Nisga'a central government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from the Nisga'a legislature, there will be a bureaucracy 
to administer Nisga'a laws, programs and institutions.  The 
agreement calls for a number of boards to oversee a host of 
matters.  With an adult Nisga'a population of about 1,200 
residents in the area, one wonders who will not be working for 
the new government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Nisga'a government is to be given the power to impose 
taxes on persons or businesses that own and have interest in land 
within the area.  If such persons are non-Nisga'a, they cannot 
vote in Nisga'a government elections but they would pay taxes. 
This is a classic case of taxation without representation.  It is 
racially based taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Evelyn Gillespie, the NDP MLA for the Comox Valley, recently 
wrote that the Nisga'a final agreement provides the Nisga'a with 
a municipal style government.  She said this knowing that the 
people fully support municipal powers, as do I.  The reality is 
that no municipal government has any status under the 
constitution while the Nisga'a will.  This is the third order of 
government sought by former Assembly of First Nations leader, 
Ovide Mercredi, and rejected by his own people and by a majority 
of Canadians in the referendum on the Charlottetown accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nisga'a citizenship and not residency determines who votes. 
Would Jacques Parizeau not love to have that?  The Nisga'a 
agreement retains one part only of the Indian Act.  This is the 
very worst part, that which defines who is an Indian.  The 
tragedy of the Indian Act is that registered Indians are treated 
differently by government than other Canadians, usually to their 
detriment.  Why would anyone want to perpetuate this difference 
constitutionally?  A Nisga'a committee will review bloodlines to 
protect prospective citizens.  Incredibly this is what we are 
entrenching in our constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Registered Indians are 2.5% of the B.C. population of whom half 
live on reserves or pursue what can be remotely considered to be 
a traditional native lifestyle.  There must be a better way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would I do?  I will summarize it this way.  I would make 
the negotiating mandate public; compensate aboriginals for what 
the courts recognize as their modest aboriginal entitlement; 
establish aboriginal governments consistent with municipal style 
governments, similar to the Sechelt Indian government; subject 
the Nisga'a and all other native persons to the same tax system 
as other Canadians; ensure finality and certainty; and, keep it 
simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Zealand eventually tired of a never-ending agenda and did 
just that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have one question for the Reform Party.  If they 
are such believers in the rule of law and in the authority of the 
Supreme Court of Canada, then they have to accept all decisions 
by the Supreme Court of Canada and not choose between what things 
they like and what things they do not like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court has said the constitution is legal and 
aboriginal rights are provided for in the constitution. This 
Nisga'a treaty is based on aboriginal rights that the courts 
continue to say that we have to negotiate what these aboriginal 
rights are.  This is what this Nisga'a treaty is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Reform Party not know that there has already been a 
constitutional challenge in the B.C. court and the court has said 
that it would be more appropriate for the courts to consider 
questions related to the constitutionality of the treaty when the 
full legislative record is available to the courts for 
consideration.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do members of the Reform Party want to now, before passing 
legislation recognizing the treaty, refer it to the law courts? 
If they believe in the rule of law, and if our constitution gives 
aboriginal rights to natives, why would they say that those are 
not the rights they want?   They do not want to give them any 
rights.  They just want to abolish the Indian Act and treat 
everybody the same, denying aboriginals their legal rights? They 
are not such a big defender of rights for all as far as I can 
see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Madam Speaker, that question was not to 
the Reform Party, it was to the member for Vancouver Island 
North.  We recognize existing aboriginal rights as defined by 
section 35 of the constitution.  We are quite aware of that.  No 
one would argue the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are aware of the judgments that have occurred in the supreme 
court.  We are also aware of the myths that are propagated by the 
federal and provincial governments as to what constitutes the 
decision making by those courts and the spin that is put on those 
decision.  The aboriginal entitlement, the modest compensation 
that has been put forward consistently by the Supreme Court of 
Canada, is far different from what is reflected in agreements 
such as the Nisga'a agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out to the member who posed the question that his 
very own government has supported a variety of agreements.  In 
British Columbia we have, for example, the Sechelt Indian 
government, which has been in effect since 1985 or 1986.  It is a 
municipal style government.  I have no difficulty at all in 
endorsing the Sechelt agreement.  It very much represents the 
rank and file members of that band, with all of the 
accountability and democracy very much in evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only the Liberal Party in this place would suggest, as the 
member did, that we can achieve equality by not treating everyone 
equally.  I find this to be something I philosophically cannot 
buy into.  We should in every way be attempting to move people 
together not split them farther apart.  I think that is what 
divides the official opposition from the government on this 
issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I should give the House due notice that I am splitting 
my time with the member for Vancouver Quadra, who I know will be 
eager to speak to these issues and speak to them well and 
competently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise in my place to respond to the motion by the 
member for Skeena.  Before I go into my written notes, I did not 
have an opportunity to ask the member for Vancouver Island North 
a question, but perhaps I can make a comment.  He can respond 
privately to me later if he likes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make about the legislation we are 
contemplating here in the House and as part of the motion, is 
that it is not race based government at all. It is based on 
citizenry.  Anyone can become a citizen of the Nisga'a place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member for Skeena or the member for Vancouver Island 
North would like to undertake the process of becoming Nisga'a 
citizens, I could meet with the Nisga'a people.  Being 
non-aboriginal persons themselves, I would like to inform the 
House that I would be more than willing to undertake that if they 
are willing.  This would clearly and categorically demonstrate to 
them both that it is not race based government at all.  If the 
member for Skeena would like to become a Nisga'a citizen, I would 
make that application for him beginning today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Skeena, who put the motion for the 
opposition, has asked that the House recognize public concern in 
British Columbia over the Nisga'a treaty and self-government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say respectfully to my good friend that we on this side of the 
House fully acknowledge that Canadians in all parts of this 
country recognize the significance of the Nisga'a final 
agreement.  We know that the Nisga'a treaty will bring us into a 
new chapter in Canadian history.  Unlike the members opposite, we 
will not try to hold on to the ragged script that has governed 
our past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three of the members opposite used the words racist Indian Act. 
Perhaps they are correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the members opposite we will not try to hold on to these 
old ways of the past which they seem to fight against in their 
Reform Party rhetoric.  We will not enter into this new chapter 
of Canada's story without due regard for what has come before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will respect the rights of individuals and minorities and 
will pay heed to the independence of the legislative and judicial 
branches of government.  That is why the government could not in 
good faith accept the premise on which the opposition's motion is 
based, that we as legislators should abrogate our duty to address 
those matters of policy which shape Canada's history, its 
identity and its future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be irresponsible for the government to take debate 
about the Nisga'a treaty from the hands of Canada's elected 
representatives and place it in the lap of the judiciary, a 
judiciary I might add that has encouraged this most recently in 
the Delgamuukw case.  I ask the member to read the words of the 
supreme court justice and others who wrote that opinion to 
negotiate rather than litigate land claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member spoke about the $31 million that was used, for 
example, for negotiations and said, astoundingly, that it should 
be used for sewer and water projects. I absolutely agree.  If the 
member honestly believes that, would he then oppose his own party 
and help me here today in voting against this motion to stop what 
it wants to do with this motion which is to go back to court?  It 
is preposterous. Let us recognize the opposition motion for what 
it really is, a failure to respect Canada's constitutional values 
which the Reform Party cannot, will not and has not embraced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members opposite of the decision of Mr. Justice 
Williamson of the Supreme Court of British Columbia in the recent 
Campbell case.  In his reasons his lordship reviewed the basis on 
which a court might consider questions about the 
constitutionality of the Nisga'a treaty. Paragraph 11 of his 
lordship's decision affirms “the constitutional validity of the 
legislation”—and he is referring here to the Nisga'a final 
agreement—“arises only after the bill has been passed by both 
houses of parliament, received royal assent and become law”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words his lordship is saying to this House that he 
respects the rule of law and parliament.  He is giving us in 
deference to that, proper authority that parliament would debate 
this and pass this and the courts would then make their judgement 
on it.  Why does the Reform Party want to usurp that proper 
jurisdictional ruling by the B.C. court? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lou Sekora:</B>   Because they are racist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Madam Speaker, paragraph 11 of his

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Clearly the member from Coquitlam, in speaking out of 
turn was— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lou Sekora:</B>   You are racist. You know you are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Madam Speaker, that language is clearly 
unparliamentary. I would ask the Chair to ask the member to 
apologize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Yes, you are quite 
right.  I ask the member to withdraw his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a question of 
privilege.  It is not enough for a member to stand up twice in 
this House and call another individual a racist; he does it and 
gets away with it.  This kind of attitude and this kind of 
comment from the member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam 
is absolutely unacceptable.  I ask that you turf him out of here 
for a day.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on the same question of 
privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate has been heated throughout the day. When other 
speakers were in the Chair, there were remarks made from this 
side of the House toward NDP speakers, swear words, a common 
vulgar word starting with <I>a</I> that I will not repeat.  We did 
not bother raising a question of privilege or point of order 
because we recognize that in the passion of the debate things are 
said.  They were not said into the record. They were said during 
the debate and not on any formal record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seeing as these issues were not dealt with I would ask that the 
same latitude— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  This is the last 
point of order on this.  The hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Madam Speaker, let me put this into 
perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think one of the ministers just said we say it.  The fact is 
we do not say it.  I refer you, Madam Speaker, to rules of debate 
in Beauchesne's sixth edition. In citation 492 the word racist is 
one of the prohibited words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP member who just spoke is talking about something else 
that is quite irrelevant to the discussion we will be having here 
for a little bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The individual opposite, the member for Port 
Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam not only said it once but he 
said it twice knowing full well that when he uttered 
unparliamentary language in the House he could get away with it 
and all that was going to happen was that he would be asked to 
withdraw the comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I submit to you that it is not acceptable for an 
individual to keep repeating words and you asking for their 
withdrawal— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The Chair has already 
ruled on that.  The member opposite has withdrawn his remark and 
we will leave it at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order.  It is my understanding that when members rise in the 
House in order to be recognized for anything they may say they 
must be in their place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Port Coquitlam was not in his place.  Therefore 
I believe that the Speaker is in order to request a withdrawal, 
at the very least, while the member is seated in his place. He 
uttered the word racist on two occasions and continues to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  At this point I would 
like to ask the hon. member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port 
Coquitlam now that he is sitting at his desk to officially 
withdraw his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lou Sekora:</B>  Madam Speaker, I withdraw my comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Now we can proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Madam Speaker, thank you for your 
ruling.  I do appreciate it.  I believe my colleague from 
Winnipeg North was engaged in a similar problem with the Reform 
Party this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word racist was used a number of times in the House by 
Reform Party members in terms of referring to the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the debate there is no member of the Reform Party, the 
official opposition, since we came to this place in 1989, who has 
ever had the disrespect to call anybody in the House a racist. 
That is the lowest form of insult in my opinion.  For the member 
to suggest in any way— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid that we 
are now entering debate, so we will resume debate with the 
parliamentary secretary.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Madam Speaker, I did not suggest that 
any member from the Reform Party called any member here racist. 
I suggested, and the record can be checked, that Reform members 
referred to the Indian Act as racist.  That word was used in the 
House.  However I would prefer, if I may, to proceed with my 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I referred to the B.C. supreme court decision.  Mr. Justice 
Williamson states in his reasons in paragraph 28 “It is 
essential that the courts respect the right of parliament to 
exercise unfettered freedom in the formulation, tabling, 
amendment and passage of legislation.  This obligation is no less 
than that of the duty of legislative and executive branches to 
respect”—and I emphasize this—“the independence of the 
judiciary”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite should know that the contents of legislation 
and indeed the entire legislative record is relative to the 
determination of constitutional issues in this case.  It is often 
by this record that the judiciary deduces legislative intent. The 
proceedings of the House therefore will be relevant to any 
determination the courts are called upon to make on the Nisga'a 
treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the debate in the House is also important to all 
Canadians.  They deserve to know where their members of 
parliament stand on the issues affecting the country.  For that 
reason alone this is and will be a historical debate indeed. 
Would the member for Skeena prefer that his constituents not hear 
the full extent of his views on an agreement which promises to 
change the face of the region for the better? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the motion the member for Skeena has put before this House he 
implies that he is concerned that the treaty could be used to 
usurp, diminish or subrogate the individual rights of Nisga'a 
people.  I would put it to the member that if he were so 
concerned about the rights of the Nisga'a constituents, he might 
visit that area more frequently. I know that he has to clarify 
that in the House and I appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said before, I would be prepared to offer my services 
to him to mediate meetings between himself and the Nisga'a people 
who are eager to do that.  I am certain these constituents would 
assure the member that they no longer want the limitations of the 
Indian Act.  Even some of his own colleagues have agreed.  In 
fact, the Nisga'a have unequivocally said that most important of 
their objectives is to remove the Indian Act.  They agree and we 
all agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After more than 20 years of negotiation, it is important at this 
time that we ask the lawyers to step aside, that we pull back 
from the courts, we stop the debate, we fold up the tent as it 
were, and all the parties that are affected come together and 
debate that.  It is the House of Commons where we intend to do 
that.  We want a full debate on this matter.  We will have an 
opportunity to do that in the fall as we have talked about and 
promised.  The due diligence process that all our constituents 
require from us will be exercised thoroughly in the House when we 
debate these motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that history will show after the vote is taken in the 
House of Commons, that those who for whatever reason vote against 
this treaty will in 25 or 30 years from now be judged by the 
Canadian people, that while their opinions may have been right or 
wrong, they were on the wrong side in opposing this treaty. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, one of the biggest fallacies is that the public hear 
that this is just another type of municipal government.  It is 
not.  It is another level of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the question that the aboriginal people in my area 
ask me.  In this treaty will the aboriginal people be granted the 
same rights as other municipal governments? Will they have 
accountability, annual audited statements and all the other 
rights that we enjoy?  I say it is not within the treaty.  Am I 
correct?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Madam Speaker, all due diligence and 
proper procedures in terms of accountability will apply.  I 
remind the hon. member that the 14 points in the treaty fall 
within the three categories of culture, language and 
administration of their own assets on reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have said many times in the House that all other areas of law 
such as provincial and federal continue to apply, as does the 
charter.  I assure the hon. member those guarantees and 
protections will be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they are breached in any way there are remedies available 
through an appeal process to the B.C. Court of Appeal or to the 
federal court on those matters. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
parliamentary secretary is professing a great concern for 
aboriginal people and I am sure his concern is legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not the Gitksan and Gitanyow count?  Why was the overlap 
situation not addressed before this treaty was implemented?  Why 
is the government talking about a fiduciary obligation to 
aboriginal people on the one hand but completely cutting out the 
Gitksan and Gitanyow people who claim that 85% of the land being 
given to the Nisga'a in this treaty is actually their traditional 
territory? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote for the hon. parliamentary secretary's benefit 
Stewart Phillip, president of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, 
who represent a considerable number of indigenous people in 
British Columbia.  He says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fastest approach that government is taking to treaty making 
will undoubtedly mire indigenous peoples and the province in 
years of court cases. Until overlap issues are dealt with and 
addressed among indigenous peoples, no government has the right 
to enter into treaties recognizing title or rights to any 
territory.  I am outraged by these reprehensible actions.  The 
entire B.C. treaty process is not viable, is wide open to many 
legal challenges. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the parliamentary secretary not address that issue 
which is of vital concern to many aboriginal people, including 
people in my riding to whom I happen to talk on a regular basis? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find it quite 
extraordinary that the hon. member opposes 2,500 Nisga'a people 
who are his constituents and supports the Gitksan Wet'suwet'en 
and the Gitanyow who are not.  This is an oddity, indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last break I took the opportunity to fly to British 
Columbia.  I sat down with the Nisga'a and our justice lawyers to 
look at a mapping of the respective area.  Those boundaries are 
protected within the Nisga'a area.  We are certain that they do 
not violate the historical pathways, fishing or hunting territory 
of any of the other affected parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those areas that are under question, and there is a grey 
area, the Nisga'a have said that they are willing to sit down 
with the Gitksan Wet'suwet'en and the Gitanyow to discuss it. 
They recognize that there are familiar relations which go back 
historically.  They are not disputing them.  They want to sit 
down and reasonably negotiate.  Why does the hon. member want to 
divide those people and end up going to court again? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of 
privilege.  I think the parliamentary secretary in his 
intervention has led Canadians and people in my riding to believe 
that the Gitksan and the Gitanyow people are not my constituents. 
They are very much my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that my job as a parliamentarian is 
accurately represented.  I do represent these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I do not think that is a question of 
privilege, but on the other hand the hon. member has made his 
point. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
may I make several prefatory comments to correct the record as it 
has emerged to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty is not a template for the remaining 50 
treaties in British Columbia.  This point was politically made by 
the premier of the province and later withdrawn.  We recognize 
the Nisga'a treaty rests on its own special historical facts. 
All the other treaties will have a similar factual record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the Nisga'a treaty is concerned one of the key factors 
in its rapid negotiation in these last few years—it had been 100 
years in the making—was an essentially highly pragmatic 
leadership on the part of the Nisga'a people and a spirit of give 
and take and the absence at the time the negotiations were in 
full play, and I stress this, of countervailing interests 
concretely expressed. 
However it was always envisaged that this and other treaties 
would operate within the constitution and the rule of law and 
that the ordinary legal remedies apply.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to say on behalf of the very great former 
member for Westmount that there was nothing in Prime Minister 
Trudeau's approach that was incompatible with aboriginal rights. 
Quite the opposite.  He rejected the pathological nationalism 
that there was in Europe between the two world wars.  He was a 
strong believer in minority rights and in fact sections 25 and 35 
of his celebrated charter of rights are as a result of his 
accepting that they must be there.  They are provisions that 
preserve aboriginal rights such as they are.  He envisaged also 
that it would left to subsequent constitutional testing to 
determine their precise ambit and limit in concrete cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make some comments on judicial review.  The member for 
Sydney—Victoria earlier in the debate made the comment that 
there are ironies and contradictions here.  I have heard, I 
think, several semesters of debate on the evils of judicial 
review and judicial activism.  I wrote my first book on judicial 
review and judicial activism.  It is always interesting to find 
people converted on the road to Damascus, and I welcome that.  I 
would not reproach that to anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me simply say that judicial review and judicial activism do 
not exist in isolation.  There are not very many cases in 
Canadian law establishing the parameters, but it is well 
established in the jurisprudence of the World Court.  In one 
recent case in which I gave free advice the court quite properly 
said even on an advisory opinion jurisdiction that it must 
consider standing to sue.  It rejected an intervention by the 
World Health Organization, although accepting one by the UN 
General Assembly on the issue of the legality of nuclear weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically and in this context even in a specific case 
controversy there are limits to what courts with the proper 
respect that they do exercise to co-ordinate arms of government, 
like the executive and the legislature, may do and how they may 
do it.  In the recent ruling, admittedly by a single judge of the 
Supreme Court of British Columbia, the court has rightly 
established that the issue raised on the Nisga'a treaty was 
premature in legal terms, that it was not ripe for adjudication, 
that the issue was moot, that it should at least wait on the 
adoption of the relevant federal and provincial legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not any doubt that would be the position of the Supreme 
Court of Canada.  In fact when I looked at the motion here as it 
is given, with a certain degree I guess of poetic enthusiasm, I 
would wonder myself about any court ruling on usurping, 
diminishing, subrogating or other Latinisms of that sort, in the 
absence of a concrete factual record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have reached the situation of how and when native rights are 
defined.  It is not expected that the treaties are the last word. 
They are the beginning of an empirical case by case development 
in concrete situations.  What is good and sensible for the 
Nisga'a may need to be re-examined in the context of highly 
urbanized settled areas such as exist in Vancouver, Kamloops and 
Victoria.  This will be done in the treaty making process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to the compatibility or the reconciliation of the 
treaties with sections 25 and 35 in which I have a special 
interest, Senator Perrault and I gave advice to Prime Minister 
Trudeau on sections 25 and 35 and suggested their inclusion in 
the charter. It is always envisaged that there will be in the 
spirit of the common law an empirical case by case development in 
the concrete factual record of specific problem situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law is not frozen once and for all, for all time.  We have 
gone beyond provincial-federal constitutional compartment 
theories.  We recognize, in the spirit in which Lord Sankey 
established through the privy council 65 years ago, that the 
constitution is a living tree.  It has constantly to be adjusted 
to changing circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we do not do that in abstract.  We do it in concrete 
cases. The case controversy is crucial.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of us were involved in a negotiation within parliament, 
making parliament work.  New problems arose in connection with 
Bill C-49 that were brought to my attention after the all party 
committee had made its unanimous report.  We have laboured with 
the Senate and others.  The Senate has come up with a suggestion 
for the amendment of Bill C-49, which will be coming back to the 
House, that certainly renders it more compatible with common law 
principles and the charter of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some things were left out, for example the status of native 
women.  It is not a concrete issue in the case of the Nisga'a but 
it will undoubtedly arise in the case of some treaties within the 
Vancouver area.  I anticipate those will go to the court when 
particular persons and interest groups say that they are 
concerned about this and we will get a ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole process of treaty making rests on Jeremy Bentham's 
principle that the law is not made by judge alone but that it is 
made by judge and company.  The treaty making process involves 
the executive arms of government, parliament and the provincial 
legislature legislating to implement and the courts ruling on it 
when necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in the record of the negotiation of treaty 
rights to date that is incompatible with the constitution.  It is 
all subject to the constitution and the charter of rights.  There 
are sections 25 and 35.  See the accommodation made by all 
members of parliament and in the Senate in relation to Bill C-49 
after hearing representations from a very wide section of the 
Vancouver community.  These accommodations helped to bring the 
general principles in a pragmatic orientation, in line with the 
large constitutional principles and the rule of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to the members of the opposition that the motion 
is premature.  In my view it would interrupt the principle of 
comity which courts and others owe to co-ordinate arms of 
government to the executive that is charged with the negotiation 
of a treaty. Let it do its work.  Parliament is charged with the 
business of implementing the treaty in concrete legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If and when in the concrete legislation it is demonstrated that 
there is a concrete clash of interest between persons or groups 
within the community, then take it to the courts.  I have always 
argued that the justice ministry should help finance such cases 
that raise general constitutional issues.  It was done and was 
dropped in budget austerity measures earlier in the term of this 
government and it could be revived.  It is a constant, dynamic 
process of making law compatibly with the constitution and the 
charter of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite all members of the House to co-operate in that process. 
I thank those who have intervened in the debate, sometimes with 
asperity, but I take notice of the fact that it was said on both 
the opposition and government side that feelings were strong.  We 
tolerate asperity when it is in pursuit of good cause. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a very quick question for the member.  Why is the 
government prepared to give to the Nisga'a powers it is not 
prepared to give to the province of Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. asks a leading 
question that certainly goes beyond the legislation or the 
treaty. The province of Quebec is in its own process through its 
present government of asking for certain measures which the 
government considers not in accordance with the constitution.  I 
know of no parallelism between what is now being proposed under 
the Nisga'a treaty and what, as I understand from the record, the 
province of Quebec is asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said before that the Nisga'a treaty and all subsequent 
treaties are subject to the constitution and to the rule of law. 
It was our belief in relation to Quebec proposals that they were 
beyond the constitution.  That caused us to say that if there is 
any further referendum on this issue we would insist on drafting 
a question and on having the language corrected to show that 
fact, so people can determine it.  If and when an affirmative 
referendum arises, it will be political judgment whether to 
respond to it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Nisga'a agreement, as it is currently written, gives the 
Nisga'a the ability to determine their own citizenship.  I assume 
that would be something none of us would want to give to the Bloc 
or to the separatist faction in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is exactly the same as my colleague's.  There are 
many aspects of the Nisga'a agreement that would be very 
favourably accepted by the people of Quebec who desire to see 
Quebec as a separate state.  Let us be specific.  Why would we be 
extending to the Nisga'a the ability to determine their own 
citizenship when, if we received the same request from the 
separatists in Quebec, and I am sure we would, we would not give 
it to them?  What is the difference between those two things? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to repeat again, the 
Nisga'a treaty and all subsequent treaties are within the 
constitution and the rule of law the constitution represents. Any 
definition made of citizenship is subject to judicial review and 
subject to the constitution, as well as other constitutional 
provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Quebec may or may not propose is another matter.  However, 
if proposals are made that involve a conflict with the 
Constitution of Canada as it exists, then our position is very 
clear, we would approach that as a request to depart from the 
constitution and we would treat it accordingly.  The Prime 
Minister has made his views very clear on that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to continue to pursue the same issue that has 
been raised by my colleagues.  Specifically, the only power that 
has been asked about up to now is citizenship.  However, the 
member knows full well that in the Nisga'a treaty there is 
provision for overriding power, a power superior to that held by 
the provinces and this government with respect to, for example, 
fisheries, wildlife, adoption, culture and language, 
expropriation powers, health services, family services and 
education.  By any definition that is a country.  Again I would 
ask the hon. member, why is it more acceptable or equally 
acceptable to have a mini-state within Canada than it would be to 
have Quebec as a macro-state beside Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again we are using 
coloured language, coloured words.  We should stick to the text 
of the treaty and the basic assumption, which is not questioned, 
by the way, by the Nisga'a, the provincial government or the 
federal government, that it operates within the constitution and 
subject to the constitution.  On the only thing remaining in 
relation to the Quebec government, we can consider on the merits 
what is being proposed, but if Quebec takes us out of the 
constitution, then we recognize that a fundamental change has 
occurred.  The difference is as between night and day in the two 
situations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to be debating this issue today.  Coming from 
British Columbia I know full well the extent of the problems that 
many people perceive in aboriginal land claims, in particular the 
Nisga'a agreement because of the precedence it will set for all 
of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding in particular has several small aboriginal bands, and 
there are land claims involved.  It is not as big an issue as it 
is in some areas, but more and more people in my community, which 
is a good mix of rural and urban, are concerned about their 
private property and how it will be affected by aboriginal land 
claims, in particular the Nisga'a agreement. Many of the things 
my colleagues have said are very serious considerations that 
people in my community are wrestling with. For anybody in the 
House to think this is some kind of political debate to score 
points is very incorrect. 
Some of us happen to be closer to the problem than many realize.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I am not directly in the Nisga'a area, I am on the lower 
mainland of B.C., I choose to speak to this from a fiscal point 
of view.  Being an accountant, I suppose I would revert to that 
in this case.  I have always been interested in the consequences 
of the fiscal assumptions that have been made in many land 
claims, not just the Nisga'a.  However, the Nisga'a concerns me 
greatly because of the enormous number of dollars and cents that 
are bantered around by provincial and federal governments.  What 
scares me more than anything is that I do not think anybody 
really knows the exact parameters of the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we possibly settle an agreement with anybody in this day 
and age when the exact parameters of that agreement are not known 
financially, in particular since we are talking hundreds of 
millions of dollars; not $10,000 or $20,000, but hundreds of 
millions of dollars? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk from my perspective of the political problems in 
British Columbia, where we have the most unpopular NDP government 
in North America at the moment.  It is a government which was 
elected by 38% of the people, much like the Liberals over there. 
It does not really represent the majority of the citizens in its 
area, whether it is the Liberals from the federal point of view 
or the NDP from a provincial point of view.  If that is the case, 
the way through that to make sure that a government has a mandate 
from all of the people, because it has such a minority— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lou Sekora:</B>  What kind of votes did I get? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  The member for Port 
Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam is trying to harass me.  Can 
hon. members imagine that?  Boy, am I ever afraid of this fellow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lou Sekora:</B>  You are talking about 38%.  State the 
facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Some loser from Coquitlam comes in 
because he got lucky in a byelection and he thinks that I am 
afraid of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a government is elected with 38% of the vote, it would be 
well advised, whether it is federal or provincial, to go to a 
referendum and get a mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Did you not get 6% in Windsor—St. Clair? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I suspect these fellows 
across the way do not like me.  Do you know what?  The feeling is 
mutual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody:</B>  We love you, Randy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  I want folks who are watching on 
television to listen to this.  Out of 156 members of the Liberal 
government, there are five sitting in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The House leader for the official 
opposition knows the rules and he knows that he is not to refer 
to the absence of members from the House.  He is well aware of 
that.  I have had to rebuke him for this before and I know he 
would not want me to do it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I apologize.  I know that 
once in a while I get carried away, but I like people to know how 
many people are in the House of Commons when we are talking about 
an important issue like the Nisga'a agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that the only cost analyses for this Nisga'a 
agreement that have been available to the people of British 
Columbia have been the official estimates of the federal and 
provincial governments.  My colleague from Delta—South Richmond 
said that we had better get something a little more objective on 
this, so he commissioned R. M. Richardson and Associates to 
prepare an analysis on the cost of the Nisga'a treaty to B.C. 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That analysis has been made public and I want to express to the 
House some of the findings of the analysis with regard to the 
Nisga'a agreement.  If there is some doubt on the financial 
aspect, surely it would be prudent for any government and all 
politicians, regardless of what party they are in, to check it 
out, particularly if the numbers are at serious variance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what Richardson found on the analysis.  The total cost 
of the Nisga'a treaty, as measured, is up to $1.5 billion, in 
fact $1,515,800,000, compared with the official government 
estimate of $485.8 million.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Somebody might say that R. M. Richardson and Associates are 
wrong.  How far wrong are they?  Are they wrong by $1 billion? 
If they are wrong by $10 million taxpayer dollars should it not 
be the responsibility of the government to stop and check it out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the record of the NDP in British Columbia.  It does 
not matter to those folks.  They would blow tax dollars like 
there is no tomorrow, and for the NDP there is no tomorrow.  It 
does not matter to them.  However, there is going to be a good 
dog fight in the next federal election.  I would suggest to the 
Liberal government that it check out this $1 billion discrepancy 
on that item alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British Columbia government has underestimated crown land 
values, construction costs of the Nisga'a highway, forest 
renewal, B.C. spending and third party compensation costs.  We 
had better think about this.  Perhaps there is something wrong 
and we should check it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Non-reserve Nisga'a settlement lands, which constitute 
approximately 1,930 square kilometres, are valued at $406.4 
million, compared with the $106.7 million estimate of the 
Government of British Columbia.  This is not $10,000 or $10 
million.  We are talking about $300 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should not be about making everybody feel good and making 
sure this goes, being the champions of this group or that group. 
It should be for all taxpayers across the country because there 
are a lot of dollars involved.  We should reassess the situation. 
It should not be reassessed by government or government 
employees.  Let somebody else do the job.  That is what we did. 
It was a fair assessment.  There was no political ploy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the government to listen to what we are saying.  This 
valuation includes forest resources at $268.2 million, mineral 
resources at $13.8 million, water resources at $17.5 million and 
fisheries resources at $106.9 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the Nisga'a highway?  The Nisga'a highway will cost 
at least $87 million, compared with the estimate of the 
Government of British Columbia of $41 million.  This Liberal 
government, just like that, is willing to sign on behalf of young 
people and on behalf of seniors on fixed incomes who are going to 
pay the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are very few members on the other side who are listening 
to this very important debate.  The whole darn government should 
be in this House listening.

</I></B></P><P align=left>After checking the record, I find the testimony of the Auditor 
General of Canada to the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs 
and Northern Development to be entirely inconsistent to the 
question I posed about land evaluations that far north in areas 
of Canada with that kind of space.  I asked him what kind of 
acceptable accounting standards and practices would be used to 
make those kinds of categorizations and whether the Government of 
Canada was within its boundaries and properly understood those 
limits or boundaries with respect to those evaluations. I was 
told by the gentleman at that committee that we were indeed 
within those boundaries and it was acceptable according to the 
officials from the auditor general's department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who would the member believe,  Mr. Richardson, who I do not know 
nor do I think anyone in the House knows, or the Auditor General 
of Canada?  If he is an accountant, could he answer that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me clarify a couple of 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A parliamentary secretary in the House does what he is told on 
the government side.  This particular individual is here trying 
to defend on behalf of the government the whole Nisga'a 
agreement.  It is quite irrelevant to me if there is a motion on 
the table as to a certain aspect of the Nisga'a agreement.  I am 
trying to address something very specific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just a question of whether it is the auditor general 
involved in this.  That is what I said originally.  My colleague 
from Delta—South Richmond commissioned a private firm to do it. 
I would suggest to the government that it commission, and ought 
to have commissioned, several private firms to undertake a cost 
effective analysis on this thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a matter of just going to the auditor general and 
saying it has a variance of 5%.  Does the member know what a 
variance of 5% on one billion dollars is?  It is a lot of money 
to the Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premise I am trying to get across to the hon. member and 
those few Liberals who are here listening is that there is much 
money involved in this.  They should not just assess what some 
bureaucrats are telling them that this is what it is going to 
cost because they want this to be put into place.  They should 
not just assess and take the word of the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should commission a number of organizations.  It 
has time.  We have managed to get this thing deferred until the 
fall.  Over the summer, why does it not commission two separate 
firms to make a cost effective analysis of this?  If there is 
such a large discrepancy, which I am charging today there is, 
then it should halt the process, re-evaluate it and look at it 
not just from the social aspect of it, not just from any other 
aspect of it, but look at it as well from the fiscal cost of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is going to cost British Columbians and all Canadians a 
great deal of money.  The effects of it down the road will cost 
British Columbians and all other Canadians, by virtue of other 
land claims, a great deal more money.  There is a lot at stake 
here.  It is not just a one day debate that we happened to have 
called for in the House of Commons.  The government has time. Why 
not do it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, since 
the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford has asked for a direct 
question on the points he has raised, I will ask him a direct 
question on the points he has raised and that is the value of the 
land in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the member for Langley—Abbotsford can correct me on this, 
but it is my understanding that the land in question has all been 
logged.  The majority of it, up to 80% or 90% of it, has been 
logged.  The region is second growth and much of it is much too 
young to cut.  That was part of the reason the companies involved 
in this transaction gave it their blessing.  Can the member for 
Langley—Abbotsford comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not live in the area, 
but one of our members who does assures me that it has not all 
been logged, and I am sure that is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  There is no access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, regardless of whether or 
not there is access to the land, we do not say it has no value 
when it comes to any of our other forest renewal areas in British 
Columbia that have no access.

As most Liberal members are from Ontario or Quebec, I do not know 
if they understand what we log in British Columbia via helicopter 
from remote regions of our province.  Just because it is remote, 
it does not mean there is less value to it.  It probably means 
that there is greater potential value to it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am honoured to see that no Liberals have left.  There are so few, 
we would hardly even notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking to the supply day motion, I will begin by pointing 
out that in a court of law both sides have their experts and so 
to say that one opinion or two opinions represents what is right 
or not right in a particular case really needs adjudication. That 
is the whole entire point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attended a conference just last week on the Delgamuukw 
decision.  The only certainty that arose out of that conference 
was that certainty is the one thing that is not available from 
the Delgamuukw decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experts, while not a dime a dozen are in fact very expensive. 
However, they are certainly not in short supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supply day motion wants the Liberal government to ask the 
question, prior to ratification, whether the supremacy of the 
Government of Canada will still be in force after the treaty is 
ratified.  We are asking if it constitutes an amendment to the 
Constitution?  We want to know what it does does to individual 
rights?  We are simply asking for judicial clarification and that 
we hold the agreement in abeyance until that time.  That is not 
so terribly much.  It is about the bare minimum that should be 
available to people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have maintained a rather cozy relationship with 
aboriginal leadership and that relationship has not always been 
to the benefit of individual Indians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I found out, and I have not been here all that 
long, is that in the 1950s Indians could not sell the fruit of 
their labour and retain the proceeds.  Grain, for instance, had 
to be sold and the money was returned to the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development.  It was spent, of course, by 
the leadership.  Therefore, evolution is not always a negative 
process.  They now have that right but prior to that, with the 
agreement of chiefs and the department of Indian affairs, that 
was denied to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just recently, section 77(1) of the Indian Act was struck down. 
That is the section of the Indian Act that forbade band members 
who did not ordinarily reside on a reserve the right to vote in 
band elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guess who fought alongside the chiefs and councils to deny them 
that right?  It was the department of Indian affairs.  It had 
intervened to deny non-resident band members the right to 
participate in the election of the government of their reserves. 
It was a denial of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the Nisga'a land there are many members who do not live on 
the reserve.  We wonder, would those people have voted for this 
had they been there, or were their rights denied that way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-31 Indians who have, until now, been denied a voice in 
shaping the policies that govern reserves, of which they are a 
part, have finally got a voice in the government, in the way 
moneys are handled, in the facilities, program administration and 
all of these types of things.  They finally have a voice but they 
were denied that voice because they were not a part of the group 
that resided on the reserve.  We are saying that we need these 
types of questions answered in the Nisga'a case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mobility rights were denied by that section.  It had the effect 
of impinging on the mobility rights of Indians by requiring them 
to maintain residency on a particular reserve in order to 
exercise their rights as band members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out as well that the auditor general is critical of 
Indian affairs' mismanagement of taxpayer funds directed to band 
administered programs. 
He cites lack of legislative authority, lack of reporting 
mechanisms and characterizes it as dump and run as only a couple 
of instances.  We might ask who is responsible for this.  The 
Liberal government is responsible.

ask themselves if their motives were good, and they may feel 
their motives were excellent.  They may feel that their integrity 
in the process was above question.  They may ask themselves if 
they did this with full integrity and will believe they have, 
although I find that we question it.  However, it is their 
ability to negotiate and implement a modern treaty that is 
definitely questionable and the Nisga'a treaty is just one 
example of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point members to the auditor general's recent 
comments.  Chapter 14 of the auditor general's report on Indian 
and northern affairs, comprehensive land claims in section 14.16 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Parliament of Canada has jurisdiction in matters 
relating to Indians and land reserve for Indians, co-operation in 
settling claims is needed from the territorial and provincial 
governments with respect to certain lands that fall under their 
jurisdiction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is admitted that the federal government has the 
agreement of the current B.C. government, it is clear that there 
is no such agreement with the next Government of British 
Columbia.  Should the government not have negotiated a treaty 
that had all party support, one where when the next government is 
elected it is not seeking to overturn it by court action, which 
it is already trying to do, one that enjoys broad popular support 
and there are no regrets.  It seems to me that would be an 
important issue to have been addressed prior to the signing of 
the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a final agreement fails to create or address private 
property rights for Nisga'a people.  I think that is very 
important.  For about 130 years, Canada's governments have denied 
individual Indians the right to own private property on reserve 
lands.  They have been subjected to a collectivist approach to 
land holding that has termed traditional.  However, I would like 
to take issue with that statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to settlement by the colonial powers, the Indian people 
had a variety of societies within the boundaries of what is now 
Canada.  There were nomadic tribes on the prairies for whom the 
idea of ownership of land would have no meaning.  These were 
people for whom land as such would have no value.  They moved 
about with the seasons following the game which they depended on 
for their livelihood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, ownership of articles that could be relocated were 
really the only kind that had value to them.  I would like to 
list a few.  their dwellings were mobile.  Their horses were 
absolutely essential because the buffalo moved about.  If we look 
at their drawings and paintings from that period we see that is 
what they related to.  We do not see landscapes in their 
paintings.  I think that demonstrates a point.  No one would even 
steal land, let alone buy it because no one owned any land as it 
had no intrinsic value to a nomadic people.  It was useful only 
insofar as it could sustain them when it was necessary. Neither 
communal nor fee simple ownership is traditional to such a 
people.  The important thing was use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other areas of Canada, Indians remained in one place due to 
the relatively hospitable weather, the ongoing abundance of game 
and the fact that some crops could be raised.  It was a different 
type of society.  These conditions allowed for the creation of 
societies in which people built permanent houses and communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be safe to say that these people were not interested in 
communal ownership of their homes.  That is important.  Simply 
because they did not have a Torrens land title system in place 
and issue paper titles to their property does not mean to say 
they had no concept of ownership of property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole principle behind a title or a deed system is that it 
simply documents ownership and may indicate extent, or to put it 
in other terms, size, shape and location of property.  To say 
that a collectivist approach works there speaks against the 
reality of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated earlier, the reserve system of allotting land to 
Indians is based on the principle of communal ownership which I 
believe is not based on actual historical facts. 
It was created for the purpose of creating sanctuaries from 
encroachment by settlers to ensure a land base for Indians and 
their dependants.  That was certainly an important and necessary 
action the Canadian government took.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditional activities such as hunting, fishing and gathering 
country food were seen as major activities which would occur on 
reserves with a view to preserving traditional lifestyles in what 
was at the time a primarily agricultural and resource based 
economy.  That a different vision now exists in the context of a 
modern society based not on traditional but on modern commercial 
activities calls for a different approach to land holding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Holding land in common concentrates not only economic power in 
the hands of a few or of an elite, but political power as well. 
Many rank and file Indians are beginning to speak out on the 
issue of the abuse of power and conflict of interest, cronyism 
and lack of accountability on reserves where land is held in 
common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no denying that ownership of land has been an effective 
tool in the creation and distribution of wealth in Canada but 
only for those to whom it is available.  For the Liberal 
government to perpetuate the collective communal approach while 
refusing to admit any other approach that might recognize an 
individual band member's right or desire to hold a portion of the 
land in fee simple is a major weakness not only in the Nisga'a 
treaty but in the ongoing policy of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Nisga'a final agreement to be held up as a model for 
future B.C. treaties while ignoring this fundamental flaw is to 
perpetuate an ongoing injustice visited upon all Indians who 
desire something more out of life.  To be lumped into a communal 
system with no means of breaking out and experiencing the same 
freedom and opportunities afforded other citizens of Canada is a 
miscarriage of justice in my view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House should refuse to deal with this treaty.  It should 
send it back for revision on a number of issues which my 
colleagues and myself are highlighting today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
throughout the day we have been hearing Reform's reasons why the 
Nisga'a deal should be put to bed and that it should not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are really hearing is that any move toward true 
aboriginal self-government or toward the emancipation of 
aboriginal people should be squashed, because for some reason 
they are not ready for it, or they are too rife with corruption, 
or there is a mismanagement of funds.  For two years we have 
heard Reform members cite isolated incidences of the misuse of 
funds. They have tried to thread that together into some overall 
picture that aboriginal people do not deserve control over their 
own destiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just heard another speaker on this subject try to point out 
that there is mismanagement and abuse and that they are speaking 
out for the grassroots aboriginal people.  It is really galling 
for most of us in the House to listen to the Reform Party try to 
paint itself as the champion of aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently we heard members of the Reform Party, such as the 
member for Athabasca, say that just because we did not kill the 
Indians and have Indian wars that does not mean we did not 
conquer these people and is that not why they allowed themselves 
to be herded into little reserves in the most isolated, desolate 
and worthless parts of the country. Thankfully not all members of 
the Reform Party agree with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard Herb Grubel a former MP counter this.  He likened 
Indians living on aboriginal reserves to people living on south 
sea islands and being taken care of by their rich uncles.  One of 
them thinks they live on desolate little worthless pieces of 
property, driven there as vanquished people by the conquerors. 
Another one says that living on a reserve is like living off the 
fat of the government, like some guy on a south sea island being 
taken care of by his rich uncle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, the most recent speaker tried to be a little more 
sensitive in pointing out some of the true hardships that exist 
on aboriginal reserves. That is what I would like to comment on. 
He itemized some of the genuine social problems that exist in 
aboriginal communities and which desperately need some measure of 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation in aboriginal communities is a predictable 
consequence of colonialism.  It is like others in recent history 
who were driven off their land, vanquished and then suffered 
alcoholism, broken families and all those things. 
The most recent one we could relate to is the British during the 
industrial revolution. People were driven off their land and 
found themselves in ghettoized situations. Would the member like 
to comment on that analogy with his own history perhaps?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no disagreement on facts. I have been on many reserves 
as a land surveyor and as a member of parliament.  Anybody who 
has been on a reserve would not disagree with the facts.  Anybody 
with eyes can see that things are terrible on reserves.  They 
have been terrible for many years and if the present situation 
continues it will be terrible for many more years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that happened in Britain was a change in 
social policies.  It enabled individuals to take some control 
over their own lives while the government provided support along 
the way.  It is not so much on the facts that we disagree but it 
is on process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another situation in B.C. that was resolved with the 
Sechelt Band.  Nobody has any question about that.  It is a 
completely different type of land claim which does not have 
constitutional implications for its government but it does 
involve the land itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the final analysis it is fair to say that there are really 
only two visions in this country.  The Liberals, the Tories, the 
NDP and the Bloc represent one type of thinking on Indian 
affairs.  The Reform Party has put forward a completely different 
vision, that there is a possibility for individualism to make a 
difference in the lives of Indian people and that they could own 
their own land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I point out to the hon. member that I have relatives 
who are Indians as well.  They have done very well but they are 
not living on reserves.  They are actually landowners and private 
citizens within the Canadian federation and they are very 
successful.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe the Nisga'a treaty is the right 
thing to do for Canadians and for the Canadian government in 
recognition of the problems that have not been settled since the 
early settlements of Europeans in Canada. I quote from the 
Nisga'a chiefs who travelled to Victoria in 1887 and asked to 
settle this issue: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not opposed to the coming of the white people into our 
territory, provided that this be carried out justly and in 
accordance with the British principles embodied in the royal 
proclamation.  If therefore as we expect the aboriginal rights 
which we claim should be established by the decision of His 
Majesty's Privy Council, we should be prepared to take a moderate 
and reasonable position. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened is the Nisga'a accepted the white European 
immigrants settling in Canada and British Columbia.  They were 
asking for a treaty to set down their rights and different issues 
but they were denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is right that we recognize what the constitution has set out 
and what we owe to the aboriginal people.  This is a treaty not 
based on race but based on rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We always hear the Reform Party talk about this being a treaty 
based on race.  It so happens that the rights we owe are to the 
aboriginals who are a race, yet the rights we are giving back to 
them are aboriginal rights.  These rights are based on the fact 
that they were here first.  They lived on this land and the 
Europeans came in and intruded on their land.  They accepted 
them, yet their original rights were not recognized by the 
government at the time.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me, it is the right thing to do.  We might not be happy that 
we did not get everything we wanted in this treaty, but it is a 
negotiated treaty.  It is a balanced treaty.  That is the merit 
of negotiation.  The natives, the aboriginals, the Nisga'a would 
like to have a lot more than is specified in this treaty, and we, 
representing Canadians, would like to have a lot more and have 
given much less.  The merit of negotiation through so many years 
is that we have to come to a compromise.  We have to come to a 
balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support this treaty.  I think it is right for the nation and 
for British Columbians to move forward so that we have certainty 
in the land.  We can remove uncertainty so that investments can 
come back to British Columbians again.  The aboriginals, the 
Nisga'a people can have the confidence to move onward and to be 
integrated into Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing I want to address is the legality of the 
agreement.  The Reform Party always complains and challenges the 
constitutionality of this treaty.  It has tried to challenge 
this.  It has joined the B.C. Liberal Party to challenge this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, before I continue, I would like to mention that I 
will be splitting my time with the hon. member for 
Pierrefonds—Dollard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has challenged the constitutionality of this 
treaty yet it has already joined the B.C. Liberal Party to 
challenge it in the B.C. court.  The judiciary has indicated that 
it would be more appropriate for the courts to consider questions 
relating to the constitutionality of the treaty where the full 
legislative record is available to the courts for consideration. 
It does not make sense for the Reform Party at this stage to ask 
us to refer this matter to the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Reform Party always talk about the rule of law. 
They believe in the rule of law.  They believe in the 
constitution.  They believe in law and order.  Yet they choose 
the decision of the supreme court as support.  They believe in 
the rule of law, they believe in the supreme court.  This is why 
they want to refer this issue to the supreme court.  Very often 
they pick and choose what the supreme court decides.  They pick 
and choose what the constitution specifies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about aboriginal rights.  They are specified in the 
constitution.  Reform Party members say we should treat everybody 
the same.  Then what about these aboriginal rights that are 
different for aboriginals?  They say to treat everybody the same, 
that on the Nisga'a issue the solution is to abolish the Indian 
Act and treat everybody the same, allow them to be Canadians and 
then everything will be fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that position members of the Reform Party are denying the 
aboriginal rights of the Nisga'a.  How can they say both at the 
same time? First they deny the Nisga'a rights by treating 
everybody the same.  They are not the same.  Aboriginal people 
have aboriginal rights.  They have different rights than we have 
and which are guaranteed by the constitution.  If they have 
different rights, then they cannot be treated the same.  That is 
what the constitution says.  If they support the supreme court 
decision, then they have to agree that we have to give the 
Nisga'a different rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court said not to go there for a ruling.  It is 
going to be expensive; it has been proven to be expensive. It 
said that Government of Canada and the people of Canada should 
negotiate with the aboriginals to settle what the aboriginal 
rights are all about.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Reform members believe in the supreme court, if they want to 
uphold the rule of law, then they should support this agreement. 
This is a negotiated treaty between the Government of Canada, the 
Government of British Columbia and the Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Reform member previously said that the NDP, because it is so 
low in the polls, does not represent the people of British 
Columbia.  The NDP government is still the Government of British 
Columbia.  The notion of saying that Canada or the province of 
B.C. is governed by polls is a tremendous insult to democracy in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were governed by polls, according to a recent poll the 
Reform Party only has about 30% support in B.C. and the Liberal 
Party of Canada has about 50%.  Does that mean that the Reform 
members in this House do not represent the voice of B.C., but 
that seven members of the Liberal Party represent all British 
Columbians?  There is some misrepresentation in that argument. 
There are approximately 30 members of the Reform Party who 
represent their ridings in B.C. and there are seven members of 
the Liberal Party who represent their ridings in B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the right thing to do.  We have to move forward.  After 
100 years of negotiation, after 100 years of troubles with the 
Nisga'a people, it is time for us to move on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform complains that this treaty has some problems in that the 
charter does not apply, but the charter of rights does apply to 
the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again Reformers are wrong when they say that this treaty does 
not give protection to women.  The B.C. family relations act 
applies.  They also said that trade unions would not be able to 
organize under this treaty.  Once again they are wrong.  The 
labour law of the province and of Canada would apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of this House to support the Nisga'a treaty. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to remark on one comment made by the hon. member which 
has not yet been raised today.  One new idea has come up today 
that we have not heard rehashed over and over again, and that is 
that treating people equally is not the same as treating everyone 
in the exact same way.  Equality is not the same as treating 
everybody in the exact same way because it does not recognize the 
historic imbalances which may exist.  We should be shooting for 
equal opportunity or access to equal opportunity, and that may 
make it necessary to treat some people unequally in order to 
raise them up to the same, level platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from Judge Murray Sinclair of Manitoba in 
the Manitoba aboriginal justice inquiry.  He put it very well and 
in very short terms.  He stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Discrimination involves the concept that the application of 
uniform standards, common rules and treatment of people who are 
not the same constitutes a form of discrimination.  It means that 
in treating unlike people alike, adverse consequences, hardships 
or injustice may result. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the member for raising that very key point 
because it helps to defuse some of the misinformation that we 
have heard from members today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very closely to the speech of the member for Richmond 
in which he dealt with the issue of aboriginal rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens if an amendment is made to the treaty given that 
there is constitutional protection for aboriginal and treaty 
rights?  Will it require a more rigorous and more lengthy process 
to amend the treaty?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Raymond Chan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in answer to the hon. 
member's question, we have extensive, comprehensive legal advice 
from the Department of Justice that the treaty which we 
negotiated does not violate the constitution.  We do not need an 
amendment to the constitution to adapt this treaty.  The issue of 
constitutionality does not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the best of my knowledge, this treaty is constitutional and 
we should be able to move ahead without amending the 
constitution. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not believe the hon. member answered 
the question.  The question was:  Can this agreement be amended 
without a more complicated constitutional amendment formula?  I 
would like to add to that question:  Is it not true that it takes 
the agreement of all parties to amend this agreement?  Is it not 
true that this treaty will become part of the constitution under 
section 35, and protected under that section, and therefore any 
changes to it would have to go through constitutional amendment 
processes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Raymond Chan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to the best of our knowledge, 
from input from judicial experts, this is protected by the 
constitution.  This treaty defines the aboriginal rights which 
are protected by the constitution.  That does not mean that we 
have to amend the constitution to engage it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constitution specifies the rights of different peoples.  We 
do not need to amend it.  The courts continually define the 
constitution, to the best of the knowledge of those involved in 
the judicial system, but we never have to amend the constitution 
on those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the treaty is constitutional and we do not need 
to worry about a constitutional impact. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, with 
this agreement, which involves the Nisga'a nation, Canada and the 
Government of British Columbia, can the member explain why the 
Nisga'a people were allowed to vote in a referendum, which is one 
part of the agreement, when the Canadian people, namely British 
Columbians, were not allowed to vote in a referendum on the same 
issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Raymond Chan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that was how the treaty 
was negotiated.  It was agreed by all parties.  The people of 
B.C. are represented by the legislators which they elected, so it 
is not true that the people of B.C. were not represented in these 
negotiations.  The people of B.C. are also represented by members 
of parliament in this House and we speak on their behalf.  That 
is how Canada is governed.  Canada is not governed by referenda.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds—Dollard, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to address the motion of the hon. member for Skeena on 
the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The signing of treaties is an opportunity for a fresh start. 
Treaties signal our will, as a society, to accept responsibility 
for past mistakes and to correct them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treaties also represent a way to bring about positive changes 
and to promote the harmonization of our historical and cultural 
differences, so that we can all march together toward the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To gather our strengths: This is what the government pledged to 
do in Canada's aboriginal action plan entitled “Gathering 
Strength”. We developed an action plan as the first page of a 
new chapter on relations between the Government of Canada and 
aboriginal people. This chapter will be marked by the will to 
build the foundations of a future that is more prosperous and 
more than ever based on co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strengthening aboriginal governance: The royal commission took 
the view that the right of self-government is vested in 
aboriginal nations. 
The commission also noted that the exercise of extensive 
jurisdictions by local communities may not always lead to 
effective or sustainable governments in the long term. The 
federal government supports the concept of self-government being 
exercised by aboriginal nations or other larger groupings of 
aboriginal people.

direction and to ensure that the perspectives of aboriginal 
women are considered in these discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal people recognize the need for strong, accountable and 
sustainable governments and institutions. This means ensuring 
that aboriginal governments and institutions have the authority, 
accountability mechanisms and legitimacy to retain the 
confidence and support of their constituents and of other 
governments and institutions, to govern effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada will work closely with aboriginal 
people, and provincial and territorial governments, where 
appropriate, to turn this political ideal into a practical 
reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing the inherent right of self-government: The 
Government of Canada recognizes that aboriginal people maintained 
self-sufficient governments with sustainable economies, 
distinctive languages, powerful spirituality, and rich, diverse 
cultures on this continent for thousands of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consistent with recommendations of the Royal Commission on 
Aboriginal Peoples, the federal government has recognized the 
inherent right of self-government for aboriginal people as an 
existing aboriginal right within section 35 of the Constitution 
Act, 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, approximately 80 tables to negotiate self-government 
arrangements have been established bringing first nations and 
Inuit communities together with the federal government, 
provinces and territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal departments continue to devolve program responsibility 
and resources to aboriginal organizations. 
More than 80% of the programs funded by the Department of the 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development are now being delivered 
by first nations' organizations or governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1996, the administration and funding of cultural 
education centres was transferred to first nations' control, and 
management of the aboriginal friendship centres program was 
devolved to the National Association of Friendship Centres. 
Responsibility for administering training supports has been 
devolved through regional bilateral agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the north, the federal and territorial governments and 
aboriginal organizations are involved in a number of forums 
throughout the western Northwest Territories to discuss the ways 
of addressing aboriginal self-government aspirations at the 
territorial, regional and community levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Progress continues to be made on the establishment of the new 
territory of Nunavut, in which the self-government aspirations of 
Inuit of that region can be implemented through a new 
territorial government. In the Yukon, six self-government 
agreements have been signed and eight are being negotiated with 
Yukon first nations, while discussions are underway with the 
Yukon territorial government and Yukon first nations about the 
devolution of remaining provincial-type powers to the territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Self-government processes for Metis and off-reserve aboriginal 
groups exist in most provinces. In these processes, the federal 
government is prepared to consider of the variety of approaches 
to self-government, including self-government institutions, 
devolution of programs and services, and public government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these initiatives provide opportunities for significant 
aboriginal input into program design and delivery, and should 
ultimately lead to direct control of programming by aboriginal 
governments and institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New approaches to negotiations in the recent past have led to 
agreements on processes being reached with the land-based Métis 
Settlements General Council in Alberta and with the urban-based 
Aboriginal Council of Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building governance capacity: As the royal commission noted, 
many aboriginal groups and nations require support in order to 
assume the full range of responsibilities associated with 
governance, including legislative, executive, judicial and 
administrative functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government acknowledges that the existing federal 
policy and negotiation process, particularly in the area of 
capacity building, can be improved. To address this, the 
Government of Canada intends to include a focus on 
capacity-building in the negotiating and implementing of 
self-government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also prepared to work with aboriginal people 
to explore the possible establishment of governance resource 
centres. These centres could help aboriginal people develop 
models of governance, provide guidance on community consensus 
building and approaches to resolving disputes, and serve as a 
resource on best practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They could assist aboriginal people to identify the skills 
required. They could also play a role in supporting capacity 
development in the areas of administrative, financial and fiscal 
management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal women and self-government:  Capacity development also 
means ensuring that aboriginal women are involved in the 
consultations and decision-making surrounding self-government 
initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government recognizes that aboriginal women have 
traditionally played a significant role in the history of 
aboriginal people and will strengthen their participation in 
self-government processes. This is particularly relevant for 
women at the community level. Consistent with the approach 
recommended by the royal commission, the federal government will 
consider additional funding for this purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal justice: The Government of Canada will continue to 
discuss future directions in the justice area with aboriginal 
people. 
We will work in partnership with aboriginal people to increase 
their capacity to design, implement and manage community-based 
justice programs that conform to the basic standards of justice 
and are culturally relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also work with aboriginal people to develop alternative 
approaches to the mainstream justice system, as well as dispute 
resolution bodies. Programs will require the inclusion of 
aboriginal women at all stages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professional development in land, environment and resource 
management:  The Government of Canada, in partnership with first 
nations, intends to develop and implement professional 
development strategies in the following key areas: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Law-making: a primary vehicle for legislative and executive 
capacity building to equip first nations with trained personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lands and environmental stewardship: initiatives will be 
supported to provide accredited professional development 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Land and resource management: initiatives will support 
accelerated transfer to first nations of land management, land 
registry and survey functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Community support: specific capacity development initiatives 
will be directed at promoting the informed consent of 
constituents in aboriginal communities in order to help 
harmonize progress in governance with how community members 
understand the changes taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These initiatives will strengthen first nations capacity in key 
areas of governance and economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beginning in 1701, the British crown entered into solemn 
treaties which were designed to foster the peaceful coexistence 
of aboriginal and non-aboriginal people. Over several centuries 
and in different parts of the country, treaties were signed to 
accommodate different needs and conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaties between aboriginal people and the crown were key 
vehicles for arranging the basis of the relationship between 
them. 
The importance of the treaties is confirmed by the recognition 
of treaty rights, both historical and modern, and aboriginal 
title in the Constitution Act, 1982.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that in the memorandum of understanding, changes were 
made so that the Nisga'a first nation will have to pay 
provincial tax after 7 years and federal tax after 11 years. 
There will in fact, therefore, be revenues, something that is 
definitely very important. This will put the first nations at 
the same level as the other inhabitants of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to federal and provincial government revenues, since a huge 
amount of money will be spent in this region, the revenues of 
the two governments will increase. After some ten years, the 
figure should be approximately 25% of the cost to the federal 
government for the Nisga'a first nation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, is it also true that the 
Nisga'a government will not be able to tax non-Nisga'a residents 
on Nisga'a lands?  This is certainly one of the fears that we 
have heard spread throughout B.C. by the people who are trying to 
block the Nisga'a deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further along those same lines, in the case of income tax will 
the Nisga'a government and its corporations be treated the same 
as any other municipality, to the hon. member's knowledge?

whether or not the Nisga'a law would be superseded by provincial

means when paragraph 32 says that in the event of an 
inconsistency or conflict between this agreement and the 
provisions of any Nisga'a law, this agreement prevails to the 
extent of the inconsistency or conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph 36 states that in the event of any inconsistency or 
conflict between a Nisga'a law under paragraph 34 or 35 and a 
federal or provincial law, the Nisga'a law prevails to the extent 
of the inconsistency or conflict.  Paragraph 40 again refers to 
in the event of inconsistency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on.  I understand it says 14 times that in the event

whatever and federal or provincial law, the Nisga'a law prevails

me what this means?

Party has neglected to say is that certain laws will be under 
the jurisdiction of the Nisga'a first nation and there will be 
federal and provincial laws as well. If the member means laws 
concerning the environment or crime, the laws of the Nisga'a 
first nation must be equal or superior to provincial and federal 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be changes in some respects, but if the Nisga'a first 
nation decides to have laws on the environment that are superior 
to those already in existence at the provincial and federal

would apply in the Nisga community and what benefits they would 
bring to the Nisga'a people?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in two 
cases in Nova Scotia the Minister of Human Resources Development 
is violating the Canada Pension Plan Act by unilaterally defining 
spouse for purposes of the act.  The minister cites the M. v H. 
decision as if it has given him the power to unilaterally 
override every act that contains the word spouse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The M. v H. decision is about private support payments upon the 
breakdown of a relationship.  The Canada Pension Plan Act relates 
to spousal benefits which are linked to the public purse, an 
entirely different situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Pension Plan Act says spousal benefits are limited to 
opposite sex couples and the legal rulings at the supreme court 
level in the Egan decision support the constitutional validity of 
the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is ignoring the law of Canada and the courts to 
push public benefits to relationships outside marriage, all at 
taxpayers expense.  This is clearly wrong.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very 
concerned about the rise of college and university tuition fees 
across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tuition fees are one of the principal barriers to higher 
education for low income students.  Even though there are other 
significant costs, those students and their families are 
particularly sensitive to changes in tuition fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the federal government for its efforts to deal with 
this problem, including the millennium scholarships, the RESP 
grants and special measures for low income students.  However I 
urge the government to work with the provinces to systematically 
reduce tuition costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a national problem.  We cannot afford to lose the talent 
and energies of bright young Canadians simply because their 
families cannot afford to help them go to school.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Nisga'a treaty is a $490 million land claim 
treaty that gives significant self-government powers and 2,000 
square kilometres of land to 5,500 Nisga'a band members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some frightening and constitutionally questionable 
aspects to this treaty.  Until now, governmental power in Canada 
was divided among federal and provincial governments.  The 
Nisga'a creates a new level of government, the Nisga'a national 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new government will have power to tax without representation 
by virtue of its race based premise and to entrench inequality 
for aboriginal women.  The treaty will allow the Nisga'a to pass 
laws over timber, water, fisheries and wildlife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP government in British Columbia rammed this treaty 
through the legislature with closure.  Now the federal government 
is looking for a rubber stamp. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the Reform Party urges the government to refer this treaty 
to the supreme court to determine, before we proceed down the 
road of creating mini states in British Columbia, if the treaty 
constitutes an amendment to our constitution and if individual 
rights are usurped by this national government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the treaty is on solid ground, the federal government should 
welcome this determination.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to thank the Leader of the Opposition for his very 
pertinent question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it is a breakthrough and I am very happy that a minute ago 
the President of Finland made a statement that President 
Milosevic has accepted the proposition we received yesterday. 
That is subject to verification because now the NATO military 
people and the military people of Yugoslavia will meet to bring 
about the implementation of the agreement, and the eventual 
stopping of the bombing and withdrawal of troops from Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to go to the United Nations for a resolution to be 
approved because the troops that will be going there will be 
going through the authority of the United Nations.  It is much 
better than what we were obliged to do before with NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not sure because sometimes there are developments that 
could stop the process.  I want to thank the Leader of the 
Opposition and the leaders of the parties in the House of Commons 
who have sustained NATO in this endeavour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It looks as though within hours cleansing policies that we 
fought against will be terminated. Hopefully very soon the 
Kosovars will return safely to their homes and villages in Kosovo 
and that freedom and prosperity will come eventually after such a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

low.  This is despite the fact that Canada is one of the few 
nations actually participating in the NATO air campaign.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

United States minister of defence was in Europe.  He met with 
some ministers of defence of Europe who were having a meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that we are involved. In fact we have been 
involved since the visit of our Minister of Foreign Affairs to 
Russia and they started to talk about a way using the United 
Nations.  We were among the initiators of the meeting of the 
ministers of foreign affairs of the G-8 that led to the eight 
conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do think that both the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the 
Minister of National Defence have acted very well on that and on 
behalf of all members of parliament.  We have shown a solidarity 
that was reflected in the solidarity of NATO.  Apparently the 
policy has been accepted by Mr. Milosevic at this moment and was 
voted for by the parliament in Belgrade. We hope now that 
everything will proceed very swiftly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

Canadian forces will be deployed on the ground in Kosovo in the 
coming weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the equipment that our troops have but it is unclear 
exactly what their role will be in terms of its magnitude or its 
duration. 
Will the Prime Minister tell the House precisely what Canada's 
military commitment will be to back up the G-8 plan?  Will he 
seek a mandate from this House in support of that commitment?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, here is 
why controversy is swirling around the Prime Minister.  A Quebec

get donations to the Liberal Party. Convicted criminals and 
self-confessed embezzlers get millions in grants and the Prime 
Minister's own representative is being investigated by the RCMP.

making sure that his constituents benefit from the programs 
available from government.  Some have quite rightly said that 
they do not agree with grants, but we are not to deprive under 
our system our electors from receiving the money that is

yes, the Prime Minister does keep saying the same thing by 
evading the questions.  The question is not whether or not a 
program exists that supplies pork barrel grants to ridings. 
The question is whether or not the Prime Minister had a personal 
financial benefit in the arrangements surrounding the golf course 
in Shawinigan.  He denies ownership in those shares, but payment 
was never made for those shares.  Ownership was never transferred 
for those shares.  The Prime Minister continues to own those 
shares and has benefited from the transactions that occurred.

the hon. member for Medicine Hat.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PRIVILEGE

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>SUBCOMMITTEE ON TAX EQUITY FOR CANADIAN FAMILIES WITH 
DEPENDENT CHILDREN 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question of privilege arises from a newspaper article in the 
Toronto <I>Star</I> today. In that newspaper article we find a 
quote from the member for Vaudreuil—Soulanges who is the chair 
of the finance committee's subcommittee on family income and the 
tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that article the chair of the subcommittee comments on the 
results of a report which is yet to be released to the finance 
committee.  I believe that is a direct violation of the rules.  I 
believe that my ability to do my job as a member of parliament 
has been impeded by this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote from the article. The member for 
Vaudreuil—Soulanges said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have done that analysis and I think the general conclusion is 
that the tax system does not discriminate between single- and 
dual-income earner families because you have children— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is any appearance of discrimination in the tax system, 
it is based on two principles (taxing individuals and 
progressivity). 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is simply that we have a process whereby the reports 
from these subcommittees are to go to the committee that they are 
attached to.  In this case it has gone directly to the media 
without people like me on the finance committee having had a 
chance to see it ahead of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe my privilege has been violated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am not cutting the member off.  He has a 
serious point.  However, the hon. member for Vaudreuil—Soulanges 
is not here with us today.  I do not think that the hon. member 
for Medicine Hat said that this statement was ever made in the 
House.  Is that correct? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  That is correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I want to wait until we hear what the member 
for Vaudreuil—Soulanges has to say, if indeed he did say 
anything in that respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question of privilege will not be brought up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this matter will come up 
again when the member comes back into the House.  Do you want to 
hear submissions prior to that or will you give us ample notice 
so that we can be here to provide further submissions to what my 
hon. colleague just gave you? 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I think what I will do as a first step 
is wait to hear what the hon. member for Vaudreuil—Soulanges has 
to say. If there is other pertinent information, I might be disposed 
tolisten to it provided that indeed the hon. member did say what he 
was alleged to have said.  I am not going to take it any further. 
It will be one step at a time.  I will hear what the hon. member 
has to say.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have several questions for the government House leader today, 
as he might guess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I ask the questions I would like to take this opportune 
time to congratulate the hon. government House leader on 
completing his Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Waterloo

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  I know it takes a long time to finish 
those degrees. I have been there myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member one skill testing question 
on history. Is the hon. member aware if any Liberal government 
ever formed three successive majority governments in Canada?  He 
might reflect on that historic question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the government House leader if the House 
will indeed be sitting past June 11.  We hear that it is closing 
early. We were anticipating going until about June 18 or 21.  I 
would like to ask him if it will continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to bring the House up to date with 
regard to all legislation being brought forward to the House to 
the end of this session. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Not wanting to take the fire out of the 
government House leader, I believe there were successive Liberal 
governments from 1935 to 1957 but I could be mistaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate the hon. member too.  I think it is a 
wonderful feat and a good example for all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the opposition House 
leader and all his colleagues for the applause as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of three successive Liberal 
governments, this is bound to happen again soon because ours will 
be re-elected the next time.  There will be another Liberal 
government re-elected a third time. 
I will start with the business for the next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow we will consider report stage and third reading of Bill 
S-22 respecting air transit preclearance, followed by Bill S-23, 
respecting carriage by air.  I understand that these bills may 
proceed rather rapidly.  Then we will take up consideration of 
the Senate amendments to Bill C-49, the land claims legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Monday and Tuesday shall be allotted days. I would like to take 
this opportunity to remind all colleagues that Tuesday is the 
final day of the supply cycle which results in a day that is 
longer than the ones with which most of us are familiar in terms 
of votes and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting Wednesday next week, I intend to commence measures to 
wrap up some of the parliamentary agenda.  Let me give the 
following outline to colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Assuming that the bill has returned from the Senate, and I am 
told that it likely will, we will proceed with the Senate 
amendments to Bill C-55 as a priority.  We will then consider 
Bill C-54.  If an agreement has been reached, we could then deal 
with the impaired driving bill, but only provided there is an 
agreement.  I understand that some members have different views 
as to what the bill should include and we can only deal with that 
bill if we all agree on it. 
The bill is unnumbered and will likely be tabled probably as 
early as tomorrow. Hopefully we can arrive at a consensus on 
that.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would then do the miscellaneous statute law amendments act, 
otherwise known as MSLA.  Hopefully we could do that at all 
stages rather rapidly.  This could take us to Friday of next 
week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the week after, perhaps I should wait for the meeting of 
House leaders to be held on Tuesday before describing any 
business beyond that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to alert the Chair, of course the business I am describing 
beyond next Wednesday is only tentative and there would be a 
House leaders meeting on Tuesday.  I will endeavour to keep 
colleagues informed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Possibly, depending on the events in Kosovo there have been 
negotiations on particular procedures in that regard among House 
leaders.  Those may change depending on the events.  I intend to 
discuss those with House leaders as well.  Perhaps on a question 
next Thursday I could update the House in that regard as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ends my report.  I am sure we are all anxiously awaiting 
the re-election of the third consecutive Liberal government under 
the able leadership of the Prime Minister.

only with him to the extent that he shows such obvious and 
misguided enthusiasm for a third Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the controversy that has erupted recently over the head 
tax for refugees and immigrants, could the government House 
leader say whether the government intends to bring in any 
legislation at any time to remove the head tax for refugees?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  I am bringing this forward under the 
Thursday question, Madam Speaker.  Perhaps when I finish, the 
member could make his point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will there also be legislation coming in with respect to water 
exports?  This is something else that was promised by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona is on a point of order. We will finish with 
this one and then get back to the hon. member.  The hon. 
government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Madam Speaker, on the issue of water 
exports, there could be a bill introduced before we rise.  There 
is still a fair chance that we will be able to complete that in 
terms of having it ready for introduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other issue that was raised, that is to say the issue of 
a head tax, of course there is no head tax in Canada.  All 
members will recognize that.  If the member is referring to the 
landing fee, there is no proposal to table such legislation 
before we rise. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order.  As far as the procedure of the House 
is concerned, so far as I am aware, the Thursday question is 
asked by the official opposition.  Last time I noticed that there 
was another Thursday question asked.  If that is the case, I 
would also like to ask the government House leader that if Bill 
C-49 does not finish, how long will it go on, and how long will 
the MSLA take? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Madam Speaker, we are producing Bill 
C-49 tomorrow, the Senate amendments, and the miscellaneous 
statute law amendments act Friday of next week.  It is a little 
unusual that the government could answer as to how long the 
opposition will take to dispose of the stage of a bill, but 
hopefully it will be as rapidly as possible.

Madam Speaker, since we are going on with a long Thursday 
question, I would ask the government House leader what happened 
to the young offenders bill which has been touted by the 
government.  Millions of dollars have been spent on advertising 
and it does not seem to be on the government agenda any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Madam Speaker, it certainly is on the 
agenda.  Bill C-68, the youth justice bill, was debated on four 
consecutive occasions in the House of Commons.  The House and all 
Canadians will be aware of the extensive filibuster made by some 
hon. members opposite.  I am ready to refer the issue to 
committee by unanimous consent right now if members opposite are 
agreeable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I will recognize the 
hon. member for Dewdney—Alouette on another point of order, but 
I am afraid this is the last one I will allow since traditionally 
it is the House leader of the official opposition who asks the 
questions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, my point of order 
follows along that raised by my NDP colleague from Winnipeg.  It 
has to do with the head tax which he mentioned or, as the House 
leader likes to refer to it, the landing fee.  This was an issue 
that was brought before committee yesterday.  It was a compelling 
point made by members of the committee and Liberal members 
absented themselves from that vote.  Is that going to inspire the 
government to move on this very important issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Madam Speaker, procedure before 
committee is just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Madam Speaker, the government House 
leader has said that if there was unanimous consent we could send 
the young offenders bill to committee.  I would like to ask for 
unanimous consent to send the bill to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there agreement?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I hope you did not miss the point.  We have a Thursday 
question and now we have established a second question period.  I 
would like to ask you, Madam Speaker, to ask the table officers 
how this is going to work.  If we are going to extend question 
period into a question period for the government House leader, we 
want to be adequately prepared.  My colleagues are ready to ask 
questions.  We would like a clarification and we would like the 
government House leader to stay around a while because we have a 
lot of questions to ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must remind the 
hon. member that I have already made the point that traditionally 
it is his privilege to address the Thursday question.  Today we 
have made a few exceptions.  I hope the hon. member understands 
that this is not the usual procedure.

closure on this debate when it reaches the House in the fall.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It distresses me that there seems to be an unwillingness on the 
part of governments, both in British Columbia and here in Ottawa, 
to look at this agreement with an open eye, to really look at the 
document and try to answer some very serious questions that the 
people of British Columbia have and that the people of Canada 
should have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern that we have in British Columbia is that the 
precedent setting Nisga'a final agreement will have ramifications 
across the country and Canadians should be aware of what those 
ramifications might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already in Alberta we have Treaty 8.  There is talk about 
re-opening that treaty.  Treaties which have been agreed to and 
have been in place for a good number of years may be changed 
because of the final agreement that has been settled with the 
Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is also a concern from British Columbians' point of view is 
that the Nisga'a agreement will be a template for 60 other 
treaties that are under negotiation.  However, we should 
understand that those 60 agreements which are being negotiated 
now do not represent the total number of aboriginal communities 
trying to reach agreement.  There are a good number of aboriginal 
communities.  The first nation in my riding is not taking part in 
the treaty negotiations because it does not believe that it is a 
process which it wants to follow.  We are not talking about 60 
treaty agreements, we are talking about many more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this treaty has yet to be ratified by the House, which 
would put it into the position of being considered under section 
35 of the constitution, there are already four law suits pending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People can say it is just the non-aboriginal people who are 
concerned.  No, it is not.  The Gitanyow band from up north has a 
court case against the Nisga'a and against this treaty because 
the Nisga'a have seized up to 84% of its traditional territory in 
the Nass Valley.  Eighty-four per cent of the land that is 
claimed by another first nation is being absorbed in this 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A leader of the Gitanyow has stated that they are concerned that 
the Nisga'a were never required to prove the extent of their 
title to resolve the overlaps in land claims.  They feel it is a 
violation of aboriginal law and federal policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to one individual, it is not right to sacrifice the 
land entitlement of one nation to obtain a treaty with another 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just non-aboriginals, it is aboriginals themselves who 
have taken the Nisga'a to court to resolve some of the issues 
that are not clear and to try to resolve some of the conflicts 
which this agreement has already established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel very strongly in the Reform Party that we must settle 
some of the things which are not clear, the uncertainties, 
through the courts on this agreement before the House ratifies 
it.  How can we ratify an agreement when there are four lawsuits 
before the courts concerning its legality and the land it 
entails?  How can we possibly ratify this agreement with those 
four cases before the courts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One reason we brought this motion to the House today for debate 
is because there are so many constitutional and legal issues that 
must be clarified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard over the past number of months when we have raised 
this issue in the House the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development claim that the Nisga'a government will be 
subject to the charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read directly from the Nisga'a final agreement, which 
states that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies 
to Nisga'a government in respect of all matters within its 
authority, bearing in mind the free and democratic nature of 
Nisga'a government as set out in this agreement. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this agreement is going to recognize the charter of rights, 
why does it include “bearing in mind the free and democratic 
nature of Nisga'a government as set out in this agreement”?  Why 
does it not just say that the charter of rights and freedoms 
applies to Nisga'a government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the reason is quite simple.  It is that the 
government is wanting to leave the ambiguity in the agreement so 
that the courts understand clearly that they are expected to 
treat the Nisga'a people differently and not to apply the charter 
of rights as it would apply to any other Canadian.  I can think 
of no other reason than to force the courts to treat the Nisga'a 
people differently under the charter of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had many experiences in my previous life of aboriginal 
communities taking on responsibility for themselves.  I was an 
observer of 11 aboriginal communities in northern Alberta taking 
on the responsibility under the Lesser Slave Lake Indian Regional 
Council to provide education, welfare and social services to 
their people and to co-operate to provide good regional 
government for their people.  However, it was never done with 
constitutional protection.  It was never done by forming another 
level of government.  They were very successful over a large 
number of years in providing these services without the need to 
form another level of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia we have seen a number of cases where 
aboriginal communities have achieved more authority in running 
their programs and their communities, but they have not shown a 
good degree of responsibility.  I refer to the Musqueam Band and 
the Semiahmoo Band.  In both cases they were not fair in their 
treatment of non-aboriginal individuals within their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Musqueam Band has raised rents extraordinarily, out of 
reason.  One individual got a bill for $73,000 for 18 months' 
rent from the Musqueam Band.  Although their rents skyrocketed, 
the actual value of the land and their property plummeted.  It 
now has no value at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this is because of an attitude of an aboriginal people 
who are being supported by provincial and federal governments 
which allow them to completely disregard fairness and equity for 
non-aboriginals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also happened in my own community where there were nine 
non-aboriginal residents who lost their homes.  They lost those 
homes after 40 or 50 years with absolutely no compensation.  They 
were evicted.  I would question if that would be allowed to 
happen if it was a white Anglo-Saxon male making the decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are too many questions left unanswered in this final 
Nisga'a agreement.  The uncertainty of the legal status of the 
Nisga'a treaty and the Nisga'a government must be resolved in the 
courts before the agreement is ratified here in the House. Nobody 
can predict what the courts' reaction and decisions will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to the House that when the Prime Minister helped 
to introduce the charter of rights and freedoms many years ago he 
never for a moment contemplated that pedophiles would have a 
legal right to child pornography.  I do not think we can leave 
uncertainty and ambiguity in our agreement.  We cannot ratify 
this agreement.  We must be more certain of what it means and 
what its ramifications will be across the country. 
I would like to think that parliamentarians and Canadian people 
as a whole have a right to know what the legal ramifications will 
be before parliament ratifies this agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her interventions and 
interest in this issue.  I would like to point out a couple of 
inaccuracies in her observations and her comments and then ask a 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, she mentioned the Gitksan and Wet'suwet'en and Gitanyow 
first nations in terms of infringement.  These problems were 
anticipated many years ago and are included in paragraph 33 of 
the agreement.  I draw to her attention where it says that 
nothing in this agreement will derogate from any of the existing 
rights of other aboriginal people.  The answer to her comments 
and concerns is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it is not a constitutional document in the sense that 
the Manitoba act became part of the Constitution of Canada.  She 
is misreading section 35 which recognizes existing aboriginal 
rights in Canada.  It therefore follows that there is no need for 
a constitutional amendment.  If the parties want to change the 
agreement, as it is discussed and contemplated in paragraphs 37 
and 38, the Government of Canada can do so through an order in 
council.  It is absolutely not true and it is fuzzy thinking to 
suggest to the House that there is a need for a constitutional 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the process of the legal case, Justice Campbell of 
the B.C. supreme court, one of her own leading justices, has 
properly stated that this treaty should be debated in the House 
of Commons and parliament before any judicial activism is allowed 
to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again we point out the contradictions of the Reform Party.  On 
one the hand the member raised the question of child pornography 
and it wanted to usurp the courts and have it done in parliament. 
Now that has changed.  It wants to utilize the courts and bypass 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I could reasonably satisfy her by using the reasonable man or 
woman test and convince some of her constituents in South Surrey 
that it is not a document that necessitates a constitutional 
amendment, and that the charter does apply as it specifically 
says in the agreement, would she do the proper thing and 
represent her constituents by standing in her place and 
supporting the deal during debate in the fall when the document 
comes to the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
across the way for some of his comments.  He probably does not 
know, because it is not customary for his side of the floor, that 
on a regular basis I communicate with my constituents and ask 
them what they feel about legislation.  I have asked them about 
the Nisga'a agreement and I will ask them again when it comes 
before the House.  I honour their suggestions and their 
directions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about it not being a constitutional amendment, that 
is up for debate.  Some people feel that it is not a direct 
constitutional amendment that we are looking for but that it will 
indirectly become part of the constitution and will not be able 
to be changed by an order of council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is colouring the image when he suggests that the 
government can change the agreement whenever it feels like it 
with an order of council.  That is not so.  It will take the 
agreement of all three parties for any changes to be made.  As 
with the Canada-Quebec accord and with immigration, it is often 
impossible to get the agreement of two parties to change an 
agreement when one party would lose a lot of its benefits because 
of the change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member says that the charter of rights will apply.  Why 
is that addendum added to the application of the charter of 
rights if it does not mean anything?  If it is there it means 
something.  If it does not mean anything then it should not be 
there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the people of British Columbia and the people of Canada 
are asking for clarity.  They want to know exactly what it means. 
It is quite different taking something to the supreme court or to 
the courts for clarification prior to legislating than it is to 
have courts making decisions because of the ambiguity and the 
grey areas left in legislation by the government of the day. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, so 
far in the debate we have heard Reform members talk about some 
important issues in a substantive way:  the constitutionality of 
the Nisga'a agreement, the four lawsuits being pressed to try to 
stop the agreement from going ahead, and many other substantive 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, as I have listened to the debate I have heard 
members of the governing party and of the New Democratic Party 
pretty much spend their time attacking Reform and not answering 
the questions put after they finished their debate.  I am quite 
shocked at the level of debate from these two parties in 
particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are pretty much focused on imputing the motives of 
the Reform Party in terms of our stand on the agreement and on 
the motion today.  We have heard the Liberals present a lot of 
emotional, feel good rhetoric but not much in terms of substance. 
We have seen the New Democratic Party members seemingly bent on 
protecting the undemocratic process of their provincial 
colleagues in British Columbia, and I am concerned about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised and bewildered by what I have heard from the 
Liberals and the New Democrats.  The government thinks it can 
deal with a problem of inequality by enshrining further 
inequality.  To me it seems unfathomable to try to deal with 
inequality by enshrining in law another inequality.  Yet that is 
what the agreement will do in several ways if it goes ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The potential inequality when it comes to the division of 
property in the case of a divorce is one big problem with this 
piece of legislation.  It is troubling to think they believe we 
can deal with inequalities by enshrining others.  I am also 
concerned about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to an aboriginal task force process and report in 
which I was involved in my constituency over the past year or 
year and a half.  The aboriginal task force was established with 
me as chair for the purpose of hearing from grassroots aboriginal 
people the things that were most troubling them about the way 
their governments were working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From those people I obtained nine recommendations.  There were 
many more I could have put in the report, but I wanted it to be 
something that would be read by the minister.  To her credit she 
met with the task force and heard what we had to say.  These nine 
recommendations were from the people who were saying that these 
things caused the greatest problems in their everyday lives. 
These were their recommendations to the Indian affairs minister 
which they thought would help improve their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go through these nine recommendations very quickly and 
ask whether they are dealt with in the Nisga'a agreement, whether 
the problems that were expressed and the recommendations for 
solving them are dealt with in the Nisga'a agreement.  In that 
way we could evaluate how successful the agreement has been in 
answering the concerns of grassroots aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start by explaining a little about the process very 
quickly.  It was a three stage process.  The first stage was 
private consultation where none of the information that was given 
to me would be repeated.  It was done in strictest confidence 
unless there was agreement from the person who made the 
statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second stage was the questionnaire which was sent out to all 
the reserves and the towns near reserves in the constituency. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT68"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT68"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1540
<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third stage of the consultation process was public meetings 
where some of the key issues in the earlier part of the process 
were discussed in a public manner.  About 70 aboriginal people 
attended one of the public meetings in St. Paul.  We had an 
excellent discussion on some key issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go through the recommendations and comment very quickly 
on whether the Nisga'a deal includes them.  The first 
recommendation is in the area of financial accountability.  It 
states that the government must enforce more comprehensive and 
transparent financial reporting by band and settlement 
administrators.  This information must be freely available to all 
members and the general public.  That recommendation was getting 
at the lack or gaps in financial accountability, the most 
commonly expressed concern of the people involved in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Nisga'a agreement ensure that there will be 
comprehensive and transparent financial reporting and that it 
will be made available to the public?  It does not.  The first 
recommendation has not been dealt with in the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second recommendation of the aboriginal task force states 
that to ensure sound financial management on reserves and 
settlements the government must provide better financial 
management support for aboriginal councillors and administrators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recommendation is saying that leadership needs some help in 
doing a better job of managing.  It is a complementary point to 
the first one but focusing on what kind of help can be offered. 
One person said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Problems on reserves are the outgrowth of a system which at one 
time prevented people from leaving reserves, and at one time 
starved them. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was stated by George Forsyth, the administrator of the 
Onion Lake Band.  He went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You can't go from a system where people were watched over every 
minute to one where they are totally on their own, and expect 
perfect accountability.  The evolutionary process should have 
gone from control to help.  But there has been no preparation to 
provide an infrastructure for accountability. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Nisga'a agreement deal with this concern and with this 
recommendation?  It does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third recommendation, again on fiscal accountability, states 
that the government together with councillors and administrators 
must ensure there is effective, regular and ongoing consultation 
of band and settlement members.  In other words get the people 
most affected by the government, the people on the reserves, 
involved on a regular basis so there is openness and transparency 
about what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Nisga'a agreement deal with this?  It does not.  We saw 
some things that were actually quite shocking, including one 
member of a band at one public meeting saying that the band on 
that reserve had not called a meeting in seven years.  That is a 
problem.  There is nothing in this agreement that will ensure 
there will be ongoing and open consultation when it comes to 
fiscal accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another member said that the solution may be to require band 
meetings where people approve and forecast the budget.  What an 
idea.  What a concept.  A budget would actually be approved in 
advance.  It makes sense.  There is nothing to ensure that in 
this agreement that will be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth recommendation is on democratic accountability, a 
huge concern on the part of the people the Lakeland aboriginal 
task force heard from.  The government must establish an arm's 
length body or an ombudsman or agency to hear and act on the 
confidential concerns of aboriginal Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recommendation is getting at something that was heard from 
participants quite often.  When things just are not going right 
members feel they have no one to go to.  They cannot go to the 
council because that is where the problem is coming from.  There 
should be an available independent ombudsman to give the people a 
call or have them come in to deal with the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth area of accountability was in terms of having fair 
elections. Again what in this agreement would ensure fair elections? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, clearly the concerns that were expressed by the 
aboriginal task force members are not dealt with in the Nisga'a 
agreement.  That leads me to wonder whether things will be better 
for the Nisga'a people and I believe they will not be. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the concerns expressed by my colleague 
opposite.  However, I would submit to him that the actual place 
where systems of accountability and election and propriety, shall 
we say, should exist should be in the legislation, not in the 
treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the initiative coming from the Reform Party on 
the question before the House is premature.  I think his 
questions are more relevant to the legislation that will come 
before us in six months, or perhaps to different legislation 
entirely.  I cite for example the Access to Information Act and 
the Privacy Act.  These are elements of legislation that should 
address the kind of problems that he is mentioning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member has 
expressed a couple of more concerns about the way things are 
handled now.  I think he would be the first to acknowledge that 
there is no indication whatsoever that the Nisga'a agreement will 
help deal with those concerns.  Things will not be made better as 
a result of the Nisga'a agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully agree with the member.  True, maybe I have strayed 
slightly from the actual motion today, but I was dealing very 
directly with the problems with the Nisga'a agreement.  How at 
the grassroots level, at an everyday life level will things be 
better for aboriginal people as a result of this agreement?  I do 
not see any indication that this agreement will ensure that at 
all. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, on that point I would refer the member again to chapter 
1, article 13, in terms of all the federal and provincial laws 
that are not enumerated, those 14 areas enumerated in the 
agreement, those laws will continue to apply to the aboriginal 
people of the Nass Valley as they do today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out to the member that he is wrong in 
terms of the equality provisions.  We have said this many times 
in the House in answering questions from members across the way 
that section 15 of the charter of rights and freedoms guarantees 
those rights both to men and to women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, in contemplating the drafting of the charter of rights and 
freedoms women's groups were concerned it was not clear enough. 
Section 28 says that the rights of women and men apply equally in 
the charter.  Still further, section 35(4) was put in by the 
lobby group for the aboriginal women in 1981-82 at the amending 
conference to provide those guarantees.  There are those 
guarantees and the member is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is a good thing that the member has toured and has 
visited some reserves as some of the other members of his caucus 
have also done in the past couple of years. They must be 
commended for that.  However, I would ask him to come up to the 
Nass Valley.  If he would like, I would act as a conduit and an 
instrument to bring him to meet the Nisga'a people. He could tour 
the area and meet and speak with them, perhaps in more detail 
than his colleague from Skeena would.  Perhaps he could educate 
the rest of his caucus on what he found. I trust the member's 
concerns would be eased and he would be comforted by that.  Would 
he take the challenge and come up to visit the Nisga'a this 
summer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would really love to 
do that.  It is a great invitation and if I possibly can, I will 
take the member up on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must remind him though that I have about 30,000 aboriginal 
people in my constituency.  I have been on reserves.  I know the 
conditions.  I have heard from these people through the 
aboriginal task force process and every day of every week in my 
office.  They need help.  Things are not going well on their 
reserves.  The leadership is not accountable.  The money is not 
getting to the people for whom it is intended.  My first 
responsibility is to those people and that is where I will focus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the inequality issue, I have an interesting letter 
from Jack Gosnell the president of the Nisga'a Tribal Council. 
This letter was in response to the letter from the Reform Party 
member for Okanagan—Shuswap. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the letter the question that was being answered was how will 
you protect the property rights other Canadian women enjoy in the 
event of marital breakdown?  That is a concern I have. The answer 
is very short.  I will give just a short quote from Mr. Gosnell: 
“The nature of the property interest to be held by Nisga'a 
individuals in their residential property has not yet been 
determined”.  This was from Mr. Gosnell himself.  How can the 
member opposite say that he can ensure that equality rights will 
be protected? 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in my place today to respond to the 
motion by the hon. member for Skeena.  I will be sharing my time 
with the member for Wentworth—Burlington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased because I can use this opportunity to correct 
misinformation put forward by the hon. member who clearly does 
not understand what the Nisga'a final agreement is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take this opportunity to remind him of the reasons 
that Canada has signed this treaty with British Columbia and the 
Nisga'a people.  With the ratification of the Nisga'a treaty, 
Canada will at last be able to turn the page on one of the less 
admirable chapters in our country's history.  We will finally 
conclude the unfinished business of treaty making with the 
Nisga'a people, a process that has dragged on since the time of 
Queen Victoria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind my hon. colleagues that treaties are not new to this 
country.  In fact, this year marks the 100th anniversary of 
treaty 8.  However, while treaties were negotiated with many 
other first nations, most of the aboriginal peoples of British 
Columbia did not sign treaties with the colonial governments. 
With the exception of treaty 8 which extends into northeastern 
B.C. and the 14 Douglas treaties on the southern tip of Vancouver 
Island, the majority of first nations in the province have never 
had their claims to their lands and resources addressed, nor have 
they abandoned their belief in their right to determine their own 
destiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From our earliest days as a nation, the Nisga'a people have 
fought valiantly to have those rights recognized and withheld. 
Six years after the province of British Columbia entered 
Confederation, the Nisga'a chiefs began their quest for a 
negotiated settlement of their land claim and sought a treaty 
that acknowledged the Nisga'a people's right to self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1887 when they first went to Victoria demanding recognition 
of aboriginal title, to 1913 when the Nisga'a sent a petition to 
the Privy Council in London to resolve the land question, to 1973 
when the Supreme Court of Canada recognized the prior existence 
of aboriginal rights to lands and resources, six generations of 
Nisga'a people have patiently waited for their claim to be 
addressed. As we stand at the threshold of a new millennium, we 
must ensure that the seventh generation not only sees the hopes 
and dreams of the elders fulfilled, we must be sure they reap the 
benefits of rights so long denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only fitting as Canada closes the books on the 20th 
century that we embark on a new relationship with the Nisga'a and 
indeed all aboriginal people.  A relationship built on trust, 
mutual respect and reconciliation.  A relationship that 
acknowledges the mistakes and makes amends for past wrongs.  A 
relationship that recognizes that we will only move forward as a 
nation when we all move forward together.  That ultimately is 
what the Nisga'a final agreement is all about.  It is a crucial 
step on the path to a better future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the ratification of this agreement a new chapter will be 
written in Canada's history of which our children and our 
grandchildren can be proud.  We will enter a new era of 
government to government relations that finally and forevermore 
uphold the rights of the Nisga'a people to govern their own 
affairs on their own lands.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear that we are talking about a government 
based on rights, not race as some might have us believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The landmark supreme court ruling of 1973, commonly referred to 
as the Calder case, determined that aboriginal title existed as a 
legal right.  That historic legal decision led to the recognition 
and affirmation of treaty rights, both historical and 
contemporary, as well as aboriginal title under section 35 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treaty rights and aboriginal title are part of the highest law 
in the land.  Those rights have been confirmed again and again by 
the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent ruling, the Delgamuukw case, reinforces the 
necessity of reconciling the relationship of aboriginal people 
through negotiated arrangements.  Delgamuukw understood the 
doctrine of aboriginal rights stems from one simple fact:  when 
Europeans arrived in North America, aboriginal people were 
already here living in communities on the land and participating 
in distinctive cultures as they have for centuries.  The 
undeniable and irreversible reality is that aboriginal peoples' 
prior presence gives them status and rights as the original 
inhabitants of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government formally affirmed the inherent right of 
aboriginal peoples to self-government as an existing aboriginal 
right.  The Nisga'a final agreement reflects the commitment to a 
new treaty relationship and the negotiation of a fair and lasting 
solution to the longstanding land claim of the Nisga'a people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key word here is fair.  This negotiated agreement balances 
the interests of all parties and provides significant economic 
benefits to the Nisga'a and their neighbours.  The final 
agreement identifies how federal, provincial and Nisga'a laws 
will coexist and complement each other.  It establishes a 
blueprint for peaceful and respectful relations that will govern 
the lives of all people living within Nisga'a lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the House that more than ideals are at stake.  The 
rights of all citizens living within Nisga'a lands will be 
protected and promoted.  Everyone living there will continue to 
enjoy the same rights and freedoms under the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms.  Everyone will continue to be subject to the 
Criminal Code of Canada.  Federal and provincial laws that are in 
force for all residents of British Columbia will also apply to 
every resident living in the settlement area.  Surely no one 
could ask for an arrangement that is more fair and better 
balanced than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is equally essential to understand that the Nisga'a treaty 
will be suitable for the Nisga'a nation people but not 
necessarily for any other first nation.  This is a one of a kind 
treaty that reflects the unique needs and interests of the 
Nisga'a.  It reconciles modern Canadian realities with the 
traditional aspirations of the Nisga'a people alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a final agreement, completed after years of 
negotiations and extensive consultations, sets out clearly for 
all to see the rights of the Nisga'a that are protected by 
section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.  In addition to 
establishing a land based and financial settlement, it provides 
the Nisga'a self-government powers over matters integral to their 
culture, internal to their community and essential for the 
operation of their government.  It sets out their powers to 
protect and promote the Nisga'a language and culture and to 
safeguard heritage sites.  It enables them to provide schools, 
health care centres, roads, sewer systems and other 
infrastructure on a standard comparable to communities elsewhere 
in northwestern B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty will also contain provisions to regulate the Nisga'a 
fishery, manage wildlife allocation, forestry and environmental 
matters on Nisga'a land.  The Nisga'a will use, develop and 
manage these lands and resources to create wealth, wealth that 
will stay in B.C. and be invested locally in goods and services.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty will be the first modern day treaty in 
British Columbia.  It is finally time to get on with the treaty 
business in that province.  Treaties have been negotiated with 
first nations almost everywhere else in Canada from the time 
Europeans first began to settle the country.  Treaties are part 
of our history, of how we became a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The days of discussion and negotiation are over.  After more 
than a century of waiting for justice the time has come to honour 
the rights of the Nisga'a people.  In doing so we will renew the 
federation based on the full inclusion of Nisga'a people. 
Therefore I urge the House to vote against the motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
hon. member opposite used the word all in a number of comments 
she made.  There was one instance that particularly peaked my 
curiosity.  If I remember correctly she said something to the 
effect that everyone living on Nisga'a land would be protected by 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member define the word all or the word everyone 
in this instance?  Does the right of everyone under the charter 
of rights and freedoms include the right to vote for a Nisga'a 
council of people who are not Nisga'a but are resident on Nisga'a 
lands? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have to use 
my own land claims agreement as an example.  We have concluded 
our land claims agreement.  As a Nunavut beneficiary I can vote 
on issues that deal with Nunavut land claims, but people who are 
not part of the Nunavut land claims are not able to vote.  The 
land claims agreement is for specific Nunavut beneficiaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we deal with Canadian law, with municipalities and with the 
territorial government, everyone can vote.  It depends on area. 
As an aboriginal in title I can vote for certain things that deal 
with me as an aboriginal in the Nunavut land claims agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Madam Speaker, my question was not 
about voting on any thing.  The question was specific.  May a 
resident of Nisga'a lands who is not a Nisga'a vote for a council 
member to govern the land? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell:</B>  Madam Speaker, because I am 
dealing with my own land claims as my example I think they would 
have the same rules in voting for their band council as we do for 
our municipal councils. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people talk about not having rights in dealing with 
aboriginal issues, they sometimes give us credit that we have 
different rights beyond Canadian law.  I remind the hon. member 
that we are still Canadians and we are still bound by Canadian 
laws.  The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to 
every Canadian. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for Nunavut for raising one point with 
which most Canadians have a very easy time agreeing.  The Nisga'a 
final agreement is turning a page on a chapter of our history 
that most Canadians would rather put well in our past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we get closer to the reality of aboriginal self-government, 
right wing extremist groups all across western Canada are 
escalating their campaign to try to put any semblance of 
self-government to bed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member for Nunavut aware that the anti-Indian 
movement in British Columbia called B.C. FIRE was actually put 
together by a Reform Party member's staffer, a person who worked 
on the Hill for the Reform Party, on a salary from the party or 
from the government, really?  He quit his job here to go to 
British Columbia to set up what they call B.C. FIRE, which is the 
anti-Indian movement in British Columbia, working full time to 
squash any deals like the Nisga'a deal.  Was the hon. member 
aware of that fact? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell:</B>  Madam Speaker, no, I was not 
aware of that, but it saddens me to hear about such incidents. We 
tend to forget what role aboriginal people played in our history 
when Europeans first came to the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we live in a very difficult environment in my area, I 
can honestly say that if it was not for the help of the people 
there it would have been more devastating for people moving to 
this new country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I must say it is an honour to follow the member for 
Nunavut, because I think her remarks are very appropriate to the 
debate today.  I hope some of my remarks will complement what she 
has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin first by pointing out that the motion before the 
House is in my view very premature, because what it does is raise 
questions about the Nisga'a treaty when in fact what this 
parliament is all about is legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The normal process is for a government to enter into a treaty, 
either a treaty with an aboriginal people or a treaty with a 
foreign state, and for parliament to examine the text of that 
treaty and ratify it in legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We really cannot address the concerns being raised by the Reform 
Party members until this House actually has the legislation 
before it.  Then I am certainly prepared to look at some of the 
concerns that have been raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should preface my remarks also by saying that I am not one who 
believes that radicalism, as mentioned by the member from the New 
Democratic Party, is what is motivating my colleagues in the 
Reform Party.  I have had quite a bit of experience on the 
aboriginal affairs committee and I can assure the House that 
members on both sides of the committee room, those on the 
government side and those on the opposition side, share a genuine 
concern for the welfare of aboriginals across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My problem with the motion today, though, is not simply that it 
is premature on the Nisga'a issue.  It is that I think genuinely 
the members of the Reform Party, in their search for solutions to 
the problems that they see that are very evident in some of the 
aboriginal communities in their ridings, are addressing the wrong 
portion of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am one who, I have to admit, two years ago approached the 
question of aboriginal self-government with a lot of trepidation; 
but I have come to the conclusion, particularly after my time on 
the aboriginal affairs committee in which we saw hundreds of 
witnesses, that aboriginal self-government is a very meaningful 
way to go, shall we say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have heard many times today about what the courts say 
about treaty rights and that kind of thing.  I am not one who 
really believes that it should be the courts that determine what 
is the spirit of this country.  I prefer to approach the 
constitution and the charter of rights for the special provision 
for aboriginals to try to fathom the reasoning of my predecessors 
in according these special rights to the aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have come to the conclusion, and it was not very hard I have 
to say, that indeed this country is composed of three great 
founding peoples.  Certainly we have heard many times from the 
Bloc Quebecois that one of those founding peoples were those who 
spoke French and indeed settled New France. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another of the founding peoples were certainly the English who 
came in mainly via the 13 colonies and later settled the interior 
of Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other founding people were the aboriginals.  I do not think 
any of us should ever forget that there would be no French 
speaking Canadians nor English speaking Canadians were it not for 
the fact that the aboriginals taught our ancestors how to live in 
the wilderness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is that sense of those people who are still with us and are 
such an important part of us.  It was their connection with the 
wilderness, to the physical spirit of Canada, that has earned 
them a special place in our society that is reflected in the 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That special place as reflected in the constitution has to do 
with territory.  The reason the constitution talks about treaties 
and the reason why we talk about a treaty with the Nisga'a is 
that in order to express the cultural and historical connection 
of the various aboriginal nations with the territory, with 
Canada, with the wilderness, we have to describe it in terms of 
where they live and where indeed they still live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that it is Canada's aboriginal people who 
choose to live on the frontiers of our country, who choose to be 
the custodians of our wilderness.  Even though I am an urban 
Canadian, regardless of whether I am French speaking or English 
speaking or a naturalized Canadian, it is an important part of me 
to know that there is someone who is looking after and feeling 
the forest, if you will, feeling the lakes and feeling the 
sunsets in a way I can never do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit it is that incredible role of the aboriginal peoples, 
regardless of whether they are in the Arctic, in western Canada, 
in northern Canada or wherever, that is the great contribution 
they have to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are problems.  I think there are terrible problems in the 
interpretation of the constitution and the spirit of our 
relationship with the aboriginal people in legislation that has 
come since the charter of rights.  I refer very specifically to 
what was called Bill C-31, which was passed into law in 1985. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to address a problem with aboriginal women who lost 
status when they left reserves, when they married off reserves, 
has created I think a problem that should be the real focus of 
the opposition in this kind of debate, and that is the problem of 
defining aboriginals strictly by race and not by their connection 
to the wilderness or their connection to their own culture or 
their language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that law was passed, within five years between 1985 and 
1991, I think 98,000 new aboriginals were created.  Some of these 
aboriginals were created in my own community.  They were created 
out of people who had no connection, no memory and no thought of 
any connection to an actual band or piece of territory or 
wilderness.  They were no different from anyone else in my 
community and yet because they got Indian status suddenly they 
were awarded privileges: medical care, education and all kinds of 
privileges that were not accorded to other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have some sort of archaic mechanism whereby the Indian 
status is given to people, subject to an arcane questionnaire in 
which they demonstrate that somewhere along the line, maybe four 
or five generations back, they are related to an aboriginal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that is very wrong and it is also very costly.  The 
government has not done a study since 1991, but in 1991 it was 
clear just in non-insured health benefits alone it was costing 
$122 million to service these Canadians who were suddenly status 
Indians with no connection to the wilderness or to their own 
culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have a crisis at hand because what has occurred is that 
the supreme court has ruled now that all aboriginals who have 
status can now come back to the reserves or whatever band they 
claim to have a connection with and vote in the elections.  That 
distorts everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation out there where we have the people who 
choose to live on the reserves, who choose to live in the 
wilderness, to be custodians of the game and to look after the 
environment.  They are responsible. 
We now have a situation where people with no connection can come 
back and have the same rights to shoot the game, take the fish 
and vote in band elections.  I suggest that this is a major 
threat to aboriginal culture and identity.  This is where the 
debate ought to be:  The idea, the principle of going out to the 
land and finding a people like the Nisga'a and telling them that 
they have stayed on their land, stayed in their forests, stayed 
in their mountains and have looked after their mountains for 
generations.  The only way we can give them recognition for what 
they have done, and ensure that they will continue to do it, is 
to have a treaty.  We certainly want to make sure that the treaty 
protects the rights of all Canadians and protects the people 
living in the community.  It is ultimately the right way to go.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to go back and look at the legislation that created the 
so-called C-31ers, who in fact are drawing money away for no good 
purpose.  Many of the C-31ers are university educated and have 
jobs.  Some of them are actually working for the civil service 
and yet their children can have free schooling and special 
benefits.  This draws away from our ability to help those 
aboriginals who really deserve help because they are doing 
something special for the country, those aboriginals who have 
decided to stay in the wilderness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see I am out of time.  I appreciate the opportunity to make 
these remarks even though the motion itself does not approach the 
real concerns.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have to agree in regards to Bill C-31.  It has created 
quite a mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let us go on to the Nisga'a agreement.  Part of what 
the member said pertains to some of this.  Six thousand Nisga'a 
people were entitled to vote but only 2,376 were eligible to 
vote.  A lot of Nisga'a out there were not allowed to vote.  This 
has now created a problem where they are now taking their own 
Nisga'a people to court over this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member, the whole House and everybody out 
there who is listening, to understand that the B.C. Liberals are 
also taking this to court.  For anyone to say that it is only the 
Reform Party that has a problem with this, I want everybody to 
understand that the B.C. Liberals also have a problem with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a look at the neighbouring bands which have 
said—and I am sure the hon. member for Nunavut will understand 
this—that through this process they have now started court cases 
stating that their land is being stolen from them by the Nisga'a. 
These questions are all before the courts and still not answered 
but the government is still willing to bring this bill before the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member is telling me is that it is okay to take from 
here to give to there without due process of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am not sure exactly 
what the question is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately this parliament does decide, and that is actually one 
of the reasons I also have faults with the motion as it stands, 
because it makes an appeal to the supreme court, asking the 
supreme court basically for permission to write the legislation, 
when in fact we do know that if the legislation, when it does go 
through, is in contravention of the constitution, it will very 
soon be struck down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the end, whenever we try to establish something for 
someone, we are going to have some people who will object.  All I 
can say is that the real fault here is not with the constitution, 
and I do not think it is going to be with the principle of the 
Nisga'a agreement or aboriginal self-government.  The real fault 
is with these other bits of legislation like Bill C-31.  I think 
it really needs to be revisited.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to raise the issue of Bill C-31 in relationship to 
the comments my hon. colleague made.  It is a very complicated 
process.  We could have 13 categories of Indian people under 
different pieces of statutes and legislation.  The system was a 
man made designed.  It has its flaws in as much as there is the 
problem of those people who may have status who perhaps do not 
warrant it.  However, we do not know that.  I do not know that, 
because I have processed many applications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was adopted when I was nine years old.  I lost my status.  My 
grandfather signed treaty 11 as a chief.  I lost my status 
because I was adopted by a non-treaty family, non-status.  It 
took me a long time to get my status back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many people out there.  I want to know what the 
opinion is of my colleague on those people out there who I know 
are aboriginal, who have the background and whose parents were 
perhaps out trapping, hunting or visiting the nets, who are not 
registered.  It is just a technical issue.  They were 
de-Indianized or de-aboriginalized because they were not there to 
register.  For that very simple fact, what happens to those 
people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, Bill C-31 was expected to 
restore Indian status to about 10,000.  It has not given Indian 
status to around 120,000 or 130,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not quarrel for a minute with the original intention of 
Bill C-31, but unfortunately, like so many good things, it has 
created a different kind of monster that, in my view, as an 
outsider of the aboriginal community, is doing terrible damage to 
the aboriginal community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also point out that in communities such as Winnipeg, where 
there are so many urban aboriginals, we have people in poverty 
and some of them being treated differently simply because of 
their race.  It is the wrong thing to do.  We need to revisit it 
and still maintain the original intention, but it still needs a 
fix.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
thrilled to hear some of the comments the hon. member opposite 
made congratulating the Nisga'a people for the work they have 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to pay special tribute to the hon. member who spoke 
just a minute ago.  I found myself very much in sympathy with 
lifting the level of debate to issues that go beyond some of what 
I would like to call the stuff of the treaty.  I think the issue 
is far deeper and far more significant than that.  I recognize 
that the hon. member has also recognized that and is coming to 
grips with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also need to make a point and put on the record my utter and 
complete disassociation from what I believe the hon. member for 
Winnipeg Centre suggested, that somehow I or my colleagues are 
associated with B.C. FIRE.  Let it be absolutely clear that we 
are not associated or in any way connected with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also referred to a particular gentleman who may have at one 
time worked for an MP.  It should also be known that he is not 
working for an MP and that there is absolutely no way that I or 
any of my colleagues, to the best of my knowledge, are in any way 
associated with that particular organization.  I really want to 
underscore that because my heart goes out to the way in which the 
aboriginal people in Canada have been treated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Western Arctic spoke from her heart and I 
really appreciate that.  I have met a number of aboriginal people 
and they have not had a treaty.  The Nisga'a people have not had 
a treaty.  It is good that they do have a treaty.  They have 
negotiated for many years and they have negotiated well.  In 
fact, I think they have negotiated a little bit too well in some 
areas, but that is another issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to lift this beyond the complicating factors:  that the 
boundaries are in dispute; that there are three bands that want 
the same land; that the B.C. Legislature made a mockery of the 
democratic process by cutting the debate; and, that there is 
uncertainty about the constitutional implications.  I do not want 
to get into that too much because I do not think that is the 
primary issue here. 
I agree with the hon. secretary when he says that constitutional 
amendments are probably not required.  That may well be the case. 
I think the issue is the implications of the provisions in the 
constitution and the provisions in the treaty itself.  That is 
not clear right now.  It is before the courts at the moment.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really want to focus on two issues: democracy and citizenship. 
The first issue is about democracy and the business of 
accountability.  I am going to put democracy or democratic 
accountability close together.  It seems to me that there are 
four characteristics of a democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first principle of a good democratic organization is that 
there must be the substance of a genuine control of the 
leadership by those who are governed.  That means that there has 
to be representation and the representation is selected by 
election and not by heredity.  This is a very interesting 
concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it was way back in 1215 when the Magna Carta was passed 
and where King John, I think it was, was denied his divine right 
to be king.  There has been nothing in our democratic process 
since that time that would suggest that we have the right to be 
somewhere simply because of a certain heredity in terms of the 
way we want to govern ourselves.  The whole democracy of our 
country today rests on the fact of one person, one vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other part of that is that we are equal.  We are different. 
Madam Speaker, you and I are different.  I am different from any 
other member of the House, but before the law of this land and 
for the constitution that governs us in our noble institution 
here, we are equal.  I think that is desirable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second principle is that there must be a clear and accurate 
information flow so that on matters of public importance we know 
what is going on. Let us take, for example, the issue of the 
conflict in Kosovo right now.  We need accurate and complete 
information in order to make good decisions about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third principle is that there must be regular opportunities 
to vote on who shall lead us.  That does happen in the House and 
that needs to happen. People will argue that those three 
principles are indeed contained in the treaty, and I am not going 
to argue that they are not.  However, I will come to grips with 
the fourth principle, which is that we must have the ability for 
a free vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that there is a particular difficulty in this 
treaty because we are dealing with a very small government with 
very large powers.  The Nisga'a Council will have very large 
powers but will have difficulty providing an honest free vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote an analysis that was done by Gordon Gibson.  I 
want to get into some detail here: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small governments with large powers may acquire the ability to 
control citizens rather than vice versa...Top down control is 
easier in small situations.  This is a worldwide phenomenon, 
totally independent of culture. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed Nisga'a government, a small one, would have very 
large powers.  What are they?  Because most cash resources in the 
economy will flow through the Nisga'a government by virtue of the 
terms of the treaty, people will be uncommonly dependent upon and 
beholden to that government.  The dependence will not merely be 
for municipal type services, but also for matters of intense and 
immediate importance to the individuals concerned; matters such 
as housing, social assistance and even employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a state will control so many things.  Health and 
education will presumably be available to all, but higher 
education and extraordinary health measures will be rationed and 
discretionary, as they always are.  There will be strong and 
obvious incentives for citizens of this government to go along 
with those in power in order to get on with their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem of democratic accountability is escalated because 
the Nisga'a government will largely be using other people's money 
through federal and provincial transfers flowing through the 
Nisga'a state.  Is this in any way an aspersion on the Nisga'a? 
It is not.  When local taxpayers pay the bills, they have a 
powerful incentive to control their governments, and that applies 
to all of us as well as it does to anyone else.  When bills are 
paid by outsiders instead, the locally governed have every 
incentive to conspire with the local government to extract 
maximum gain from external sources rather than prudently use the 
available resources.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, you know as well as most people that people 
manage their own money a little more carefully than they manage 
money which belongs to others.  Sometimes that is not the case, 
but usually it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tom Flanagan from the University of Calgary stated this very 
well when he said:  “Just as you shouldn't have taxation without 
representation, nor are you likely to get good representation 
without full taxation”.  It works both ways.  So much for 
democratic accountability.  I have just touched the surface on 
the whole question of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to briefly discuss the issue of citizenship.  Citizenship 
under the Nisga'a treaty is determined on a hereditary basis, not 
on the basis of residence.  Voting is on that basis.  Only 
Nisga'a citizens may vote.  It is a birth right which allows them 
to vote under this treaty.  That does not exist anywhere else in 
Canada.  In Canada it is determined upon where people reside. 
That is a fundamental principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have a situation where there are Nisga'a who reside on 
Nisga'a land and Nisga'a who reside off Nisga'a land.  Both of 
these groups have the right to vote.  However, those who reside 
off the land can only vote for three councillors, yet there are 
30.  There is disproportionate representation for those who are 
off the land and those who are on the land.  In effect it creates 
two classes of Nisga'a citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not all it does.  There are other rights and privileges 
given on the basis of the constitution to the Nisga'a people that 
are not given to other Canadians.  We have three classes of 
citizens.  We have two classes of Nisga'a and then there is a 
difference between all Nisga'a people and other Canadians. We 
should be equal before the law.  We should not create separate 
citizenship questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just the beginning.  I encourage the House to give very 
serious debate to these issues.  They are at the root of and are 
the fundamental basis of what needs to happen in terms of giving 
all people in Canada the right to vote, the right to be 
represented equally and responsibly, and the right to be in 
control of their own affairs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the hon. member began his remarks by trying to distance himself 
from B.C. FIRE, the hate movement or the anti-Indian 
movement in B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an interview on CBC television, journalist Carol Off was 
interviewing Mel Smith, the author of <I>Our Home or Native 
Land?:  What Government's Aboriginal Policy is Doing to 
Canada</I>.  That is the book which has become the bible for the 
B.C. anti-Indian movement and is often quoted by the Reform 
Party. In fact, the Reform Party hired Mel Smith to head up its 
Indian task force hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ms. Off said:  “In fact, a lot of FIRE organizers have 
Reform connections.  Brian Richardson is running for the Reform 
Party in the next federal election (the 1997 election).  Greg 
Hollingsworth was on the payroll of the Reform Party until he 
left to start B.C. FIRE.  Georgeanne Sanders, who was an activist 
in the Okanagan and who was active in B.C. FIRE, is a member of 
the Reform Party.  So are Marcia Gilbert and Judy Kilgour both 
prominent members in the anti-Indian movement in the Okanagan. 
Preston Manning only announced Reform's Indian policy last month, 
but yet it bears a striking resemblance to the policy of B.C. 
FIRE”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Carol Off is a credible journalist with the CBC.  She found in 
her own research example after example of direct links to the 
hate movement, the people who are promoting hatred in British 
Columbia.  I am not saying it is the Reform Party that is 
promoting hatred; I am saying it is intricately linked with the 
people who are promoting hatred.  We all know it is a lot easier 
to promote hatred than it is to promote tolerance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Madam Speaker, I regret both the tone 
of voice and the content of what the hon. member has just said. 
There may indeed be people within the Reform Party who have 
contacts.  I did not say that in my opening remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have freedom in this country; freedom to speak and freedom to 
associate.  I was speaking very personally.  I want it to be 
abundantly clear that I am not in any way associated with the 
FIRE movement. 
I have no intentions of becoming associated with that movement. I 
make it abundantly clear as well that we are not here as the 
Reform Party, either as individuals or as a party, to in any way 
stand in the way of an amicable settlement of the question of 
land claims and the self-governance which aboriginal people in 
Canada want.  We want that as much as anyone else.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very concerned that Canada be a united nation and that it 
provide rights, privileges and equality for all of its citizens. 
We are deeply concerned that if we should countenance the 
development of issues and of decisions that might be made, which 
in their implications and in their future adaptation, application 
and interpretation may lead to the creation, as I pointed out, of 
three or four different classes of Canadian citizens, that will 
begin to create the kind of conflict that we have just witnessed 
in central Asia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the deep concern that I have.  It does not help to point 
fingers at individuals who may have been indiscreet in some of 
their remarks.  I appeal to the member for Winnipeg Centre and to 
all members that we are here to try to build solid relationships 
of co-operation where we can together build a strong nation, a 
strong community where we can develop freedom from fear, where we 
can help one another and indeed get to the point where we can 
actually love one another.  I extend that to my hon. colleague as 
well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I take it as a great privilege to be able to bring this issue to 
the floor of the House of Commons as the Reform Party has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an exceptionally important issue, I believe, to all 
Canadians, in particular people in the province of British 
Columbia.  As this treaty ends up becoming a template over a 
period of time it is going to undoubtedly have a tremendous 
impact on future treaties and future negotiations and the future 
reopening of existing treaties which are currently in place in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take the House back to 1993 when I was elected 
for the first time.  When my colleagues and I arrived in Ottawa 
we were all fired up, ready to take on the establishment and to 
discuss important issues on behalf of our constituents.  We were 
in for something of a surprise.  We were informed that there were 
certain issues that we could not discuss or question.  We were 
told that it was politically incorrect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal department that immediately raised questions for 
myself and I am sure many of my colleagues was the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development.  We were aware of many 
of the serious problems that our aboriginal brothers and sisters 
were having both on and off reserve.  Politically incorrect or 
not, we were determined to create positive change. We were 
determined to speak out on aboriginal issues and reserve issues, 
the major issue being that of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will reflect for a moment on comments made by my colleague who 
preceded me.  Unfortunately at that particular time there were 
some in the House who chose to take those comments and our 
direction of trying to make these changes in a positive way in a 
very adversarial way.  They chose to impugn motive to myself and 
to my colleagues in the Reform Party.  That was desperately 
unfortunate.  There were many issues that required and continue 
to require open, honest and candid dialogue.  It is that which 
hopefully we have engaged in today, with some minor variations 
that have occurred, and I should say on both sides of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were asking when we came here, at the outset:  Where are 
taxpayer dollars going?  We recognized that we were funnelling 
some $9 billion every year into federal and provincial programs 
of all descriptions, supposedly to support our aboriginal and 
Metis people.  Why then, we asked, do we still see such poverty 
right across Canada, such appalling living conditions and so many 
of our aboriginal people filling our prisons?  As the solicitor 
general critic for the Reform Party I am familiar with the fact 
that 17% of all inmates in 1998 were aboriginal, up from 11% in 
1991-92. 
Why do we see such despair, such substance abuse, along with high 
suicide rates on reserves?  What is happening?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more questions we asked on these issues, the more phone 
calls my office received from what I call grassroots aboriginals 
who raised more and more questions about issues on their 
reserves, issues in my former constituency of Kootenay East and 
now in my current constituency of Kootenay—Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I agreed to hold a town hall meeting last November.  I 
invited the minister and others from the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development.  Of course I also invited the 
five band chiefs and their councils who are in my constituency of 
Kootenay—Columbia.  None of them chose to attend.  There were 
aboriginal residents from all five bands in the constituency who 
attended.  They spoke with quiet dignity, asking for changes 
toward a system that was more democratic and more accountable to 
the membership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a politician, quite frankly, I feel I must apologize for all 
of the preceding governments of the past 130 years for their 
absolute failure to address outstanding aboriginal issues.  The 
results of their failures are obvious to anyone looking at the 
state of affairs on the reserves anywhere in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say, in all sincerity, that it is my commitment as a 
member of parliament and it is my commitment as a Canadian 
citizen to see the wrongs righted and things put on a proper 
path.  Unfortunately, what we are looking at today is the Nisga'a 
agreement and that is not the way to do it.  By any stretch, it 
is not the way to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud of the record of my office and of the Reform Party 
for being prepared to speak up for positive change for Canada's 
aboriginal people, so let us talk about the Nisga'a agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives from the federal and B.C. governments have 
negotiated a land claim treaty with the leaders of the Nisga'a 
people.  The agreement was initialled on October 4, 1998 and 
ratified by the Nisga'a people early in November.  It must now be 
ratified by the federal and B.C. legislatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The citizens of British Columbia were not invited to participate 
in the negotiation process and were not given an opportunity to 
influence the terms of the Nisga'a treaty at any point, with one 
small exception.  The small exception was when resource based 
industries and recreational users were brought in near the end of 
the 20 year process.  Tragically, even these non-aboriginal 
citizens were thrown out when Glen Clark insisted on rushing the 
conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the terms were set, the B.C. government refused to allow a 
provincial referendum on the deal.  It will not allow the voices 
of British Columbians to be heard.  The Nisga'a had a referendum. 
Non-Nisga'a opinion apparently does not count, as we have heard 
in the House earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a recent poll, 62% of British Columbians do not 
feel they have been properly informed on this most important 
issue to face B.C. since confederation.  With more than 1,000 
respondents, I can report that I did a poll in my own 
constituency where fully 76% are opposed to their member of 
parliament, myself, voting in favour of the Nisga'a agreement as 
it is presently written.  Rather than promoting the straight 
facts about the Nisga'a treaty, the B.C. government initiated a 
$6 million advertising campaign aimed at selling the deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, many of the speeches made today by Liberal 
members and indeed by members of other parties, while very well 
intended, have been short on fact and very long on emotion. I say 
again, it is my objective and it is the objective of my party, 
which is again a reflection of the member for Kelowna and his 
comments, to see a full and just settlement of these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation as it presently stands cannot go on, but the 
Nisga'a agreement is not the way to do it.  Here are a few facts 
on what this treaty would give the Nisga'a people:  over 2,000 
square kilometres of land in northwestern British Columbia; the 
authority to make laws in a large number of areas, in many cases 
overriding provincial and federal laws; self-government 
provisions far exceeding the powers of regular municipal 
governments; rights to fisheries and other natural resources, 
including minerals and wildlife, on an exclusive basis; the right 
to manage wildlife over an area five times larger than the 2,000 
square kilometre settlement, land almost double the size of the 
province of Prince Edward Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at some information that is of particular 
interest to people who are in municipal government. 
Are self-government provisions in the Nisga'a treaty comparable 
to municipal governments as claimed by treaty opponents? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First let me make a couple of points on the topic of 
self-government. I support the goal of aboriginal self-government 
as I previously stated.  I believe aboriginal communities should 
have the ability to govern their own affairs just like any 
municipal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sechelt nation has shown the way by successfully tying 
together aboriginal interests in a municipal model.  I 
parenthesize for a second and ask are there some difficulties, 
are there problems, are there some inconsistencies within the 
agreement in principle for the Sechelt?  Yes, but they can be 
worked out.  It is a totally different agreement to what we are 
talking about with the Nisga'a agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Canadian constitution only the federal or provincial 
governments have law making authority and this authority is not 
transferable to a third order of government.  As my colleagues 
have pointed out, there are 14 areas in this agreement that give 
the Nisga'a a special ability to interact on areas that will give 
them a supremacy over federal and provincial law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary says that is not true.  This is 
precisely the reason we are calling for a reference to the 
supreme court in the same way that there was a reference on the 
question of Quebec and its right to secede. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking the government to do the right thing. Prior to 
having this thing etched in stone and constitutionalized, refer 
it to the supreme court so that we can establish the difference 
of opinion, whether the parliamentary secretary is right or our 
party is right.  It is the only reasonable and responsible thing 
to do. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, justice; the hon. 
member for Markham, government contracts. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and 
Youth), Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have been listening to the 
debates of the two hon. members opposite very carefully and I 
think very judiciously. It is my opinion that we come from two 
very different pedagogies politically speaking.  We are not from 
the same party.  We obviously do not have the same broad 
principles and we do not obviously believe in the same things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the Nisga'a agreement is something Canada should 
embrace. These members should engender an attitude of generosity 
toward those people, the Nisga'a themselves, who asked for more 
than what they are getting. They are only getting 10% of the land 
they asked for. That is only 10% of their traditional territory. 
The Nisga'a have ceded much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has not just been an agreement that was struck overnight. 
For over 20 years people like Joe Gosnell and many leaders, 
elders and Nisga'a will not be here to celebrate the finalization 
of this claim. They will not be here because it is not complete. 
We have not reached that point because we have a parting of the 
ways when it comes to what we believe about self-government, what 
we believe about aboriginal rights in the constitution, the legal 
and unique status of aboriginal people, their relationship with 
the crown and the fiduciary aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously our view of democracy is very different from that of 
the members opposite.  I ask the member opposite, is there just 
one kind of democracy? Is it a democracy that just comes from 
western based civilization?  Is it a democracy that is just 
Eurocentric and ethnocentric? Is it all based on super secession 
by law because we believe our way is better than theirs, because 
we think we are the ones who are right, we have the supreme 
attitude, the answer of what is good for those people?

might prove members wrong because the Nisga'a have leadership 
that can do it.  The Nisga'a can be fair, judicious, generous, 
sharing and giving like they have been. Many millionaires were 
created off their territory.  Very few of them—

Hong Kong, England, Australia and Austria.  Democracy is a set of 
values where individual rights have a special place by comparison 
to collective rights. The kind of thing the parliamentary 
secretary is talking about in terms of aboriginal issues has to 
do with collective rights.  It is an interface of these two 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the Sechelt is not a perfect model by a long shot 
but at least it is something that we can look at as a model to 
have as a successful interface. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my objective to see that we end up with a permanent 
solution rather than one that is going to be a constant open 
wound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did a thorough survey in my constituency.  I can tell the 
parliamentary secretary that 71% of the people do not want me to 
vote in favour of the agreement; 79% believe that they have not 
been properly informed about the agreement; and 92% do not 
believe it is fair to the rest of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My real deep concern is that as the agreement was rammed through 
the legislature in Victoria, it will undoubtedly be rammed 
through this parliament.  The agreement will be forced down the 
throats of people who do not want it, do not accept it and will 
not work with it. We do not have a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement is nothing more than something that the 
bureaucrats, the political elite of the Nisga'a as well as the 
political elite in this place have said is the way to solve it. 
There is no solution as long as there is no broad popular 
support. There is no broad popular support for this agreement in 
British Columbia.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the 
Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, people have asked about 
financial accountability.  I would like to draw all members' 
attention to the fact that the final agreement and the related 
fiscal financing agreement specifically contain provisions to 
ensure that the Nisga'a government is accountable. The Nisga'a 
constitution builds in specific obligations on Nisga'a 
governments in terms of accountability to the citizens for funds 
received and expenditures made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the fiscal financing agreement, the Nisga'a nation is 
required to prepare and provide audited accounts and financial 
statements to Canada and/or British Columbia.  The financial 
statements must meet generally accepted accounting standards. 
These financial statements may be reviewed by the auditor 
general. The parties will establish a tripartite financing 
committee which will review the implementation of the fiscal 
financing arrangements. The approach taken in this agreement 
ensures first nations accountability for the funds they expend to 
both their members and to the governments from whom some of their 
funding is derived.  Those are the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to talk about the motion put forward by the 
member for Skeena.  I am not surprised by this motion. The hon. 
member is simply sharing once again his party's well known and 
oft-stated position with respect to aboriginal people in Canada. 
The motion he puts forward shows a complete lack of understanding 
of the Nisga'a treaty and the fundamental principles behind it. 
Let us set the record straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the ratification of the Nisga'a treaty, Canada will chart a 
course for a stronger and a more just society; a Canada where the 
Nisga'a people finally feel at home in their native land; a 
Canada where aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians work 
together for a brighter future for our whole country. 
This is the Canadian way:  working together to resolve our 
differences peacefully. There are many merits to this treaty.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think perhaps all of us need to remember the very exceptional 
people whose sheer determination ensures that we are talking 
about these issues today.  For some 10,000 years the Nisga'a have 
lived in the Nass Valley in northwestern British Columbia, a land 
of snow capped mountains, glacier fed lakes, ancient forests and 
volcanic rocks. The Nisga'a call the Nass Valley the common bowl 
from which their people draw life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The timeless relationship between the Nisga'a and their land was 
interrupted with the arrival of Captain George Vancouver in 1793. 
At the time the Nisga'a numbered roughly 30,000, a population 
made up of traders and entrepreneurs.  Theirs was a sophisticated 
society.  These prosperous people lived in two storey homes in 
established orderly communities. They governed themselves 
according to a strict code of conduct passed down through 
centuries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the millennia the arrival of the Europeans put and end 
to that lifestyle.  What the early settlers left behind instead 
was a legacy of paternalism, perhaps the legacy we see in the 
members opposite.  Over the past 200 years the Nisga'a have seen 
their lands, the lands they once freely used, taken over for 
purposes that were not theirs. They were prevented from publicly 
practising their religious beliefs.  Their children were sent to 
distant residential schools. They lost their language and their 
culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet even though their political, economic and social systems 
were suppressed, deeply affecting their dignity, the Nisga'a 
people never gave up their struggle to reclaim their rights and 
their lands.  Generation after generation, Nisga'a leader after 
leader has soldiered on assuring the Nisga'a people that one day 
justice would be served.  Finally we have put that system in 
order.  We have put things right for the Nisga'a first nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the ratification of this treaty, finally the Nisga'a will 
have stewardship over their resources and their affairs.  They 
will have a right to self-government and a land base on which to 
exercise it.  All Canadians understand the necessity and value of 
including self-government arrangements as part of treaties not 
only with the Nisga'a but with the many other first nations 
waiting for their opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That understanding of course begins with the recognition that 
the term inherent right is accurate.  The constitution is the 
highest law of this land.  It sets out what makes all of us 
Canadians, what makes us different from citizens of other parts 
of the world.  Our constitution recognizes the multicultural 
heritage of Canadians and protects the cultural rights of our 
citizens.  In particular, the constitution recognizes and 
protects the rights of aboriginal people in Canada based on their 
prior occupation of this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal peoples lived on this continent long before explorers 
from other continents first came to North America. For thousands 
of years before this country was founded they enjoyed their own 
form of government.  Today we are learning from them.  We are 
bringing into our own society, into our own way of doing things, 
things that the aboriginal peoples taught us, a better way of 
dealing with justice issues, of dealing with children, of dealing 
with the environment. We can learn from these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their special role in Canada is that government believes that 
aboriginal people have a right to govern themselves in a modern 
context.  Unequivocally this treaty is clearly about rights, not 
race as some critics have contended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court said in the 1973 Calder decision that 
aboriginal title existed as a legal right in Canada.  That 
landmark decision led to the affirmation of aboriginal and treaty 
rights which are now enshrined under section 35 of the 
Constitution Act, 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our constitution and our courts affirm that aboriginal and 
treaty rights exist. 
They have made it clear that these rights have real meaning and 
must be upheld. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts have made it equally clear that these rights should 
be negotiated, not litigated.  In one of its most recent rulings 
the Supreme Court of Canada confirmed that aboriginal title 
exists.  It reinforced that we should negotiate settlements to 
achieve the purpose of section 35.  As Chief Justice Lamer 
rightly noted “let us face it; we are all here to stay”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treaty making enables us to reconcile in the modern context the 
pre-existent rights of aboriginal people with the establishment 
of a crown sovereignty.  It signals all our willingness as a 
society to resolve major historical and cultural differences 
through negotiation and compromise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treaty making is a process, as the hon. member for Western 
Arctic has said.  It is a give and take process, the results of 
which are local solutions to local problems.  It establishes a 
shared understanding of how aboriginal and non-aboriginal people 
can co-exist and realize our common goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It leads to a fair, affordable and honourable settlement that 
accommodates the interests of all parties, ensuring stability and 
promoting opportunity for all residents living on or near claimed 
lands.  At the most fundamental level a treaty provides a bridge 
from which to build a new relationship between the first peoples 
and those of us who followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been a long time in coming.  This relationship is built 
on trust, on recognition, on respect and on responsibility.  It 
is a relationship that demonstrates the mutual benefits of 
sharing. The key components of the treaty demonstrate these clear 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty is the first of its kind in Canada.  It 
covers a land claim and self-government in one single package. It 
establishes a full and final settlement of all outstanding 
Nisga'a claims.  The treaty sets aside approximately 2,000 square 
kilometres of the Nass River Valley as Nisga'a land and 
establishes a Nisga'a central government with jurisdiction over 
matters that are internal and inherent to their culture.  The 
Nisga'a will own the surface rights and the subsurface rights on 
Nisga'a land and have a share of the Nass River salmon stocks as 
well as Nass area wildlife harvests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty provides the Nisga'a with a financial transfer of 
$190 million payable over 15 years.  These funds will stimulate 
the local economy and spur economic development.  Jobs will be 
created.  The Nisga'a will be able to strengthen their community 
infrastructure and services to the same standards as those 
enjoyed by the rest of Canadians.  They will break the cycle of 
dependency created from 100 years of living under the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Nisga'a gain control over the management and development 
of their land's resources, they will develop self sustaining and 
self supporting communities.  With a resource base on which to 
build their economy, these proud and remarkably resilient people 
will be able to break the cycle of dependency and escape from the 
trap of poverty that has so affected their dignity.  The Nisga'a 
will once again know the satisfaction that comes with 
self-reliance, something all of us have had a chance to 
experience.  They will once again be able to contribute fully to 
their communities and to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps most profound, after decades of attempting to negotiate 
their way into Canada the Nisga'a will at last have the ability 
to participate equally in society, to speak their language, to 
teach their traditions, to govern themselves once again, and just 
like other Canadians to pursue their hopes and dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Non-aboriginal British Columbians will also see meaningful 
benefits flow from this settlement.  The negotiation of treaties 
will bring certainty to the Nass Valley.  Treaties will clarify 
who can log, who can fish, who can mine and where.  It certainly 
means business can invest in the region with confidence and 
unleash billions of dollars of untapped economic potential.  It 
means both aboriginal and non-aboriginal people can pursue 
business opportunities unimpeded by disputes about rights to land 
and resources.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the Nisga'a and their neighbours will be direct 
beneficiaries of treaty settlement moneys.  This infusion of new 
funds will provide a badly needed boost to the economies of the 
communities within and surrounding the Nisga'a. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time in the province an aboriginal group has 
agreed to forgo the existing tax exemptions.  The treaty will 
gradually phase out exemptions from sales and income taxes. After 
the transition period Nisga'a citizens will pay all the same 
taxes other Canadians pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over time the Nisga'a nation will contribute a portion of the 
revenues it raises to offset transfers from other governments for 
programs and services.  It is expected that the combined impact 
of taxes paid by Nisga'a citizens and revenues raised by Nisga'a 
government will represent one-quarter of the annual budget 
requirements of the Nisga'a nation just 15 years from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Non-aboriginal people can also rest assured that their rights 
and freedoms will also be respected and upheld.  The treaty 
stipulates that the Criminal Code, the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms, as well as other federal and provincial laws of 
general application, will continue to apply safeguarding the 
constitutional rights of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty specifies that Nisga'a governments will take into 
account the rights and needs of all residents including other 
Canadians who reside on Nisga'a lands.  Non-aboriginal people 
living there will be able to stand for election and vote for 
Nisga'a public institutions like education and health boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a treaty's significance extends well beyond British 
Columbia.  It represents a small but important step along the 
path to a better Canada, a better Canada for the Nisga'a, a 
better Canada for aboriginal peoples and a better Canada for me 
and for all my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ratification of the Nisga'a treaty will serve as a marker in 
our passage to the next millennium.  It will act as a nexus, a 
bridge connecting our past with our present and our collective 
future.  It will take care of unfinished business, establish a 
new relationship and create a continuum of hope and possibility 
for generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all the right reasons we will finally do the right thing. 
Members of the House should never let a motion like this get in 
the way of that noble pursuit. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened 
very carefully to the member's intervention.  We certainly agree 
that there has been a real failure of aboriginal policy in 
Canada.  That failure falls most heavily on the shoulders of the 
Liberal Party and the successive Liberal governments that have 
spent most of the time in government in this country since 1867. 
When we look at the failure, the people over there should accept 
their responsibility in being a big part of that failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the cost of Nisga'a government and said 
after 15 years the Nisga'a, through internal revenue raising, 
would be able to pay for approximately 25% of the annual cost, 
which is about $32 million a year, to govern a population of 
approximately 2,000 people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member have any idea what the cost per person for 
that government will be?  Does she think it is in line with the 
rest of government in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the hon. member have to say to the 40% of the Nisga'a 
people who do not support this agreement?  What does she have to 
say to the people who are watching from Skeena today, to the 
Gitanyow, the Gitksan and the Tahltan, who are really upset over 
the fact that the overlap situation was not addressed prior to 
the federal government signing this agreement and indicating its 
willingness to bring ratification legislation through in the 
fall?  What would she say to these aboriginal people who are 
watching today from Skeena to whom the government also has a 
fiduciary obligation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if anyone has to answer 
to the people of Skeena it is the member.  It is the member who 
has a constitutional challenge before the B.C. court.  The member 
is using the floor of the House to pursue a court challenge.  It 
is the member who has talked out of both sides of his mouth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He asks what our policy is with regard to aboriginal people.  I 
ask the member opposite what is his policy with regard to 
aboriginal people.  Members of the Reform have never been clear. 
They have never articulated anything but paternalism and some 
might suggest some other isms that I will not be levelling at 
this point, but I think we all know what they are.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I want to make it abundantly clear that the hon. member in her 
intervention indicated to the House that I had a court challenge 
in British Columbia.  I am not part of any court challenge in 
British Columbia to anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is not a point

<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for both the tone and the content of her 
speech.  She has actually done something to elevate the whole 
standard of debate we have been hearing all day today. I thank 
her for pointing out some amazing facts that we should keep in 
mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people have lived for 10,000 years in the Nass Valley with 
their own traditional ways of governance and their own 
traditional cultural values, et cetera.  Those 10,000 years make 
100 years of persecution and cultural genocide actually seem like 
a fairly short period of time.  Maybe that is why we see such 
great stoicism and patience on their part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak about the point the hon. member made, that it is 
classic white arrogance and Eurocentricism for us to think that 
the only way of governance is our own British parliamentary 
system.  I would like to share one story with the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took part in the Charlottetown aboriginal hearings.  I was 
sitting with a group of aboriginal women, one of whom was saying 
that in her culture and community women were not allowed to run 
for chief.  Everybody shook their heads and said that was 
terrible.  Then she said that the men were not allowed to vote. 
Somehow these people over hundreds and thousands of years have 
found a pretty interesting way to make sure that the chief is 
accountable, et cetera.  That is just one example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a point of clarification, I have a question for the hon. 
member.  She pointed out a number of clarifications about 
taxation, et cetera, to try to put to bed some of the 
fear-mongering and the misinformation being spread around British 
Columbia and all of western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it true that in the case of income tax the Nisga'a government 
and its corporations will be treated the same as a municipality? 
Is it also true that the Nisga'a government will not be able to 
tax non-Nisga'a residents on Nisga'a land? Finally, is it true 
that the Nisga'a taxation power will not limit or displace 
federal or provincial taxation powers?  Could the hon. member 
clarify some of those things for the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, all but a few of us are 
immigrants to this land.  We are talking about a very fundamental 
issue of rights to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Winnipeg Centre has articulated very correct 
positions about his support and belief that there is a better way 
to do things than what has been done in the past.  His respect 
for human rights comes through loud and clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to learn from the people who came before us in this 
land, the people who started this land on its way to being as 
great as it is and ensured that we took the best.  We must 
respect them and ensure that they have the same rights as other 
Canadians to pursue their dreams, to govern themselves, to 
recognize their own religious experience and their own culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Winnipeg Centre is absolutely correct on his 
taxation points as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member spoke at some length about fiscal accountability.  I 
can think of one example in my home province of Saskatchewan, the 
Saulteaux band, which last year spent more money on travel than 
the entire provincial cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member a very simple question.  What 
guarantees are there in this deal that would make myself, my 
colleagues and the rest of Canadians feel comfortable that those 
same kinds of things will not happen in this deal?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the question was what 
will make the member opposite and his party comfortable with this 
deal.  Perhaps a whole attitude adjustment would be appropriate. 
They come from a place of disrespect for the aboriginal peoples 
and it is very clear that they will never be comfortable with 
deals that ensure respect for culture, respect for people to 
pursue their dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member had listened to my opening comments, they 
were all about the systems that are in place on fiscal 
accountability.

malicious individuals run candidates with similar or identical 
names. 
For instance, in 1988, in the riding of Verdun—Saint-Paul where I 
was a candidate, one of the candidates on the ballot papers was 
named Lavergne.  He was a representative of the Green Party and 
got a lot of votes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, the same party had a candidate whose name bore no 
resemblance to any of the other candidates.  The party received 
very few votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, in the riding of Outremont, the name of one of the 
candidates was similar to that of the member who was 
representing the riding in the House at the time.  Fortunately, 
people trusted this member and re-elected him without too much 
trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, in the Ontario provincial election, there are two 
candidates with similar names in the riding of Casselman.  One 
is named Jean-Marc Lalonde and the other Alain Lalonde.  With 
situations like this, one might well think that there are people 
who want to reduce a candidate's majority, or eliminate him 
altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is unfair to someone who has worked like mad to run 
for a political party to see certain people doing such things. 
That is why I have introduced a private member's bill to 
counteract the actions of malicious people, who may be found in 
all of the ridings across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go still further and state that the photographs of 
candidates ought to be on every ballot, and I will tell you why. 
After I introduced my bill last May, I received a letter from 
an organization that works with literacy, Carrefour d'éducation 
pour l'alphabétisation, asking me to add a clause to the effect 
that all candidates should have their photograph on the ballots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will explain why.  As hon. members are aware, illiterate 
people have trouble voting.  I remember back to 1980 when I 
helped a lady to do so, on behalf of an organization for the 
mentally handicapped. 
The organization was made up of about 18 mentally handicapped 
persons.  Over 19 years, we managed to get 150 mentally retarded 
people out of the back rooms in which their families had hidden 
them out of shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If hon. members could only realize how much help the simple 
addition of a photo would be to the illiterate, who do not get 
out and vote because they are embarrassed at not being able to 
read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was campaigning door to door in 1997, people would tell 
me “Mr. Lavigne, I will not be voting. It is not that I do not 
want to vote for you. 
I would like to, and I could vote for you if there was a photo 
of you.  But I cannot read, and I do not know where to go”.  I 
told them they just had to pick the third name down and they 
said “Yes, but what if I make a mistake and I pick the fourth 
one?” If there were photos, all these people would have the 
same right to vote as everyone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many services for the disabled in Quebec and in 
Canada.  A few months ago, with funding from the Government of 
Canada, I formed an association with young lawyers to make the 
disabled aware of their rights. 
We even opened an office in Canada, to provide information to 
the disabled about their rights.  Like us, those who are 
illiterate are entitled to vote.  The Government of Canada must 
give them an opportunity to do so.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of my bill, of course, is to counter malicious 
intents and acts to reduce a candidate's margin or eliminate him 
altogether, but I think we should take it a step further and let 
everyone benefit. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to say a few words on this bill on behalf of my 
party. I am sure the sponsor of the bill is well meaning but we 
have to ask ourselves if this is the way we want to go in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of colourful symbols to identify the various political 
parties on the ballot is quite common in many third world 
countries.  There are probably countries where the photo of a 
candidate is next to his or her name on the ballot paper.  In 
countries where there is a high degree of illiteracy it would 
make sense.  It also makes sense in countries where there are a 
multitude of local or tribal languages where even a literate 
person could become confused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not a third world country.  We have a high literacy 
rate and we only have two official languages.  Therefore we do 
not see the need for this amendment to the Canada Elections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I say to the hon. member that the wording of the 
proposed amendment leaves a lot to subjective interpretation. Who 
decides which names are similar enough to be confusing on the 
ballot paper?  Will there be a similarity test?  He did not 
indicate that.  If they fail a similarity test, do not get their 
picture on the ballot and lose the election by a small margin, is 
that a valid reason to have the election declared null and void? 
What would happen if they had a twin with each individual running 
for a different party?  Surely the picture would only add to the 
confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other valid factor is sociological.  Many studies have shown 
that good looking people who are photogenic tend to be regarded 
more positively by others than people who are not so good 
looking.  What if they are a bright, articulate, spirited, public 
minded individual but very plain to look at, not really good 
looking like the hon. member happens to be?  What would happen in 
that case?  Publishing their picture in that case could be 
detrimental to their electoral chances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another factor which has to be taken into consideration is 
incumbency.  An incumbent already enjoys a big advantage in an 
election campaign.  We are all very much aware of that.  An 
incumbent generally has a 20% to 25% advantage going into an 
election campaign.  Putting the incumbent's picture on the ballot 
would only add to the incumbent's advantage.  I do not know if 
the hon. member would agree with that line of thought. 
If one happens to be a rather plain looking challenger then the 
picture would only add to the individual's disadvantage. It would 
only add to his chances of not getting elected.  At some point in 
this debate I would like the hon. member to address some of the 
little problems I have given him to think about.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, I do not see any pressing need for this change.  I 
feel we could be opening a Pandora's box of potential new 
problems if we approve the bill.  Under the current circumstances 
as presented by the hon. member we would not have any choice but 
to vote against his bill.  During the course of this debate the 
hon. member may be answering some of the concerns I have made 
known to him today, and hopefully we will see. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-405 respecting 
amendments to the Canada Elections Act.  I must admit there is 
great uncertainty with the bill.  The summary states that the 
photograph of each candidate shall be printed on the ballot next 
to the name of that candidate.  That would suggest that each and 
every one of us would have to send our pictures in and that the 
ballot would have the pictures of all candidates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, clause 2 of the bill indicates that only where there is 
similarity in the names of any two candidates would their 
pictures be on the ballot.  If we are unclear as to what the bill 
says, imagine somebody trying to figure out at Elections Canada 
whether or not all our pictures are required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too have problems with the suggestion that Canadian voters are 
not smart enough to be able to identify the candidate of their 
choice.  As we all know, on today's election ballots the party 
name is attached to the name.  If there is a similarity in names 
or if one person has the same name as somebody else, there is an 
indication of what political party they represent.  That 
differentiates one candidate from another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking for people to take advantage of that situation. In 
past elections we have had two John Turners running for a seat in 
the same constituency.  It was done for a reason.  I believe he 
represented the Rhino Party, which tends to take lightly the 
election process.  I am a little concerned that the pictures that 
might be received to be put on ballots may not in all 
circumstances be pictures of a person's face.  What constitutes a 
picture of the candidate?  We are really asking for somebody to 
take advantage of the situation and to turn it into a joke more 
than a very serious process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see the reason for it.  I fail to see where the 
pictures are going to differentiate the individuals any more than 
the party name differentiates them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue should be considered.  Whether we like it or not, 
if only two individuals have pictures on a ballot of from six to 
thirteen people and the others do not have pictures, it draws 
more attention to those two individuals.  Our election process 
has to be fair and equal to all candidates and not give one any 
more of an advantage over another.  In some cases where two 
people may have their pictures on the ballot, that would 
automatically draw the attention of the voter to those two 
individuals and may exclude the others from consideration. 
I do not think we want to go down that path.  I think it is a 
dangerous path to go on.

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a question of when there is not a real problem why we need 
to change the process.  Elections Canada works very hard in 
making sure that the ballots are clear and the names are listed 
alphabetically.  That again can cause problems if people want to 
take advantage of it.  I know someone who put a name on the 
ballot that basically said “none of the above and put a couple 
of <I>z</I>'s in front of it.”  We have to be careful that we do not 
encourage that kind of attitude in making the election process a 
joke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of ballots there are already methods that Election 
Canada uses to clarify such as, as I mentioned, alphabetical 
order, names with clarify, using initials and using the party's 
affiliation.  If that in itself is not clear, a person can put 
his or her occupation on the ballot as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is plenty of opportunity to make sure there is clarity in 
terms of who are the candidates.  Putting picture on the ballot 
would not help and may make the process unfair.  I will be voting 
against this private member's bill and encouraging my colleagues 
to do the same.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
wish to begin by congratulating the hon. member for 
Verdun—Saint-Henri on his initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe he is totally justified in his concern to see our 
fellow citizens participate fully in selecting those who will 
govern them.  I can therefore understand that he would want to 
ensure that all those who vote are fully informed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe, however, that there is a problem here.  As it 
stands, we believe the bill confers an unfair advantage on 
certain categories of candidate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member pointed out in his opening remarks, if all 
candidates had a photo I believe that the hon. member would 
receive considerable support, if not unanimity.  He would 
without a doubt have the support of the Bloc Quebecois, because 
in the ridings we represent we know there are people who cannot 
read and write, for all manner of reasons related to their 
particular circumstances, and we must respect that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take advantage of this excellent initiative by our 
colleague to pay tribute to our fellow citizens who are involved 
in this process of learning to read and write.  They deserve all 
our support, for this is not an easy undertaking, we know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage the hon. member to consider introducing an 
amendment, whereby all candidates could have their photo on the 
ballot.  This would, I believe, be of service to democracy and 
all members of parliament would be grateful to him for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to make sure that our fellow citizens take 
part in the democratic process.  There are a number of countries 
on this planet where, unfortunately, the right to elect those 
who govern them is not recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people in the world would like to be in our shoes in 
order to be able to regularly, periodically, every four or five 
years, focus their attention on public life, on public issues 
and be part of the very important moment of choosing 
representatives in this democratic institution here of the House 
of Commons. Obviously, this is a principle we would be able to 
apply to many institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the member is raising an important point. It is all to 
his credit, and I thank him for it. I want to remind the House 
that we are proud, because in Quebec—like me, he is a member from 
Quebec, and so is his seatmate—we have an extremely deep-rooted 
democratic tradition. You know that the National Assembly was 
the first parliament in North America.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of whether we voted yes or no in the last referendum, 
we must all rejoice in the fact that over 90% of our fellow 
citizens exercised their right to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those in elected office, like the member for Verdun—Saint-Henri, 
myself and any parliamentarian, would all do well to ensure that 
people turn out to vote in numbers. There is no doubt that what 
the member is proposing, that is including the photo with the 
name of the candidate on the ballot, is an enlightened measure 
that provides people with the best information possible on the 
people who are running in an election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore invite him to consider expanding the scope of the 
bill. I am sure that I am speaking for my colleagues of the Bloc 
Quebecois when I say that we will be happy to support such an 
initiative. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
did not plan on speaking to the bill today but there is one thing 
I would like to point out which I have not heard today in the 
comments of other members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too have reservations with the whole idea of putting 
photographs on the ballot.  I would disagree with the hon. member 
from the Bloc who just pointed out that members of his party 
would probably not have much problem if all the candidates had 
their photographs on the ballot.  The point I want to raise is a 
good argument for having neither.  Neither should all the photos 
be on the ballot.  Nor should just two in the case of names that 
are very similar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For people who do not know what their candidates look like, if 
they do not follow politics very much or did not really pay any 
attention to the leaflets and literature that might have come to 
their doors, there is a very real possibility they are the type 
of people who do not really know a lot about politics and would 
make their choices based on what the candidate looked like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think everybody here would agree that would be fundamentally 
wrong.  There are all kinds of biases that exist: racial bias or 
racial prejudice or gender bias, people who do not want women in 
politics.  My name is one that could be used for a male or 
female.  Many people with the name Pat are from both genders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be two people with the name Pat, one a man and one a 
woman, and the choice would be made simply because someone might 
not want women in politics and would vote for the male, never 
mind what the virtues are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  The members opposite are chuckling. 
There are people who certainly feel that way.  They are biased 
toward having women in politics.  They might vote that way.  I am 
just saying it is a possibility and it is one of the reservations 
that should be raised here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other things such as ethnic background.  People who 
are racially prejudiced would notice right off the bat, never 
mind the merits and qualities of the person.  One person might be 
wearing a turban, for instance, and one not. They might have 
similar names and the voter might be biased against a certain 
type of person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about people with obvious physical disabilities?  Somebody 
like Stephen Hawking would not have much of a chance if he was 
going strictly on physical appearance if the voter did not think 
handicapped people could conduct themselves as well as somebody 
else.  We all know that having somebody like Stephen Hawking 
would be a great asset to any political environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are ways to tamper photographs to one's advantage.  People 
have done all kinds of research on reactions to people who are 
physically beautiful.  If one looks like a 30 year old Olympic 
athlete and has the same name as a person who is paunchy, middle 
aged and more my vintage, the 30 year old Olympic athlete would 
have a clear advantage over me personally.  I would find that 
troublesome because I might think I would be the better 
candidate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those reasons I would oppose this idea, even though I 
understand that it was put forward with all the best of 
intentions to make it a better system.  Our party could not vote 
for the bill as it currently stands because of the possibility of 
biases based on physical appearance.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the member for St. John's East, who is not in 
the House at this moment, but who spoke to this bill— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I must remind the 
hon. member that we do not comment on the presence or absence of 
members in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings:</B>  Madam Speaker, I did not mean to 
cast any aspersions.  The member for St. John's East, when he 
spoke about photos being placed on ballots, said that this could 
in fact put someone who is plain looking into difficulty.  I want 
to assure him that he is a very good looking person.  That is the 
first thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the member from the NDP that he as well is a 
very good looking person.  In fact, I think that everyone sitting 
in the House today, and not sitting in the House today, but who 
has the right to sit in the House, is very good looking.  The 
member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve is also good looking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the point was raised by the NDP member that this could 
lead to discrimination on the basis of race, gender, or whether 
people like the way an individual looks.  He is right. There may 
be some people who will decide on the basis of a photo not to 
vote for a candidate because the candidate is a woman, a senior, 
too young, black, a visible minority or an aboriginal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Luckily, we have a system in which we have signage and 
billboards.  I can assure the member that it would have been 
incredible if, of the 59% of the electorate which voted for me, 
one person in my riding voted not knowing that I was a black 
Canadian woman of African origin.  It would have been very 
difficult.  I had billboards all over my riding.  The person 
would have had to have suffered from a visual disability and not 
have had any friends or family with whom they communicated over 
the length of the campaign not to know that I was, one, a woman, 
and two, a black woman, a visible minority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also hope that in Canada we have advanced sufficiently, 
regardless of the level of our education, that the overwhelming 
majority of Canadians would vote for the best candidate, for the 
candidate that represents that party which embodies their values. 
I think that is in fact what we have.  We have an increasing 
diversity within the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a higher number of women representatives in the 36th 
Parliament than we have had in the past 130-odd years of our 
confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a higher level of representation in terms of age groups 
representing the different ages.  We have younger MPs, middle MPs 
and our more senior and more mature MPs.  I consider myself to be 
in the middle in terms of maturity and age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have greater representation in terms of the members of 
parliament who are of varying and diverse ethnocultural origins. 
Only 20 years ago it would have been very difficult to find a 
member of parliament in this House whose name was not Tremblay or 
James or Brown.  I perhaps should not have used the name 
“Brown”.  Let me try McKinney or Smith.

and the policies of that person and the party which that person 
represents. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own riding, there is considerable socioeconomic diversity. 
The percentage of residents living on welfare is rather 
disturbing.  A number of them are illiterate as well, and many 
of them voted for me, despite or perhaps because of the fact—I do 
not know which—that I am a woman, that I am middle aged and that 
I am a member of a visible minority.  These people perhaps 
thought that because of my own diversity I would be able to 
understand what they are going through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think an important point is being raised here in the House, 
which is that the bill, as its stands, may cause some difficulty 
because it requires pictures on ballots only when the names of 
two or more candidates give rise to confusion. I believe that 
ballots should include the pictures of all candidates, as the 
member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure all members here in the House at the moment that 
the member introducing this bill—which I support—intends, if he 
manages to get it through second reading stage and referred to 
committee, to make an amendment to ensure in fact that all 
candidates' photos appear on the ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many associations and non-profit organizations are working on the 
issue of literacy in Canada and, more specifically, in Quebec. 
We have excellent organizations, which conclude the Regroupement 
des associations de l'analphabétisme, Literacy Partners in 
Quebec and others. I hope they will not be upset if I do not 
name all of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I consulted a number of them on this point, and I can tell you 
that everyone I consulted, working Monday to Friday and often on 
weekends with people who are illiterate, support with one voice 
the idea of having each candidate's photo on the ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will come back to the point raised by the hon. NDP member. 
Should we fear having our picture on a ballot when we do not 
fear having our picture on billboards, which are sometimes 10 by 
11 feet or 15 by 10 feet high? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had lived in feudal times, when most people did not have 
the right to vote, we might fear having our photo displayed. But 
at this point, it would be more likely through ignorance that we

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think all the parties in this House should support this bill. 
If, as I hope, the bill is referred to committee, you may rest 
assured that there will be an amendment to make sure that the 
photos of all candidates appear on the ballot.

understanding and I congratulate the hon. member for 
Verdun—Saint-Henri.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, we were discussing the possibility of amending this 
bill, whose motivation seems to be totally commendable and 
justifiable to the extent that, as the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce pointed out, it would be of service to 
democracy that as much information as possible be provided on 
candidates running for office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that the motivation for this bill is very 
appropriate and deserves to be supported. However, the wording 
of the bill seems to pose a bit of a problem, since a photograph 
of the candidates would only be affixed if two or more 
candidates had an identical name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This obviously creates a problem for the other candidates, who 
would not have their photos on the ballot. In a way, this would 
almost be placing these other candidates in what would no longer 
be a level playing field, since some candidates could be 
identified on the ballot by their facial features but not 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the moment that, in an election campaign, there are posters 
on telephone poles or balconies showing the facial features of 
candidates—and we all know how important that is—to have one's 
picture on telephone poles or balconies, to have the photographs 
of just a few candidates on a ballot would be detrimental to 
those whose picture would not appear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our view that, in its present form, Bill C-405 is totally 
unacceptable. 
There will, I imagine, be the possibility of proposing an 
amendment at either the committee or the report stage, or even 
today, why not, by unanimous consent.  I will make a motion to 
that effect at the end of my speech.  I will be seconded in this 
by my colleague for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, whom I would invite to 
return to his seat so that he may do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the motivation for this bill is most 
commendable, because the more information one has on candidates, 
the more able one is to make an enlightened decision.  This is, 
of course, particularly true when the names of candidates are 
confusing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, let us take my first name. For many anglophones, 
Stéphane looks like a girl's name because it ends in the same 
way as Suzanne or Joanne. 
I remember within a few days of my election getting mail from 
all over Canada addressing me as Mrs. Stéphane Bergeron, and 
those who were not completely sure added a letter to my name, 
making me into Mrs. Stéphanie Bergeron, convinced that there had 
been a mistake in my first name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many anglophones, my name is a woman's name.  For the few 
anglophones in my riding—and they are not very many—this can 
indeed represent a problem.  I imagine that this could be the 
case for a large number of candidates running for office, who 
have confusing names. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This idea of having candidates' pictures on the ballot is an 
excellent one as well for those of our fellow citizens who are 
unfortunately unable to read, or whose language is written with 
another alphabet, and therefore are at a disadvantage compared 
to other voters when it comes to making a choice on election 
day.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that this is an interesting bill. But in fact, 
as I said, the provisions, as they appeared in the bill, are 
totally unacceptable in our opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, I would like to propose an amendment, and I invite 
all my colleagues to support it. I move: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That all candidates be identified on the ballot by means of a 
photo of approximately 3 cm by 1.8 cm taken within the year 
preceding nomination day. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must point out that this amendment, drafted carefully by my 
colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, which I introduce with his 
support, is entirely in keeping with clause 1 of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Unfortunately, at this stage 
of the debate, the amendment I have before me is unacceptable in 
its present form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Madam Speaker, may I ask why, in all your 
wisdom, you consider this amendment inadmissible in its present 
form, since, if there is unanimous consent, it is certainly 
acceptable procedurally? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I will take the amendment 
under advisement and consider it carefully, and I will make a 
decision before the end of this hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not want to prolong 
the debate unduly, except to say that you have an opportunity to 
consider the wording of the amendment as proposed. I think it is 
not insulting to our colleague from Verdun—Saint-Henri to amend 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the nodding we see before us, most of our colleagues in 
this House do seem to agree with the idea that the photo of all 
candidates should appear on the ballot, and not just the photo 
of candidates whose names might be similar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, I respectfully submit to my colleague from 
Verdun—Saint-Henri that, through a gesture of openness, his bill, 
as amended by an opposition party, could rally all parties in 
this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the

that there is a complexity of problems. 
In fact there are very many people in this chamber who have 
names that are not gender specific.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like my colleague opposite, who receives many letters addressed 
to “Mrs. Bergeron”, I have received many letters addressed to 
“Mr. Torsney”. My name is not very common in Canada. My family 
alone bears this name, because my parents immigrated to Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak to Bill C-405 which has been sponsored by 
the member for Verdun—Saint-Henri.  On a personal basis I 
support everything that we can do to enhance people's 
participation rate in the election process, to help people to 
overcome physical difficulties and literacy difficulties. The 
objective of this amendment is to improve access for persons 
specifically with reading deficiencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of accessibility is a fundamental principle to all of 
us in our electoral system. The questions that are raised here 
are quite important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Elections Act has in fact been modified on many 
occasions in the last number of years.  Polling stations on 
election day, the offices of the returning officers and the 
advance polling stations have a mandate to be available on a 
level access.  While Elections Canada does not have it perfect, 
it does have 97% of its locations with level access for electors 
with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 Bill C-114 extended the use of voting by special ballots 
to all electors, allowing electors with physical impairments to 
vote by mail.  Elections Canada has taken steps to assist voters 
who have difficulty understanding English or French.  Material 
about the electoral process was published in as many as 24 
languages in the last general election. Returning officers are 
encouraged to appoint multilingual elections officials to provide 
information in several languages, particularly in urban areas and 
polls where there are people of many ethnic origins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other measures and new technologies have been put in place for 
the particular needs of hospitalized people, for voters with 
visual and hearing impairments, mobile polls, ballots in Braille, 
interpreters of sign language at polling stations, a special 
phone line for voters with hearing impairment.  Voters who have 
reading deficiencies are included in the voters who have special 
needs.  We need to find a way to help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The addition of photographs has been proposed by the hon. member 
for Verdun—Saint-Henri.  This issue as well as that of placing 
party logos on the ballot have been the subject of study over the 
past few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 the Royal Commission on Electoral Reform and Party 
Financing recommended that logos or initials of the political 
parties be printed on the ballots and that photographs of 
candidates be displayed in the form of a poster at polling 
stations.  Who knows how that would have affected all of our 
chances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the 1993 general election the Chief Electoral Officer, 
a fine individual, recommended in the annex to his statutory 
report tabled in parliament in 1996 that the logos of registered 
parties be printed in black on the left side of the ballot in 
front of the candidates' names. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the June 1998 report on the Canada Elections Act, the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs expressed a 
number of reservations with this recommendation. Some members 
doubted that using logos would increase the participation of 
illiterate voters.  Others echoed the Chief Electoral Officer's 
concerns about the technical difficulties involved in getting the 
logos or candidates' photographs on the ballot, including whether 
or not the photos should be in black and white or in colour. The 
committee of this House did not arrive at a consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many factors must be taken into consideration in assessing the 
proposal before us.  There is an absence of empirical studies. 
Whether or not the voter rate for individuals who have reading 
deficiencies is lower than the participation of Canadians in 
general we do not know.  Whether or not individuals with reading 
deficiencies who do not vote would vote if pictures were on the 
ballot is not clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to evaluate, as many members of the House have 
articulated, without further research on the influence of voter 
selection of candidates as a result of having the pictures. Would 
it have a distorting effect?  Would we be here or not be here? 
It is unclear. It may well be an unforeseen consequence that it 
could affect people's voting habits whether it be based on some 
kind of difficulty with people of various parties.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know some people imagine it impossible, but I had great big 
mall posters.  I had pictures in the paper.  I had lots of 
pictures on materials and still people told me that their 
relative, friend or acquaintance had voted for me specifically 
because I was a Liberal and because I was not a woman.  Who 
knows?  I can assure everyone who is watching that I am female. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The candidates' photographs on the ballot may address the 
situation of people who wish to cast their ballot for a 
recognizable candidate regardless of the party affiliation. 
However, it would not address the case of electors who intend to 
vote primarily for a party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of questions that have not been answered. 
What would be the cost of the proposal?  What would be its impact 
on the electoral calendar?  Are there technical dimensions 
associated with its implementation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  The printing of ballots can take place only 
after the closing date for nominations, day 21.  The opening of 
advance polling stations starts 10 days after the closing of 
nominations, days 10, 9 and 7.  Therefore all the ballots need to 
be produced and distributed even in remote areas of the country 
within a period of 10 days.  It would be a serious strain on the 
already very short timeframe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The production process would be further complicated by the 
addition of photographs, besides the fact that the ballot may 
need to be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would need to be established rules, as the hon. member 
opposite has indicated, on the quality of the impression, the 
format, the size and the placement of the pictures.  Elections 
Canada would need to be provided with the responsibility to make 
sure that the rules are enforced, otherwise all of us could be in 
jeopardy for fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elections Canada has not had a chance to answer these questions. 
We already know that the 36 day period of the electoral campaign 
leaves little room for additional steps in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have that many parameters in Bill C-405.  We need to 
look through these issues and we need to look at what the other 
options are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Northwest Territories for instance currently posters are 
provided with photographs of candidates in all voter locations. 
At first glance this could be the way to solve the problems of 
the hon. member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No proposal should be excluded or adopted before the 
organizations representing the people who have reading 
deficiencies are consulted.  They can best identify the 
solutions.  We need to have a bottom-up solution. More analysis 
needs to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of accessibility, all of us in the House support 
that. On the issue of encouraging more people of varied 
backgrounds to participate, hopefully all of us support that and 
work every day to reduce those barriers, but further analysis is 
needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind all hon. members that the government House leader 
will be introducing legislation to amend the Canada Elections Act 
in the very near future.  Perhaps this matter could be pursued at 
that time by the hon. member opposite and by all members of the 
House.

<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of my colleague's bill. I understand the 
constraints and arguments put forward by members of the various 
opposition parties, and even by members of our party, to the 
effect that the photographs of all candidates should appear on 
the ballots, and I agree that this is a very good point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when it comes to the overall issue, we must first think 
about people in our society who are at a disadvantage for one 
reason or another. It is nice to say “We all support access”. 
But when we then go on to say “There are many constraints”. I 
realize this is not an easy thing to put in place. But at the 
same time, this is precisely why we have House committees. 
If, as it is my hope, this bill makes it through second reading, 
it will be referred to a committee, and that committee may want 
to send for Elections Canada officials to discuss the details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I see no reason why the official photographs 
appearing on the posters of candidates could not be used on the 
ballots. It would only make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, Elections Canada spends $8.6 million on pamphlets 
distributed to organizations for illiterate people. We do not 
know whether all illiterate people are reached through these 
organizations. I met some of them myself, and there is often an 
issue of individual pride involved. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pride of the person.  How many people want to belong to 
these organizations in the first place?  And when they do, how do 
the organizations reach them when they themselves, these people, 
cannot read?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if pamphlets are sent to these organizations by Elections 
Canada, even if there are all kinds of systems used by Elections 
Canada to try to reach illiterate people, certainly a number of 
people are not reached.  Witnesses have come to me personally at 
meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one meeting attended by my colleague from 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine and myself, one lady told us how she 
was afraid of taking the bus. She had avoided every public place 
until she was 35 or 40 years of age. Her pride prevented her from 
doing normal day to day routine things that we take for granted. 
One day something clicked in her mind and she sought an 
association.  She went to school at a very late age. She even 
tried to hide from her own children that she was illiterate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People like that do not venture forward.  If we can help them in 
any way at all, if we can put that $8.6 million toward 
photographs on the ballots, then surely it will be simple to 
decide whether it should be a black and white or colour photo. 
We have decided this for driver's licences.  In Quebec we have 
decided this for medicare cards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see anything wrong with deciding whether it should be a 
colour or black and white photo, how much it would cost, what the 
criteria for the use of photographs should be, whether it should 
be a photograph that is one year old or more recent.  We do it 
for our passports.  We do not use just any picture for our 
passports. It has to be stamped and certified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the cost would be outrageous.  I do not think the 
cost would be more than the nearly $9 million Elections Canada 
spends today to advise people who are illiterate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill my colleague has put forward is well worth sending to 
committee.  That is what he is asking.  He is not saying that it 
is a perfect bill or that there are not unanswered questions.  Of 
course there are as with all changes and unanswered questions, 
but not unanswered questions that defy solutions.  Of course they 
do not defy solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is asking for a majority vote in this House on the 
motion for second reading so we can send the bill to a committee. 
The committee can have hearings.  The committee can hear from 
Elections Canada and the organizations representing illiterate 
and handicapped people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well worth our support. I strongly support the bill my 
colleague has brought forward.  He can make amendments in 
committee.  He can propose amendments to the bill which is what 
he intends to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have discussed with my colleague what he would like to do.  He 
does not want to just accept piecemeal amendments at this stage. 
He wants to listen to what the witnesses have to say during the 
hearings.  There may be one, two, three or four amendments to 
bring forward which he would be prepared to consider because he 
is completely open minded.  He wants to safeguard the principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind, I would like to express my strong support for 
the bill proposed by my colleague from Verdun—Saint-Henri.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, on March 12 I asked the Minister of Justice and 
the Deputy Prime Minister about Canada's youth criminal justice 
act that had just been introduced the day before.  Obviously 
there are a lot of concerns about the bill. The public had not 
had much of a chance to look at it, but we had some concerns and 
we were seeking answers at that time and were also anxious to see 
the bill move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today it was disappointing when the government House leader 
talked about adjourning the House earlier than what is on our 
normal calendar because the government is really running out of 
legislation and is talking about possibly getting out of here 
next Friday.  Yet when I got up and asked the government House 
leader why we were not dealing with the Canada youth justice act 
his comment was that it was being filibustered by the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite interesting.  I did go and look.  I know we have had 
some speakers on the bill.  We have had some obvious input.  My 
colleague from Surrey North has great concerns on the bill and 
has been up as well as many others.  But we have spoken as the 
opposition for four hours, 240 minutes on this bill since it was 
introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was introduced by this government over five years ago. 
It was something the Liberals wanted to do and it took them five 
years to get the bill to the House.  After three months we have 
only had the bill before the House a very small amount of time. 
We certainly want to see it get to committee.  We want to see 
many changes in it but the government seems to be dragging its 
feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals do much talking and introduce a lot of PR jobs. 
They spent about $5 million on advertising in this area so far. 
Yet the book they put out says that the Government of Canada will 
establish a five to six year implementation plan.  The Liberals 
have had five years to look at.  Now they are talking about 
taking five to six years to implement it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals go to great lengths in their advertising to talk 
about how they have committed $206 million over the first three 
years for the Canada youth justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Young Offenders Act is supposed to be supported by 50:50 
contributions from the federal government and the provinces. This 
government is only paying about 30% on average for Canada's young 
offenders.  That is the problem.  It is a lack of money.  It is a 
lack of really caring about what is going on in society today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in my community in British Columbia on the lower mainland, 
one person every day dies from a drug overdose, yet we have no 
money from the government to solve that problem. I do not know 
what the numbers are in Toronto and Montreal and other major 
cities but they are very large.  British Columbia is one of the 
capitals for drugs and it is very serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a government that talks about money but it is not 
putting it where it is needed.  It is not putting it there fast 
enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are great at talking about the Canada youth justice 
act and how they are going to implement it and what they are 
going to do for young children, but they do not get behind their 
words with actions.  They do not get behind their words with 
money. They know how to spend money with PR firms to make it look 
like they are doing a good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are spending a couple of hundred million dollars to 
register guns across Canada, really guns in the rural areas 
because guns have been registered in Canada for a long time. 
Hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent on that but there 
is very little being spent on drugs.  There is very little being 
spent on young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a case today where a young man 18 years old is going to 
spend about seven years in jail for viciously murdering a young 
girl in Victoria.  I do not think that is acceptable to most 
Canadians.  Had this bill been brought in a year or two ago as it 
should have been, it would have had a major impact on that young 
man.  He would have been treated as a real adult and got real 
adult sentencing and served a long time in prison for a very 
vicious crime, which is what he should do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also are not spending any money on rehabilitation.  The 
government did not want to include 10 to 12 year olds in this 
bill.  All the provinces want to do that whether they are NDP 
provinces, Conservative provinces or Liberal provinces. They want 
to include those young people to rehabilitate them to make sure 
they do not turn into criminals.  This government will not do 
that because it does not want to spend the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country has a serious problem with crime, a serious problem 
with young children. We have a government that likes public 
relations but likes very little action and that is too bad for 
our families and too bad for our children.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government will take a chance over the summer 
holidays to look at what it is doing and come back with a mandate 
from the people to do what the people want to solve this problem 
for young people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the 
Environment, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the member's comments have 
distracted me so much because of a number of things I would like 
to say.  Let us make sure that a crime never occurs and a victim 
is never created.  Let us include things like the national child 
tax benefit.  Let us invest in our young people and make sure 
they have healthier tomorrows rather than end of pipe solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In responding to the member opposite I would like to clarify the 
rules that govern publication of names, because that was the 
specific question that he raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-68, publication of names will continue to be 
allowed in all cases where the youth is sentenced to an adult 
penalty.  Publication will be prohibited when a youth is 
sentenced to a youth penalty unless the sentence is given for a 
presumptive offence such as murder.  In those cases the 
presumption is that publication bans could not apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are however two situations when the name of a young person 
receiving a youth sentence for a presumptive offence would not be 
publishable.  The first occurs when the attorney general does not 
seek an adult sentence.  The second occurs when a judge considers 
an application by the youth or the attorney general and 
determines that publication should be prohibited based on the 
importance of rehabilitating the youth and the public interest. 
These rules will give judges the guidance and flexibility to 
enable them to take into account the particular circumstances of 
the young person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that publication will also continue to 
be allowed when it is necessary to apprehend a youth who is 
dangerous and wanted for a serious offence.  The government 
believes in an open justice system.  However, we must remember 
that youth are more vulnerable than adults.  Their chances for 
rehabilitation are greater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Publication is banned in all cases where a youth sentence is 
imposed for a non-presumptive offence.  However, when a sentence 
is so serious that the youth is sentenced as an adult then the 
rules applying to adults must apply to youth, including the 
publication of names.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it gives me 
no great pleasure to rise on this issue tonight during 
adjournment debate because the Prime Minister continues to evade, 
avoid and delay on the important question of why close to $9 
million of government grants, loans and contracts end up in the 
hands of a select few:  a criminal, a fraud artist and the Prime 
Minister's single biggest contributor in the last federal 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister had the arrogance to stand before the House 
this afternoon and say that these shady Shawinigan shenanigans 
will help his re-election efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the people of Saint-Maurice are all that 
impressed that the Prime Minister's office intervenes on behalf 
of a convicted criminal, with Yvon Duhaime getting close to 
$900,000 in grants and loans.  I do not think they are impressed 
that someone with a record of not paying his taxes, not paying 
his creditors, should get his hands on their money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget the hotel owned by Mr. Duhaime, which he 
bought from the holding company in which the Prime Minister has a 
financial interest, was in serious financial difficulty prior to 
the Prime Minister's largesse starting to roll in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Montreal business consultant Yvon Plante, MBA, stated in a March 
27, 1997 report that the Grand-Mère Inn had a long term debt of 
$1.49 million, $350,000 above a manageable level; lacked $250,000 
in working capital and required a $350,000 investment; had 
compiled $330,204 in unpaid bills, an amount considered by Mr. 
Plante to be three times an acceptable level for a company of its 
size; had scheduled mortgage loan payments totalling on average 
more than $210,000 annually between 1998 and 2002, payments which 
Mr. Plante viewed as unthinkable given the firm's financial 
situation at the time; had no well trained accountant; had no 
budget; and had no standard bookkeeping system, resulting in 
management not being able to obtain a monthly financial statement 
of the company's revenues versus expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, a final report submitted by Mr. Plante to the 
Government of Quebec on May 8, 1998, concluded that the 
Grand-Mère Inn's accounting system and budget planning had shown 
no improvement in one year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone with a track record like Yvon Duhaime and the 
Grand-Mère Inn asked for more money from a bank or from private 
investors, they would be laughed off the street.  Yet somehow the 
Prime Minister defends this type of government spending as 
working for his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it working for criminals like Yvon Duhaime? Yes.  Is it 
working for admitted fraud artists like Pierre Thibault?  Yes. 
Is it working for Liberal Party financial donors like Claude 
Gauthier?  Absolutely. 
Is it working for Saint-Maurice?  Well, judging the high rates of 
unemployment and poverty in that region of Quebec, this apparent 
brand of “I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine” politics 
does not seem to be too effective.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the parliamentary secretary will no doubt stand up and say 
that everything was above-board with respect to the $6.3 million 
CIDA contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is true, I challenge the government to prove it by 
releasing all the documents related to the awarding of the 
contract.  Certainly Markham Electric, a company in my riding 
which lost the CIDA bid to Mr. Gauthier's company, would 
appreciate a substantive answer.  Certainly the taxpayers would 
appreciate an answer on whether it takes $43,000 in donations to 
the Prime Minister's campaign and the Liberal Party of Canada to 
obtain multimillion dollar contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody wants to unduly besmirch the Prime Minister's name, but 
if everything was above-board, let him release all the documents 
related to these funding decisions and let them call in the 
auditor general to audit these deals. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the 
Environment, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, if only there were not so 
many members so willing to besmirch the Prime Minister's name. 
Why do they not step outside the House and say all the things 
that they are saying in here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me set the record straight.  This contract is between the 
Government of Mali and a Canadian company.  It was awarded 
through an open competitive process.  This process considers the 
quality of the company's services to ensure the best possible 
results for the people of Mali, which is one of the world's 
poorest countries.  The selection process gives top priority to 
the cost of the bids to ensure the best possible use of our 
taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some reason opposition members have chosen to disregard 
these facts.  I believe members should be outraged had the 
contract been awarded to any other bidder since this would have 
increased the cost to Canadian taxpayers by at least $2.5 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate cannot possibly be about patronage since the 
selection committee was made up of two officials from the 
Government of Mali, one independent Canadian expert specializing 
in electrical projects and one CIDA official acting as an 
observer.  Responsibility for the choice of the contracting firm 
rested with these representatives, not with the CIDA official who 
was there to ensure the integrity and transparency of the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It certainly did not rest with the minister responsible for 
CIDA, who was informed of the selection after the final decision 
was made.  The lowest bid got the contract and the opposition has 
not offered up a shred of evidence to support its ridiculous 
allegations.  It is more interested in slinging mud at a man who 
has spent the last three and a half decades serving this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The motion to adjourn 
the House is now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly, the 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6:32 p.m.)
