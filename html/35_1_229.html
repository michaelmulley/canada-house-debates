	The House resumed from September 19 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-94, an act to regulate interprovincial trade in and 
the importation for commercial purposes of certain manganese 
based substances, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
continuing on from my speech which was interrupted by a vote on 
Tuesday.
<P>
	The environment minister claims MMT contributes to sparkplug 
failures, in particular a type of sparkplug manufactured by General 
Motors. GM claims there were more warranty complaints against 
one of its single engine sparkplugs in Canada than in the U.S. and 
MMT was to blame. However, studies conducted by the Southwest 
Research Institute demonstrate that a short circuit problem occurs 
in the brand new plugs and it has nothing to do with MMT. It is also 
important to note that GM has since withdrawn the sparkplug in 
question from the North American market. Therefore, in short, that 
argument does not hold any weight.
<P>
	What we seem to be missing on this issue are the facts. The 
Canadian Petroleum Producers Institute has called for the 
environment minister to allow industry to examine MMT and its 
impacts in a fact based joint assessment which would be conducted 
by PPI and the automakers; in other words, get the two players in 
the same room.
<P>
	Why has the government refused to call for or conduct an 
independent technical review? The largest fuel additives testing 
program in history conducted over five years for the U.S. EPA 
concluded MMT poses no problems for vehicle emission systems.
<P>
	In addition, the recent decision by the U.S. court of appeals 
determined that MMT does not cause or  contribute to a failure of 
any emission control device or system. The EPA testing program 
looked at MMT's effects on catalytic converters, onboard 
diagnostic systems, exhaust systems and sparkplugs among a 
variety of other factors. The EPA concluded MMT passes the most 
critical of tests with a comfortable margin.
<P>
	As a result of the U.S. EPA testing program, MMT may be 
introduced in the U.S. by the fall of 1995. Why then are we banning 
it in Canada when the government has stated it wants a uniformity 
of standards with the U.S.? The result of the U.S. court decision 
alone would be sufficient reason for the government to withdraw 
Bill C-94.
<P>
	We need to look closely at why we are being asked to consider 
banning interprovincial trade in MMT. This proposed ban clearly 
contradicts Bill C-88 which is intended to remove barriers to 
international trade and constitutes unilateral interference into 
interprovincial matters. We need to have some solid evidence 
before making such a move.
<P>
	Bill C-94 must be examined more thoroughly by the industry 
committee. As it stands we are still left with more questions than 
answers. Without any legitimate answer from the government the 
bill cannot be justified.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this 
debate on the second reading of Bill C-94 and more particularly on 
the Reform Party amendment proposed by the member for Calgary 
North who does not think we should proceed with Bill C-94, an act 
to regulate interprovincial trade and so on. She thinks the bill 
should be withdrawn and we should merely refer this issue for 
further study before a parliamentary committee. I would like to 
speak to that for a moment.
<P>
<B>(1005)</B>
<P>
	Every now and then the Reform Party in its wisdom tells us we 
should not procrastinate, delay things, debate them too long, that 
we should move on with things. I heard profound speeches from 
hon. members of the Reform Party yesterday, at least as profound 
as we can get from Reform members, admonishing the government 
and all of us, asking us to pass legislation more quickly. What is the 
first thing they do? They propose an amendment asking that we not 
proceed with this bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14754"> 14754 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us get to the subject matter of the bill to determine whether 
the Reform Party is correct in what it wants.  What does the bill do? 
The purpose of the bill is to prohibit the import or the 
interprovincial trade for commercial purposes of MMT or anything 
containing MMT. What does that mean? It means that particular 
additive to gasoline would not be permitted.
<P>
	I suppose the next question is does everyone not use MMT? It is 
not used in hardly any country except ours, and I will get into more 
specific details in a minute. Could it be that if it is not good enough 
for anyone else then perhaps we should consider banning that 
product as well?
<P>
	Some people will say it is used in a variety of countries. The 
Ethyl Corporation put an ad in newspapers yesterday or the day 
before saying it is used in some countries and gave the examples of 
Brazil and New Zealand, I believe. It is used there and let it not be 
said it is not used anywhere.
<P>
	I did not keep the advertisement in question because I thought 
the corporation's own sales pitch made the reverse argument of 
what it was trying to prove. It was saying it was not true that it was 
not used anywhere, that it was not used just about everywhere. I 
thought that reinforced the argument most of us believed in.
<P>
	MMT should be banned for a number of reasons. The product in 
question has been known to have effects which are offensive to the 
health of people. That is why it was not used in many countries. 
That is why it is still not used by most nations. The question we 
should ask is does it make it any better if we keep the product? No, 
that does not work either.
<P>
	The hon. member for Bruce-Grey the other day gave us a very 
important speech on this issue. He is very knowledgeable in the 
area. He taught that subject matter as a teacher and knows much 
about it. He told us why the attitude of some people with regard to 
this product is totally wrong.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> We should get Reform to read it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Yes, we should get Reform members to read the 
speech of the hon. member, although I am sure most members 
would want to read all speeches from the hon. member for 
Bruce-Grey because they are so very eloquent.
<P>
	Coming back to the matter in question of MMT, we in this 
country use that product. It is an additive to gasoline. It is an octane 
enhancer in effect but there are other octane enhancers we can use. 
For instance, ethanol can and has been used to provide the same 
kind of octane enhancement. I know ethanol cannot be a total 
replacement but that in itself along with other initiatives proposed 
by the Minister of the Environment assists the agricultural area, 
helps to clean up the environment and rids us of the product known 
as MMT.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I see that the member across from me disagrees; he says that is 
wrong. Well if the hon. member thinks so, he may be able to 
convince U.S. authorities and all the other jurisdictions in Western 
Europe, etc. All those countries are probably wrong while the hon. 
member is right. I am sure that many would have different opinions 
on this matter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	People ask whether sparkplugs are affected by MMT. Auto 
manufacturers have reported there is a greater incidence of 
sparkplug failure in Canada compared with similar product 
offerings in the United States. Sparkplug failure and other 
problems of that nature which are caused by the use of MMT affect 
automobile performance. Cars that do not perform well waste more 
gasoline, pollute more and so on; it is a chain reaction.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that the maintenance schedule which 
includes tune ups and so on for the brand of car I drive is 
substantially different in Canada from the United States. Why does 
a car have to be tuned up less frequently in Minnesota than in 
Ontario or Manitoba? There is no logical reason save perhaps what 
is used to propel the car is different and maintenance may be 
required more in one jurisdiction than the other. We are told 
precisely by auto manufacturers in the instance of sparkplug failure 
that there is greater wear on sparkplugs and a greater incidence of 
failures where MMT is used compared with where it is not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Why did we not do this years ago?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I do not know. The hon. member for Kingston and 
the Islands has put it very eloquently by asking why we did not do 
this some time ago because the product was banned in the United 
States a long time ago.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I do not know. Of course, for almost a decade, we had a 
government that was very much like the Reform Party in front of 
us, namely the Tory government, and that probably did not help.
<P>
	Today, we have the opportunity to right this wrong by adopting 
measures to clean up the environment. I know that the former 
Minister of the Environment, the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean, 
who is a great environmentalist, will want to vote in favour of this 
bill, as will all other parliamentarians concerned about cleaning up 
our country's environment.
<P>
	In conclusion, I ask all my colleagues to vote in favour of the bill 
tabled by the hon. Minister of the Environment and against the 
amendment put forward by the hon. member for Calgary North, 
who is once again demonstrating the Reform Party's systematic

<P>
and systemic efforts to block any worthwhile initiative aimed at 
cleaning up this country's environment.

<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you 
for the opportunity to speak to this issue again. I listened to the 
members from the opposite side and I am absolutely amazed at the 
blatant untruths that are being spewed forth from members 
opposite. I have studied this issue very carefully and there is simply 
no independent evidence to support the statements we have just 
heard being made.
<P>
	There is all sorts of evidence to support exactly the opposite. The 
Canadian Department of Health did studies and concluded there 
was absolutely no detrimental effect to the health of Canadians or 
anyone else by using MMT. That is simply factual evidence. The 
government continues to spew forth studies from the Canadian 
Automobile Association which it refuses to release to the public 
and so we can neither deny nor verify them. It is simply not true.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	I fail to understand what is really driving the agenda. We heard 
some comments about the ethanol industry and how we should give 
the industry a leg up, which I suppose means subsidization of an 
industry that cannot compete on an equal playing field. We 
certainly do not support that kind of initiative. If the ethanol 
industry can exist viably without taxpayer subsidization then good 
for it. We wish the industry all the luck.
<P>
	In speaking with the refiners in Canada that refine and formulate 
our gasolines, they assure me that even if MMT were banned 
ethanol would not replace MMT as a gasoline additive. The only 
thing banning MMT would do would force refiners to be more 
intensive in their refining process, to use more crude oil, to refine it 
further, causing higher CO2 emissions, higher benzene emissions 
and higher sulphur emissions. Again those facts simply do not back 
up what is being said.
<P>
	There was some debate when I spoke the other day on this matter 
about whether the minister had met with Ethyl Corporation, the 
other side of the issue. I specifically said she has consistently 
refused to meet with both sides of the issue to discuss it and to 
listen to all the facts. After having spoken on it and after having had 
the debate with members opposite I checked to make sure I was 
correct. The Canadian Petroleum Products Institute wrote to me. It 
also wrote to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the 
Environment. The letter reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I listened with interest to the second reading debate on Bill C-94 and while I 
do not agree with your position in this matter, I appreciate your interest in this 
subject. I would, however, like to address one issue you raised with the member 
from Athabasca, Mr. David Chatters, during the question and comment period 
following his speech.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Chatters quite correctly pointed out that Minister Copps has refused to 
meet with representatives of Ethyl. In reply, you stated twice that the minister 
met twice with CPPI as a representative of Ethyl, on this issue.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I want to be completely clear on this point. The Canadian Petroleum Products 
Institute does not now, nor has it ever, spoken on behalf of Ethyl Canada or 
Ethyl Corporation. Ethyl is not a member of CPPI, as membership is limited to 
producers and marketers of motor gasoline.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Representatives of Ethyl have met once with the minister's staff and have met 
on a few occasions with departmental officials. We have asked for, and been 
refused a meeting with the minister.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I would ask that you correct this statement at your earliest opportunity.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Clearly there is a lot of confusion, a lot of misinformation and a 
lot of untruth surrounding the issue. The government repeatedly 
claims to promote the reduction of interprovincial trade barriers 
and to promote trade between the provinces. On the issue the 
minister of the environment for Alberta said: ``It is unclear that the 
removal of MMT from gasoline has a net environmental benefit. 
Alberta favours the design of a suitable binding process to resolve 
the dispute in a fair and timely fashion. An open multi-stakeholder 
review of the environmental and economic merits of MMT should 
be key to the dispute resolution mechanism to credibly solve the 
vehicle fuel compatibility issue''.
<P>
	I have a letter from Michael Shaw, deputy minister of the 
environment and resource management for Saskatchewan, to Mel 
Cappe, deputy minister of Environment Canada, which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association has not convinced 
Saskatchewan and the majority of the provinces that there is any evidence to 
show that MMT has an adverse effect on the onboard diagnostic systems.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are also concerned with the impact this decision has on the Consumers' 
Co-operative Refineries Limited-in Regina. CCRL has advised us that refining 
costs will increase in the order of $500,000 annually if MMT is banned. We have 
difficulty rationalizing this cost with no identifiable benefits to air quality by 
this action.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	I have a letter from the minister of the environment for Nova 
Scotia, Wayne Adams, which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We have recently expressed concerns to the federal Minister of the 
Environment's stated intention to legislate a ban on the use of this additive.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment has 
established a task force on cleaner vehicles and fuels. The mandate 
of this task group includes the development of options for setting 
minimum standards for reformulated fuels as a measure to improve 
air quality. The assessment will be done in such a way as to provide 
a national approach and the continued use of MMT in Canada will 
undoubtedly be one of the issues reviewed. The results of an 
independent study and the benefits and detriments of MMT would 
undoubtedly be considered.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14756"> 14756 </A></B>
<P>
	David Wilson, the provincial minister of the environment for 
New Brunswick, said: ``It seems there are two opposing views on 
the value of MMT to the environment. Perhaps an independent 
review is warranted''.
<P>
	Norman Brandson, Manitoba's deputy minister of the 
environment, said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The potential negative impacts or positive benefits arising from the 
continued use of MMT as an additive to unleaded fuels seems to be an issue that 
includes comprehension of significant technical information. There needs to be 
a resolution that will be in the best interests of the environment and the 
consumer, for both the short and long term.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It would be much preferred that this issue could be resolved directly between 
the industries involved (the manufacturer of vehicles and those providing the 
fuels for those vehicles).</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would hardly deem that as support for the initiative from the 
provinces.
<P>
	Again we go back to the statements that are being made on the 
issue continually from the opposite side of the House. Again I 
reiterate that I cannot understand what is driving the agenda 
because the evidence is so clear and indisputably against what the 
government has been saying on the issue.
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Some companies have indicated that, rather than accept the possibility of 
increased warranty repair costs, they may disconnect OBDs or reduce vehicle 
warranty coverage unless steps are taken to remove MMT from unleaded 
gasolines in Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That simply is not a valid statement. In blaming MMT for the 
onboard diagnostic problems the automakers have not disclosed 
that the automobile industry has experienced substantial technical 
difficulties in complying with the onboard diagnostic II 
requirements in the U.S. where MMT is not currently being used 
and has not been used for 18 years. It is not MMT that is causing 
problems with the onboard diagnostic equipment. It is simply that 
the technology has not been perfected and developed to the point 
where it is reliable.
<P>
	Another statement by the minister reads that removing MMT 
``will ensure that the most up to date equipment used to reduce air 
pollution with will not be jeopardized by components in the fuel''.
<P>
	That comes from the Environment Canada news release on May 
19, 1995 and is simply not true. The automakers are blaming MMT 
for onboard diagnostic problems with certification that I spoke 
about before. The government has blindly accepted that argument 
without any studies or without any facts, or at least without any 
independent studies of the auto making industry.
<P>
	The next statement reads: ``The automobile industry is 
convinced that MMT has an adverse effect on the operation of 
vehicle emission control components including sophisticated 
onboard diagnostic systems''.  That statement is also from an 
Environment Canada news release May 19, 1995. It continues: 
``The automobile manufacturers have failed to demonstrate any 
adverse effects related to MMT and have not disclosed onboard II 
certification problems in the U.S. Most of the Motor Vehicle 
Manufacturers Association information on onboard computers has 
been previously rejected by both the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency and the U.S. court of appeals''.
<P>
	Before the end of the year MMT will again be used in the United 
States, which would mean that if we are to achieve formulation 
compatibility between the two countries, as was the wish of the 
Minister of Industry, we would then be required to leave MMT in 
the formulation rather than remove it.
<P>
	If one cares to look at the evidence-and it does not seem to be 
very important in the debate that is taking place-there simply is 
no strong independent evidence that MMT has caused any of the 
problems we spoke about.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	It is very important that we step back, take another look and do 
some independent studies in the time we have before the product is 
again released in the U.S. to verify this argument one way or the 
other. That is a reasonable request and one based on the evidence 
before us.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first and foremost, following the Reform 
member from Athabasca, he should check his facts because when 
he refers to factual statements by the New Brunswick environment 
minister he should at least get his name straight.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The federal government took a decisive step to protect the 
environment, jobs and consumers and to ensure Canada remains a 
leader in automotive technology.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-94 will prohibit the import and interprovincial trade of 
MMT, a manganese based fuel additive manufactured in the United 
States. The proposed bill, to be known as the manganese based fuel 
additives act, will come into effect 60 days after it gains assent.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Only in Canada is MMT added to unleaded gasoline. The United 
States banned MMT from their unleaded gas in 1978. Bulgaria and 
Argentina are the only other countries interested in using it. Why is 
MMT not used in a larger number of countries? Because MMT 
impedes the functioning of emission control devices on modern 
cars and trucks.
<P>
	Environment Canada has received and reviewed many studies on 
the effects of MMT on this kind of system. I  agree with Ford, 
Chrysler, General Motors, Toyota, Honda, Subaru, Nissan, Mazda, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14757"> 14757 </A></B>
<P>
Mercedes, BMW, Volkswagen, Volvo, Saab, Lada, Jaguar, Land 
Rover and Hyundai, who all say that MMT impairs the operation of 
state-of-the-art onboard diagnostic systems, or OBD systems, 
where the vehicle's emission control device is located.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These systems are extremely important for the environment. 
They are responsible for monitoring the vehicle's emission control 
and for alerting the driver to malfunctions. They ensure that the 
clean burning engines of today and tomorrow operate as designed. 
They ensure that automobiles are properly maintained, resulting in 
decreased tailpipe emissions and improved fuel economy.
<P>
	In other words, it is one more important tool to help us address 
air pollution, including smog and climate change.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government will not let MMT prevent the Canadian 
automotive industry from designing vehicles that are much less 
polluting. Our environment and Canadian consumers deserve that 
the best emission control systems be used.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Yet the Ethyl Corporation, the manufacturer of MMT, and its 
subsidiary Ethyl Canada refute the vehicle industry allegation 
about the ill effects of MMT on the vehicle emission control 
systems and make a counterclaim that MMT is environmentally 
beneficial.
<P>
	What is certain is that our efforts to reduce motor vehicle 
pollution can no longer be addressed by just the petroleum 
industry, the auto industry or the federal government. Progress at 
reducing vehicle pollution requires simultaneous action by all. The 
petroleum industry needs to keep making improvements in the 
composition and properties of the fuels the engines burn.
<P>
	The auto industry needs to keep making improvement in vehicle 
emission control technologies such as those offered through 
onboard diagnostic systems. The government needs to take 
decisive action such as Bill C-94, which removes a major obstacle 
to the introduction of these technologies.
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	However, our strategy to reduce vehicle pollution goes beyond 
just taking action against MMT. The federal government is doing 
its part because we know that automobiles are a major contributor 
to climate change and urban smog as well as some toxic pollutants 
like benzene.
<P>
	In a recently released task force report done by Canada's deputy 
ministers of the environment, it is noted that even with the 
improvements in emissions  technology, vehicles are still the 
largest contributors to air pollution. On a national basis gasoline 
and diesel powered vehicles still contribute some 60 per cent of 
carbon monoxide emissions, 35 per cent of nitrous oxide 
emissions, or smog, 25 per cent of hydrocarbon emissions and 20 
per cent of carbon dioxide emissions.
<P>
	The report stresses the need I talked about earlier to proceed on 
all fronts simultaneously. It states: ``Vehicle technology and fuel 
composition, although two separate industry sectors, must be 
treated as an integrated system in the development of policies and 
programs in order to successfully reduce emissions from motor 
vehicles''. This is good advice. It should complement our work in 
preparing a comprehensive motor vehicle emissions control 
strategy which includes the adoption of more stringent vehicle 
exhaust emission standards. To meet these standards we are 
counting on integrating improvements achieved in emissions 
control technologies and fuels.
<P>
	Clearly we cannot hope to meet these standards without the kind 
of action we are taking against MMT in Bill C-94. It is not an 
action of impatience. Since 1985 the federal government has 
waited for the automotive and petroleum industries to resolve the 
situation without legislation. It was not resolved. The time for 
waiting is over. It is now time for the government to act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government will not wait any longer and risk compromising 
federal vehicle emission programs just because both sides cannot 
come to an agreement. The government will not sit back while auto 
manufacturers take standard diagnostic systems on 1996 models 
off line or refuse to have them covered under car warranties 
because of the damage caused by MMT.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is decision time. Last October the Minister of the Environment 
urged both industries to voluntarily resolve the issue of MMT in 
Canada by the end of 1994, otherwise the government would take 
action. This deadline was subsequently extended into February of 
this year to review automobile and petroleum industry proposals. 
The MMT issue is no longer an industry dispute. Its outcome can 
affect the vehicle emissions program that we are putting into place 
and in the long term it could also negatively impact the automobile 
sector.
<P>
	A successful resolution of the MMT issue will ensure that 
environmental benefits are realized with the use of the most 
advanced emissions control technologies. It will ensure that 
Canadians are offered the same warranty coverage as in the United 
States. It will ensure Canadian motor vehicle emissions control 
programs do not diverge from those in the United States. This 
means Canadians continue to benefit from the cost and 
technological advantages of a North American harmonized fleet. It  
means Canada's auto sector will maintain its competitiveness.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14758"> 14758 </A></B>
<P>
	I know some have expressed concern with our plan to prohibit 
the use of MMT in Canadian gasoline given a recent U.S. court 
decision to grant Ethyl a waiver to use MMT in unleaded gasoline 
sold in the United States. However, let it be perfectly clear that 
MMT still cannot be used in unleaded gasoline in the U.S.
<P>
	Let us move ahead. Let us do it because we need new emission 
control technologies like the onboard diagnostic system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We will not tolerate that Canadian consumers be denied access to 
the same pollution control technologies as their American 
counterparts because gasoline in the U.S. does not contain MMT.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	We will not allow such a discrepancy to exist between Canadian 
and American vehicles.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am terribly sorry, but time has run out.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the motion moved by my colleague from Calgary North is 
a logical one, a motion of practical sense.
<P>
	I encourage members of the House to listen carefully to the 
debate. The motion is realistic and I urge the House to adopt it 
when it comes to a vote which I assume will be on Monday.
<P>
	The title given the bill does not sound like one that should be 
sponsored by an environment minister. Bill C-94 is an act to 
regulate interprovincial trade in and the importation for 
commercial purposes of certain manganese based substances.
<P>
	Why is the Minister of the Environment so keen on the passage 
of the bill? When one sees something this discordant it usually 
plays out in the end, when all the documentation is finally exposed, 
that a short term political deal has been struck. Someone has the 
inside track and then much puffery is used to hide the intent.
<P>
	The bill presented by the environment minister has nothing to do 
with helping clean up the environment. Consequently one has to 
ask what is really going on here. Few believe the minister, yet she 
proceeds with justifications. It is embarrassing to watch.
<P>
	In theory one would expect that a minister of the environment 
would have little in common with car makers. After all, cars are the 
leading cause of smog. I suppose that when we look at where the 
minister resides the notion becomes a little clearer. Hamilton East 
is right in the heartland of auto makers central.
<P>
	Not long ago officials from the Department of the Environment 
came to my office to explain the background of the bill. When they 
were asked what impact the bill would have toward helping the 
environment they had to admit it was slim to none and at best 
maybe only indirectly.
<P>
	Some time ago I received an explanation of the onboard 
diagnostic systems that are said to sometimes not work when MMT 
is included in gasoline. According to the Motor Vehicle 
Manufacturers Association the 1996 cars are to be equipped with 
the latest technology but because MMT is still in Canadian fuel 
they simply unplug the sensor lights for the systems.
<P>
	Canadians need to picture this. Canada's environment minister is 
banning the use of a fuel additive because a little part on a car is 
said to create a premature warning light to go on. Where is the 
national environmental concern here?
<P>
	I am not disputing that onboard diagnostic systems may be 
beneficial. Politicians hoped they would make car pollution 
equipment more reliable so they ordered manufacturers to put them 
on. Consumers sure did not ask for it and the reluctant car makers 
also balked.
<P>
	Car makers kicked back and designed a scheme to blame 
someone else for their technical failures and shortcomings and 
their unwillingness to pay. Let us be clear: OBDs do not regulate or 
control emission systems, neither do they clean anything. I think 
some people are assuming these devices will reduce pollution from 
our environment. It is just adding warning lights, or as we used to 
say idiot lights, on the dashboard that signal that the existing 
pollution controls are normal.
<P>
	Imagine it, idiot lights for cars are a legislative priority of the 
Minister of the Environment. The minister likes lights on her 
dashboard, so she brings a $1 billion disruption to the Canadian 
petroleum industry to get a little lighted colour in her driving 
experience. When the public absorbs what the minister is doing I 
know what they will want to do to her lights.
<P>
	In the United States the Environmental Protection Agency 
placed a moratorium on MMT in 1978. It was a raw deal by some 
American politicians and regulators that will eventually be 
corrected in the courts. So far the United States court of appeals 
found that the EPA did not have the evidence to prove that MMT 
should not be used.
<P>
	Banning MMT in Canada is not an environmental issue. 
However it could very easily have been had Health Canada found it 
harmful but it did not. It could not, no matter how hard it tried. In 
fact Health Canada on December 6, 1994 issued a report entitled 
``Risk Assessment for the Combustive Products of MMT''. It 
reported: ``All analyses indicate that the combustion products of 
MMT in gasoline do not represent an added health risk to the 
Canadian population''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14759"> 14759 </A></B>
<P>
	I am sure the minister would have liked to put the substance 
on the listed schedule under the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act to please her friends, except Health Canada got in 
the way and made an unfavourable ruling.
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	If the minister could have banned MMT under CEPA she would 
not have needed this legislation. If the environment minister cannot 
prove this bill will directly affect the environment then I say this 
should not be an environmental bill.
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment is telling Canadians the 
removal of MMT will significantly improve the quality of our 
environment. That is wrong, very wrong. The removal of MMT 
will increase nitrous oxide or NOx emissions by 20 per cent. That 
is why MMT is used. It is there to make gas burn cleaner, to help 
the environment. In case Canadians do not know what NOx creates, 
it is smog.

system, so we are all safe.
<P>
	The hon. member has four minutes left in his intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Mr. Speaker, constituents of Hamilton East should 
know their MP has created legislation that will increase smog over 
Hamilton. The Canadian Petroleum Products Institute recently 
made a claim that removing MMT would be the equivalent of 
adding over one million additional cars to Canadian roads. That is 
what this environment minister is doing.
<P>
	It is said that the onboard diagnostic sensors are put in cars 
essentially for consumer protection. Industry Canada's role is to 
protect, assist and support consumers' interests. It would only 
make sense this bill be made an industry bill and dealt with in a 
more technical light. If the bill is industrial rather than 
environmental, it should then go to the appropriate standing 
committee.
<P>
	Further, the problem addressed in this bill is essentially a 
commercial dispute between two industries, the automobile 
manufacturers and the petroleum  refiners. It is about who pays to 
reach the next level. The Minister of the Environment really has no 
business stepping into the fray of this marketplace decision and the 
deals and the manoeuvres going on in another country.
<P>
	Last year the minister was pressured by the MVMA and 
therefore found a way to make the issue an environmental bill. 
Apparently representatives from General Motors, Ford and 
Chrysler met with the Minister of the Environment to discuss the 
banning of MMT. They told her that if MMT was still in gasoline in 
August 1995, a time when all new models would be released, they 
would do one of three things: raise the price of each automobile by 
$3,000; void sections of their car warranties; and/or close down 
some high technology Canadian manufacturing units. She could 
not because Reformers were here, and they did not do what they 
threatened to do because they lied in the first place.
<P>
	The minister did not know and for that matter probably did not 
care what effects MMT had on the environment. She knew the 
MVMA have tremendous power. When they said jump, she asked 
how high.
<P>
	Our motion is to change the wording of the bill so it reads that 
the subject matter be referred to the Standing Committee on 
Industry. The House has heard the Minister of Industry rise on 
questions related to the issue. He realizes that it is closely 
associated with his department. However, the industry minister did 
not take it on because it was too embarrassing a proposal.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry has said he wants a uniformity of 
standards between the U.S. and Canada. He stated in the House on 
April 25, 1995 that ``it is crucial that we have uniformity of 
standards. The efforts we have put into trying to ensure there was a 
voluntary agreement between the two sectors has been well placed, 
but finally governments have to decide''.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry wants our fuel to be the same as it is for 
various parts of the United States. He wants some uniformity. He 
may not have to wait very long. The United States is set to have the 
American MMT prohibition lifted some time before Christmas of 
this year. However, the Minister of the Environment is too 
committed down a certain path to thoughtfully do what is right. She 
is on a direct course to please her friends, play with her Canada, 
and leave us with all the bills.
<P>
	All members of the House are honourable enough to evaluate 
what is really going on here. The Liberal backbenchers know what 
is going on. If there were ever a time to blow the whistle on the 
boss, it will be on Monday when we have a vote on the motion 
moved by my colleague from Calgary North. It is eminently 
sensible and appropriate to send this bill to the industry committee.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 11 a.m., pursuant to the standing order we 
will now hear statements by members.

	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the interim agreement just signed at the United Nations between 
Greece and FYROM, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 
meets two key international issues raised by the Greek government: 
removal from FYROM's flag of Alexander the Great's star and 
removal from FYROM's constitution of apparent irredentist claims 
on Greek territory.
<P>
	FYROM's name, a principal barrier to normalization of relations 
and co-operation between the two states, is agreed as a subject for 
further negotiation.
<P>
	Canada's policy of non-recognition of FYROM until these issues 
should be resolved has contributed positively to the diplomatic 
negotiations now under way and should be maintained until a full, 
binding legal agreement is achieved, probably at the end of 
October.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, after announcing 
that it would eliminate 10,000 jobs between now and 1997, Bell 
Canada refuses to use the voluntary departures of 328 telephone 
operators in Quebec to avoid having to lay off 100 other 
employees.
<P>
	Bell Canada justifies its decision by pointing to the stiff 
competition which it must face since the CRTC forced the company 
to end its monopoly.
<P>
	We can understand that Bell Canada must remain a profitable 
venture; however, it must not do so at the expense of many families 
and without any consideration for the economic survival of several 
Quebec and Ontario regions, which are severely affected by the 
company's decision.
<P>
	While all of this is going on, the Minister of Labour remains 
silent. She does not do anything to reduce the negative impact of 
that situation on the families concerned. The centralizing approach 
of the federal government is now being copied by large companies 
and that is unacceptable.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Canadian taxpayers have been held up, held down, 
sand bagged, walked on, sat on, flattened  out and squeezed by our 
income tax system and by the GST.
<P>
	Every year Revenue Canada makes sure that as taxpayers we are 
inspected, suspected, audited, examined and re-examined to the 
point that we do not know who we are, where we are or why we stay 
here at all. All we know is that as taxpayers we are supposed to 
have an inexhaustible supply of money for every whim that suits 
high brow Liberals but not brow beaten Canadians.
<P>
	Taxpayers are tired of being held up, hung up, robbed and darn 
near ruined by excessive taxation in this country. Many families are 
hanging on now fearful for what happens next. Our message to 
them and all Canadians consists of two simple words: flat tax.
<P>
	For all those who have cussed, discussed and boycotted our 
convoluted Income Tax Act we say hang on. A simple, visible and 
fair tax system is on its way; so too is a Reform government for 
Canada.
<P>

supporter of the tax system.

happening to Canada's finest?
<P>
	Most Canadians were shocked to learn that the RCMP had joined 
with Disney in an effort to promote both of their images at home 
and abroad. However, what about the picture in today's <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>: six scarlet clad Mounties at the New York Stock Exchange on 
Wall Street, rented by a private oil company to promote its new 
stock listing on the New York Stock Exchange.
<P>
	The company also planned to use these rented Mounties to 
generate more publicity for its stock by having them chauffeur late 
night talk show host David Letterman to his studio. However this 
was nixed at the last minute, not by the RCMP but by Actors Equity 
which claims the Mounties were not professional actors.
<P>
	Is the RCMP now renting out members of the force to raise much 
needed budget funds or is it spending time back in Canada fighting 
crime? While its members are on Wall Street they are not fighting 
crime in Canada which is their mandate.

emphasis on training and our focus on helping small business have 
all helped to create real opportunities and jobs.
<P>
	It is time the Reform Party came clean with its plans for Canada. 
The complete dismantling of our social programs, the end of 
universal health care and the elimination of equalization payments 
to the provinces are all examples of that party's true national

Treasury Board warns federal public servants in Quebec to think 
twice about the nature of their employment before making public 
statements.
<P>
	Federal union officials are unanimous in denouncing this barely 
veiled threat because, notwithstanding the Liberal government's 
will to gag federal public servants, the Supreme Court recognized 
that they have the right to freely express their views during election 
or referendum campaigns.
<P>
	Since when does the government threaten its employees with 
losing their job if they exercise their right to speak freely? As we 
saw earlier this week, the government is once again about to 
sacrifice the rights and freedoms of Quebecers for the sake of 
Canadian unity.

justice minister has continued the tradition by appointing to the 
Court of Queen's Bench 11 party hacks, bagmen and party 
supporters to have a turn feeding snout deep at the taxpayers' 
expense.
<P>
	The Liberals promised in their infamous red book to end 
patronage. Canadians should know the only symbol their colour red 
stands for is the continuing debt and the colour of baloney. The 
Liberal justice system of social engineering and blaming society 
for the actions of criminals will continue with these appointments. 
The Liberal attitude of finding everyone wrong but special interests 
crying discrimination will continue because of these appointments.

an aging population, expensive technologies and an economic 
crisis have all combined to make medicare as we know it 
unsustainable. We must look at other new ways to preserve the 
intent of medicare which will ensure that all Canadians regardless 
of their income have essential health care services covered in a 
timely fashion.
<P>

as pointed out by Michel Van de Walle in his business column in

<P>

from the confusion around the author of the report. The firm of

endorses its conclusions.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PRIVATIZATIONOFPEARSONAIRPORT">PRIVATIZATION OF PEARSON AIRPORT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on two occasions-December 8, 1994 and March 27, 
1995-in response to questions by the official opposition, the 
Prime Minister stated in this House that he never met promoter 
Jack Matthews in order to discuss the privatization of the Pearson 
airport and has denied soliciting a contribution of $25,000 to his 
campaign for the leadership of the Liberal Party.
<P>
	Testifying last night in the Senate investigation of the Pearson 
scandal, Mr. Matthews stated under oath that he indeed met the 
Prime Minister in late 1989 or in early 1990, that discussions did 
indeed concern the privatization of Pearson airport and that the 
future leader of the Liberal Party asked him for a $25,000 
campaign contribution.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. In the face of this sworn 
testimony, will the Prime Minister continue in his denial or does he 
intend to change his version of the facts?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I continue in my denial. Particularly because the meeting 
was held on April 14, 1989 in the company of a lawyer, who 
testified under oath and kept notes in his files and because we 
discussed with Mr. Matthews the possibility of building a head 
office for Transport Canada on property in Ottawa.
<P>
	There was absolutely no discussion of Pearson airport and, what 
is more, I have never solicited funds from anyone during my 
political career. People were solicited by my supporters. He has got 
it mixed up again; he has the date wrong and everything. Mr. 
LaBarge has testified that he had no interest in it and that he is a 
lawyer. He testified very clearly confirming my version that we 
discussed the Transport Canada building and nothing else and that, 
at that point in time-April 1989-the then leader of the Liberal 
Party was still in office and had not yet resigned. I therefore have 
nothing to add to what I have said in this House.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in March 1994, as he did today, the Prime Minister relied 
on corroboration from his former colleague, lawyer Paul LaBarge, 
who also denied what Mr. Matthews said. Mr. LaBarge testified 
under oath yesterday as well before the Senate committee 
maintaining his denial.
<P>
	However, this morning's <I>Globe and Mail</I> reported obtaining a 
copy of the tape of last January's telephone call in which Mr. 
LaBarge contradicted his testimony of yesterday and confirmed 
Mr. Matthews statements. I quote the following passage from this 
morning's <I>Globe and Mail</I>:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``Mr. LaBarge confirms that the meeting took place just before 
Mr. Chrétien launched his bid for the Liberal leadership and that 
campaign contributions were discussed''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Given this recording in 
which Mr. LaBarge himself confirms Mr. Matthew's sworn 
testimony, will the Prime Minister, who has now been twice 
contradicted, acknowledge that his credibility is seriously in 
doubt?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I met with Mr. Matthews in the circumstances I described 
to this House in April 1989. We discussed the Transport Canada 
building, which, at that time, was the subject of various proposals 
the government wanted. I was a lawyer. I gave my opinion on 
whether they were following the right procedure and on the 
chances of successfully obtaining the contract. It was in April 
1989, as has been confirmed by Mr. LaBarge, who had it in his 
notes. And about the telephone call that was recorded without Mr. 
LaBarge's knowledge, I really do not know. All I know is that the 
dates are confirmed in the file in the office of the firm of lawyers I 
belonged to.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, apart from the fact that Mr. Matthews was under oath and 
runs the risk of facing very serious consequences for perjury, there 
is the fact that the Prime Minister can no longer use Mr. LaBarge's 
testimony as his support, because Mr. LaBarge contradicted him-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14764"> 14764 </A></B>
<P>
self in  the tape the <I>Globe and Mail</I> obtained, as it reported this 
morning, and this is very serious, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	So, if the Prime Minister is so sure of the truth of his words, why 
does he not go and repeat them under oath before the Senate 
committee of inquiry?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am the Prime Minister of Canada at the moment. I repeat 
that I was not a member of Parliament at the time, I was a lawyer, 
and we discussed the proposal for the Department of Transport 
building.
<P>
	There was no question of an election campaign at that point, and 
all those who know me know very well that I have never solicited 
funds on my own behalf for my election campaigns and that the 
facts are very clear in this regard. I give my word that I never 
discussed the Toronto airport with this man, who is having 
considerable difficulty himself remembering the dates and 
everything. I am not going to take the time to analyze all the many 
contradictions in his testimony.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, of course 
the Prime Minister's opinion commands respect. However, in this 
case it has been formally contradicted by a Canadian citizen 
speaking under oath and by a taped conservation.
<P>
	In the circumstances, would the Prime Minister not consider it 
would be most advisable for him to agree to testify under oath in 
order to clear up this matter? Would the Prime Minister agree with 
the importance of such a step?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when a minister rises in the House and gives his word, that 
is generally good enough for hon. members.
<P>
	Especially since according to one of his claims, he received a 
call from someone who is now one of my collaborators, Mr. 
Goldenberg, who allegedly also asked him for a contribution. Mr. 
Goldenberg has asked him, through his lawyers, to withdraw what 
he said. He never met Mr. Matthews and never spoke to him on the 
telephone.
<P>
	Mr. Matthews will have to face charges before the courts, since 
Mr. Goldenberg has instructed his lawyers to start legal 
proceedings against Mr. Matthews if he does not withdraw his 
statement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know it is 
customary, and indeed we do respect the word of a member in this 
House. However, the Prime Minister is no doubt aware that the 
parliamentary immunity, the legal immunity a member enjoys 
when he speaks in this House implies that when a citizen testifies 
under oath or a member agrees to testify under oath outside this 
House, the impact is far greater, because there are major legal 
consequences.
<P>
	In the circumstances, why should the Prime Minister, who 
knows the value of a sworn statement, leave any doubts as to his 
version of the facts and his integrity, considering he was formally 
contradicted by an individual who was speaking under oath and 
may face certain consequences? What this individual said is 
confirmed by a tape recording.
<P>
	Why should the Prime Minister be willing to leave these doubts 
in people's minds, when he has the convenient option of appearing 
before a Senate committee, being sworn like an ordinary citizen 
and repeating his statement?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am going by the precedents in this House for testimony 
by prime ministers. If you want to bring a Bible here, I will swear 
on the Bible in front of the entire country. Bring the Bible. I will 
swear on the Bible. I have no objection.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, do you have a Bible? I will swear on the Bible right 
now. If the hon. member will not respect a parliamentary tradition 
that says that when a member rises in this House, his word is as 
good as his oath, bring me a Bible and I will swear on the Bible, in

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the odour surrounding the cancellation of the Pearson 
airport contract continues to get worse. The government is now 
planning to use the taxpayers' money to buy its way out of a mess it 
created. It claims it will be an arm's length purchase by the greater 
Toronto airport authority, but what private sector lender provides 
175 per cent financing?
<P>
	The Prime Minister continuously slams the actions of the former 
Tory government but continues to practise the same old style 
politics that blurs any distinction between the lines of the two old 
parties of the past.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Will he admit that this 
questionable deal is nothing more than an effort to buy his way out 
of an embarrassing problem and with taxpayers' money?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member knows from his experience with the transport 
committee how important the policy of local airport authority and 
privatization of local airports is to the government. He knows that 
many communities other than Toronto are also engaged in a 
process of negotiation with the federal government to follow on the 
example of other cities that have taken local control of their own 
airports. This is a policy that  enables local communities not only to 
improve their own airports but to take responsibility for ensuring 
that they use them as economic development tools. That is 
something that will benefit the travellers, the businesses of the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14765"> 14765 </A></B>
<P>
Toronto area, as it will, I hope, Ottawa, Winnipeg, Halifax, and the 
other airport cities that are engaged in these negotiations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Liberal government has claimed in the past that failure 
to pass Bill C-22 has inhibited its ability to resolve the problem. 
The truth is it has no plan.
<P>
	The current Liberal course of action is costing 4,700 jobs, $72 
million in tax revenues, leaves Pearson with a potential passenger 
shortfall of two million passengers a year, and has caused Air 
Canada to look at a $525 million expenditure, which it can ill 
afford, to prop up its operation in terminal two. The government 
still has not provided any kind of plan.
<P>
	Will the government not agree this is nothing more than an 
attempt to get out of a mess that is ever worsening, particularly in 
light of the Prime Minister's former law partner softening his 
refutal of the accusations that have been made?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is a mess here, and it started 10 days before the last election.
<P>
	I can recall very clearly how explicit it was during the election 
campaign that a government days before an election did not have 
the moral authority or parliamentary authority to commit the 
Government of Canada to a transaction of the magnitude and 
importance of this one. This was not in any doubt whatsoever.
<P>
	The fact that the government of the day went ahead and signed 
this transaction is the exact and only cause of the mess that 
surrounds Pearson airport today.
<P>
	If the hon. member would tell his friends in the Senate to get on 
with completing Bill C-22, we could get on with the work at 
Pearson airport.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, two years have gone by since the Liberals formed the 
government. There is no injunction against the government by the 
Pearson consortium to stop any plan of action by the Liberals. They 
simply do not have one.
<P>
	If the government is planning to use $800 million to compensate 
Claridge's partners, why is it paying this money only to the 
Bronfman controlled company and expecting them to bail the 
government out of its Pearson mess? Obviously the cheaper they do 
it the more money for them.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit the obvious? He is playing the 
same old game of Liberal patronage that he accuses the Tories of 
playing.
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think the best advice I can give the hon. member is to heed the 
comments of the Conservative chairman of the committee that is 
examining Bill C-22, who said yesterday, and I quote: ``You can 
carry this as far as you want, but it has got nothing to do with this 
committee. If you think I am trying to protect the Prime Minister's 
reputation, my credentials as a Conservative are one hell of a lot 
stronger and of a longer term than any other member here''. The 
Conservative chairman of the committee says that the Prime 
Minister's reputation is not the issue here. We know the issue here 
is getting on with the work at Pearson airport.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Why is it that the Reform Party continues to support a 
transaction that was entered into by a Conservative government 
lacking the responsibility and authority to do it? I do not 
understand that. Maybe he can explain it one day.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, just now, tried to hide behind parliamentary 
tradition. However, no parliamentary tradition places anyone in 
this House above the law.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has called for a Bible; there are Bibles in the 
Senate. Let him go to the Senate and borrow the very Bible Mr. 
Matthews used when he swore his oath. What is he waiting for to 
go to the Senate, like any other Canadian, to swear an oath and 
answer questions?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the chairman of the committee himself told me this had 
nothing to do with the issue. The chairman, a Conservative senator, 
told us that they do not want to ask the Prime Minister to appear, 
and will not do so.
<P>
	No one has asked me to appear there. I stand here in this House 
to say clearly what I know. If the hon. member has any courage, let 
him accuse me specifically of lying to this House, and let his seat in 
this House hang in the balance as a consequence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, speaking of respecting the institutions of Parliament, as 
well as respecting democracy in general, as for the referendum vote 
in Quebec, the Prime Minister ought to begin by respecting the 
traditions of this House, and behave like any other Canadian.
<P>
	Once again, I ask what he is waiting for to go to the Senate to 
testify, to shed light on this whole matter which, it would appear, 
shows Conservatives and Liberals to be two peas in a pod, as they 
both have helped themselves freely to the taxpayers' money.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.)</B> Mr. Speaker, 
at this very moment, I am testifying before the  House of

<P>

The meeting concerned the Matthews group's plan regarding the 
offer they wanted to make to the government with respect to the 
Department of Transport headquarters.
<P>

<P>
	There were a lot of bids going on at the time in Ottawa 
competing for this building that has never been built. They came to 
ask me if the procedures they were following were the proper ones 
to maximize their chances of winning the bid.
<P>
	I told them what was positive in their bids, in my judgment, and 
what was not positive. Eventually nobody won the bid because the

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
after witnessing question period this week Canadians are now 
familiar with the government's public unity strategy. However, out 
of sight of the cameras the Liberals are practising a different 
strategy, namely appeasement through the election process at 
committees.
<P>
	After 14 meetings this week it has become clear the Liberals 
have formed some sort of alliance with the Bloc in what can only 
be concluded is an effort to appease the party which would tear our 
country apart, in the vain hope that it will lead to unity in our time.
<P>
	Will the government House leader bring forward a notice of 
motion to amend the standing orders to ensure the election of 
committee officers by secret ballot?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> May I please suggest to hon. members that your 
Speaker is listening to virtually every word that is said in the

<P>

<P>
	Many times in the preambles, which if you will permit me to say 
are getting longer, it seems, you are leading to a point where we are 
in committees. When we get to the question it has to be quite 
precise.
<P>
	I ask you, please do not put your Speaker in a position that I have 
to rule out of order before we get to the question. I would ask you to 
please consider those preambles because they are, for me at least 
here in the chair, somewhat misleading.
<P>
	I will permit the question because the question is in order.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, whatever happens in committee is 
the responsibility of members of the committee.
<P>
	The member is also a member of the House procedure 
committee. If they wish to change the rules they can ask the 
member sitting in the committee to advance that proposition and 
the committee on House procedure will look into it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are not talking about internal committee procedures but the 
responsibility of the House with regard to House rules.
<P>
	If we look at the figures of the 34th Parliament, the third party 
received no less than 11 vice-chairs or even chairs. It is hard to 
believe that the Mulroney Tories would have a greater sense of fair 
play than the Liberals, especially when the now minister of 
immigration said in 1987: ``The secret ballot offers members of 
Parliament an opportunity to do what is right for this country''-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I ask the hon. member to put his question now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> My question, Mr. Speaker, is again for the

<P>

	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council

Speaker, the reason why I did not admit that we were conducting 
studies on duplication is because we are not. What I said is that 
we were doing analyses of the current situation and that the 
purpose of these analyses is to give advice to the decision makers, 
that is to say, the ministers.
<P>
	I would point out to the opposition that similar analyses done for 
the Executive Council of the Quebec Government are not made 
public either, since they give confidential advice to the decision 
makers. There is an essential difference between such analyses, 
which are exempted under the Access to Information Act, and 
studies done by research institutes like the INRS, which are meant 
to be published so that the public can have a better idea of what 
independence would entail. That is something they are hiding, 
whereas we are not hiding what we have.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we will get back to this on Monday but in the meantime I

his own advisers, who said at the time that it may have amounted to 
$250 million.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Mr. Parizeau quoted a $30 billion figure in his

These figures are wrong and totally unbelievable. These figures

should not be used if the opposition wants to preserve a minimum

	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	The minister continues to adhere to the myth that if medicare 
ain't broke don't fix it. Yet it is broken and there is a growing 
chorus from across Canada that wants a change to fix it. This 
chorus includes provincial  governments and ministers of health 
from across Canada, including British Columbia and Quebec. This 
chorus includes health care workers, including doctors and nurses 
and the public whose very lives may be at risk.
<P>
	To date the minister has introduced only two pieces of legislation 
in the last two years in Ottawa. Will the minister be introducing any 
legislation to address this growing need, in fact the demand for 
change?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
to date the Canada Health Act has been extremely flexible in 
allowing for change within different provinces. To say that the 
system is broken is to exaggerate. I would rather say that the 
system needs changing. Technology is with us. I am working with 
the provinces and I will continue to work with them.
<P>
	I think that the Canada Health Act, which works well for 
Canadians, should stay in place and continue to protect the rights of 
Canadians to first class medical care, regardless of whether or not 
they can afford to pay extra.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister's answer once again reflects a blindness to 
reality, to the facts.
<P>
	Let me focus on the breakdown of the system. Two examples 
may suffice. In my home province of British Columbia it takes over 
seven weeks, almost two months, to get an appointment with a 
specialist. It takes 27 weeks on average to receive cardiovascular 
surgery, almost seven months.
<P>
	When will the minister show that she values the well-being and 
the lives of Canadians above her blind loyalty to outdated 
legislation? When will the minister first admit and then act on an 
obviously unsustainable health care system?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am always a little surprised to hear members opposite say how 
things are in British Columbia. The officials and the minister of 
health for British Columbia are extremely supportive of the Canada 
Health Act.
<P>
	They have brought in their own health act, which mirrors the 
principles of the Canada Health Act, to ensure that British

the best health care programs available for them.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I have had my answers to the questions put to me in 
February dug out. What I said at the time is this: We presently have 
action plans with eight provinces and two territories to reduce 
duplication. During the past year, we signed with the provinces and 
territories 64 agreements, which have been made public. We 
therefore have no objection to letting the opposition admire these 
fine pieces of work. Eight of these agreements were concluded with 
Quebec before September 12, 1994, and none since, obviously. We 
continue to use moneys in such a way as to reduce duplication and 
overlap. That is not just talk, that is what we are doing.
<P>
	This was my answer. We use taxpayers' money to make the 
federal government more efficient. We do so in co-operation with 
the provinces when they want to co-operate, but since the Parti 
Quebecois came into office, no co-operation has been forthcoming 
on its part and, unfortunately, it failed to help make services more 
efficient in the province.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
does the minister explain that some studies conducted by the Privy 
Council, notably by Stéphane Dion, Lorne Nystrom, a candidate in 
the NDP leadership race, Michelle Tisseyre, a former Liberal 
candidate, and Maurice Pinard, a professor at McGill University, 
cannot be released as requested under the Access to Information 
Act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and

Mr. Speaker, at the meeting of the standing committee, I not only 
provided the complete list of those involved in making analyses, 
but I also explained what they had worked on.
<P>
	Analyses were carried out for ministers to advise them on the 
current situation. Again, the opposition is trying not to shed light 
on the Le Hir studies because they were kept secret, but the Access 
to Information Act clearly states that analyses carried out for 
decision makers are confidential and therefore not covered by the 
act.
<P>

<P>
	Will the Prime Minister instruct the Minister of Health to be 
flexible on the deadline so that the provinces and all of the 
stakeholders involved in health care and the delivery of health care, 
which is under serious pressure, are able to come around the table 
and solve the problem without artificially imposed deadlines?

Mr. Speaker, Gordon Capital, the Toronto firm which employed the

absolutely ridiculous and laughable. First, some 15 other firms in 
Canada were involved. It must be pointed out that the margin 
between Gordon and the others was one of the narrowest ever seen 
for this type of transaction.
<P>

was the best privatization process ever accomplished by any

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence. I 
have learned that a Sea King helicopter crashed Wednesday night 
in Piopolis, Quebec. The crash was due to a transmission failure.
<P>
	I had trouble getting this information from the Department of 
National Defence. I wonder if the  minister will confirm this

incident and will he tell the House why it is a secret when one of 
our aging Sea King helicopters goes down?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is certainly 
not a secret. It is very unfortunate. The pilots felt as a result of a 
warning light coming on that indicated transmission trouble that 
they should make an emergency landing. That is quite publicly 
known. I cannot understand why the hon. member has had 
difficulty getting information on this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in my recent visit to Shearwater I found out that the 
Sea King helicopter requires 25 hours of maintenance for each one 
hour of flying time. This definitely speaks to the serious situation 
the Sea King is in right now.
<P>
	I can make my supplementary question very simple and I would 
like to make it direct because the children serving our country are 
literally falling out of the sky. How many other crashes must there 
be before the government takes action to replace the Sea King?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we know very 
well these helicopters are old and we know very well the 
parliamentary committee of which the hon. member was a 
participant recommended they be replaced. This is a matter the 
government said was to be pursued in the white paper. On the other 
hand, it does not want us to spend money.
<P>
	It is a matter for consideration. Since the armoured personnel 
carrier contract is now en route we will look at the helicopters. In 
the meantime these helicopters are certified to fly until the year 
2000. They are perfectly safe. I have been on them many times. If 
the hon. member would like to go for a ride I would welcome 
giving him one.

<P>
	Yesterday we launched the $2 coin. We also know the $2 coin 
will cause some problems, some concerns, some inconvenience 
and also some expense to certain sectors of our economy. What is 
the minister prepared to do to minimize the problems for the new 
coin?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for the unexpected but yet timely question relating to the 
$2 coin.
<P>
	The member is quite right. Yesterday we unveiled the design of 
the new $2 coin which is a polar bear. Some of the young people 
have referred to it as ``the bear''. We hope to be able to work with 
the various small and medium size businesses to make the 
transition as smooth as possible.
<P>
	The rationale for the decision was a result of the budget of the 
Minister of Finance. It clearly set out that by changing from the $2 
note to the $2 coin we will save the taxpayers of Canada in excess 
of $250 million.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	One year ago I tabled a petition that called for the government to 
regulate tobacco under the Hazardous Products Act. The minister's 
response at that time was that tobacco could not be made safe and 
therefore could not come under that act.
<P>
	Given the Supreme Court ruling, what are the government's 
plans to amend or replace the Tobacco Products Control Act and to 
deal with the situation as a result of the Supreme Court ruling?
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we will take guidance from the decision of the Supreme Court. It is 
absolutely essential.
<P>
	We would rather not have to spend another seven years before 
the courts. That in effect is what has happened. We spent seven 
years and twenty-one days, to be exact.
<P>
	It is very important, following the guidance of this decision, that 
we take the steps available to us and go as far as possible and as 
quickly as possible, because many people are dying as a direct 
result of tobacco products. We have to do everything in our power, 
especially to stop young people from starting up and having access 
to those tobacco products.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should ask Canada Post 
Corporation to integrate into its development plan a strategy promoting the 
local development of regions and municipalities in Quebec and Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I find it very interesting to rise today in 
this House on this motion, especially as the minister responsible 
for Canada Post Corporation announced, a few weeks ago, that a 
committee would carry out an in depth review of the corporation.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	A while ago, I presented the motion which is on today's Order 
Paper and through which I want the House to convey to this 
committee that, from now on, Canada Post Corporation should 
integrate into its development plan a strategy promoting the local 
development of regions and municipalities in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	We must say that, in this area, things were not too great in the 
past.
<P>
	Under the previous federal government, the reform of Canada 
Post Corporation was entirely and exclusively focused on cutting 
costs, regardless of the impact on the rural and urban communities 
affected by post office closures. I would even venture to say that 
this strategy was part of what brought down upon the government 
the wrath of the public and caused its demise in the fall of 1993.
<P>
	I also believe that it resulted in the moratorium banning post 
office closures which has been in effect since the fall of 1993. 
However, to this day, the government has made no effort to correct 
past mistakes. Take, for instance, the village of Saint-Clément, in 
my riding, where the post office was closed against the will of 100 
per cent of the population who clearly proved that it wanted and 
needed a post office. The previous government turned a deaf ear 
and so did the current one, arguing that the moratorium did not 
cover the previous government's mistakes, and that the case was 
closed.
<P>
	Now it seems the review committee, which will examine the 
mandate of Canada Post Corporation, will be open to public 
complaints concerning postal services so it is important that we 
give that committee the opportunity to hear the opinion of 
Quebecers and Canadians on the operations of the corporation and 
on its contribution to the local development in every region of the 
country.
<P>
	Today, we can ask ourselves, as did the committee on rural 
development in Canada after a thorough examination of the post 
office issue: Is it possible to modernize Canada Post Corporation 
and prepare it for the twenty first century? Could we not adopt a 
new approach, a new form of marketing for postal services and not 
a defensive attitude like the one which led to the closing of many 
post offices, not because the clientele was decreasing, but because 
the post master was retiring? Such measures were totally absurd 
and it was written quite clearly in the mandate of Canada Post 
Corporation. It caused some ludicrous situations. Today there are 
post masters in post offices where clients are few while certain very 
busy post offices have been closed.
<P>
	So we really must seize this opportunity given us by the review 
committee soon to be created. I sincerely hope this committee will 
be in place very soon. It is important because we should be 
announcing next week that the review committee will be 
operational and will review all the issues concerning Canada Post 
Corporation.
<P>
	Rural development is not the only issue, there are many other 
aspects but my motion deals precisely with the local development 
of rural regions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14773"> 14773 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to give a very concrete example of that. In the riding 
of Rimouski-Témiscouata, the village of Saint-Honoré played the 
game and agreed, four or five  years ago, to have its post office 
closed and the mandate given to a corner store owner.
<P>
	This owner has now realized that this activity was not profitable 
at all and he wants to give up that responsibility. That village is 
now facing the situation where, in February 1996, it will not have 
any postal service, because the post office will have been closed 
and sold. With a short term vision, it was thought that giving the 
mandate to a corner store for a minimal amount was a good idea, 
but we now find ourselves in a very serious situation because, 
according to its current act, Canada Post Corporation is responsible 
for ensuring mail delivery all across Canada, which will not be 
done in that area.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	There is no real solution on the table. In rural areas, there is often 
one corner store or one grocery store for every village or 
municipality, and there may not be much choice but to move the 
post office many kilometres away. It is not a very interesting 
prospect at all.
<P>
	So I think it would be important to look at the postal service not 
only from a humane perspective-what the moratorium has 
achieved is very important and I think we must recognize the effect 
it has had-but also in terms of its future. Would it not be possible 
to compel Post Canada Corporation to say in its development plan 
what it intends to do in terms of the information highway, for 
instance, in our villages? Would it not be a good idea to have, in 
each of our municipalities, an information highway service point 
which could be used by the local population?
<P>
	For example, I can see that in a farming area, where farmers 
need to know about the latest technology, programs, trade 
opportunities and information in the field. We may not have yet 
reached the stage where every farmer has access to the information 
highway. Canada Post could maybe run some pilot projects to 
ensure that our municipalities are cut off from the rest of society as 
little as possible.
<P>
	Post offices could also provide a fax service. Not everyone can 
afford to pay $100 or $200 for a fax machine, least of all the people 
who do not use them very often. Let us take, for example, a senior 
citizen who suddenly runs into trouble with a department, because 
a technical document went missing. We cannot expect that citizen 
to have a fax machine at home, but we could provide such a service 
through the post offices. This could prove interesting.
<P>
	Another interesting service the post offices could provide is 
access to the terminals of Human Resources Development Canada. 
We are not saying that we are against the current centralization of 
employment centres, but that is not the issue I want to address 
because we do think that the centralization process is worthwhile. I  
think that when people are looking for jobs, they must be able to 
deal with persons.
<P>
	However, if the workforce is maintained at its current level, we 
could add several service points to give access to a program the 
Department of Human Resources Development is already offering. 
In order to do so, Canada Post would have to say: ``Because of our 
corporate image and because of the benefits this would entail for 
individual citizens, we would be ready, as a department, to sell you 
this equipment''. Like they are doing actually. Right now, the 
installation of these terminals costs about $5000. Canada Post 
could buy quite a few of these terminals, even though it would 
mean that it would have to inject several million dollars in this 
project, but it would give all our citizens access to this information.
<P>
	You have to remember that Human Resources Development 
Canada does not provide only job search programs. It also deals 
with our senior citizens and the pension systems. There is a lot of 
room for improvement in this area and I think Canada Post should 
be forced by this House, and by the committee considering this 
issue, to see that its business plan look at ways not only to provide 
postal services for less money, but also to do something to improve 
things at the information level.
<P>
	Let me give you an example, Sweden has decided to decentralize 
the processing of income tax returns. Instead of having large 
processing centres clustered in a single region like we do in 
Canada, they can have income tax returns from one area processed 
at the other end of the country in a decentralized way, thanks to 
computer technology, so that, in every town, people can have a job 
and work without leaving their community. Thus, the nation's 
territory can be better used, and a fairer distribution of income is 
fostered.
<P>
	I think it is much better to keep regions alive through job 
transfers than through transfer payments, and people could stay in 
their own communities. That kind of development is possible with 
a network like that of Canada Post.
<P>
	Something else must be taken into account. We should avoid any 
unwarranted competition. Let me give an example. In my own 
riding, at the time of the year when income tax returns are 
processed, Canada Post came up with a pilot project that allowed a 
bank to sell RRSPs in a given town to residents of the area. That 
kind of competition was unwarranted because there was a caisse 
populaire in the town, and it had made investments in capital and 
salaries so that it could to be located right on the spot year-round.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	But the bank, thanks to a profitable contract, did not have to pay 
back the whole investment and did not have to contribute to rental 
costs of the place, at least not at 100 per cent. That was unfair 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14774"> 14774 </A></B>
<P>
competition. This, in my opinion, should be looked into 
thoroughly.
<P>
	I think we should also emphasize the need for public debate and 
hearings on this issue. Right now, a coalition of private couriers is 
making representations to have the Canada Post's mandate revised 
so that they can market their own services in densely populated 
areas like Montreal, Quebec City, Vancouver, Toronto and all cities 
with a large enough population. A private company might be able 
to provide services at a lower cost than the Canada Post 
Corporation.
<P>
	The provision of these services must not result in a reduction of 
services in other regions. If Canada Post suddenly becomes 
responsible for providing postal services in sparsely populated 
areas and the private company gets to serve all the profitable areas, 
we will have an unacceptable situation which, in the medium term, 
will lead to the disappearance of postal services in many places.
<P>
	I think that there is a need for public debate, for public hearings, 
and maybe that is what the Conservatives should have done first 
before carrying out their reform. They should have asked people 
what kind of postal services they wanted. It would help everybody 
understand what the real issues are. Closing a single post office 
may not look so tragic, but in our rural communities, given the way 
development is going, it is often a sign that other services are about 
to disappear, like the school and even the church.
<P>
	We must find a way to ensure the development of those 
communities. There may have been some mistakes but, in general, 
people who founded parishes and helped them grow invested a lot 
of time and energy in those communities. We should ensure that, in 
the future, services will be maintained to promote the development, 
and not the disappearance, of local communities.
<P>
	This seems important to me; it will be a golden opportunity to 
see how important the development of local communities is to the 
government. Is the government really willing to do something 
interesting in this area?
<P>
	As a final argument, I will broach another aspect of this issue. In 
the partnership proposed to Quebecers in the referendum 
campaign, four or five priority areas are clearly mentioned, such as 
the monetary union, the movement of people as well as various 
areas in which there could be an agreement between governments, 
and Canada Post is one of those areas.
<P>
	I think the committee that will be given responsibility for these 
studies, which will not be sitting tomorrow morning but probably 
after October 30, should plan to study this sort of situation so that, 
in the future as part of the cooperation to be established between 
Quebec and Canada after a Yes, it is clear that there are advantages  
for both sides in agreeing and ensuring the service functions 
properly.
<P>
	The entire network of post offices in Quebec and Canada has 
been paid for by all taxpayers, and will therefore form part of the 
debt allocation. This may be one of the issues we consider 
important, one that is included within the agreement, which makes 
provision very properly for a set of issues to be covered under the 
partnership, and this one strikes me as important.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, the letter carrier unions, postmasters, rural 
communities and private messenger services are asking that this 
study be as public as possible, so we are sure we do not end up with 
a monopoly or making decisions that have an impact over a number 
of years in the future without the community being consulted. I 
think the public should be informed on this.
<P>
	When Canada Post will be forced by Parliament to integrate into 
its development plan a strategy promoting the local development of 
regions and municipalities in Quebec and Canada, it will know that 
it is part of its mandate and it will be able to take it into account in 
its decisions and to avoid the mess of three or four years ago in this 
sector.
<P>
	This will make it possible to correct at last significant errors that 
are still with us today, symbolic mistakes such as the decision 
concerning the Saint-Clément post office and the one concerning 
Saint-Honoré and other such examples throughout Quebec and 
Canada that I gave today. Canada Post must become a corporation 
that is as modern all over Quebec and Canada as it is in Ottawa 
where it gave itself great facilities. It is a corporation whose clients 
want to know what services they will get and how good these 
services will be. I believe that is part of the challenges Quebec and 
Canada will be facing in the 21th century. Let us seize this 
opportunity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
motion proposed by the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup is rather strange. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should ask Canada Post 
Corporation to integrate into its development plan a strategy promoting the 
local development of regions and municipalities in Quebec and Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I say strange because Canada Post Corporation is already 
promoting the local development of regions and municipalities in 
Quebec and Canada. Canada Post is everywhere. For instance, 
there are now over 18,370 retail outlets where one can buy stamps 
and other products as well as postal services. In Quebec, there are 
3,451 outlets. Over 75 per cent of these are presently owned by the 
private sector. Many of them are found in drugstores, convenience 
stores, etc. In fact, over 2,000 of these retail postal outlets are 
managed by small and  medium businesses who gain not only from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14775"> 14775 </A></B>
<P>
the revenues generated, but also from the increased flow of clients 
in their stores.
<P>
	For the information of the members, I want to briefly recall the 
historical background of Canada Post Corporation. Organized 
postal services in Canada began in 1693, when the government of 
New France paid Pedro da Silva to take some letters from Montreal 
to Quebec. In 1755, the government opened the first post office in 
Halifax. The development of postal services followed that of the 
transportation network. Postal communications are closely linked 
with the history of Canada. For 300 years, postal communications 
helped Canadians keep in touch with each other, reduced distances 
and thus promoted the exchange of information and distribution of 
goods.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Today Canada Post Corporation delivers 46 million pieces of 
mail each business day, which are processed through 23 major mail 
plants and several other facilities, to nearly 12.3 million addresses 
in Canada and forwards mail to virtually every country in the 
world. Clearly what we see is Canada Post contributing to a 
fundamental part of Canadian life.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	In June of 1994 the Canada Post Corporation declared that the 
new corporation is in business to serve. This is no mere slogan. 
Canada Post has established it as a new way of life. It is a 
philosophy the corporation wants to permeate every decision it 
makes at every level. CPC is transforming itself from an operations 
based organization asking the customers to meet its requirements 
to one that will go the extra mile to satisfy customers and meet 
their needs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This motion addresses development. The Canada Post 
Corporation knows a good deal about development. This past year 
CPC has focussed particular attention on improving and expanding 
its services to small business. It is aware of just how important 
small and medium size businesses are to the economic growth of 
the country. The central focus of its new approach is a program of 
services to business. It now has two business centres, one in 
Calgary and one in London. These are one stop resource centres, 
where customers can obtain a variety of information on postal 
products and services, and Canada Post staff can help businesses to 
expand by providing owners with a full range of communications 
and distribution solutions.
<P>
	Another example of Canada Post Corporation's commitment to 
small and medium size business is the fact that it has made 
preferential rates available to small volume mailers-some 
members may be aware that special rates were, until very recently, 
reserved in theory  for those with a heavy volume of mail. That is 
what I call development.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada Post is a dynamic commercial crown corporation which 
competes with the open market throughout Canada. Due to this 
dynamism, Canada Post's competitors, for example the Canadian 
Courier Association, have frequently charged Canada Post with 
unfair business practices. Why? It is simple: they cannot compete.
<P>
	The allegations of cross subsidization are not true, and some 
recent media reports have even supported the association's 
proposal that a federal regulatory body be established to oversee 
the operations of Canada Post. However, hon. members should 
know that independent quasi-judicial bodies have examined the 
charges, and the charges of cross subsidization cannot be sustained, 
whether they are aimed at Canada Post's priority courier service or 
at the corporation's purchase of a controlling interest in Purolator 
courier.
<P>
	The CCA has never produced any evidence to support its cross 
subsidization allegations. The Standing Committee on Government 
Operations, the Bureau of Competition Policy, and the National 
Transportation Agency have all examined the issue. They have 
never been substantiated. For example, with regard to Canada 
Post's purchase of Purolator courier, in which no public funding 
was involved, the director of the competition bureau concluded in 
November 1993 that ``there are no grounds at this time to believe 
that cross subsidization has occurred or would occur post-merger 
with Purolator, which would likely result in a substantial lessening 
or prevention of competition in the marketplace''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The CCA claims Canada Post Corporation is in unfair 
competition with CCA members, through a monopoly on what it 
calls a considerable portion of its business. But it is more than one 
hundred years since Parliament enacted legislation assigning this 
exclusive privilege in order to guarantee all Canadians will pay the 
same prices to have a letter delivered within the country. Canada 
Post is in business to serve all Canadians and exclusive privilege is 
the only way Parliament could guarantee all citizens access to 
universal postal service from coast to coast.
<P>
	The independent review concluded that Canada Post is not 
abusing that exclusive privilege. Is the CCA implying that 
Parliament erred when it gave a monopoly to this fundamental 
element of Canadian life?
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some may question Canada Post's ability to survive in the age of 
the information highway. The corporation is quite aware that the 
evolution of new communications technologies such as E-mail, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14776"> 14776 </A></B>
<P>
facsimile, data transmissions,  and electronic funds transfers will 
impact the outlook of Canada Post's traditional mail services.
<P>
	The postal service recognizes the move toward electronic 
transmission of information and it has developed a number of value 
added electronic services, which combined with an unmatched 
infrastructure will allow the corporation to provide all Canadians 
with the services they will need as Canada heads into the 21st 
century.
<P>
	The corporation is no stranger to technological developments in 
the communications industry. Canada Post has been involved for 
years in electronic messaging and it continues to develop new 
services for the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The motion before the House today asks Canada Post 
Corporation to promote local development. I know of no better way 
to do this than through the literacy campaign. Canada Post works 
closely with literacy groups throughout Canada. It launched a 
reading game to encourage reading among school children. This 
game is now part of the curriculum in Newfoundland and New 
Brunswick, and in Winnipeg. It developed a series of videos to 
raise motivation and awareness.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Canada Post Corporation does not need to further, through 
more regulations, a strategy promoting the local development of 
regions and municipalities in Quebec and Canada. Why not? It is is 
simple: it has already done so.
<P>
	Canada Post recognizes that it plays an important role in the 
social and economic fabric of Canadian life. Although the member 
for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup is well intentioned, I cannot 
support the motion that is before the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address the motion put forward by the member from the 
Bloc regarding Canada Post.
<P>
	Motion 403 proposes the government ask Canada Post 
Corporation to integrate into its development plan a strategy 
promoting the local development of regions and municipalities in 
Quebec and in Canada. I have several concerns regarding this 
motion.
<P>
	The first issue that needs to be addressed is the wording of the 
motion, as I find it quite confusing. This motion addresses Quebec 
and Canada separately, which does not make sense when Quebec is 
a province within Canada. I fully recognize that we are facing a 
referendum in Quebec regarding separation. However, the last time 
I checked Quebec was still a part of Canada. Perhaps legislative 
counsel could iron out this obvious oversight and clarify the 
wording so that it simply refers to Canada. Then all provinces will 
be included using that definition.
<P>
	Besides the wording of the motion, it is somewhat confusing as 
to why this motion is being proposed by a  separatist in the first 
place. Canada Post is a Canadian corporation set up to serve 
Canadians. If the member is so keen on pushing the separatist 
agenda, why the interest in a Canadian crown corporation? The 
member simply cannot have it both ways. Surely he does not 
expect to separate from Canada and then take the crown 
corporation with him. A separate Quebec will obviously run its 
own postal system, not one subsidized by the rest of Canada. 
Canada Post serves Canada, and that includes all the provinces 
within its borders, nothing more and nothing less.
<P>
	I also have problems with the fundamental intent of this motion, 
which suggests that Canada Post be used to prop up declining 
regions and municipalities. Given that Canada Post is a money 
losing venture, how does the member propose that it be used to 
build municipalities and regions? It does not make any sense.
<P>
	Canada Post's mandate is to best serve the postal needs of 
Canadians. Getting a letter quickly and as inexpensively as 
possible from one area of the country to the other should be the 
primary concern.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Canada Post is a basic service and must fulfil its role as 
independently as possible, without reliance on government 
subsidies or unwanted interference.
<P>
	In 1981 Canada Post Corporation was created and given a 
mandate that included achieving self-sufficiency while acting at 
arm's length from the government. At that time Canada Post faced 
economic uncertainty and was losing $600 million a year. Canada 
Post has turned its business around in the last 12 years, but there is 
still plenty of work to be done.
<P>
	This past year Canada Post lost $70 million, the third loss in five 
years. Canada Post was forced to increase its stamp price by two 
cents this year because it claimed to be in such financial trouble. 
Given that Canada Post is running a deficit, the corporation needs 
to focus its energy as much as possible on its basic mandate: 
delivering mail quickly and at the lowest cost.
<P>
	If Canada Post cannot run its own business, how can we expect it 
to promote regional development? This smacks of old style, pork 
barrel politics: full speed ahead and to heck with the costs.
<P>
	It is fundamental that post offices must be established on a basis 
of need for service. Location should be selected on the basis of 
where they will best meet the needs of the local residents, not for 
buying votes from a town or rewarding political supporters. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14777"> 14777 </A></B>
<P>
Regional development ideas went down with the <I>Titanic</I>, so why 
are we trying to refloat them here? With any crown corporation, 
taxpayers need to know that they are getting their money's worth. 
They want good service and fair prices, not another bloated 
bureaucracy with a fuzzy mandate incorporating regional 
development.
<P>
	We know we have problems with our crown corporations. 
Canadians need to be assured that their tax dollars are being spent 
wisely. They want an open, efficient postal system, because 
Canadians are frustrated with poorly run corporations that ignore 
their primary role.
<P>
	A point that particularly frustrates me with current legislation is 
that I cannot go back to my constituents with any assurances 
because crown corporations like Canada Post are exempt from 
access to information inquiries. Why is it that when crown 
corporations are supported by taxpayers they are at the same time 
protected by a cloak of secrecy that cannot be accessed under 
freedom of information? Canada Post has a monopoly on mail 
delivery, but it refuses to open its books to the public for fear of 
competition.
<P>
	Questions have been raised again and again regarding Canada 
Post competition against other courier services. The Canadian 
Courier Association has accused Canada Post of using its exclusive 
mail revenues to subsidize its courier services, yet we cannot find 
out the answer because the corporation is protected from access to 
information. Business is complaining that Canada Post has an 
unfair advantage with its courier services and that they are forcing 
private enterprise out of business. However, the real story never 
sees the light of day because the answers are hidden behind this 
shield of secrecy.
<P>
	Canada Post claims to have had an independent study done by 
KPMG to review the matter. Where is the study? We have not seen 
it. Canada Post refuses to release it. Canada Post protection from 
public scrutiny only raises more questions.
<P>
	Questions have been raised about Canada Post's granting of 
contracts. Bidding for advertising mail services, for example, is 
obscured and potential bid players are raising questions about the 
procedures for bidding for services. For example, if a bidder has 
tendered the lowest bid he or she may not get the contract. The 
reasons for choosing one bidder over another are completely 
obscured and there is no way for an individual to find out where 
their bid sat compared to the others. Exemption from access to 
information prevents individuals from reviewing the results of any 
particular contract.
<P>
	Given that the post office monopoly is under the umbrella of the 
patronage king himself, the public works minister, it is high time 
that Canadians were allowed to look into the books and practices of 
Canada Post. Already we have caught the minister responsible for 
this crown corporation with his hands in the cookie jar, handing out 
post office leases to his political supporters in Nova Scotia.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	How many other instances of political patronage are there 
wrapped up in this corporation? Canadians want to know. It is high 
time the government came clean and put an end to the old style 
practices within our crown corporations.
<P>
	Canada Post, like all crown corporations and government 
agencies, must be accountable. That is first and foremost. Services 
need to protected and functions run as cost effectively as possible 
with the least likelihood of incurring public debt.
<P>
	The government should move Canada Post out of the subsidized 
role of courier service and ad mail delivery and limit it to what it 
was designed to do in the first place, pick up and deliver mail.
<P>
	I cannot support the motion to allow Canada Post to become 
involved in regional development because it would be a poor 
business decision and is simply contrary to the primary role of 
Canada Post.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity to speak to the motion moved by my colleague that 
the Canada Post Corporation include in its strategic development 
plans a local development perspective.
<P>
	We have so often seen the negative impact that closing post 
offices has had on small communities in Quebec and Canada. The 
present government is very much aware of this and a few months 
ago, asked the Canada Post Corporation to set a moratorium on 
closing post offices in rural areas.
<P>
	Considering the role played by the Canada Post Corporation in 
these small communities, I think it was a wise move on the part of 
the government and, furthermore, I think the Canada Post 
Corporation's review committee, to be appointed by the 
corporation, would do well and, in fact, should ensure that the 
corporation's development plans include a special focus on the 
development of local communities and that postal services 
continue to play the role they had played so far in these 
communities.
<P>
	After expressing my support for this motion, I think I should 
comment on what was said by my two colleagues, the Liberal 
member and the member for the Reform Party. I think it is a good 
indication of the present situation in Canada and the problems we 
have.
<P>
	First the hon. member for the Liberal Party said everything is 
fine at the Canada Post Corporation. The corporation is 
streamlining its operations, making a profit and introducing a 
number of programs, including literacy programs which, as far as I 
can see, would be used by the Canada Post Corporation to develop 
local communities. It is not quite enough in my view.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14778"> 14778 </A></B>
<P>
	We then heard the hon. member for the Reform Party launch 
his party's customary attack on crown corporations, government 
services in general. According to him, the Canada Post 
Corporation's sole responsibility is to deliver the mail. Whether 
this is done by the Canada Post Corporation, a private corporation, 
an American corporation or whoever, the only responsibility of 
Canada Post is to deliver the mail.
<P>
	This attitude has become increasingly widespread in this 
country, and I think it has a destabilizing influence on Canada as a 
country and on Quebec as the country I hope it will become. We 
can draw a parallel with what happened to the railways.
<P>
	The railroads, which were among the major institutions of this 
country, have been abandoned. They did not believe in railroads, 
they invested in transportation companies, which were allowed to 
use heavier trucks that were then subjected to fewer inspections, 
hence the increase in the number of accidents and in the level of 
danger on our highways. In some areas of Canada, highways have 
been almost completely destroyed because they are now used to 
carry loads which ought to be moved by rail.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the rail system is being dismantled. There is also the 
whole issue of telecommunications. We see in Quebec, and I 
believe it is also the case in Ontario, very serious problems caused 
by the fact that Bell Canada is presently restructuring its services 
on the basis of new technologies and a new personnel management 
policy.
<P>
	This company is cutting jobs in order to withstand competition. 
This situation was caused by the fact that two or three years ago the 
CRTC allowed American companies, and I underline it did so 
despite opposition from Quebec, to compete with Bell Canada here 
in Canada. As a result, one of the most profitable companies in 
Canada, one with annual profits in the order of $900 million, or 
nearly $1 billion, was forced to compete by adopting its 
competitors' methods, including new technologies, lower prices 
and layoffs. In Quebec, this represents 4,000 out of 10,000 jobs.
<P>
	This company, which made an important contribution to the 
political and economic life of Canada and Quebec, is currently 
being restructured. In addition to CN, Canada Post and 
telecommunications, our friends in the Reform Party are talking 
about privatizing hospitals. There is also talk about privatizing 
prisons in New Brunswick. If we go on like this, we will eventually 
find ourselves with a territorial entity called Canada, where there 
will be no government services, where the law of the jungle will 
prevail, where a bunch of small companies will compete without 
taking national imperatives into account in their business 
strategies.
<P>
	A country, be it Canada or Quebec, cannot simply set its sights 
on globalization and set competition and the  lowest costs as its 
goals. History shows that a country is created out of a sense of 
solidarity, a sense of nationhood. What is being shown here in this 
House, especially by our Reform colleagues, is that we are altering 
this concept of nationhood, of government services that has 
evolved over the centuries.
<P>
	I think that by focussing on short term profits we are dismantling 
democratic countries, bona fide countries which made sure they 
could provide services to people and settle their land. I think that 
many of our fellow citizens, in Quebec and my region in particular, 
are becoming aware of this ill effect of new political ideas that 
came out of the blue in the early 70s. I think that in striving to 
restructure certain processes and change the way we do things as 
nations we are in fact destroying our countries.
<P>
	I think that we will have to pay close attention to all this 
dismantling in our regions. Last week-end, more than 700 people 
gathered in my region. These municipal council members and 
representatives from various organizations were attending a 
general assembly to let people know that we want to continue to 
exist as a region. It is not true that our region will be shut down just 
because some banker, business leader or finance minister got the 
notion that we are no longer profitable.
<P>
	We have settled this area. We have built communities and we 
want these communities to continue to exist. At a time when new 
ways of doing things are promoted, we can do as fine a job in 
Jonquière as in Montreal running a company or establishing a 
telephone service with real people to man the phones. I believe 
things can be done just as well in Montreal, Toronto, Jonquière, 
Chicoutimi or Roberval.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Citizens are realizing that, under the guise of putting into 
practice economic theories the fruits of which have never been 
reaped by the population, the structure of the country is being 
pulled apart to the extent that we no longer form communities, we 
no longer are citizens of a country; we have become mere 
consumers and investors.
<P>
	I believe we must rise slightly above this vision of life and we, in 
this House, must look at things from a loftier plane and be able to 
tell our fellow citizens that we are heading in a direction that will 
ultimately transform us into vibrant countries, be it Canada or 
Quebec, which will be increasingly prosperous and fair with their 
citizens.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the motion of 
our Bloc Quebecois colleague concerning the preservation of 
postal services in the regions.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="14779"> 14779 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe the government of Canada has reacted very well since 
the Liberals took office. It declared a moratorium on local post 
office closures. Of course, this applies to Quebec as well as to 
the rest of Canada.
<P>
	What I found particularly interesting, in the motion as well as in 
the comments of the member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, 
is that he seems to recognize the important role the federal 
government has to play in regional economic development. When 
listening to the speeches of these sovereignists, I felt that these 
unique centres of Canadian visibility had to be preserved in small 
communities all over the vast regions of Quebec. I thought it was a 
bit odd to hear these people say, on the one hand, that Canada does 
not work and that the only way Quebec can get whatever it deserves 
is by separating but then, on the other hand, that this House should 
maintain postal services as they are. This is very interesting. I feel 
it emphasizes how important the role of the federal government is 
and how much the Canadian government is welcome in what we 
call remote areas, in rural areas of Canada.
<P>
	I think we are about to reach a turning point in our history, not on 
a political level, because Quebec still wants to be part of the 
Canadian federation, but on an administrative level, if you wish, 
for postal services in Canada.
<P>
	During the last few years, we have seen the emergence of 
computers, modems, fax machines, and a whole new 
telecommunications technology. Thanks to all kinds of 
technologies, regions and above all the self-employed workers of 
these regions will be able to better communicate with the outside 
world.
<P>
	Quebec does not need sovereignty, separation or independence 
to develop its rural regions. Services are in place, we have offices 
and the expertise necessary to meet the needs of the population, the 
business people and the students, to help them in their regional 
economic development rojects.
<P>
	For the last 30 years, Quebecers, especially in the rural regions, 
where I come from, have always asked for further decentralization 
of federal government services and especially of provincial 
services.
<P>
	Nevertheless, I must tell you this. Nothing prevents the province 
or the federal government, as things now stand, from 
decentralizing services. Obviously, 30 years ago, it was impossible 
to do that, for the simple reason that the new technologies did not 
exist in 1960.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Governments, businesses and social services in Quebec, 
particularly in remote areas, will be able to create some form of 
partnership and set up service points to serve local communities. If 
I understand the logic of the Bloc Quebecois, of the separatists, 
these service points designed to promote regional economy should  
naturally be located around the post offices of the Canadian 
government.
<P>
	It is quite something to hear the opposition say that the regions 
have a future, provided that post offices remain open in small 
communities throughout Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	We could do more. We have other departments. For example, the 
department responsible for science and technology recently 
announced a new service designed to make Internet more 
accessible to Canadians.
<P>
	Last April, in Carleton-sur-Mer, in my riding of Bonaventure, I 
held an information session with officials of Science and 
Technology Canada, in co-operation with Québec Téléphone, as 
well as various other people involved in the region's 
socio-economic development. We came to the conclusion that, for 
example, the federal government has the means and the programs 
to establish this Internet network throughout Quebec.
<P>
	Unfortunately, few municipalities and provincial organizations 
answered the call. This is sad. We have the tools and the moneys to 
create this new synergy and promote regional economic 
development.
<P>
	Efforts are being made and we must forge ahead and find 
partners. Above all, we must convince school boards. We must 
convince CEGEPs, hospitals, as well as social services of all kinds, 
particularly those which fall under provincial jurisdiction, so as to 
ensure a better partnership and set up new ways of communicating 
with the rest of the world.
<P>
	I believe that regions in Quebec and in Canada will prosper 
thanks to new technologies. It would certainly be possible to 
establish videoconference centres in those Canada Post buildings in 
order to give residents of those regions an opportunity to take 
courses or to communicate with people outside Canada.
<P>
	I think that Canada Post has a new social role on top of its 
economic role. It must discover new technologies and encourage 
people to use those technologies in order to take care of their own 
economic development at the local level.
<P>
	The Canadian postal service has quite a history. As mentioned by 
the parliamentary secretary a few moments ago, I think that the 
postal service has played a glorious role in Canada over the last 300 
years. Now, because of the new technology and because of the 
reality of today's world, we have to find different markets for our 
products and different ways to provide our services. I think that our 
postal service is a bit like the PTT in France, which offers a wide 
range of services to its clients.
<P>
	Today's clients are not necessarily in office buildings in 
Montreal or in other large cities. Teleworking is becoming more 
and more popular. For example, there is a new trend emerging in 
the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14780"> 14780 </A></B>
<P>
United States where people  are leaving the cities and even the 
suburbs for small communities of 1,000 residents or less.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	With today's technology, it is possible for, let us say, a 
translator-or an engineer, an architect, etc.-to work out of a 
small community somewhere in Quebec. If educated people, who 
often come from remote areas themselves, decide to go back to 
those regions, we have to ensure the presence of the federal 
government and its many services.
<P>
	I see that we are running out of time, but I must tell you that I am 
very happy to hear the Bloc Quebecois say that this basic service 
provided by the government of Canada is still welcome in the 
regions and also that we must maintain this federal service to have 
an even more glorious future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will not take much time, but I will make a few 
comments about Canada Post.
<P>
	I congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, as being one of the Liberal 
members of Parliament who withdrew from the MP pension plan. 
You are to be acknowledged for that effort on behalf of Canadian 
taxpayers. You certainly have my personal congratulations as 
another MP who absented himself from the MP pension plan. We 
are in different parties but we share a kinship in opting out of the 
MP pension plan.
<P>
	I find it really strange, really odd that there is a private members' 
motion before the House from a separatist suggesting that we 
somehow change a federal crown corporation. That is an irony and 
a bit of hypocrisy, if I am allowed to say that.
<P>
	Twenty-five per cent of the population of Canada resides in the 
province of Quebec. If this member were a member in a separate 
Quebec, would he be putting forward such a motion to use the 
postal service of Quebec, a separate entity, for municipal 
development within his province? I suspect that his motives are not 
entirely pure and noble in putting the motion before us today.
<P>
	I believe Canada Post should be put to more public scrutiny and 
exposed to competition.
<P>
	I have been approached by many competitors of Canada Post 
who would like to get into the flyer business but find they cannot 
compete with Canada Post, not because they are not competitive 
but because Canada Post is subsidizing third class mail with first 
class delivery.
<P>
	In New Zealand the first class postal rates have decreased and we 
have seen our rates go up. I believe the motive is to put competitors 
out of business. That is wrong and Canada Post should be
