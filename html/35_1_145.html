	The House resumed from December 14 consideration of Bill 
C-53, an act to establish the Department of Canadian Heritage 
and to amend and repeal certain other acts, as reported (with 
amendments) from the committee.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 45(5)(a) the House will now proceed to the taking of the 
deferred divisions on report stage of Bill C-53, an act to 
establish the Department of Canadian Heritage and to amend 
and repeal certain other acts.
<P>
	The first question is on Motion No. 8 The vote on Motion No. 
8 also applies to Motion No. 10.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	An affirmative vote on Motion No. 8 obviates the necessity of 
the question being put on Motions Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 
21. A negative vote on Motion No. 8 necessitates the question 
being put on Motions Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. The vote on 
Motion No. 1 also applies to Motion No. 9.
<P>
[<I>English</I>]

member for Rimouski-Témiscouata.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I think you will find 
unanimous consent to apply the vote just taken on Motion No. 
P-3 to the motion now before the House in reverse.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Madam Speaker, I am certainly prepared to give my 
consent to this. In the last vote I was present but did not vote. I 
would ask that the record show that I abstained from voting on 
the last motion. I am certainly present for this vote and will vote 
with my caucus.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Does the hon. member 
have unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Madam Speaker, there must be a mistake; we did 
not vote on Motion No. 4 as we intend to vote on Motions Nos. 6 
and 7.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, if I could just attract the 
attention of our colleagues for a moment. I am seeking 
unanimous consent to apply the vote taken to report stage 
Motion No. 2. That is, item 4 on the list that we have before us.
<P>
	I am seeking unanimous consent to apply that vote to report 
stage Motions Nos. 6 and 7.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: See list under Division No. 151.</I>]
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I declare Motions Nos. 6 
and 7 lost.
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	The next question is on Motion No. 11.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I believe you will find 
unanimous consent to apply the vote taken on report stage 
Motion No. 1 to this motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: See list under Division No. 150.</I>]
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I declare Motion No. 11 
lost.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The next question is on Motion No. 12. An affirmative vote on 
Motion No. 12 obviates the need for a vote on Motion No. 13. A 
negative vote on Motion No. 12 necessitates a vote on Motion 
No. 13.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I think you would find 
unanimous consent to apply the vote taken on report stage 
Motion No. 2 to the motion now before the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is there unanimous

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The next question is on Motion No. 13.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I think you would find 
unanimous consent to apply the vote taken on report stage 
Motion No. 1 to the motion now before the House and you 
would find further unanimous consent to apply that to report 
stage Motions Nos. 17, 22 and 24 as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Madam Speaker, again, I think that the numbers 
of the motions reported by the hon. Liberal Party whip should be 
checked because all this is not consistent with the previous 
agreement.
<P>
	Would it be possible to repeat the numbers of the motions 
being referred to?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I would ask consent that the 
result applied to Motion No. 1 apply to report stage Motions 
Nos. 13, 17, 22 and 24.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: See list under Division No. 150.</I>]
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I declare Motions Nos. 
13, 17, 22 and 24 lost.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The next question is on Motion No. 14. A vote on this motion 
also applies to Motions Nos. 15, 16, 18, and 19.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I seek unanimous consent to 
apply the vote taken on report stage Motion No. 3 to the item 
now before the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<I>[Editor's Note: See list under division No. 152.]</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I declare Motion No. 14 
lost. Consequently, Motions Nos. 15, 16, 18, and 19 are also 
lost.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The next question is on Motion No. 20. A vote on this motion 
also applies to Motion No. 23.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Madam Speaker, I think you would find 
unanimous consent for the members who voted on the previous 
motion to be recorded as voting on the motion now before the 
House in the following manner: Liberal members voting nay.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Madam Speaker, we will vote yea.

	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have the honour to present the fifth report of the 
Standing Committee on Natural Resources relating to our 
review of the mining industry.
<P>
	I wish to thank those who testified before or submitted briefs 
to the committee. By their input, they have made a significant 
contribution to our work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois who sit on the committee 
welcome the recommendations contained in the report of the 
Standing Committee on Natural Resources concerning mining 
development. However, the Bloc Quebecois saw fit to append a 
dissenting report to make sure that these recommendations do 
not promote federal interference in areas of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction, particularly with respect to costly duplication and 
overlap between actions taken by each level of government.
<P>
	Finally, Bloc members want the Minister of Natural 
Resources to make sure that the implementation of the tax 
measures described in these recommendations will benefit the 
mining industry and that appropriate control measures will be 
put in place so that there is no loophole, in the interest of the 
national Treasury and the continued credibility of the mining 
industry.

	<B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-299, an act to amend the Canada pension plan 
(increased contributions and pension).
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I have the pleasure to table a private 
member's bill which aims to improve the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	The amendments to the Canada pension plan which I am 
proposing will cause the plan to grow significantly in 
contributions and benefits. The expanded plan will eventually 
result in a more adequate retirement pension for all Canadians 
and will reduce the need for private pensions and retirement 
savings plans.
<P>
	The Canada pension plan would then provide an adequate and 
fully portable pension for all Canadians.
<P>
	I hope that all members will support this initiative.

Question No. 82-<B>Mr. Cummins:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What effect did the late signing of the aboriginal fishing agreements in 
British Columbia have on the Department of Fisheries and Oceans enforcement 
of the agreements and fisheries regulations in 1994?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> On 
September 23 the hon. member raised the question of the impact 
of the late signing of agreements on enforcement and regulation 
of British Columbia fisheries. On November 18 a response was 
provided which assessed the impact of late signing on the 
overall enforcement of agreements and regulations pertaining to 
management of the aboriginal fishery.
<P>
	The answer provided to the question posed by the hon. 
member in September was neither inaccurate nor misleading. 
The response acknowledged that late signing did have some 
effect.
<P>
	In characterizing this effect as small, the response was correct 
in the context of management of aboriginal fishing throughout 
British Columbia and in the context of the legal capacity to 
enforce against unauthorized fishing. The question posed by the 
hon. member was set in both these contexts. The response was 
not meant to imply that in specific areas and for specific 
agreements the late signing of agreements did not have negative 
implications as recorded in the documents cited by the hon. 
member.
<P>
	The response characterized the effect on ``enforcement of the 
agreements and fisheries regulations'' as small for the following 
reasons:
<P>
	1. The integrity of management systems made up of both 
agreements and regulations was maintained. All aboriginal 
salmon fishing before the signing of agreements was licensed 
under the aboriginal communal fishing licence regulations. 
These licences provided an enforceable framework for the 
control of aboriginal fishing until agreements were signed.
<P>
	2. While there were problems with the implementation of 
some of the more complex agreements, particularly the Sto:Lo 
agreement, these instances must be interpreted in the context of 
the 47 agreements signed in 1994 with aboriginal groups across 
British Columbia.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9118"> 9118 </A></B>
<P>
	3. In 23 cases steps were taken to minimize the effect of 
delays in signing agreements through bridge funding 
agreements starting at the beginning of May. These agreements 
provided aboriginal groups with funding to continue 
management and enforcement activities under protocols 
established the previous year while negotiations on allocation 
numbers and funding levels for the current year continued. In 
the Sto:Lo area, while bridge funding was not possible, a 
contractor was employed to monitor the fishery.
<P>
	4. Finally, many of the problems with enforcement which 
have been identified by fisheries officers are not related to the 
late signing of agreements. Problems of resource levels, 
planning and communication while real, and in some cases 
perhaps attributed by officers to signing of agreements, are 
actually more related to other aspects of the operation of the 
department.
<P>
	The minister has never denied that there were problems with 
enforcement of aboriginal fishing agreements and regulation in 
British Columbia in 1994. Many concerns were raised by 
fisheries officers when the minister met with them on November 
2. Some of these problems, such as the curtailed activities of 
aboriginal guardians and other problems with the ability of 
some aboriginal groups to participate in management, were 
related to the late signing of agreements and were identified as 
such in the initial response. However, in the face of failure to 
reach agreements at an earlier date, the department took steps to 
minimize these effects.
<P>
	The minister is committed to conservation and has taken 
measures to ensure that the reasons for the disappointing returns 
to the Fraser this year are independently investigated and 
publicly reported on. The minister does not believe the late 
signing of agreements was the primary cause of poor returns in 
the Fraser. The minister would like to point out that, as 
agreements are negotiated documents, the department does not 
have complete control over when they are signed. However, if 
late agreements are bad, the government must consider the 
effect of no agreements and no aboriginal involvement on the 
management of the fishery.
<P>
	This should not be a game of semantics debating the 
definition of ``little impact''. Suffice to say, all issues 
contributing to the situation on the Fraser this year are being 
assessed and the minister is committed to taking whatever 
remedial action proves necessary to ensure conservation.
<P>
	With specific reference to the late signing of agreements steps 
have already been taken to commence negotiations on 
agreements for 1995 in early January. To provide time for 
planning the implementation of agreements the minister will not 
be authorizing the signing of agreements after a deadline well in 
advance of when fishing for major runs is to commence.

	<B>Hon. David Anderson (for the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage)</B> moved that Bill C-53, an act to establish the 
Department of Canadian Heritage and to amend and repeal 
certain other acts, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the hearings on Bill C-53 by the Standing Committee 
on Canadian Heritage during the past weeks have given many 
Canadians from all sectors of our society the opportunity to 
present their views on the responsibilities encompassed in the 
proposed legislation.
<P>
	Every kind of opinion has been heard about this bill, including 
the name of the department, the portfolio and its holdings, and 
suggestions on how to amend various acts under its jurisdiction. 
This expression of a wide range of views about the Department 
of Canadian Heritage is consistent with the objective of our 
parliamentary system of fairness and openness in government. It 
is consistent with the government's ideal about giving all 
citizens the right, the access and the opportunity to become 
involved in all aspects of Canadian life.

<P>

<P>
	In a few moments, my colleague, the member for Mississauga 
East, will speak about the many advantages of having one 
integrated department.
<P>
	Indeed, the department's responsibilities, which range from 
natural reserves and historic sites and figures to sports and 
include the arts and cultural industries, really cover all aspects 
of life in Canada.

<P>
	My intention therefore is to concentrate on the multicultural 
aspects of Canadian life and why there is a need for a program 
that focuses on building understanding and respect and on 
fighting racism, bigotry and prejudice.
<P>
	For my government this program is more than building a 
monument. It is far more lasting in terms of daily living for 
Canadians, whatever their language, culture, milieu, newly 
arrived or long time resident. Multiculturalism is about the very 
fabric of our society.
<P>
	Canada has been built by wave after wave of immigrants. All 
Canadians other than the First Nations have their roots reaching 
to the four corners of the earth. They have kept coming and they 
have come at different stages.

at Rideau Hall with the Governor General of Canada. At that 
ceremony Dr. Dmytroa Cipywnyk, a very distinguished 
Canadian of Ukrainian descent and who is president of the 
Canadian Ethnocultural Council, received in the name of the 37 
groups that represent ethnocultural communities across Canada 
a coat of arms.
<P>
	It was a very moving day as I saw Ukrainians, Germans, 
Italians, Greeks, Jewish people, East Indians, people from the 
Czech Republic, Poland, Argentina, people of Irish descent and 
people from countries all around the world who all belong to this 
Canadian Ethnocultural Council. They had decided that they 
wanted to have a heraldic emblem that would represent who they 
are and what it means to be part of Canada.
<P>
	I was very touched and moved by the words of the Governor 
General. Mr. Hnatyshyn made a comment on the choice of the 
heraldry, the red and white crest with the winged seeds. He said 
maple trees are different. Maple seeds have a design that allows 
them to spiral to the ground far from the trees. They take root in 
new places, adapt to new conditions and thrive. That is the kind 
of spirit that has drawn millions of people to this land for 
hundreds of years. It is that spirit that draws people here today.
<P>
	I thought that was very demonstrative of the role and the place 
that Canadians have played from all parts of this world, from the 
Irish who came here fleeing hunger and famine to the Chinese 
who came to help build the railways, to the blacks who came 
through the underground railway. All kinds of people have come 
to this shore and each wave has brought prosperity, growth and 
development. Each wave has had to live difficult experiences 
and each wave has been enabled by the concepts that are founded 
in our democratic process to grow and to prosper, but not 
without difficulty.
<P>
	We have addressed those difficulties at many different times 
in different ways because we have been a growing and emerging 
democracy.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	In that spirit that moved thousands upon thousands of 
volunteers to respond, to reach out and to work for social 
harmony and social peace as their communities arrived here, it 
was the small groups that lent a hand to the business people, to 
the families in need, the Baron de Hirsch, for food, for coal, for 
heat; it was the organizations that came together to give food 
and lodging, shoes and clothing for the cold weather. Whether it 
was my community or the Christian community or the other 
communities, they gave a helping hand and enabled us to feel a 
sense of comfort and welcome and then we made the choice to 
stay, to move on, to integrate, to associate, to make our way of 
life here in Canada.
<P>
	That spirit, that generosity is found in the charitable social 
and cultural organizations of today. They all need respect, 
understanding and they need and come for some form of support 
as they work to face a very changed dynamic in society. Society 
is a great big global village whose people have still not learned 
how to live respectfully in many of the lands from which they 
come.
<P>
	We have an important job that is different than before because 
technology has changed. The world we now see is in conflict and 
those conflicts are now coming here and we must stop those 
conflicts. It is a different kind of situation.
<P>
	It is important that these volunteer organizations help us work 
toward social peace and social harmony. If we reach out our 
hand in friendship and we welcome the newly arrived as the host 
society, we will have received them at our table with grace and 
dignity and we will help others integrate into our society under 
the value system that we have built into our society.
<P>
	It is fairly new. When we talk about what we have put in here it 
is the spirit of multiculturalism that moved much of the change 
that we saw as we brought in our Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, as we brought in the Canadian Constitution, as we 
signed international documents to eliminate all forms of 
discrimination, all forms of racism, as we put into place acts of 
employment equity.
<P>
	I have said it before and I will say it again. It is time for us to 
get up to date, to understand and to explain to constituents just 
what multiculturalism means for Canada, just how important it 
is to the fabric of life here.
<P>
	We have never been a static society. Canadian federalism is a 
growing and evolving modern society. It is governance that 
looks at and adapts to change. It is not frozen in any particular 
mode or model. It has guiding principles today that form the 
very core of this nation and it moves based on fundamental 
principles. It means that Canada has been and is now and will 
continue to be a host country and a home country for people 
from around the world, from a multitude of other cultures that 
all share the same goal of making a good life for themselves and 
their families within the framework of our laws and our prin-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9120"> 9120 </A></B>
<P>
ciples of justice and fairness, of peace, order and good 
government at all levels of our society.
<P>
	It is obvious that people see the structures we have in place 
and that is why they want to come here. As citizens we have 
adapted it, have adopted it and have allowed it to evolve because 
we do not all have in our hearts and our minds the goodwill we 
need to have to help ensure that the fundamentals are there and 
that we move forward with them.
<P>
	It is very healthy that we have dialogue around the goals of 
multiculturalism. It is very healthy that we look at and analyse 
our society and recognize the ugly face of racism, recognize that 
those groups, Heritage Front, the Ku Klux Klan, are here, are out 
there, are spreading their poison and it has to stop. This is not a 
place where we allow them one seed from the maple tree to settle 
in the earth of this land.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	Community groups, social, cultural and educational groups 
contribute their skill, knowledge, expertise and creativity to 
Canadian life. It is the responsibility of all Canadians in the 
public as well as the private sector to encourage the conditions 
that allow all of us, regardless of our origins, to expect these 
principles of fairness and justice flourish and grow and that we 
support those initiatives.
<P>
	The government's multiculturalism programs are in place to 
assist us in reaching this goal. It is not an unreasonable goal and 
it is not an unattainable goal to expect that all Canadians be 
integrated into our society and become contributors to the 
country's progress.
<P>
	I did not say assimilate. I did not say that one should lose 
one's identity, but one should learn to live in co-operation with 
respect and understanding in our neighbourhoods. Those are the 
choices we have in this society. This is nothing more than good 
common sense. It allows for peace. It allows for civil society. 
The multicultural programs are there because unfortunately 
there are still barriers that prevent some individuals and groups 
from realizing their full potential.
<P>
	Canada was founded on a tradition of democracy, decency and 
civility, values of fairness and justice associated with this 
system that have guided and shaped our social structures, laws 
and institutions.
<P>
	We have strayed. We have erred, but we have also grown and 
learned to cherish the fragile form of rule that we have in place 
here which calls for constant vigilance. It is in civility and 
respect, it is in an appreciation of our diversity that we live. 
Pluralism, diversity, multicultural and multiracial backgrounds 
are our reality. Together we shall weave a tapestry that forms the 
fundamentals that is Canada, as we look in the House and see 
how different we are, how different are the geographic regions, 
the backgrounds, the lands and the languages.
<P>
	There is no one in the House who can look back more than two 
or three generations, maybe four. There are some here who tell 
me they have been here for six generations, but that is not the 
lifetime of this nation. We are all different and learning to live 
together, respecting each other. We do not have to love each 
other, but we have to respect each other for our differences and 
yet for our Canadian appreciation of the values of life.
<P>
	To live with this reality, to ensure social peace and cohesion 
will not happen by wishing. That only happens by working for it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Multiculturalism is not incompatible with Canadian values. 
On the contrary, it is based on the principles of the rights and 
responsibilities set forth in the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, the Canadian Human Rights Act, the Official 
Languages Act, the Citizenship Act and I might even add the 
Employment Equity Act.
<P>
	Canada's multiculturalism policy makes it possible to 
overcome obstacles more easily and to promote institutional 
change.
<P>
	It recognizes the richness found in cultural diversity. It is 
modeled on the values which guide us, are essential to our way 
of life and underlie what we aspire to as Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	When I visited numerous cultural communities across the 
country, I had the opportunity and the privilege to meet many 
men, women and young people who were all representative of 
today's Canadian society. Some are proud that their ancestors 
were among the first ones to step on Canadian soil. Others take 
pride in their dual citizenship, or in their newly acquired 
citizenship.
<P>
	I met members of organizations and associations involved in 
many sectors, including business, health care, education, law 
enforcement, as well as municipal and provincial 
administrations, to name but a few.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The message is always the same. The Government of Canada 
must help Canadians of all backgrounds to build a society where 
we can live in our neighbourhood in peaceful respect, united in 
the common purpose of securing the well-being of our families. 
That is what they told me. They recognize prejudice, they 
recognize bigotry, and they recognize the need to ensure that we 
stamp it out.
<P>
	I believe that the government's multiculturalism policy and 
the programs it supported can help to achieve this goal but only 
in participation with the private sector and community based 
groups that speak for all Canadians. Those multicultural 
councils are vital to our well-being.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9121"> 9121 </A></B>
<P>
	To do this successfully we are going to have to meet a number 
of challenges. First, we must recognize that pluralism does not 
contradict our assured sense of national identity, nor does it 
prevent social cohesion. We must not confuse national values 
with cultural pluralism because values cut across religious, 
cultural and ethnic and racial lines.
<P>
	Second, we are going to have to work on ways to facilitate the 
long term integration of first generation Canadians. We must 
give new citizens the tools to be effective, responsible, and 
informed so that they can contribute to Canada's development 
and become full and active participants in building a stronger 
country.
<P>
	Long term integration starts with learning about Canada, 
starts with civics. So many of the countries from which people 
are coming and have come do not understand democracy as it is 
lived here in Canada today. They do not and have not lived in 
democratic states. They have fear of speech. They have fear of 
police. They have fear of neighbours. They have fear of 
difference. It is our job if we want to live together in peaceful 
harmony to enable them to understand they are welcome, as I 
said earlier, at our table as part of the family.
<P>
	We teach that Canada is a democratic country. That is what we 
do in multiculturalism. We teach that we welcome the 
expression of opinion. We teach that we welcome difference 
while ensuring that racism and bigotry find no home here. 
Otherwise it is pointless and it would be a pointless lesson if we 
do not practise what we preach.
<P>
	Democracy requires that all citizens feel they are valued in 
this society. They must know that the opportunities to 
participate are available to everyone and should be available 
equally. We have to stop creaming those societies of their top 
intellectuals, bringing them here and not recognizing their 
academic qualifications.
<P>
	We must recognize that we must teach one of the official 
languages of this country. If we do not do that you cannot 
participate in a democratic society. You cannot shop in 
knowledge. You cannot look after your children and apply 
medications and buy medications. You cannot understand 
political parties. You cannot make rational decisions if you 
cannot read and speak one of the official languages of this 
country, depending on where you live and in what region you 
live and from where you came and what seems to adapt best to 
you. One of the official languages must be a part of the 
background of training.
<P>
	There must really be no barriers to participation based on 
race, religion, ethnic background or language.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	All Canadians must be able to express their views so as to be 
understood by others. This is why, as I just said, we have made 
education in both official languages a priority. This is 
important, because Canadians must have a decent standard of 
living, and they must participate in the daily activities of our 
society. Otherwise, people feel isolated; they can be 
manipulated and they may not lead the life they should be able 
to, here in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The multiculturalism program is therefore organized around 
four key objectives. First is to facilitate community 
participation and integration into the fabric of Canadian society.
<P>
	Second is to help those who render services in our hospitals 
and health institutions and those who receive the services; the 
police, the municipalities and the schools as well, to ensure that 
their policies and programs adjust to the reality of our diversity.
<P>
	Third is to strengthen social cohesion by promoting 
harmonious cross-cultural, intercultural and interracial group 
relations.
<P>
	Fourth is to promote public awareness of the economic and 
social benefits of pluralism.
<P>
	We know already that we have the support of many major 
Canadian organizations and institutions that understand the 
value of a respectful, open and participating society. One 
example I would give is that peaceful harmony means good 
business. Therefore, removing racism and acts of racial 
prejudice undertaking is valuable.
<P>
	We thank the Canadian Association of Broadcasters which has 
produced $10 million worth of air time which has been devoted 
to the fight against racism. In our schools across this land, 
parents and teachers associations have helped us fight prejudice 
and misunderstanding in the schools and have distributed very 
valuable materials that are lessons in civicism and civility.
<P>
	Other partners, the Conference Board of Canada and the Asia 
Pacific Foundation, have made it clear that diversity has an 
economic benefit and that pluralism gives us a natural 
competitive advantage in a global economy that is in itself 
multicultural and multilingual.
<P>
	The Canadian Advertising Association has done some 
excellent research and has put out a document called ``The 
Colour of Your Money'' that enable us to understand how 
important it is to be able to deal with the customers who live on 
our street and in our district.
<P>
	Our broad range of partners also includes the Canadian 
Association of Chiefs of Police, the Multicultural Help 
Association, the Canadian Advertising Council, the Federation 
of Canadian Municipalities, the Canadian Association of School 
Board Trustees, the Canadian Teachers' Federation, and the 
Canadian Conference on the Arts.
<P>
	These are not song, dance and festivals. Although I would 
love to be able to finance them, we do not do that. They are 
partners that help us ensure an open, respectful and 
understanding society where we all have choices to live, choices 
to choose where and how we want to live within the laws of 
respect in this land so that we live in  an integrated milieu that 
makes Canada the best place for all its citizens.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9122"> 9122 </A></B>
<P>
	These are the partnerships along with the volunteer sector that 
open more lines of communication to provide all Canadians, 
men and women and our youth, with a greater knowledge of the 
richness and benefits of our diverse population.
<P>
	We are working to change government from the inside as well 
as to ensure interracial understanding. The same way we work 
with shop foremen to prepare that floor as the host community to 
the new arrivals, so we are doing within our own house. For 
example, we worked and are working with the Departments of 
National Defence, Customs and Excise, and the RCMP to help 
ensure they are sensitive in their response to Canada's reality.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our programs related to interracial relations and cultural 
comprehension, and also to the integration of first generation 
Canadians, help all Canadians, through community support, to 
work together to build an economically sound and socially just 
country.
<P>
	Multiculturalism is not based on compartmentalization, nor 
on division.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is not based on being a hyphenated Canadian.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It seeks to build an integrated society where everyone has an 
equal chance to succeed, as well as an opportunity to understand 
and apply the principles governing citizenship.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is also not as I said before about funding song and dance, 
and unicultural festivals, as important as they are.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	When we see the tragedies which occur every day in the 
world, we have no choice but to cherish human life, and that 
includes all men and women-Catholics, Protestants, Jews, 
Hindus, Sikhs, Muslims, be they black, yellow, brown, red or 
white-who adhere to the democratic values of the Canadian 
society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	With an investment of less than $1 per year per Canadian, the 
federal government helps to promote a fairer society.
<P>
	In a society with a government that spends less than $1 per 
year but depends on additions to that dollar through the 
voluntary sector and through voluntary effort, the federal 
government helps to promote a fairer society in which all 
Canadians have a chance and a choice to participate equally and 
with respect.
<P>
	This is an investment we cannot afford to ignore. The value of 
our multiculturalism programs to Canadian society must be 
confirmed by ensuring that they can work effectively within the 
Department of Canadian  Heritage. All of us, whether in this 
House or not, must be ever vigilant in our defence of the values 
of a democratic, free and open society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the bill before the House today, on third 
reading, is Bill C-53, an Act to establish the Department of 
Canadian Heritage and to amend and repeal certain other Acts.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has five major reasons for voting against 
this bill. First, through this bill the Government of Canada 
denies the existence of Quebec as a nation and the existence of 
its culture.
<P>
	Second, nothing in this bill points to any major changes in 
federal policy on defending the rights of francophones in 
Canada, although anyone who can read and use a pocket 
calculator will see that the federal government's policy on 
bilingualism has failed.
<P>
	Third, this government has forgotten its commitment made to 
creators during the last election campaign with respect to 
patriating copyright legislation to the Department of Canadian 
Heritage.
<P>
	Fourth, at a time when there is a growing trend towards 
amalgamation in the communications sector, the government 
has decided to confirm the separate status of 
telecommunications and broadcasting by making the 
Department of Industry responsible for the former and the 
Department of Canadian Heritage responsible for broadcasting.
<P>
	Fifth, nothing in this bill gives the Department of Canadian 
Heritage any real power to control foreign investment where 
cultural products and industries are concerned.
<P>
	I will now comment on these points one by one, to 
demonstrate the major weaknesses of this bill. In his speech on 
second reading of the bill we are now considering at the third 
reading stage, the Minister of Canadian Heritage defined the 
word ``heritage'' as, and I quote: ``the set of signs that enable us 
to recognize ourselves as individuals who belong to a group or 
even a country''.
<P>
	On the basis of that definition, it was reasonable to hope that 
the Canadian government would recognize in law what has been 
a fact since the beginnings of this country and what the 
Laurendeau-Dunton Commission recognized, and I am talking 
about 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9123"> 9123 </A></B>
<P>
the existence of two founding peoples equal before the law and 
of several nations. Unfortunately, this bill makes no reference to 
the signs that would enable Quebecers to recognize themselves 
as belonging to this country. This bill recognizes only one 
nation, the nation of Canada, and gives the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage the authority to promote one identity: the Canadian 
identity.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	There is worse. The heritage minister, who sponsored this 
bill, testified before the Standing Committee on  National 
Heritage on December 1. My colleague, the hon. member for 
Québec, asked him at that time why his bill made reference to 
only one nation, namely the Canadian nation, instead of two, 
that of Quebec and Canada. With the arrogance and ignorance 
that have come to characterize him, he replied: ``I would be 
grateful if you could tell me, or if there is not enough time, my 
officials who will be testifying before you at a later date, which 
clause exactly refers to a single Canadian nation. All I can see in 
this bill is references to Canadian identity. And that is not the 
same thing''.
<P>
	Again, the minister is playing games. He is insinuating that 
my hon. colleague from Québec did not understand a thing.
<P>
	Let me explain to the Minister of Canadian Heritage a couple 
of basic rules of grammar. When you write ``nation'', it is a 
singular. And singular means one, not two, because then you 
would have a plural, meaning more than one. When you write 
``Canadian nation'', the word ``Canadian'' is used as a qualifier 
or adjective and, in French, the function of the adjective is to 
modify the word it is combined with. In this bill, we are not 
talking about just any nation, but the Canadian nation.
<P>
	Let us take a closer look at clauses 4 and 5 of the bill, which 
specifically give the minister the mandate to promote the 
Canadian nation.
<P>
	Clause 4 reads, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>4.(1) The powers, duties and functions of the Minister extend to and include 
all matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction, not by law assigned to any 
other department, board or agency of the Government of Canada, relating to 
Canadian identity and values, cultural development, heritage and areas of 
natural or historical significance to the nation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As for Clause 5, it reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>5. In exercising the powers and performing the duties and functions assigned 
to the Minister by section 4, the Minister shall initiate, recommend, coordinate, 
implement and promote national policies, projects and programs with respect 
to Canadian identity and values, cultural development, heritage and areas of 
natural or historical significance to the nation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In this case, there is no room for interpretation in the French 
version of the clause, as the word ``canadiens'' is spelled with an 
``s''. If you go back to the grammatical rule I just gave, this 
means that the qualifier ``canadiens'' modifies every noun that 
precedes it in the sentence-the same way that ``Canadian'' 
modifies every substantive that comes after. The meaning of 
Clause 5 then is the following: ``In exercising the powers and 
performing the duties and functions assigned to the Minister by 
section 4, the Minister shall initiate, recommend, coordinate, 
implement and promote national policies, projects and 
programs with respect to Canadian identity and Canadian 
values, Canadian cultural development, Canadian heritage and 
areas of natural or historical significance to the nation-that is 
to say the Canadian nation''.<BR>

<P>
	You will have noticed that this entire bill is predicated on 
the concept of a Canadian nation. For the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage and the cultural agencies under him, there is only one 
nation, the Canadian nation.
<P>
	In the brief he tabled with the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage, Mr. Monière reported to us the results of 
polls conducted by Léger &amp; Léger and related by Maurice 
Pinard, a renowned McGill University professor whose 
integrity, credibility and intellectual honesty are 
unquestionable.
<P>
	These polls show that Quebec's national identity has evolved 
considerably and that Quebecers are more and more likely to 
identify themselves as Quebecers first and foremost and not as 
French Canadians, much less as Canadians. In 1992, 54 per cent 
of respondents of all linguistic origins-this is 
important-referred to themselves as Quebecers, 26 per cent as 
French Canadians and 20 per cent as Canadians. These figures 
clearly point to the existence of a Quebec culture, a Quebec 
identity, a Quebec nation, which the bill before us does not 
reflect.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Many things were said in committee on this concept of nation. 
When department officials came to testify, they told us that 
since this bill was not a constitutional document, it did not have 
to mention the two founding nations of this country. I must 
humbly admit that I did not have time to verify this statement 
from a legal standpoint. But I know very well that at the time of 
the ``beautiful risk'', we tried to have Quebec's distinct society 
recognized in the Constitution, but the rest of Canada turned us 
down.
<P>
	We are on the horns of a dilemma, the one about the chicken 
and the egg, which will be much more simple and easy to solve 
through Quebec sovereignty, since the government refuses to 
make any amendment to this bill which would have helped us 
feel at home in this country, even though we were the first to 
arrive in this country named Canada by Jacques Cartier, a 
country whose national anthem was composed-lyrics and 
music-by two Quebecers, Calixa Lavallée and Basile Routhier. 
We are being denied the right to feel at home in this country, so 
the only alternative is to leave.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9124"> 9124 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone: </B>I feel right at home, and I refuse to leave.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay: </B>I listened to you, Madam, so try to listen to 
me while I speak. Thank you.
<P>
	In summary, what the deputy minister, cultural development 
tells us is that the Canadian identity includes the Quebec 
identity. He said in committee that their general vision is that the 
Quebec identity is a fundamental component of the Canadian 
identity.
<P>
	This vision, which would wipe out Quebecois culture as if it 
did not exist by itself but was only an integral part of Canadian 
culture, was denounced by many groups that appeared before the 
Committee on Canadian Heritage during the marathon hearings 
which, by using dilatory  procedural tactics, we were able to 
force the government to hold.
<P>
	François Rocher, a political scientist at Carleton University, 
said that what the government was doing was part of an 
incomplete process of nation-building, based on a denial of the 
national realities that already exist in Canada. Establishing a 
heritage department is part of a much broader plan to refashion 
the way that Canada's identity is to be understood and 
expressed. Mr. Rocher thus shares the idea expressed by his 
colleague, Mr. Monière, who said that the heritage department 
was really a propaganda department.
<P>
	In fact, what the government is doing is, first, to deny the 
social and historic reality of an existing Quebec culture and 
nation; second, to imagine a fictitious Canadian national 
community to hide the lack of a common sense of Canadian 
identity; third, the government wishes to promote this made-up 
identity and even impose it on all communities in Canada.
<P>
	It is quite obvious that this is intended particularly to counter 
Quebec nationalism. To oppose the growing demands for 
particular identities, the government proposes a homogenizing 
national vision. However, building a national identity on the 
denial of already existing identities that are strong and 
politically articulate can only exacerbate the tensions that exist 
in Canada.
<P>
	It must be pointed out that all the efforts of this department 
consisted and from now on will consist in denying the existence 
of a culture other than the Canadian one and furthermore in 
using our taxes to promote this Canadian culture on Quebec 
territory. Why do the Bloc Quebecois and most of the witnesses 
who appeared before the heritage committee so strongly 
denounce this denial of Quebec culture by the federal 
government? Quite simply, because failing to mention it in the 
bill means denying its existence.
<P>
	Mr. Rocher said that three conditions are essential for a 
culture to exist. First, it must be able to express itself; that is, it 
must be rich and flourishing. Second, it must be able to fulfil 
itself, that is, be used and valued in economic, social and 
political activities. Finally, it must be recognized, that is, 
accepted and taken into consideration by other communities 
close by.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	The right to exist is part of one's identity. The identity must 
represent something, not only for the individuals which make up 
a community, but also for the other communities which 
recognize the legitimacy of that identity.
<P>
	Let us now come to the second reason why the Bloc Quebecois 
will oppose this bill, namely the failure of the federal 
government's official languages policy.
<P>
	This legislation provides no major change regarding federal 
policies on bilingualism, as was confirmed to us, in committee, 
by the responsible deputy minister at the Department of 
Canadian Heritage. According to paragraph 4(2)(<I>g</I>) of the bill, 
the minister is responsible for, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>g</I>) the advancement of the equality of status and use of English and French 
and the enhancement and development of the English and French linguistic 
minority communities in Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Also, clauses 23 and 24 of the bill amend the Official 
Languages Act to confirm that the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage will be the one responsible for the implementation of 
sections 41 and 42, Part VII, of the Official Languages Act, 
which relate to the co-ordination and the implementation of 
linguistic policies within federal departments.
<P>
	So, there is nothing new under the sun. Yet, the government 
should really have brought major changes to its linguistic 
policy. It should have clearly indicated its intention to salvage 
what can still be salvaged.
<P>
	Let us take a look at some figures, 25 years after the Official 
Languages Act took effect. First, the percentage of Canadians 
whose first language is French is dropping drastically, and the 
official languages policy implemented in 1969 has done nothing 
to stop that trend.
<P>
	According to Statistics Canada's latest census, 6.5 million 
Canadians, or 23.8 per cent of the population, have French as 
their mother tongue. In 1951, that proportion was 29 per cent.
<P>
	Let us look at the assimilation rate, which is the ratio between 
the number of those who say French is their mother tongue and 
the number of those who actually use French at home. 
According to the latest census, the average assimilation rate in 
Canada, excluding Quebec, was 35.9 per cent, which represents 
an increase of 4.5 per cent over the 1986 figure.
<P>
	British Columbia is the undisputed champion with an 
assimilation rate of 75.2 per cent. Saskatchewan is in second 
place with a rate of 69.6 per cent, followed by Alberta with 66.9 
per cent. Even New Brunswick, which is the only 
constitutionally bilingual province and which prides itself in 
giving special treatment to French, has an assimilation rate of 
8.7 per cent. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9125"> 9125 </A></B>
<P>
Some say that Quebec has the most racist linguistic policy. Yet, 
its English-speaking community is growing.
<P>
	In the 1991 census, 9.2 per cent of Quebecers said that English 
was their mother tongue, while 11.2 per cent stated that they 
spoke English at home. Instead of hiding its head in the sand, 
Canada should look at what is being done in Quebec.
<P>
	Let us now turn to how the federal government implements its 
policy on bilingualism in its own Public Service. Take Foreign 
Affairs, a sector that is crucial when representing Canada abroad 
and helping business people from Quebec, for instance.
<P>
	Recent reports released by the department indicated that only 
42 per cent of Canadian diplomats were bilingual and that 23 per 
cent were francophones, of whom more than 95 per cent were 
bilingual. We can therefore conclude that only 25 per cent of 
English Canadian diplomats speak French, which is totally 
unacceptable in their position as representatives of a country 
that calls itself officially bilingual.
<P>
	The consequences of the lack of bilingual Canadian 
representatives abroad are well known. A unilingual 
francophone client abroad, whether he is a businessman or a 
citizen in distress, is unable to communicate with about 60 per 
cent of departmental officers. He cannot read unclassified 
documents drafted in English only and can only communicate 
with a minority of the diplomats in Canadian embassies abroad.
<P>
	With this many of our diplomats being unilingual English, the 
problem is compounded when the embassy is a small one.
<P>
	And what impression do foreigners get when they find that the 
Canadian ambassador, a career diplomat, does not speak 
French? That Canada is a unilingual, English-speaking country.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	Turning to the Department of National Defence, 48.1 per cent 
of the total francophone establishment, both civilian and 
military, is bilingual, while only 6.9 per cent of the anglophone 
establishment is bilingual. Furthermore, 23.4 per cent of 
francophones are in English-speaking units and only 1.7 per 
cent of anglophones are in French-speaking units. There is no 
good reason for this. What makes these statistics even more 
depressing today is the closing of the Collège militaire de 
Saint-Jean. Both departments are, in fact, a microcosm of the 
situation in the federal Public Service.
<P>
	In its latest report on the language situation in the federal 
Public Service, Treasury Board said that in Quebec, to serve a 
minority group that represents 10 per cent of the population, the 
federal government had an establishment that was of 52.7 per 
cent bilingual, or 15,945 positions out of a total of 30,234.
<P>
	If we apply this ratio to the rest of Canada, the number of 
bilingual positions should be 30,666 instead of 7,465, which is 
the case today. So there is a crying need for 23,000 bilingual 
positions, which is not being met. After the Yukon, the 
francophone minority least well served by  the federal 
government is in New Brunswick, where the percentage of 
francophones is 33 per cent and the percentage of bilingual 
positions in the federal Public Service is only 39.4 per cent. 
Applying the same ratio we applied to Quebec, the entire federal 
Public Service in this province should be bilingual.
<P>
	It is obvious to me that the view in Ottawa is that a 
francophone is not worth as much as an anglophone, because 
when it comes to being served in one's own language, the 
anglophone gets the service, while the francophone has to speak 
English. Studies have repeatedly shown that the inability to 
obtain services in one's own language is a factor that contributes 
generally to assimilation.
<P>
	If the federal government really wanted to put the status and 
use of French and English on an equal footing in this country, it 
would invest in this principle, in other words, when awarding 
bursaries for language training, it would give preference to 
anglophones in Canada with a very poor knowledge of French 
instead of to francophones, who generally have a fairly good 
knowledge of English. But no, the Department of Canadian 
Heritage does the opposite. On page 13 of his report, the official 
languages commissioner notes that of the 7,301 bursaries 
awarded in 1992-1993 for summer language courses, 3,150 
went to Quebecers. What this program, like many others, is 
designed to do is anglicize Quebec, not to make Canada 
bilingual.
<P>
	Here, I cannot help pointing out the difference in the 
treatment of the English and French networks of the CBC. While 
the CBC spends an average of $18,390 per production hour on its 
French network, it spends twice that amount, or $37,496, on its 
English network, and it does so with the blessing of the federal 
government, the Department of Canadian Heritage and the 
Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications 
Commission.
<P>
	In this regard, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation 
continues to be a clear example of what the federal government 
has in store for French in Canada and of the collusion of 
Canadian institutions in the implementation of this unequal 
status.
<P>
	I could not close this chapter on the failure of 25 years of 
bilingualism policies without sharing with you some 
information that appeared in the summer issue of <I>Language and 
Society</I>, a magazine put out by the Commissioner of Official 
Languages. This particular issue looked at the accessibility of 
health services in the language of the minority. It contained the 
following lines: ``The government of British Columbia has 
instituted a program of access to multilingual services. French is 
not included, however, even though francophones form the fifth 
largest ethnic group in that province. Language assistance is 
offered in Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese), Punjabi, Spanish, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9126"> 9126 </A></B>
<P>
Somali and Vietnamese, even though Vietnamese is only the 
sixteenth largest ethnic group in the province''.
<P>
	Surely British Columbia holds the gold medal for 
assimilation, since it does not offer any health services in 
French to its French-speaking population.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	The spokesperson for the provincial Department of Health, 
Mrs. Susan Gee, explains the situation this way, and I quote: 
``There are not enough Francophones in British Columbia''. Yet, 
there are more Francophones than Vietnamese. ``They are not 
considered immigrants and they are expected to be bilingual 
since they are Canadians''. In other words, they are expected to 
speak English.
<P>
	Other provinces have no policy regarding the provision of 
health services in the minority language. As one witness told the 
committee: ``Call 911 just to see if you can get service in 
French''. When you think about everything the federal 
government said against user fees and its refusal to do anything 
to provide health services in French, there is only one 
conclusion to be drawn.
<P>
	The third reason why we oppose this bill is that it gives the 
Minister of Heritage the power to legislate with regard to 
copyright. Let me remind the House that we have been waiting 
now for almost nine years for the Copyright Act to be amended. 
Let me also remind the House that the legislation was supposed 
to be amended under the previous government and that the 
current Minister of Heritage, when he was appointed, appeared 
before the Committee on Canadian Heritage, that was last April, 
and told us that the reform of the legislation was one of his 
priorities. At that time, he said it was only a matter of weeks 
before he could table the bill. However, creative artists will not 
even see the legislation before Christmas.
<P>
	Why? Because the Copyright Act is essentially the 
responsibility of the Department of Industry. Every creative 
artists' group has demanded that the act be transferred to the 
Department of Heritage. All those who came before the 
committee indicated that the Department of Industry is in a 
conflict of interests in this matter. Indeed, the department must 
protect the interests of consumers and corporations, which are in 
direct contradiction with the rights and interests of the artists.
<P>
	Before the election, even the Liberal Party had recognized 
that this was inappropriate. In response to questions by the 
Canadian Conference of the Arts, the Liberals wrote: ``The 
Liberal Party will have as a priority to review the Copyright Act. 
We will make sure that, above all, the writers reap the fruit of 
their labours, while easing the access to copyrighted material. 
Liberals understand how important copyrights are. That is why 
we will review the Conservative decision to share this 
jurisdiction between two departments, when reorganizing the 
administration.''
<P>
	This at least is one case where the Liberal Party has not kept 
its word and that is most unfortunate. In an almost 
unprecedented effort of manipulation, the  chairman of the 
heritage committee did his best to make us and the witnesses 
believe that his government had, in fact, proceeded to review the 
Conservative decision but had finally decided that it was more 
logical to leave the responsibility of the Copyright Act with the 
Department of Industry.
<P>
	His attempt to save face failed. Indeed, senior officials from 
the Department of Industry, who drafted Bill C-46 establishing 
this department, said before the industry committee that all they 
did was put into legislative terms Ms. Cambell's reform. This 
evidence was corroborated by Heritage Canada officials who, 
during the briefing session given to our staff, stated that Bill 
C-53 was just a housekeeping bill whose sole purpose was to put 
into legislative terms the Campbell reform, and not to correct its 
flaws.
<P>
	Officials from the Department of Industry went even further. 
When questioned by the committee chairman, they stated that it 
would not help to add a reference to copyright in the Heritage 
Canada legislation. They said that if we had to add this kind of 
reference every time the interests of two departments 
overlapped, we would never see the end of it. By saying this, 
these officials confirmed what many had told us in committee, 
that the government amendment to Bill C-53 regarding 
copyright does not give the minister any new powers.
<P>
	As my colleague for Richelieu said in committee, since the 
legislative power with regard to copyright rests with the 
Department of Industry, the protection of the rights of creative 
artists comes down to a matter of credibility and the strength of 
individual ministers.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Given the clout and credibility of the present Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, creative artists have good reason to be 
pessimistic, and they have the whole-hearted sympathy of the 
official opposition.
<P>
	By its refusal to give copyright legislation to the Department 
of Canadian Heritage, the government has shown that it could 
not care less about creative artists. It sends an alarming signal to 
the artistic community and cultural industries. We all remember 
the decision made in the Ginn transaction, and we all know how 
that sorry saga ended.
<P>
	I cannot conclude without saying a word on our last two 
reasons for voting against this bill. Against all logic, as far as the 
defence of our cultural industries is concerned, the Canadian 
government maintained another decision made by Ms. 
Campbell, splitting broadcasting and telecommunications.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9127"> 9127 </A></B>
<P>
	At a time when convergence is critical to the activities of our 
cultural industries, it was important to rescind the decision 
separating two things that, by nature, belong together: 
telecommunications and broadcasting. The message this 
government sends to people in the communications business is 
that financial interests will take precedence over cultural 
interests in Canada and Quebec. That is a very serious problem 
because the value to be gained from the information highway 
will not be the physical network itself, but rather the 
information travelling through that network.
<P>
	I would also like to say that today, we are witnessing another 
shift toward the industry department. Indeed, as for copyrights, 
the federal government chose to leave to the Department of 
Industry jurisdiction over foreign investments in cultural 
industries, thus giving to the Department of Canadian Heritage 
only the power to develop cultural policies. The former 
Department of Communications had that power. It used it to 
develop a publishing policy which the government 
light-heartily violated in the Ginn case and in the 
Maxwell-McMillan versus Prentice-Hall case, as well.
<P>
	I am getting to the conclusion, which is simple: this 
government, with its Bill C-53, once again simply lacks vision.
<P>
	At the dawn of this crucial year for our collective future, the 
Canadian government had a unique opportunity to send clear 
messages to the citizens of this country, whom the Department 
of Canadian Heritage has a mandate to protect. As a member of 
Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, this saddens me. But as a 
sovereignist, I am very happy that the government did exactly 
the opposite of what Canadians were expecting, but exactly what 
Quebecers were hoping for.
<P>
	It simply denied the existence of our nation. It does not 
suggest any move to frenchify English Canada and to stop the 
bilingualization of Quebec. On the contrary, in our opinion, 
clause 4(2)(<I>g</I>), which provides for the advancement of the 
equality of status and use of French and English, is not even 
worth the paper on which it is written. Finally, the government 
has not lived up to the expectations it had instilled in creative 
artists and an important part of the tools it could use to defend 
culture and creators is now in the hands of the Department of 
Industry. The government has just officially placed an important 
part of the Canadian Heritage under its administrative 
supervision.
<P>
	For all those reasons, the Bloc Quebecois will oppose this bill. 
It is narrow-minded, dangerous for the Canadian nation and 
disrespectful towards creative artists. There is only one hope for 
Quebecers, which is to choose to have their own country. Only 
then will they be able to express their own culture and have it 
recognized for the best of our collective future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise to speak at third reading of Bill C-53, an act to 
establish the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	I must say it has been a unique experience to participate in the 
process of presenting this bill to the House, to hear the responses 
of so many of my colleagues at second reading, to acknowledge 
the efforts of all of us in committee and now finally to speak 
once again at this next step in its passage. In my view this 
represents the best of what democracy has to offer us: freedom 
of speech and the opportunity to disagree and present alternative 
points of view. Having said that, will we be left yet again with 
the status quo?
<P>
	Speaking from this side of the House I believe that our point 
of view has enriched the debate as the government has continued 
its creation of a superministry of cultural identity. We have 
presented many arguments to challenge the new ministry. As I 
have said before, it denies us an opportunity to define ourselves 
as Canadians despite the insistence of some that it provides and 
promotes greater understanding and a greater sense of 
intercultural endeavour.
<P>
	What is occurring is the legislative entrenchment of grants to 
a host of special interest groups. The total of all special interest 
group funding throughout all government departments is 
rumoured to be approximately $500 million. The government 
has not been specific in terms of the cuts it plans to make to 
special interest groups. Responses have ranged from the 
preparation of guidelines to the anticipation of reduced funding. 
There is nothing explicit in that regard but to wait until the 
February 1995 budget.
<P>
	It is obvious the government is not comfortable discussing 
expenditure reduction. This is odd especially at a time when 
Canadians are seeking a more open approach to governance. It is 
also odd at a time when the opportunity to present a model for 
change, as has been presented in the creation of the Department 
of Canadian Heritage, has not been seized. The circle of virtue is 
reduced to a vicious circle and the status quo remains.
<P>
	The ministry consolidates several subcabinet departments: 
the Secretary of State; the Department of Multiculturalism and 
Citizenship; the Department of Fitness and Amateur Sport; 
Parks Canada; components of Environment Canada; and the 
heritage component of the Department of Communications. I 
will focus further on a number of these departments in this 
presentation.
<P>
	Given the unacceptable, incomprehensible and contemptuous 
personal attack made yesterday by my colleague from 
Carleton-Gloucester with no regard or relationship to Bill 
C-53, I will clarify for the member the Reform Party's position 
on languages. I hope he will be able to understand this clear 
policy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9128"> 9128 </A></B>
<P>
	The Reform Party supports the promotion of language policy 
centred on the following:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
first, freedom of expression; second, recognition of the French 
language in Quebec and of the English language in other 
provinces; third, recognition of bilingualism in important 
federal institutions, including the Parliament of Canada and the 
Supreme Court; and finally, recognition of bilingualism 
wherever the number of people warrants the presence of services 
in both official languages.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Explaining further so as to be perfectly clear, let me quote the 
hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan. He explained during 
second reading of the bill that the official languages policy is 
divisive. For proof of this, one need only to be reminded of the 
pejorative, anti-women comments that were hurled my way 
yesterday by the member for Carleton-Gloucester.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Nanaimo-Cowichan stated that 
``the mandate calls for the advancement of the equality of status 
and the use of English and French. Under this mandate the 
ministry will spend $24 million this year on official languages 
in education. The Constitutions of 1867 and 1982 clearly state 
that education is a provincial responsibility. Why then is this 
ministry spending a quarter of a billion dollars in this area of 
provincial jurisdiction?''
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	We oppose this bill for a number of reasons, only one of which 
is our opposition to the government's official languages policy. I 
would like to quote the profound words of my colleague from 
Surrey North when she questioned the need for this department.
<P>
	The hon. member stated: ``Webster's dictionary defines 
heritage as something that we inherit at birth; in other words it is 
like a legacy. It is something or anything that is derived from the 
past or from tradition. By definition then, heritage of an 
individual or a group or a country is what we actually inherit at 
birth, that which was created and moulded by the actions of 
those who preceded us just as what we do now in our lifetime 
will become the heritage or the mould of the lifestyle for those 
who come after us''.
<P>
	She went on to say: ``Those in the present inherit a base from 
the past to build on for those in the future. Instead of there being 
a specific Department of Canadian Heritage, all departments or 
ministries should be responsible through the legislation they 
propose for the development and maintenance of everything we 
do, of the heritage for those who are to follow, not just a single 
department''.
<P>
	Let me share with the House a story about a man by the name 
of Glenn Bradley. I found his story in the book <I>Worlds Apart: 
New Immigrant Voices</I> written by Milly Charon. His story is 
titled ``The Dilemma of Multiculturalism''. This is Glenn's 
story and it constitutes the bulk of my remarks today. There is 
a poignancy to this story that I will leave with the House.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Language and nationality are current issues in today's society. In view of the 
laws and general social outlook in Quebec, one has to realize that to survive 
here, one must become French. Many of the language problems exist today 
because the younger generation did not want to learn to speak French, perhaps 
because of their parents who may have been immigrants and wished to keep the 
old ways and mother tongue dominant.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I grew up under the new age of political reform in Quebec. The social 
phenomenon of the quiet revolution and le Front de Libération du Québec were 
part of my childhood surroundings. These events played a part in the rise of the 
supremacy of the French language in Quebec.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My parents witnessed these social reforms and decided that if I was to have a 
future in Quebec I would have to learn to speak French.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>They could have rebelled in their own way. They could have brought me up 
with all the Scottish traditions they had been raised with. However, teatime, the 
clans, and Robert Burns were not to play a part in my childhood education.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My family roots are deep in Scottish soil. My parents and all my ancestors 
were born in Scotland. My parents decided to leave their homeland in the late 
1950s. At that time, Quebec was looking for skilled workers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My father, who had been an engineer on merchant ships sailing out of 
Scottish ports, decided that Quebec would be the ideal place in Canada where 
his skills would land him a job without too much difficulty.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Quebec City was my parents' first stop, but when they realized that Montreal 
was the industrial centre of the province, they moved to St. Michel, a suburb.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My father worked in the oil refineries in the east end of Montreal and 
continued to do so even after the family moved to Duvernay, a predominantly 
French Canadian sector of the city of Laval. They chose Duvernay deliberately 
because they realized that the children they were planning to have one day 
would be able to learn French by association with the other people in the area.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>During my early school days in the late 1960s, my father had decided that the 
shift work in the refineries would interfere with his responsibilities as a parent. 
Education was booming in Quebec, and the need for technical teachers was 
great. My father capitalized on this and easily landed a job with the Protestant 
School Board of Greater Montreal as a metalwork teacher for Monklands High 
School in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. At the time, my mother was the 
vice-principal of Laval Highcliff Elementary School which I would attend.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Because both my parents were involved in education at different levels, it 
made them realize that if their offspring were to flourish in this country, they 
would need a good education.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the late sixties and seventies the Laval school started testing its program 
with bilingual classes for elementary school children. Highcliff was chosen as 
the test school, and a group of students who were considered above average 
would take their classes in French. I was lucky to participate in that program.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9129"> 9129 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My interest in the French language actually had started almost from the 
moment I could talk coherently. Living in a French neighbourhood meant that 
whenever you went out into the street, nine times out of ten the other children 
were speaking what I thought was a strange language. Little did I know that 
``ballon-chasseur'' was dodgeball and that ``cache-cache'' meant hide and go 
seek. From then on I was determined to learn what they were saying so that I 
would not be at a disadvantage when playing with them. Oddly enough, this 
decision made when I was five years old would dominate the rest of my life.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Since English instruction in the French school system left much to be desired 
and I was already starting to learn French, I decided I would play ambassador. 
Just as an ambassador is a liaison in another country, my role would be liaison 
between the two languages. Imagine my surprise when I confronted the 
children in the street with my first garbled speech in French, my strained 
``bonjour, je m'appelle'' was returned with ``maudite bloke'' a reference to the 
somewhat square-headedness of the English population. Chalk up one for 
French Canadian nationalism, I guess.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Good old Scottish stubbornness, or whatever you want to call it, made me 
decide to beat them at their own game. I excelled in my French studies through 
bilingual and immersion programs to a degree where my knowledge of the 
language and grammar was perhaps better than that of the French children 
themselves.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Unfortunately, the responses I received had gone from one extreme to 
another. Although I got along with the other children, I was never really 
accepted by them. I finally discovered the reason why. French Canadians hated 
the French from France almost as much as the English. My French accent was 
almost like that of the people French Canadians called ``les snobbes''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>By the time I was 13 I realized that French Canadian was a proper language 
and a culture all of its own. I decided to treat what I had already learned as a 
separate language and discover exactly what French Canadian was and is.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In my final years of high school I delved into dozens of written novels, the 
works of Savard, Thériault and Vallieres, the plays of Tremblay and Gélinas 
and the poetry of Vigneault and Nelligan. From these pieces written by 
prominent French Canadian authors I was able to obtain a good grasp of the 
emergence of the French Canadian culture in Quebec.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It was interesting to witness the transition in myself. I was so involved with 
these studies that a few of my high school buddies started calling me Frenchie. I 
graduated from high school feeling very comfortable with my knowledge of 
French Canadians. As strange as it may sound, perhaps I had too much 
knowledge.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Just before heading off to Carleton University to study communications, 
something in my brain snapped. I began thinking I was French Canadian. I did 
everything to convince myself that I was. I had become a staunch Parti 
Quebecois supporter. I even cried when René Lévesque lost the sovereignty 
association vote. I defended everything that was considered French Canadian.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At Carleton I was elected president of the Francophone Club. My plan for 
assimilation might have worked except for two things: my name and my 
ancestors. Once again my wise parents from the old country came to my rescue. 
They were able to grind into my thick skull that should the situation in Quebec 
worsen, my name alone would make me stand out like a sore thumb.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For most people it might have been too late to change, but at 18 I began learning 
about my own cultural history, the glory of the Scottish clans and all the benefits that 
Quebec and Canada enjoy today because of Scottish immigrants. Robert Bruce, Mary  
Queen of Scots and the poet Robert Burns are well-known names in Scottish history, 
but what of those who immigrated to Canada and gave so much of their time and efforts 
to build this country?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Lord Selkirk, a Scottish philanthropist and colonizer was responsible for 
bringing immigrants to Prince Edward Island. They later spread to Nova Scotia 
and established a colony there. Selkirk opened the west with his settlements in 
the Red River Valley in Manitoba.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Scottish immigrants were instrumental in the establishment of the fur trade 
in Canada and played the greatest part in the foundations of education in this 
country.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Early Scottish settlers placed top priority on education. The first 
non-sectarian school for higher education in Nova Scotia, Pictou Academy, 
was founded by a Scot. Dalhousie University, McGill University in Montreal, 
the University of Toronto, Queen's, St. Francis Xavier and the University of 
New Brunswick all owe their establishment to Scots.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Sir Alexander Mackenzie, trader and explorer, discovered the Mackenzie 
River and was the first white man to cross the northern part of the American 
continent to the Pacific Ocean. Simpson and MacTavish are other names 
synonymous with the building of our country. Alexander Mackenzie, a Scot, 
was Prime Minister of Canada between 1873 and 1878.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In addition, Scotsmen and Canadians of Scottish origin have played 
formidable roles in communications and journalism. There has been George 
Brown, founder of the <I>Globe</I>; William Lyon Mackenzie, founder and editor of 
the <I>Colonial Advocate</I> and one of the leaders of the 1837 rebellion; John 
Nielson, editor of the Quebec <I>Gazette</I>; John Dougall, both father and son, of the 
Montreal <I>Witness</I>; and Hugh Graham, Lord Atholstan of the Montreal <I>Star</I>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Suddenly a new dimension was added to my research for cultural identity. I 
realized that I was neither Scottish nor French Canadian. Talk about an identity 
crisis! Because Canada is not the melting pot that characterizes the United 
States, there is really no distinct Canadian culture. Therefore, I didn't consider 
myself to be a Canadian. I was a mixture, a part of three great nationalities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>After much deliberation I decided that the only way out of this dilemma was 
to combine the best parts of all three nations. To become a part of the French 
Canadian culture, to be accepted as an equal, I needed more of the expressions 
in daily use.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To accomplish this I spent the summer of 1981 working in a French 
children's camp. That summer was the turning point in my life. I not only 
picked up the oral requirements but also a large group of French Canadian 
friends.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I learned more about Scottish culture by reading books and poetry by 
Scottish authors, as well as the stories of the clans. I joined a curling club to get 
a taste of a Scottish sport and social gathering.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In order to become more of a Canadian, I relaxed my hard line views on 
independence for Quebec. I now try to picture Canada as a whole and am more 
sympathetic to the feelings of the people in other provinces.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I thought I was all set-I had satisfied my goals and those of my parents. The 
one thing I had forgotten to consider was my friends.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Each group of friends I had made in the past few years had accepted me in 
the way I related to them. I was the one who had adjusted easily to each group 
by simply changing my frame of mind and attitude to what each group was 
interested in and expected of me.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I went partying with my French Canadian friends, bar hopping with my 
anglophone high school buddies and was involved in intellectual stimulation 
with my university associates. Each world was different, yet I fitted easily into 
each one. What I had failed to consider was the interaction between the groups.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I soon discovered through trial and error that my old high school friends 
would not be accepted by my university buddies; nor would my English friends 
be accepted by my French Canadian friends and vice versa.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This created a situation which is similar to the problems of Quebec society 
today. Because of my personal experience, I feel French Canadians and English 
Canadians will never associate unless some concessions are made by both 
sides. We will always run into people of both cultures who will refuse to speak 
the other's language. There is animosity even within each cultural 
group-animosity caused by intellectual, social and economic differences.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If only we could learn from one another, if we would be willing to mingle, 
we could absorb a great deal by association. With understanding comes 
acceptance. Unfortunately the situation may not be resolved in my lifetime. To 
keep the peace, the cultures may have to remain apart.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I don't favour apartheid in the South African sense, where one culture is 
discriminated against on economic, social, political and colour levels. I do 
believe, however, that many cultures can coexist in one province as long as 
there is agreement on the equal value of each.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My plight is understandable. I enjoy the knowledge of many worlds, yet to 
keep harmony among them, I have to keep them separate. Therefore, in a sense, 
I am trapped in the middle of all three groups.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Because I can't combine all these worlds, despite the fact that each has so 
much to offer, I have to spend an equal amount of time in all of them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Although it is satisfying to experience the diversity, you can't give 100 per 
cent of what we have to share and at the same time receive 100 per cent of what 
everyone else has to offer. The basic explanation for someone in this dilemma 
is that you can be acquainted with many, but totally involved with none.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is another way of explaining and learning to live with loneliness.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	That is the end of Glenn's story in <I>The Dilemma of 
Multiculturalism</I>. We will notice in all the text there is no 
mention of dollars spent but one man's effort to become more 
familiar with his own identity, his own cultural roots, and to try 
to find a way in which he could fit into a culture in Quebec and 
still remain associated with the rest of Canada.
<P>
	I leave the story with the House without further analysis. I 
think it is worthy as a reflection on what it means to be a 
Canadian living in this country of ours today.
<P>
	I am going to move now to an experience I had as a member of 
the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage when we had one 
of our witnesses come to speak to us about the issue of 
multiculturalism. His name is Dr. Rais Khan and he addressed 
the issue, stating that both the act and the department were 
evidently intended to facilitate integration of the different 
cultural groups into the Canadian society. But the policy of 
multiculturalism has become subverted in this noble intent. It 
has encouraged ethnic and cultural groups to perpetuate their 
distinctiveness and has thus prevented them, even though 
inadvertently, from integrating into the mainstream of society. 
Official bilingualism has erected cultural barriers and gender 
discrimination and encouraged social ghettoization.
<P>
	Let me give an example of how multiculturalism goes wrong, 
an example with which my Liberal colleagues will most 
certainly agree, as did the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Multiculturalism gets twisted to such an extent that groups of 
individuals believe that by virtue of being a member of some 
identifiable group they deserve special funding and privileges. 
This is clear as was the case with the Writing Thru Race 
conference which was hosted in Vancouver by the Writers Union 
of Canada. This conference refused to allow anyone of 
non-colour to attend, that is to say whites were barred from 
attending a conference which received funding from the Canada 
Council. Thankfully the minister heeded my advice and took 
away part of their funding.
<P>
	Dr. Khan, as he continued in his presentation to our 
committee, explained:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The exotic multicultural concept of the everlasting immigrant has come to function 
as an institutional system for the marginalization of the individual. While this is not 
hopefully the intent of official multiculturalism, it certainly is its consequence. Culture 
is not only a selective demonstration of exotic events; it is how people live and interact 
with one another in their daily lives. Canada in the next century will not even have a 
dominant plurality. What is especially puzzling is why the advocates of 
multiculturalism, many of whom are so-called leaders of ethnic communities, have 
embraced such a discriminatory label. The misdirected and shortsighted actions and 
propositions in the name of official multiculturalism have generated mounting 
criticism of both its intent and direction. The voices of criticism come from both old 
Canadians and new ones, from intellectuals  and ivory tower academics, from writers of 
colour and those who lack colour, from respondents to several recent public opinion 
polls and from government appointed commissions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Dr. Khan also drew our attention to the Keith Spicer citizens' 
forum which, in recognition of the inherent deficiencies and 
drawbacks of official multiculturalism, called upon the 
Government of Canada to eliminate funding for multicultural 
activities except those serving immigration orientation, 
reduction of racial discrimination and promotion of equality.
<P>
	I believe this is the crux of the problem. Even the proponents 
of multiculturalism support the policy because in their view it 
contributes to immigration orientation, reduction of racial 
discrimination and promotion of equality.
<P>
	It is a curious situation of people from opposing 
spectrums-those who oppose multiculturalism as well as those 
who support it-agreeing to a common set of objectives.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	It is not just the Reform Party that has expressed what so many 
other voices are saying. The objectives that multiculturalism 
seek to promote are immigration, orientation, reduction of 
racial discrimination, enhanced participation and promotion of 
equality.
<P>
	These can be just as effectively achieved through the 
implementation of the provision of the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms supporting the Canadian Human Rights Commission 
and the acknowledgement of the opportunities offered through 
the Department of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	Special treatment to some at the expense of others is 
discriminatory in and of itself. No one is saying that ethnic 
groups should be suppressed in the Canadian context. Rather, 
our vision of Canada should be committed to the goal of social 
and personal well-being that values individuality while 
emphasizing themes like family, community assumption of 
responsibility, problem solving and communicating these value 
sets to a means of better group life. However at no time should 
the rights of a group supersede the rights of individuals unless 
the group happens to consist of a majority within Canada.
<P>
	As I said earlier, I have concentrated most of this presentation 
on multiculturalism because it is something about which all of 
us in the House feel deeply. I also have to say that I am looking 
forward to 1995. We definitely have challenges lying before us 
in the new year. My wish for all of us, as we enter the new year, is 
that we use our collective wisdom in the decision days of 1995 
that lie ahead of us.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
be splitting my time with the member for Oakville-Milton.
<P>
	On behalf of the Minister of Canadian Heritage I am pleased 
to have the occasion to speak on the third reading of Bill C-53, 
an act to establish the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Our debate has underscored the importance that the 
legislation be swiftly passed to establish in law the Department 
of Canadian Heritage. We are marrying programs that have been 
living together for more than a year. The departmental programs 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9131"> 9131 </A></B>
<P>
are working well. The job of Parliament is to formalize its name 
and its existence, enabling the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
and the department staff to carry out, in a single ministry, related 
mandates previously held by a number of separate government 
departments.
<P>
	In reference to why the Department of Canadian Heritage is so 
vital, we like to use the term synergy. We believe the combined 
impact of the whole of the department exceeds that of its 
individual parts. We believe the formation of the new 
department has enhanced and strengthened the effectiveness of 
many of its programs.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage brings together 
important common elements of the federal government, those 
elements which define Canada as a multifaceted dynamic nation 
with a rich cultural and natural heritage.
<P>
	The department is responsible for everything relating to 
Canadian identity and values, cultural development, heritage 
preservation, and areas of natural or historical significance to 
Canada and to Canadians, values that we share and that unite and 
define us.
<P>
	While the discussions concerning Bill C-53 have been 
interesting, many of the arguments put forward against the 
formation of the department are fundamentally flawed.
<P>
	Opposition members have tried to erect roadblocks in what 
should have been a routine legislative exercise. Those 
roadblocks were reduced to speed bumps as the necessity for the 
legislation became clear. It is an important and vital tool for the 
effective and efficient government Canadians want.
<P>
	The leader of the Reform Party of Canada has argued against 
Bill C-53. On December 7 he spoke before the Standing 
Committee of Canadian Heritage. He expressed the view that 
multiculturalism, one of the components of the new department, 
is the responsibility of individual private associations and, 
interestingly enough, where necessary lower levels of 
government: not the role of the federal government.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	Conversely, he also stated or asserted his belief that the 
federal government should confine itself to combating racial, 
linguistic and cultural discrimination. While as usual 
condemning the whole program, he supports most of our 
multicultural activities. He is the master of contradictions.
<P>
	Assisting all Canadians to participate in Canadian life and 
access the same rights helps them to contribute to and ultimately 
change society so that it reflects the lived experience of all 
Canadians. Yet there are always going to be individuals who will 
blame one identifiable group for whatever social or economic 
ills that disturb them.
<P>
	As the government and as individual Canadians, we must 
recognize that understanding and respect between peoples is 
central to combating racism and other forms of discrimination. 
We have to build that awareness into our social structure at all 
levels of society.
<P>
	At the federal level there is an important and essential 
leadership role to play. In its 1992 report the Canadian Human 
Rights Commission stated that ``economic hard times and 
human rights make uneasy bedfellows''.
<P>
	Tolerance for diversity and human difference becomes 
diminished during times of fiscal difficulty. In times like these 
the temptation is to make choices: economic over equality 
issues. If our mandate is to create opportunity then it must be for 
all and not just for the privileged, well positioned and fortunate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The criticisms of Bill C-53 voiced by the leader of the Reform 
Party clearly shows that his party's policies are not rooted in the 
life and the future of all Canadians.
<P>
	The minister's multiculturalism programs support a wide 
variety of activities which promote the integration of first 
generation Canadians, irrespective of their origin, into the 
social, cultural, economic and political life of Canada. We all 
benefit from the contribution of each Canadian to the growth 
and development of our country.
<P>
	The contribution of all Canadians is an integral part of the 
strength and diversity of Canadian culture. Culture is the very 
basis of Canadian identity and sovereignty. As a whole, the arts 
and our cultural industries contribute over $24 billion to the 
gross domestic product, and this is about 4 per cent of the GDP 
and 660,000 jobs. This is no accident; it is the result of the 
commitment and determination of successive governments, and 
of the enormous pool of talent in Canada. The Department of 
Canadian Heritage will be at the centre of government action in 
the area of arts and culture.
<P>
	To help artists and creators even more, the heritage minister 
announced an amendment to Bill C-53, which would give the 
department significant responsibilities in matters of copyright. 
Copyright legislation, which determines the ownership of works 
of art, is vitally important to artists and the income they derive 
from their work. This is a most timely measure for artists and 
creative artists, some among whom earn the lowest wages in the 
Canadian economy. This is a positive, effective and efficient 
change.
<P>
	Change is also part of the life experience of Canada's First 
Nations. Native culture is part of our history and our heritage, 
and it enriches the Canadian identity  significantly. At the 
present time, more than a million aboriginal Canadian citizens, 
members of our First Nations, are at a crossroad. In 1986, Bill 
Erasmus, then Grand Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, 
said that native people would have a lot to contribute in the next 
century. ``It is our turn'', he said.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="9132"> 9132 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage is a proud partner in 
this process, administering a number of important programs to 
support aboriginal citizens in defining and participating in 
addressing the social, cultural, political and economic issues 
affecting their lives in Canadian society.
<P>
	Aboriginal peoples launch and manage the programs which 
are community based and include such initiatives as the 
aboriginal friendship centre program, the northern native 
broadcast access program and the aboriginal women's program, 
aboriginal representative organization programs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	During the whole debate on this bill, Reform Party members 
have also expressed their opposition to the official and 
legislated recognition of both official languages in Canada. 
Canadians support the notion of two official languages for the 
very simple reason that these are the languages they speak and 
they are attached to them. For instance, in spite of the ever 
present threat of assimilation, minority francophone 
communities have gone from barely surviving to having their 
vested rights recognized. There is no way back.
<P>
	On the contrary, the government recently embarked on a 
process which is the logical and unavoidable consequence of its 
vision of linguistic duality and of its action in this area. This 
process is aimed at involving all federal institutions in the 
development of minority official language communities, in 
accordance with section 42 of the Official Languages Act.
<P>
	Obviously, the Department of Canadian Heritage is not the 
only institution able to play a critical role in the full 
development of official language communities. 
Interdepartmental consultation will help the machinery of 
government to promote the development of both official 
language communities, in every field of activity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians are open to the reality of the country with two 
official languages. The Reform Party opposition is a view that a 
majority of Canadians do not share. Sixty-four per cent of 
Canadians expressed support for the policy in an April 1994 
Angus Reid survey. Provincially, support ranges from 88 per 
cent in Quebec to 73 per cent in the Atlantic region and a solid 59 
per cent in Alberta. Over all, the last 10 years have witnessed 
stable and solid national support which continues both in 
principle and practice.
<P>
	In addition, if one considers on the one hand the progress of 
official language communities in minority situations, thanks to 
their determination and the commitment of government, and on 
the other hand the overall support of Canadians for the policy of 
official languages, it remains imperative to establish the 
Department of Canadian Heritage in law.
<P>
	Under its official language promotion programs, the 
department encourages not only the development of official 
language communities throughout the country, but also the 
recognition and use of both official languages in Canadian 
society as a whole. The strenghthening of our country's 
linguistic duality promises to improve opportunities for all. The 
Reform Party members would do well to recognize and accept 
this reality and join Canadians in the benefits accrued by it.
<P>
	I commend the member for Calgary Southwest who went to 
St. Jean last summer to learn French. But the question remains 
how the member can oppose official language funding but does 
not mind using official language funding.
<P>
	We all know that the 1993 reorganization of government was 
carried out with a view to streamlining the business of 
government and adapting the structure of government to 
improve the services it provides to the public. The aim of 
reorganization was to establish better, more efficient and more 
effective government. The Department of Canadian Heritage 
epitomizes that type of government.
<P>
	I urge my colleagues to recognize the role the Department of 
Canadian Heritage plays in promoting Canadian values and 
support the efforts of the public service.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member has 
about seven to eight minutes.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak at third reading of Bill C-53, an 
act to establish the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	As a member of the standing committee, I have had an 
opportunity to review the legislation and to hear firsthand 
accounts from witnesses. I believe this bill to be an accurate 
reflection of the mandate, activities and role of the department 
in fulfilling the mandate of the Government of Canada on 
several important fronts.
<P>
	The department's programs have an effect on our day to day 
lives and their relevance, be it cultural or economic, is felt by 
each of us. Within this department are the programs that speak to 
us regarding what it means to be Canadians, that set us apart 
from the rest of the world and that have helped Canada earn its 
top ranking by the United Nations for overall quality of life.
<P>
	The new Department of Canadian Heritage embodies the 
democratic principles that are inherently Canadian.  We are a 
nation forged on fundamental respect, respect for basic human 
rights and values, respect for the use and equal treatment of two 
major official languages, French and English, respect for 
cultur-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9133"> 9133 </A></B>
<P>
al diversity and respect for the traditions and contributions of 
our aboriginal peoples.
<P>
	Today countries throughout the world are trying to discover 
the formula that will enable them to create a real sense of 
national identity among groups of different ethnic, cultural, 
linguistic and racial backgrounds. Many of these countries are 
now taking a serious interest in the 100 per cent Canadian model 
we have created which exemplifies respect for each other no 
matter what our backgrounds.
<P>
	In the bill creating this department, the government 
undertakes to advance the equality of all Canadians in their 
country's social, economic and cultural life. It recognizes the 
need to eliminate the barriers that divide Canadians and to 
provide opportunity to establish bonds built on confidence and 
mutual respect.
<P>
	We know that social cohesion and a strong national identity 
can only be accomplished where there is understanding, 
awareness and respect among all the people who make up our 
country.
<P>
	As the Right Hon. Lester Pearson put it: ``In a diverse federal 
state such as Canada it is important that all citizens should have 
a fair and equal opportunity to participate in the national 
administration and to identify themselves with and feel at home 
in our national capital''.
<P>
	I am proud to be a member of this Liberal government that 
believes in tolerance among its citizens and which strives to 
ensure that people of all origins who come to Canada have an 
equal opportunity to contribute to its growth, development and 
an evolving sense of identity.
<P>
	Our diversity is one of the things that makes us stronger and 
more competitive in the global economy. The range of 
languages we speak, the cultures we know and understand 
provide us as Canadians with a distinct advantage from an 
international trade perspective. This has been recognized by the 
president of the Royal Bank who indicated that our future 
success as a nation depends on our harnessing the richness of 
diversity within the country so that we can become truly 
competitive in the global marketplace.
<P>
	Dr. Barbara Ward, the British economist and writer, described 
us as the world's first international nation. We are admired 
abroad for the society we have built together and we can take 
real national pride in this accomplishment.
<P>
	This bill provides the government with an opportunity to 
forge ahead in an area which has proven to be of real importance 
to Canadians time and time again. They want a government that 
will lead them forward in building a society that encourages all 
its citizens to contribute economically, politically, socially and 
culturally to all aspects of life in this great country of ours.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
Bill C-53 certainly has given rise to a lot of criticism for a bill 
that was supposed to be a simple housekeeping measure.
<P>
	It must have become quite obvious by now that the Official 
Opposition is dead against this bill. And our reasons for 
opposing it are far from cosmetic. They have to do mainly with 
the very essence of our cultural identity as Quebecers as well as 
the necessity of ensuring the survival of our culture through a 
sensible handling of the copyright issue.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	First of all, after education and postsecondary education, the 
federal government has now extended its involvement to mass 
communication, even though this is clearly an area of provincial 
jurisdiction. In fact, the federal government is centralizing more 
and more, and this bill is but one example. That is why we 
denounce the deceit in calling the department to be established 
the ``Department of Canadian Heritage'', when this is just a 
disguised way of establishing a department of culture and to 
invade a provincial jurisdiction. The people of Quebec wonder 
why they should contribute financially to a scheme to deny that 
Quebec is different, unique, as a nation, when even the 
staunchest federalists in Quebec recognize this fact.
<P>
	My hon. colleagues will be reminded that, equipped with 
international agreements, English Canada is now in a position to 
counter cultural invasion from the U.S. This is a totally 
legitimate concern, seeing how important it is to differentiate 
oneself from such a powerful neighbour and to manage one's 
cultural resources. But why can Quebec not have similar 
concerns? Why would the government not feel the need to also 
do something to protect the rights of creative artists on its 
territory?
<P>
	Following government reorganization, copyright, which used 
to be with the Department of Communications and the 
Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, would now 
come under the Department of Canadian Heritage and the 
Department of Industry. Instead of using this restructuring as an 
opportunity to concentrate copyright responsibilities at the 
heritage department, which is the only one mandated to protect 
the work and its creators, the government persists in its 
paralysing indecision with regard to copyright.
<P>
	Such dichotomy only leads to divergent political priorities, 
especially when the officials of the two departments involved 
see the issue in totally different lights.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9134"> 9134 </A></B>
<P>
	For instance, Paul Racine, Assistant Deputy Minister, 
Cultural Development, told the Canadian heritage committee: 
``-the fact is that the minister and the department set all 
copyright policies and oversee the drafting work-as was done 
in the past and will be done in the future with Phase 2. In other 
words, they do all the work from A to Z. As I told you, this 
was recognized by previous Prime Ministers through repeated 
formal ministerial delegation and it is, in my opinion, 
recognized in law for the first time through this amendment. 
It is a matter of fact. Whoever gets the ingredients, cooks and 
serves them may or may not be called a chef, but he or she 
certainly bears a close resemblance to one''.
<P>
	However, there appears to be several chiefs, as Mr. Von 
Finckenstein, Deputy Minister at Industry Canada, told the 
Standing Committee on Industry something quite different. He 
said: ``Before the merger, copyright was in the Department of 
Communications and the Department of Consumer and 
Corporate Affairs, together with all other intellectual property, 
be it patent, trademarks or copyright. This whole division has 
now gone to Industry. It has not been broken up or changed. The 
people in charge of copyright are the people who once worked 
for CCA on this matter. As for their mandate, which is to 
develop copyright policy, the Minister of Industry is indeed 
ultimately responsible for the application of the law and for 
amending it, but policy decisions are obviously made at the 
cabinet level, where the Minister of Canadian Heritage, for 
instance, can put forward the cultural point of view''. That is 
what Mr. von Finckenstein said.
<P>
	Therefore it is total confusion, the department of tutti frutti, 
as my colleague from Rimouski-Témiscouata calls it. Even the 
officials do not know who really is responsible for the Copyright 
Act.
<P>
	The government is supporting a myth and confusion by letting 
people believe that the heritage department plays the leading 
role with respect to copyright, when the real power clearly 
resides in the industry department.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	It must be noted that the deadlock blocking revision of the 
Copyright Act is partly due to conflict between two ideologies: 
protecting the creative artist vs. protecting the consumer. 
Performing artists, creative artists and copyright holders do not 
benefit from this division; rather it is those whose concerns have 
nothing to do with cultural development, values and identity.
<P>
	Furthermore, it is totally unacceptable and far-fetched to put 
the Copyright Act, which protects the economic and moral 
rights of creative artists and the holders of these rights, under 
the Department of Industry. It is ridiculous to put copyrights on 
the same level as trade-marks, patents, industrial designs and 
integrated circuit topographies, as in paragraph 4(1)(<I>h</I>) of Bill 
C-46.
<P>
	Those who propose that copyrights be under the sole 
jurisdiction of the Minister of Industry are wrong. Such a 
decision would greatly jeopardize cultural creativity in Quebec 
and in Canada. Obviously, the cultural sector is an industry, in 
the sense that it generates an important economic activity, but it 
is certainly not an industry like the other ones.
<P>
	Cultural development depends on the Copyright Act, which 
allows artists to be associated with the economic life of their 
works. Consequently, if the current apathy persists, it could 
seriously hurt a very important cultural industry. The 
government approves enormous budgets to defend and promote 
Canadian identity. Is it not high time this government 
recognized the cultures which are part of that identity and are its 
very foundations, and show some respect for the artists who 
shape these cultures?
<P>
	The government's apathy is all the more incomprehensible 
considering that the Liberal Party often insisted that even 
though culture generates economic activity, it cannot be treated 
like other industries. Moreover, the Liberals pledged, in their 
red book, to support production, marketing and distribution, so 
as to promote the circulation of Canadian books, films and 
recordings on the domestic market, to consider allowing 
investment tax credits to stimulate the production of such 
works, and also to consider the possibility of providing income 
averaging mechanisms in the Income Tax Act, for Canadian 
artists. However, the Quebec and Canadian cultural industries, 
and the artists, are still waiting.
<P>
	Also, in answer to questions from the Canadian Conference of 
the Arts, the Liberal Party pledged, during the last election 
campaign, to review the Copyright Act and ensure above all that 
authors get their dues, while facilitating access to material 
protected by copyright. The Liberals claimed to understand the 
importance of copyright. It made a commitment to restructure 
the administrative organization and review the Conservative 
decision to split this jurisdiction between two departments. But 
again, our artists are still waiting!
<P>
	These facts and the delayed amendment minister Dupuy put 
forward when he appeared before the committee show the lack 
of interest and the total lack of respect of the government for 
Quebec and Canadian artists and cultures. Allow me to describe 
the disrespectful attitude shown by Liberal members of the 
committee. I have already mentioned the last minute 
amendment put forward by the Minister of Heritage.
<P>
	One of the committee members, a loyal and faithful Liberal, 
said that, when the amendment was proposed, everyone in the 
room applauded and commended the minister's decision. Not 
so, Madam Speaker! The members of the other parties did not 
applaud. The people representing the artists did not applaud 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9135"> 9135 </A></B>
<P>
either, especially since the same hon. member had just finished 
saying that these people had ``pleaded'' with the  committee to 
have the opportunity to present their very legitimate requests. 
What a respectful attitude for the government members to have!
<P>
	The artist are, in fact, far from satisfied with the minister's 
amendment. That is what they told us. Several associations from 
both Quebec and English Canada, who were able to appear 
before the Committee on Canadian Heritage because of pressure 
by members of the Bloc Quebecois, told us they were 
disappointed with and concerned about the attitude of the 
government.
<P>
	Twenty-five Quebec and Canadian associations, representing 
more than 30,000 writers, creative artists and performers, sent 
an open letter to the Minister of Heritage asking to complete the 
review of the Copyright Act, in light of the following nine 
recommendations: the confirmation of the creative artist as the 
first holder of the rights to his or her work; the recognition of 
neighbouring rights; the adjudication of consequential rights to 
visual artists; the protection of works for the rest of the life of 
the author or the copyright holder; the use of technologically 
neutral definitions; compensation through private copy; the 
establishment of a rental right; the elimination of all exceptions 
to the protection of works; the adoption of adequate sanctions to 
protect the rights of creative artists.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	These demands are far from being unreasonable since 
numerous countries have included them in their legislation. 
Germany, Japan and France have all adhered to the 1961 Rome 
Convention, but Canada has not. These G-7 countries have 
recognized the need for royalties on private copy, but Canada 
has not. France and Germany have legislated on neighbouring 
rights, but Canada has not; it does not seem to find it appropriate 
to do so.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would say that it is through copyright and 
neighbouring rights that creative artists and copyright holders 
can ensure the continuity of their creative work by receiving just 
compensation for the use of their work. The present situation has 
to change. Not only is this situation unacceptable in the context 
of a society that claims to respect the people who are the source 
of its cultural heritage, but its national and international 
notoriety makes it embarrassing for Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	This government will soon prove to us that it sees culture only 
as a symbol that can generate money.
<P>
	The least we can say is that, with such a policy and such a 
government, the future is certainly not bright for the pillars of 
Canada's and Quebec's cultures. Let us be realistic and not 
mince words: the government is showing once again that it is 
totally incapable of taking a stand in favour of artists and 
understanding the interests of creative artists.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to comment on 
the speech made by the hon. member for Québec.
<P>
	I would like to know her definition of a Quebecer. I often hear 
the Quebec nation defined as including the English, the Irish and 
the Scots. Does it include the Jews and other groups or are we 
talking about old French Canadian families exclusively? I 
would appreciate her comments on this definition. How does she 
see the Quebec nation?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, I am a little surprised the 
hon. member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine should 
ask this question. As a Quebecer himself, he ought to know.
<P>
	A Quebecer is, first of all, someone who lives in Quebec and 
is defined as such by his language and culture. I am not going to 
make a long speech about what it means to be a Quebecer. If the 
hon. member has trouble explaining what it means to him to be a 
Quebecer, then he is the one who has a problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, I have no trouble defining 
what I am and explaining who I am.
<P>
	However, in this debate on Quebec nationalism, which has 
been going on for some time, there are people who claim that 
Quebec includes all minorities. But all I keep hearing from the 
opposition is that there are Quebecers whose ancestors settled 
here long ago and that the partnership and participation of other 
cultures has become irrelevant.
<P>
	I am not asking the hon. member to tell me where I fit in but to 
tell me whether the English, the Irish and all other minorities are 
part of Quebec as we know it today. That is all I want to know.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, a Quebecer is someone who 
believes in Quebec values. He believes he can identify himself 
as a Quebecer. A Quebecer is someone who travels. I heard Mr. 
Dupuy say that when he is in Canada, he says he is from Quebec, 
and when he is in another country, he says he is from Canada.
<P>
	I have no trouble identifying myself. When I travel 
throughout the world, and I have had several opportunities to do 
so, when I am outside my country, outside Quebec, I say I am a 
Quebecer. When I say I am a Quebecer, people realize I am a 
francophone, because outside Canada, people know there is a 
francophone majority living in Canada. This is a way of 
identifying myself as a Quebecer.
<P>
	A Quebecer is also someone who believes in his or her values. 
I think Quebec must have all the tools it needs to be able to 
decide its future.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Centralizing all decision-making authority and standardizing 
all programs the way the government is doing today is not going 
to help Quebec find its identity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9136"> 9136 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Five minutes left for 
questions and comments. Any more comments?
<P>
	Resuming debate. The hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, of course I intend to support 
the government's new proposals for Canada's cultural sector.
<P>
	When I hear the opposition condemning the very existence of 
Canada and the fact that Canada has done nothing for the French 
fact, I think that is absolutely untrue and unacceptable. Some 
people are looking for a definition of the Canadian nation, and it 
seems that originally, Canada was a word that meant ``village'' 
in one of the aboriginal languages. A village is a community 
where people live together, and these people have worked 
together to build a country.
<P>
	I may remind the opposition that this Canada, this village we 
have created is the envy of the world. I could refer again to the 
view shared by the United Nations that Canada still ranks first as 
the best country to live in.
<P>
	Consider how Canada developed. The first colonists who 
came to Canada wanted to make a new life for themselves. My 
ancestors, as those of the member for Quebec with whom I share 
the same surname, landed on the île d'Orléans in 1642. My 
ancestor, Maturin Gagnon, one of the first French settlers, 
wanted to start a new life. Obviously, through the years, there 
has been many changes and historical upsets, but I believe that 
Canada and its very existence as a country, has made it possible 
for the Canadian Francophonie to thrive.
<P>
	I believe that this fact must not be ignored. I believe that the 
nature of Canada, as a state, resides in its linguistic duality, and 
the generous reception given to the cultures which have 
contributed to the development and the building of this structure 
called Canada. Among those who came were the Irish, the Scots, 
the Jews, the Asians and the Europeans, to name a few. People 
from 160 countries have contributed, in one way or another, to 
the creation and the building of the Canadian federation.
<P>
	There are 6 million francophones in Quebec, more than one 
million of whom are new Quebecers, and anglophones who also 
contributed to the development of Quebec, as part of Canada, of 
course. Everybody was the better for it: Montreal became the 
first metropolis of the Canadian federation. The river brought 
people to Montreal, but I do not want to focus on the past, I want 
to speak of the future. This is the spirit of a true Canadian: 
someone who looks towards the next century.
<P>
	And there are over half a million francophones in Ontario. A 
third of the population of New Brunswick is made up of 
francophones. There are tens of thousands of francophones in 
Manitoba and in the western provinces. They are there, they 
exist, they are counting on the support of francophones in 
Quebec to keep this country united.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	I would go even further. Unfortunately, nationalists never 
take into account the contributions of francophones outside 
Quebec. Carmen Roy was not even mentioned. There is Angèle 
Arsenault, Édith Butler, even Roch Voisine. These are 
francophones outside Quebec who not only ensure in some way 
the French presence outside Quebec but could also be 
considered as some of the greatest figures of French culture in 
Canada.
<P>
	I told you about the francophones outside Quebec but not 
about the success of bilingualism. Some vainly tried to prove 
quasi scientifically that bilingualism does not work. But there 
are more than 4.4 million Canadians who master both languages. 
I had the opportunity to go to Vancouver, where I made a speech 
to young people who, much to my surprise, spoke a more than 
proper French. This was music to my ear. I also received well 
written correspondence in French.
<P>
	We must not forget that, in 1977, 237 schools offered an 
immersion program to 37,835 students. In 1988-these are 
Anglophone students registered in immersion programs-there 
were 1,500 schools and 241,140 students. Within ten years, 
bilingual and immersion programs increased by 700 per cent. I 
think what makes French so vital and attractive is the growing 
interest of many young English Canadians for the beautiful 
language of Molière.
<P>
	Certain people have attempted to minimize and trivialize the 
efforts made by some provinces, but they overlooked the fact 
that more than 27,000 students in British Columbia, more than 
26,000 in Alberta, 18,000 in Manitoba, and even 115,000 in 
Ontario go to immersion schools. It is very interesting to travel 
in English Canada and meet these young people who were able 
to benefit from this program. And believe me, Madam Speaker, 
these young people are very grateful for it.
<P>
	Canada has an international reputation as a leader, for the way 
it treats its minorities, be they francophones outside Quebec or 
anglophones in Quebec. Of course, there are other minorities 
and, to me, this makes the strength of this country. This diversity 
of cultures, this meeting place of ideas, Madam Speaker, that is 
what Canada is all about.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> They do not even have washrooms.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Well, my friend, let me tell you something 
about washrooms. In the Magdalen Islands, there is a small 
English school for which the province of Quebec is responsible 
but it refuses to grant the money needed to rebuild this school 
used by English-speaking children. The school has water and 
electrical problems and the window panes are broken. It no 
longer meets the needs of the population but unfortunately the 
Government of Quebec is waiting for the Government of Canada 
to foot the bill and build a school for these English-speaking 
children. That is how some minorities are treated in Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9137"> 9137 </A></B>
<P>
	But enough of that. I invite the members of the opposition 
to go to Grosse-Île, in the Magdalen Islands, and see for 
themselves in what condition that small English school is today. 
I am sure the story would make the front page of Quebec 
newspapers.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	We were talking about a meeting place of ideas. We know that 
English is spoken by more than 800 million people in the world 
and that there are more than 20 million who speak it right here 
Canada. That is where this meeting place of ideas, new found 
solidarity comes from. That is what we find in Canada. When 
you have a chance to travel, as I have had the privilege of doing 
for decades, you can always appreciate the bilingualism, the 
biculturalism, the openness and tolerance of Canada. This is 
something we must never forget.
<P>
	When I see how weak the nationalist philosophy, the 
separatist philosophy is, I find it sad that they do not realize that 
it is because of the federal presence that Quebec has been able to 
find its identity. We never hear the opposition talk about the 
contribution of the Canadian government to Telefilm Canada, 
the National Film Board, the CBC or independent productions. 
We never hear the opposition talk about that. All it does is 
constantly deny the facts and knock what makes this country 
what it is.
<P>
	There is much to be done and I think it is interesting that the 
learning of the second language, as I have said earlier-in 
survey after survey, we realize that more than 75 per cent of 
Canadians are in favour of institutional bilingualism.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> You should come to my riding 
and see if that is the case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, it is the hon. member of the 
opposition who should come to my riding.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am going to turn to the English language. I have been 
privileged and I hope I am sharing this with a number of other 
young Canadians. I have seen here a number of anglophones 
who have names like McClarty, McPherson, who have names 
that are of Asian origin, who are now taking the leap toward 
bilingualism, who are now moving beyond bilingualism because 
they can now master three and four languages. That is the 
strength of Canada.
<P>
	It is a privilege to speak in this forum today in both official 
languages because bilingualism is not only a tool for our 
regional and economic development but is also a part of who we 
are. In doing so we now can pick from the French culture, from 
the English culture, from the other cultures around the world 
that have come here to work as one. That is one of the 
fundamental issues that will be discussed in the upcoming 
Quebec referendum.
<P>
	It will be up to the separatists to prove that Canada does not 
work. I am from the Gaspé peninsula which is 96 per cent French 
speaking. I attended French schools but I had the opportunity of 
mingling with English friends. I have had the opportunity of 
moving on. I have had the opportunity of exchanging with all 
Canadians from all walks of life. There is not one person in 
Canada I have met whom I do not like.
<P>
	I think Canadians are understanding. We are a tolerant society 
and regrettably the opposition, including some members from 
the Reform Party, is not aware of the fortitude, of the fact that 
being a Canadian is more than a privilege, it is something other 
countries wish they had.
<P>
	Obviously the opposition will have the opportunity to react, 
not only following this speech but in the upcoming referendum.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Start with liking Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> ``Start with liking Quebecers''-Madam 
Speaker, can you beat that? It bothers them to hear a young 
person like me identify himself as a Canadian of French origin, a 
Canadian who went to the trouble of learning the second 
language, who took the trouble to travel, visit and study with 
English Canadians. Sometimes it hurts the separatists to hear 
that. Unfortunately, we live in a changing world and 
unfortunately the opposition is unable to meet the challenge of 
Canadian federalism.
<P>
	I have heard all kinds of speeches from the opposition, on 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, St. Laurent, on real 
French Canadians, good Canadians who built and implemented 
programs from which I benefit.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	This brings me to an important point on the official languages 
in Canada. Let us look at the efforts made by Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau to have the French fact recognized, to be served-yes, 
maybe not as well as we would like in Bonaventure or Montreal 
or other places-but I think this recognition of the French fact 
by the rest of Canada, of the existence of French, and promoting 
the language-it is an incredible achievement of our Liberal 
predecessors.
<P>
	Let us talk about another great Canadian, a great Quebecer-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> René Lévesque.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> René Lévesque. You have it: René Lévesque, 
who grew up about 30 kilometres from my home town of New 
Carlisle, in the Gaspe peninsula.
<P>
	Like René Lévesque, I come from Gaspe but, unfortunately, 
none of us can pretend to be Gaspesians first and foremost. This 
is very interesting. I can tell you that: René Lévesque was 
among the first to recognize the importance of speaking both 
French and English. He was open to the world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9138"> 9138 </A></B>
<P>
	I must say, however, that it is thanks to Pierre Elliott Trudeau 
and those who followed in his footsteps that Canada has become 
the country that we know today.
<P>
	I will not talk much long longer because I am anxious to hear 
the slanderous and malicious criticisms of the opposition 
throughout the afternoon. I challenge the opposition to find a 
better country than Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Quebec is part of Canada. No independent 
country enjoys a reputation such as that of Canada. 
Unfortunately, we only hear hogwash from the opposition. And 
that is unfortunate.
<P>
	I invite opposition members to make a comparison. I am 
speaking to you as a Quebecer, a Gaspe native, a francophone. I 
am asking you to take into account the efforts made on this side 
of the House, to recognize the efforts made by this party, the 
efforts made by some English-speaking members.
<P>
	I see the hon. member for Ontario, who is an 
English-speaking Canadian. I do not always share his views, but 
here is a young man who went to the trouble of learning French. 
There are others too. I do not know them all, but several have 
made the effort. I believe this is the beauty of our country. This 
is what makes it interesting.
<P>
	We will overcome each of the obstacles set up by the 
opposition, starting with the upcoming referendum.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I wonder in what country my colleague from 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine lives. It must be a country 
somewhat different from ours.
<P>
	I too live in Canada. I must agree with him that, as long as the 
referendum is not a done deal, I still live in a country called 
Canada. I think he does not live in the same country as the rest of 
us, because he may speak English, but he does not read it. Last 
week-end, there was an article in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> depicting 
the bilingual situation and the assimilation level of 
French-speaking Canadians. I referred to it this morning in my 
speech, and I believe the hon. member was here at the time.
<P>
	The assimilation rate throughout Canada is 36 per cent. 
Bilingualism is highly praised and my colleague can be proud to 
be Canadian as much as he wants to. He has the right to be proud, 
I do not deny it. But what is surprising is the fact that he does not 
better understand the country, or the part of the country he 
comes from.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	He told us about a school in the Magdalen Islands which was 
in bad shape, but he must not forget that Quebec is just getting 
out of its torpor after nine years under a Liberal government. 
Liberals were in office for nine years. So, if the people in the 
Magdalen Islands were not able to fix the windows in their 
schools or make any renovations, it is because of the Liberal 
government which has been ousted in Quebec. There is no doubt 
that Mr. Garon, to whom we will forward your complaints, will 
hasten to find a way to solve this problem, because he has solved 
many problems in other small schools.
<P>
	The hon. member said he had never heard the official 
opposition make any positive comments about federalism, but I 
think all my colleagues have heard me say how much we owe to 
the CBC. That corporation helped us get out of the hole and 
believe in what we were. It also helped us define what we were 
and get over the Dark Ages in Quebec, all thanks to a great 
Liberal federalist, Jean Lesage, who was a federal minister here, 
in Ottawa, before returning to Quebec to tell us: ``Come on, 
Quebecers! Let us be masters in our own house!''
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, it is always a pleasure to 
discuss with the hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata. I 
think she does have a lot of respect for my region, for the Gaspe 
peninsula, and for the problems, mainly economic, that we have 
in my constituency of Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I do not agree with her option, which is 
legitimate in a way-Quebec's separation. But as a federalist, I 
will tell you that the CBC's achievements she talked about are 
precisely the result of co-operation among all Canadians, 
between anglophones over there, anglophones over here and 
francophones across the way. That is what has made and will 
continue to make the strength of Canada.
<P>
	That is why, with the recognition of the CBC's achievements, 
and the commitment of the federal government to defend, 
promote and ensure the development of the French fact in 
Canada, the next century is most promising for Canadian unity.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
let me remind the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine that we are paying 25 per 
cent of the CBC budget, but we cannot say that the English 
network is of much use to us. I would like to go back to the 
remarks made by the hon. member, who said that all official 
opposition's comments were hogwash.
<P>
	I think the hon. member has no respect for the vote of 
confidence given the elected members of the Bloc Quebecois, 
for the mandate they were given to come to Ottawa to work after 
Quebec's interests. That is exactly what we are doing today, 
defending Quebec's interests. I think the hon. member does not 
respect our mandate.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9139"> 9139 </A></B>
<P>
	After all, we are a majority in Quebec, a majority of Quebec 
MPs. I hope very many Quebecers will have heard the hon. 
member say in this House today that our comments are only 
hogwash and I hope they will draw their own conclusions from 
his disrespectful remarks.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Downright insulting.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> It is not the first time I hear the hon. member 
speak that way. He talks as if the world revolves around him. He 
is the centre of the universe and says: ``Just look at me; I am 
well-travelled, I am fantastic.''
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Yes, he is an only child.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> I do not think it is fitting for a member of this 
House to say: ``Just look at me; I am well-travelled, I am 
fantastic''.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Yes, indeed. ``Look at me. I have risen to 
the top of the heap''.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon: </B>A member should represent the public, be the 
voice of the people. The people of Quebec have given us a vote 
of confidence and sent us to Ottawa to defend their interests.
<P>
	We defend positions that are not being defended by federalists 
living in Quebec, who want to repatriate powers, who want full 
control in Quebec. We did not invent that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, I think it is uncalled for to call 
someone-I will not repeat the words that were used to describe 
me.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	I am criticized for having the intellectual curiosity to be 
interested in what is happening elsewhere and for wanting to 
share this with Quebecers. I have always recognized the 
existence of the Official Opposition. It hurts them to hear this 
voice from the Gaspe, this young federalist, because, and you 
know this as well as I do, we represent the majority of 
Quebecers.
<P>
	Look at the results of the last election in Quebec. Scarcely 44 
per cent of Quebecers supported the Parti Quebecois. 
Unfortunately, the opposition, and especially its home base, are 
not so sure they want to have their referendum as soon as 
possible. Increasingly, Quebecers are recognizing Canada's role 
and the generosity of the Canadian federation.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Token Quebecer.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Opportunist.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> I hear terms being used like ``token Quebecer'' 
and ``opportunist''. I hear all kinds of things from the 
opposition. I am proud to be the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, I have the confidence of 
my riding and I am working in the best interests of my 
constituents, and this means being in Quebec, a Quebec that is 
part of Canada. Is that clear?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being nearly 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing 
Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to Statements by 
Members pursuant to Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at 
yesterday's meeting of the House of Commons Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food I tabled a report 
entitled ``Future Directions for Canadian Agriculture and 
Agri-Food: A Huron-Bruce Perspective''.
<P>
	This report is the result of a series of intensive meetings 
which I organized in my riding with the objective of taking stock 
of where those who work in the agri-food sector today see their 
industry going tomorrow.
<P>
	It was designed to support and enhance the objectives of the 
study on the future of agriculture on which the committee, 
together with its colleagues from the Senate, has been working 
since August, and which as a result of those who claim to 
represent the interests of the grassroots community has been 
effectively blocked from undertaking its most important phase, 
consulting directly with Canadians who work in Canada's 
agri-food sector in their workplaces.
<P>
	I would encourage all members to initiate something along 
these lines to complement the work that is being done for what is 
after all one of Canada's major bedrock industries.

Mr. Speaker, last week, in its Saturday issue, <I>The Globe and

	In fact, francophones have never been so vulnerable. More

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for 14 
months now the Minister of Finance has been utterly unable to 
convince his Cabinet colleagues to take the measures necessary 
to bring about a substantial reduction in his deficit.
<P>
	In an attempt to fulfill their commitments and reduce the 
deficit to 3 per cent of the GDP, Liberal members are proposing 
to further increase the burden of taxpayers, who are already 
weighed down with taxes, particularly those in the middle class.
<P>
	Given that now is the time when taxpayers make decisions 
about the amounts they will invest in RRSPs, would the minister 
simply take advantage of this final question period to reassure 
worried taxpayers by undertaking publicly not to tax RRSPs in 
his next budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for 
Roberval knows very well that we will have to wait for the 
budget. The Minister of Finance is not really in a position to 
make budget announcements here, in the House, even if 
Christmas is approaching. We will have to wait until the end of 
February.
<P>
	That being said, I am sure the member will admit that if we 
wish to meet our objectives, cuts will have to be made. It would 
be of great help if his party would make constructive 
suggestions on exactly where we should cut.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
being the festive season, I will cordially remind the Minister of 
Finance that we have been suggesting tax expenditure cuts for 
more than a year now. What I cannot understand is why he does 
not implement our suggestions. We will make some more before 
the holidays, if he wants to keep an ear out.
<P>
	I will even offer him a suggestion today. The national 
Treasury should make a priority of recovering $6.6 billion in 
unpaid taxes owed to the government. We are not talking about 
people who have paid their taxes, but about unpaid taxes 
totalling $6.6 billion. Since he should first recover this amount, 
could the Minister of Finance then undertake not to look at 
taxing group dental and medical plans, which have a particular 
impact on families?

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, despite repeated efforts on this side of the 
House the Bloc still does not understand what accounts 
receivable are.
<P>
	In the accounts receivable there are many Canadians who are 
having difficulty paying on time, but who have made 
arrangements with the government to pay over a period of time. 
They owe us money. No question. They pay it back with interest.
<P>
	Also in that accounts receivable are certain Canadians who 
dispute tax questions with us. They say we do not owe as much 
as you say. When we examine their documents we often discover 
that they are right. I certainly do not think we should be 
collecting money from Canadians who do not owe it to us.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	The accounts receivable are exactly that. We are coming off a 
bad recessionary period, the Tory recession. We are coming on 
to the margin recovery. We are doing all we can to help 
Canadians who are having difficulty and who are now getting 
back on their feet.
<P>
	The last thing we are going to do is force them into 
receivership and bankruptcy by the policies adopted by the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it may 
be that I do not understand what an account receivable is at 
Revenue Canada, but the Auditor General of Canada and I think 
alike. Neither of us understand. These members do not 
understand and neither does the public. The minister is the only 
one to understand.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Let me get back to my question to 
the Minister of Finance, Mr. Speaker. Perhaps I will get a serious 
answer. Does the Minister of Finance see the commitment his 
Prime Minister made during the election campaign not to raise 
taxes for two years, a solemn commitment made to all 
Canadians, as a commitment that should be honoured? And if so, 
why does he not come out and say so clearly, today, instead of 
letting uncertainty hang over the heads of taxpayers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, more to the point, 
we have to ask ourselves: is our tax system, here, in Canada, 
entirely fair? Or does it have loopholes, a point that some of the 
hon. member's colleagues have already raised? Are there 
loopholes that should not be looked at?
<P>
	If, contrary to his colleagues, the hon. member is of the 
opinion that the system is perfectly fair, that no changes are 
required, fine, no changes will be made in the next budget, but 
we think that the system is not entirely fair and that changes will 
be required. We certainly intend to assume our responsibilities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was happy to hear the Prime Minister admit that there 
are tax inequities. This, incidentally, is one of the proposals he 
will find in the report submitted to him by the Official 
Opposition, which suggests 10 ways to reduce his deficit 
problem. I would ask him to read these recommendations, which 
were tabled in both official languages about two weeks ago. It 
may be time for him to read them.
<P>
	In order to meet their commitment to reduce the deficit to 3 
per cent of GDP by 1996-97, the Liberal members on the finance 
committee are proposing higher taxes for all taxpayers through a 
supposedly temporary surtax. The Official Opposition, 
however, believes that the deficit can be substiantially reduced 
without raising personal income tax, by making vigorous efforts 
to collect unpaid taxes and cut spending, including 
inappropriate tax expenditures.
<P>
	Instead of raising taxes for all taxpayers, will the Minister of 
Finance finally decide to fairly and seriously consider all the 
proposals made by the Official Opposition to help him cut the 
deficit in an intelligent way?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, first of all, yes, I 
did read the Bloc Quebecois's report. I can assure the hon. 
member that we intend to consider these recommendations 
carefully. It should, however, be pointed out to the hon. member 
that these recommendations would help us with only a tiny 
portion of the $42 billion deficit. I would ask the hon. member if 
he could make suggestions that will really help us solve the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would calmly remind the Minister of Finance that, 
based on our calculations, which he has not contradicted, our 
10-point proposal would amount to about $15 billion in cuts and 
savings of all kinds and in new taxes that would make rich 
Canadians pay their fair share, if they do not already. I would 
invite him to reassess our proposals.
<P>
	I put my supplementary question to the Deputy Prime 
Minister. Does she intend to reprimand her finance minister, as 
the Prime Minister did yesterday on the issue of high interest 
rates, so that the finance minister will reject the idea of a surtax 
that would hit all taxpayers, which would be totally inconsistent 
with the Prime Minister's own election commitment?

Quebecois just said that it has given us suggestions in terms of 
deficit reduction of some $15 billion. I hate to contradict their 
mathematics, but the number is nowhere near that. In fact it is 
not even one third of that.
<P>
	That being said, what really must be done in this House by the 
opposition, and indeed the Reform Party have done it in part and 
have said they are going to do it before the budget, is to give us a 
comprehensive plan. It is quite easy to make great speeches. It is 
quite easy to set out targets with no background. But what is 
very, very difficult is to do the line by line study that allows us to 
deal with the profound structural problems of our economy and 
the way that governments spend.
<P>
	In the month and a half that the opposition is going to have off, 
I would invite them to sit down and really work up a proper plan 
so that when we come down with the budget we can have an 
intelligent debate.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the SIRC report on the Bristow affair brought forward 
this morning is a whitewash. It does not adequately address the 
Reform Party's primary concern, namely that a paid agent of the 
former Progressive Conservative government allegedly tried to 
build links between Reform and extremist groups for the 
purposes of discrediting Reform in an election.
<P>
	The Mulroney-Campbell administration may or may not have 
known what Grant Bristow was doing but they were certainly 
aware of his activities and they were in a position to use that 
information for political advantage.
<P>
	Will the Solicitor General tell this House why SIRC did not 
more thoroughly investigate this particular concern and what he 
intends to do about it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Security Intelligence Review Committee was 
created by an act of Parliament, adopted by this House and the 
other place, to operate at arm's length from CSIS, at arm's 
length from the minister, at arm's length from the government. 
In short, it operates very much like a permanent commission of 
inquiry. It presented its report. I tabled that report in the House 
today.
<P>
	I understand the hon. leader's question. However, I think that 
question would best be put to SIRC itself. I understand its 
members are appearing before a subcommittee of the justice 
committee tomorrow. That would be a very good vehicle for 
asking such questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, sections of the SIRC report read like a who's who of the 
Tory party. Their names are sprinkled throughout the report: 
Lewis, Jelinek, Dobbie, Segal, Sparrow, Campbell. Many of 
these people were reported to have had meetings with key 
players in the Bristow affair and were involved in smear 
campaigns against the Reform Party. Yet, in interview after 
interview with these former Tory politicians, SIRC avoided 
asking the key hard questions.
<P>
	Will the Solicitor General agree that a committee like SIRC 
composed of political partisans investigating alleged 
improprieties by politicians makes a mockery of natural justice 
and discredits the internal security system in this country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the members of the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee are appointed by order in council in exactly the same 
way as a short term commission of inquiry. They have the fullest 
powers to investigate, to seek documents, to question people 
under oath and they are in a position to complete a full and 
comprehensive report into matters they look into. That is what 
they have done. That report is before us for questioning and also 
is before us to use as a resource to make sure that CSIS is 
operating in a way required by law.
<P>
	I suggest to the hon. leader of the Reform Party that he take 
another look at the report. Its basic purpose was to investigate 
allegations about the conduct of CSIS not about the conduct of 
political figures. It has done this job. I suggest that he and his 
colleagues follow up their concerns by addressing their 
questions directly to the members of SIRC when they appear 
before the parliamentary subcommittee or for that matter, 
seeking out meetings with them directly.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today's SIRC report on the Bristow affair highlights 
the inadequacies of checks and balances on CSIS. It is also clear 
that the mechanisms for monitoring the activities of CSIS are 
ineffectual. They are open to political manipulation by virtue of 
the patronage appointments to the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee.
<P>
	Will the minister agree that the highly political and 
completely ineffectual Security Intelligence Review Committee 
should be done away with? Will he agree that the parliamentary 
subcommittee on national security should be made the watchdog 
of CSIS and should be given the teeth to do the job?

	The SIRC was created by an act of this Parliament to operate 
at arm's length from the government, from Parliament itself and

question is for the Minister of Revenue.
<P>
	While the major Canadian banks are declaring record profits 
of over $4 billion this year, we learn that these same banks will 
benefit from some $300 million in tax credits for research and 
development, in particular for expenses to develop software 
used in current operations, such as automated teller machines. 
The Auditor General has denounced such tax credits as 
ineffective.
<P>
	Can the revenue minister confirm that nearly $300 million in 
tax deductions will swell the banks' profits, which already 
amount to $4 billion, and that these credits are for so-called 
R&amp;D expenses which are really nothing but current 
expenditures?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member can rest assured that there 
will be no payment on pseudo claims for tax credits.
<P>
	We have a very strict procedure for dealing with the tax 
credits for scientific research and experimental development. 
The three criteria are: first, there must be advanced knowledge; 
second, there must be a real risk of failure involved; and third, 
the research must be undertaken by experts.
<P>
	We are now assessing the applications. I might add that 
anybody can put in a request for such an application. It simply 
does not mean that Revenue Canada will accept it. We are 
looking at it closely with over 300 auditors and also a large 
number of scientific experts to make sure that in fact no money 
is paid under this scheme other than that which is due to be paid.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to remind him that he started by 
saying that the Bloc Quebecois had no suggestions. Five 
minutes later, he was up to $5 billion. So that he can do his figure 
work better, I would like to remind him that we are talking about 
$1.6 billion for defence, $3  billion in corporate subsidies, and 
$6 billion in unpaid accounts. The Minister of Finance should 
get his figures straight and by the end of Question Period, we 
may find that the deficit is much smaller.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Minister of Finance asked us where to cut. Here 
is another suggestion. Does he intend to end the waste of public 
funds denounced by the Auditor General and reduce his 
spending by $300 million, in addition to savings suggested by 
the Bloc Quebecois?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I fully endorse 
what the Minister of National Revenue just said. The purpose of 
these tax credits for research and development is certainly to 
create new technology. It is not for companies to do things that 
they should do anyway as good management.
<P>

question very well and I can tell you that he has just stated the 
finance minister's position too.

acknowledged that a CSIS Ottawa region investigator searched 
the names of the contributing individuals and companies to the

<P>
	I will be talking to SIRC tomorrow. This investigation on 
allegations was from an individual considered by the CSIS 
investigator as an unknown quality who was self-serving and 
very opportunistic. It would appear that investigations of this 
nature can be held with very weak probable cause.
<P>
	What assurance can the minister give to Canadians that

by CSIS?

attention of the public through this House in the fullest possible 
manner, which I have done.
<P>
	With respect to the second part of the member's question, the 
law adopted by this Parliament makes clear that CSIS is not to 
investigate lawful acts of protest, dissent or promotion of a

on this issue to be completed before commenting on the blatant 
lack of rigour endangering the safety of Canada's blood supply 
system. These hearings were held on December 6 and 7.
<P>
	Now that the hearings have taken place, will the minister tell 
us why the Bureau of Biologics does not comply with its own

than doubled the staff of the bureau. We implemented a number

	Our blood supply system is blatantly flawed and Canadians 
are at risk of being contaminated before the end of 1995. This is 
very serious. Some people are actually dying because of this.

a questionnaire. We have now received 20,000 copies from 
Canadians. They will be analysed. There is an ongoing series of 
discussions and a wide variety of options.

<P>
	The hon. member, as a member of Parliament, would not 
want me to preclude the judgment of his colleagues who have 
spent a great deal of time listening to Canadians, or preclude 
the judgment of many Canadians who have bothered to take the 
time to write in to give their contributions, by simply making 
an arbitrary judgment, as it seems the Bloc has done, before 
listening to the Canadian people.

	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it seems to me that people have already been waiting 
for quite a while. Everybody is aware of the minister's proposal 
and even Ontario has expressed some opposition.
<P>
	How can the minister claim to represent a flexible federalism 
when he threatens to retaliate against the government of Ontario 
if it continues to make public its resistance to the proposed 
reform?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the one thing that will 
never lead to co-operative or flexible federalism is the kind of 
fearmongering the hon. member has just engaged in. I have 
never made suggestions or threats of the kind the hon. member 
suggested. He should withdraw that remark. It is not based on 
any fact or any presupposition.
<P>
	I would simply say to him that at this time the broad majority 
of Canadians want some change. They want governments to 
work together on change. They want us to find the best ways to 
spend our money.
<P>
	I keep saying the only group that seems to be objecting 
continually without analysing or considering the options is the 
Bloc Quebecois. It is simply standing in the way of Canadians 
getting what they want, which is a much better, more effective 
social system that will help people get back to work.

	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food.
<P>
	In 1983 the government implemented the Western Grain 
Transportation Act that gave railways guaranteed returns on 
investments and operating expenses. Not only was it a licence to 
print money. It also allowed railways to become inefficient and 
non-performing since they were paid regardless of how they 
moved prairie grain.
<P>
	Is the minister now proposing to offload past Liberal mistakes 
on to farmers in the form of a cash buyout?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member knows 
the Minister of Transport and I are working on a set of proposals 
for comprehensive reform of the Canadian grain handling and 
transportation system. That obviously includes a very detailed 
examination of existing legislation in the form of the Western 
Grain Transportation Act.
<P>
	In terms of a consultative process, a very extensive process is 
now under way by both the Minister of Transport and myself 
consulting with farm organizations, farmers and all other 
stakeholders in the grain transportation system. Our objective is 
to collect all their recommendations and advice toward the end 
of this year or the very early part of 1995 so that early in the new 
year we can put before our cabinet colleagues a set of proposals 
to deal with some longstanding issues in our grain handling and 
transportation system.
<P>
	Our objective, in the final analysis, is to ensure we position 
the country to compete with the rest of the world and win in our 
grain sector.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister knows very well that three prairie 
premiers insist that the Western Grain Transportation Act 
represents an inherent right promised to prairie provinces. They 
also insist that none of these moneys go into the east and that 
they stay in the west.
<P>
	Is the minister prepared to put these funds into a safety net 
program that will offset the effects of U.S. and European 
subsidized products in the form of a trade distortion adjustment 
program?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a variety of proposals are under 
consideration. Some of those proposals come from the producer 
payment panel, which was a consultative process that ultimately 
reported publicly in June of this year. There have been other 
proposals in terms of the structure of the method of payment that 
have come from the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.
<P>
	Various farm organizations have come forward with other 
alternatives. There is clearly a difference in view among farmers 
and farm organizations in western Canada on whether the funds 
either partially or totally should be dedicated to some kind of a 
safety net system. That is one of the alternatives on the table.
<P>
	However I must tell the hon. gentleman that thus far in the 
consultations we have had with farmers and farm organizations 
the recommendations and advice we are receiving are very much 
against the notion of folding the funds into any kind of safety 
net.

<P>
	For several months Canadian lumber companies have been 
waiting for the United States to begin repaying the bulk of 
softwood lumber duties collected on Canadian exports. Can the 
minister tell this House when Canadian companies will begin 
receiving repayment of these funds?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade,

who had challenged the NAFTA procedures have now agreed 
unanimously to withdraw their lawsuit.
<P>
	Accordingly, with the removal of this final obstacle, I 
understand that the United States Department of Commerce will 
in the next days begin to return the deposits of Canadian lumber 
companies, totalling some $800 million plus interest.
<P>

	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, it is quite probable that this 
will be our last question period this year. Today, I want to do 
something that I know you will agree with. The House is saying 
goodbye to three of its House officers who have been with us for 
a great many years.
<P>
	In offering tribute, I would like André Fréchette, the head 
page who has been with us for 42 years, to please come and stand 
with me on my right.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would also like to invite our two deputy 
sergeants-at-arms. They have always been at that end of the

here in front of the Speaker's chair.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would first call on the member for Kingston 
and the Islands.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today is the last working day on the floor of the House 
for our chief page, André Fréchette. He has had an amazing term 
of service in this House. What is more amazing is that the 41 
years he has worked here represents more than 80 per cent of his 
life and I do not mean working life.
<P>
	Of the 10 Prime Ministers who have been in office since the 
beginning of his employment in this House, nine have benefited 
from time to time from his assistance. I am certain there is no 
other living Canadian who can claim to have personally assisted 
nine Prime  Ministers not to mention 14 leaders of the 
opposition, scores of cabinet ministers and probably more than 
1,000 members of Parliament.
<P>
	During his years of service he has learned more about the 
House and its workings than most members. He always seems to 
be the first to know what is going to happen in the House, often 
being able to provide helpful advice to members and to other 
staff.
<P>
	Mr. Fréchette started his career with the House as a page when 
he was barely into his teens and it is only just that he should 
retire now while he is still a youngish man.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	We will miss him very much in this House, Mr. Speaker, but of 
course we will be reminded of his presence on a daily basis 
because of the very able staff that he has trained to function in 
his absence.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Fréchette, we wish you a long and happy retirement.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, three employees of the House of Commons are about to 
retire, namely Léo Robitaille, who has been with us since 1953, 
Sam Renaud, since 1954, and André Fréchette, since 1951.
<P>
	Serving the members of this House takes dedication, patience 
and understanding, and we would be unable to do our job 
without their support.
<P>
	I would like to comment particularly on Mr. Fréchette's 
career which kept him in the House for 43 years. He started 
working here when he was 11, under Louis Saint-Laurent. He 
has known 12 speakers and several generations of members. I 
think this is a record, and should be in the Guinness Book of 
Records.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> I wish to thank Mr. Robitaille, Mr. Renaud and 
Mr. Fréchette on behalf of all members of the Bloc Quebecois.

	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today it is both an honour and indeed a pleasure to pay 
tribute on behalf of the Reform Party of Canada to my friend, 
chief page André Fréchette, on the occasion of his retirement.
<P>
	Mr. Fréchette was born in Hull and first came to work in this 
place in 1951. He became chief page in 1980. What are his plans 
for retirement? We know he enjoys bowling every week, and we 
wish him all success to bowl perfect games. In the summer he 
knows the many wonderful locations where he can pick every 
kind of wild berry around the area.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9152"> 9152 </A></B>
<P>
	After 42 years as a page he has well earned a rest, but we 
have been informed that a friend has also invited him to form 
a partnership in a small business. Mr. Fréchette has a big 
decision to make ahead. But I know he will bring his special 
enthusiasm to whatever choice he makes.
<P>
	What advice would he give to young people today? I would 
like to quote: ``Do anything you can to become a page. It is the 
best experience in the world and it is wonderful for young 
people to feel they are contributing to their country''.
<P>
	I am sure his wife, daughter and grandson take special pride in 
the years that he has given to Canada. I want to express the 
appreciation and congratulations of Parliament and our personal 
thanks to chief page André Fréchette. We will all miss you.
<P>
	Also, we would like to extend our best wishes on the 
retirement of Mr. Leo Robitaille who has served Parliament here 
since 1953, and Mr. Sam Renaud since 1954. We wish you the 
best of everything in your retirement and the best of the season.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this is a rather special day for me. As you know, I 
am the only staff member of the House of Commons ever to have 
been elected to this place since Confederation. That I consider 
special. What is even more special today is to say to you and to 
hon. members that I have had the opportunity of working with 
all three people we are honouring this afternoon.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	At one time I worked in the parliamentary restaurant like Mr. 
Léo Robitaille, who is being honoured today. As a member of 
this House, I have always known and worked with Mr. André 
Fréchette. I also came to know Mr. Renaud.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	If I could pretend for an instant that I am still an employee of 
the House of Commons, as I was a long time ago, I would like to 
tell these three men that the members of the House wish them the 
very best. I am sure that, in my imaginary capacity as an 
employee of this House, I also speak for all the employees of 
this House.

retirement and also thank them very much for their service to 
this House and to generations of parliamentarians and to young 
people throughout the years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>]

	I want to wish them a happy retirement.
<P>
	By the way, Mr. Speaker, there are many other employees in 
the House of Commons who are going to retire.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to also thank all of those other employees of 
Parliament who are taking retirement on January 1 and to thank 
them as well for their service to this Parliament.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Léo, André and Sam, at long last the Speaker 
gets to speak. My colleagues, today is a very special day. It is 
very special for all of us because in a very real sense we who 
serve in this House and the people who help us to discharge our 
duties as parliamentarians know full well of the pressures and 
demands that are placed on all of us. I include here the officers 
of this House.
<P>
	Today as we say goodbye to Léo and Sam, I must say that I had 
hoped in my tenure to never be able to avail myself of your 
services, but already once I have had to call upon you when one 
of our members would not withdraw. I have forgiven him long 
since.
<P>
	My colleagues, today also we say goodbye to André 
Fréchette. I ask the pages who are here today to come and stand 
around the Chair. There have been many pages that André has 
worked with and whom he has helped over the years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am happy to see you are all here, our pages, my pages, the 
pages of all Canadians.

	It is indeed fitting that at this time of the year, as we prepare to 
go home, as we prepare ourselves indeed to be with our families 
and friends that we, the family that is Parliament, and most 
especially these three men who are leaving us today, would say 
to them, and I do today claim my right to speak on behalf of all 
parliamentarians when I say to you: Thank you for a job well 
done. We appreciate you very much.

	First of all, in my capacity as Leader of the Government in the

best wishes to Mr. Fréchette, Mr. Robitaille and Mr. Renaud.
<P>
	This afternoon we will continue consideration of third reading 
stage of Bill C-53. I believe there is an understanding that we 
will vote on this today. However, there will be an interruption at 
around 4.30 or 5 p.m. when the Gentleman Usher of the Black 
Rod will summon the House to the other place for a royal assent 
ceremony. I understand that will be the last formal activity in 
Parliament by His Excellency the current Governor General 
before he leaves office early in the new year.
<P>
	Also, I understand there is some considerable desire on both 
sides of the House to adjourn for the winter adjournment 
provided for in Standing Order 28 after completing Bill C-53 
and the royal assent.
<P>
	I will announce the business for the day when we return 
during the week before that date, hopefully not in this House but 
directly to my hon. colleagues. I want to say that tentatively I am 
looking at Bill C-44 and Bill C-62 as the selections likely to be

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I informed 
you and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans earlier today, I rise 
on a question of privilege in relation to a discrepancy in the 
supplemental answer given today to Order Paper Question No. 
82. The answer is again inaccurate and misleading. It 
misrepresents the facts and is contradicted by DFO enforcement 
documents which I have received under access to information.
<P>
	I was prepared to meet with the deputy House leader and the 
minister as per your instructions to discuss a satisfactory answer 
to Question No. 82. I sought such a meeting. A meeting never 
occurred and instead, the minister tabled a supplemental answer 
this morning.
<P>
	The question asked the effect the late signing of the aboriginal 
fisheries agreement had on enforcement of fisheries agreements 
and fisheries regulations in 1994. The minister's answer does 
not respond to the effect on enforcement.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is this new information the member is giving 
the House, or is it a repetition of the information he put before 
the House previously? Can the hon. member clarify that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> Mr. Speaker, the information is new. What I 
am doing is responding to the supplemental answer to Question 
No. 82 which was tabled this morning.
<P>
	The minister's supplemental answer to Question No. 82 which 
I refer to does not respond to the effect on enforcement. The 
departmental documents received under access to information 
deal specifically with the effect on enforcement.
<P>
	The minister's supplemental answer deals with the 
management of the aboriginal fishing strategy, not the effect on 
enforcement of fisheries regulations, that is, the Fisheries Act. 
Now is not the time to debate the aboriginal fishing strategy.
<P>
	The answer implies that aboriginal guardians were on duty as 
usual and that licences were given out as required under the 
regulations. That is simply not true. Virtual chaos reigned on the 
west coast. Fisheries documents prove it.
<P>
	The issue before this House is whether the minister's answer 
misleads this House and prevents me as a member from carrying 
out my duties.
<P>
	Let me read a few short sections from the August fisheries 
enforcement document on early Stuart migration which clearly 
demonstrates that the minister's supplemental answer is 
inaccurate. In Steveston it was reported that ``the ability to 
properly manage the Fraser River aboriginal fishery has been 
seriously compromised''. It also states: ``The late signing of the 
aboriginal agreements has also resulted in difficulties in respect 
to proper management of the fishery, and in many cases bands 
have not been able to abide by the terms of the agreement''.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	In Fraser Valley East and Fraser Valley West the report states 
that the lateness in the signing of the 1994 aboriginal fishery 
agreement has resulted in the breakdown of effective 
management in the native fishery on the Fraser River. DFO 
officers were unable to perform their duties effectively because 
updated licensing data was not available, therefore proper gear 
and licence checks could not be done. Mandatory landing sites 
were  not operational until late July. Arrangements were not 
made by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9154"> 9154 </A></B>
<P>
the harvest committee as per agreement to recover landing 
slips-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The Chair is in a quandary. It would seem to me 
that what we have here is information which is deemed to be 
accurate by one side and deemed to be inaccurate by the other 
side. What we are into now I believe is a point of debate. I 
wonder if the hon. member could move to identify the specific 
point of privilege he is referring to.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cummins:</B> Mr. Speaker, in point of fact I asked the 
question: What effect did the late signing of the aboriginal 
fishing agreements in British Columbia have on the Department 
of Fisheries and Oceans' enforcement of the agreement and 
fisheries regulations in 1994?
<P>
	The answer that was originally provided said that the impact 
was minimal. The documents which I received under access to 
information proved otherwise. The supplemental answer which 
I received this morning did not address the issue. Instead it 
addressed the issue of the management of the aboriginal fishing 
strategy. It did not address the question asked.
<P>
	The breach of privilege as I suggested the other day for your 
consideration, Mr. Speaker, was the 1978 decision where the 
member for Northumberland-Durham raised a question of 
privilege in the House. The Solicitor General had written and 
provided information which later proved to be erroneous and 
inaccurate. The Speaker ruled as indicated in <I>Hansard</I> on page 
1857: ``I find therefore a prima facie case of contempt against 
the House of Commons''.
<P>
	I maintain that the same thing has happened again. If it was 
contempt against the House of Commons to provide a member 
with erroneous information, then surely to provide the House 
itself with erroneous information through a written reply to a 
question on the Order Paper would also be a prima facie case of 
privilege.
<P>
	Should you rule-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. Colleagues, I think at least at this point 
from what I have heard we are in the process of debate.
<P>
	The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is here now as is the 
member for Kingston and the Islands. I am going to permit an 
intervention. After the interventions are over, I will hear what 
you have to say first and then I will decide where I am going to 
go from there. The hon. Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is not a question of privilege. It is not 
even a matter of being a good point of order. What we have here 
is the beginning of a debate.
<P>
	The debate being proposed by the member opposite is a debate 
about the impact or the capacity of enforcement officers both 
departmental and aboriginal officers to conduct their 
responsibilities.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	This is very technical that there is a late signing of an 
aboriginal fisheries agreement. The agreement in question this 
year has been the subject of a lot of discussion, questions in the 
House, a great deal of media. It is now the subject of a review by 
a former Speaker and a public panel. There has been some 
acknowledgement of some problems. The agreement in question 
primarily is on the lower Fraser. The group in question is the 
Sto:Lo. But this is one of 47 agreements. There are 47 
agreements.
<P>
	If the member chooses to focus on some areas of difficulty 
and draw from them the conclusion that the entire program, the 
planet as we know it, the fishery as it has been conducted, the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans, and every last fish are all 
subject to a totally uncontrolled situation, that is his right as a 
member of this House. But to extrapolate from it that the answer 
given is misleading when there are 47 agreements and not just 
one is improper. It is wrong and is an abuse of the whole 
principle of a question of privilege.
<P>
	What we have here is a debate. Mr. Speaker, if you would like 
to provide for a debate, you well know in the years we have 
shared together in this place that I am always tempted to engage 
in such.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I just want to draw your attention to words used by the 
hon. member in expressing his question of privilege.
<P>
	I will quote only two examples. For example, he said that the 
minister's answer implied something. Different people may 
draw different implications from words that are used, whether in 
the question or in the answer. I think it is entirely proper for a 
minister to provide an answer to a written inquiry which may be 
an answer that is not agreed to by the member receiving the 
answer.
<P>
	Sometimes that may provoke the member to ask more specific 
questions. If the hon. member had asked what was the result of 
the non-signing of an agreement in area <I>x</I> he might have 
received a different answer to the question he asked on the Order 
Paper for which a much more general answer was provided.
<P>
	I note that the minister, in answer to the hon. member's point 
the other day, tabled a supplementary response. This is unusual 
but it is perfectly proper for the minister to do that. He did it in 
order to satisfy the anxieties the hon. member raised the other 
day when he suggested that somehow the answer was 
misleading.
<P>
	I want to suggest when the government prepares answers to 
questions in this House it prepares them as of the date the 
question is asked. Occasionally when the answer comes to me a 
month, two months or four months later-and sometimes they 
are late, we have had that experience recently-the answer is 
wrong because events have changed in a notorious way so that 
even I know they are wrong. Then I say I think we should  update 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9155"> 9155 </A></B>
<P>
the answer and give an answer that is correct as of the date we 
are tabling the reply.
<P>
	I suspect that part of the problem the hon. member 
encountered in this case is that the information available to the 
department on the date the question was put was different from 
the information when the answer was tabled some two months 
later. Additional or supplementary information was provided by 
the minister this morning. I tabled that on the minister's behalf.
<P>
	In light of all that I do not understand how the hon. member 
can argue that his ability to perform his functions as a member of 
Parliament have been impaired by this answer. That is the nub of 
the issue on a question of privilege. If his ability to perform his 
functions are impaired, I suggest to him the thing for him to do is 
put more questions on the Order Paper and ask more detailed 
questions so he gets more detailed answers.
<P>
	I am sure if he does that he will get the answers he wants. But 
reading from selective reports and then suggesting that because 
those reports are different from the answer when, as the minister 
has pointed out there are many reports, is not correct. It is not 
fair.
<P>
	It is not impairing the hon. member's ability to carry on his 
functions. He is obviously able to carry them on because he has 
all the reports in his possession and is able to read and quote 
from them in this House. If that is the case how are his abilities 
impaired, and if they are not, there is no question of privilege.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I think that for my purposes at 
least at this point what I would like to do is review the answer 
which was tabled today. I would like to review the information 
the member put before us on another day and has brought back 
with more information today. I will have a look at the 
information. At this point at least, subject of course to my 
looking at it and reflecting on it, I am not convinced that there is 
a question of privilege.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	However, if the House will give me the time to review the 
documents that have been placed before me, I will come back to 
the House if necessary.
<P>
	I move now to the second question of privilege of the hon. 
member for Scarborough-Rouge River.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PRESSGALLERY">PRESS GALLERY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, earlier today I was denied access to press gallery room 
130-S on two occasions. I understand a similar occurrence took 
place a few days ago with respect to another member; I was 
informed of it by the member. Although I am prepared to move a 
motion, I state for the record that the essence of the privilege 
matter is the denial of access of a member or members to rooms 
on the parliamentary precincts.
<P>
	In view of the season, our agenda this afternoon, and the fact 
that I would like to think it was a simple misunderstanding with 
the press gallery, perhaps I could suggest that Your Honour take 
the matter up with the press gallery to ensure that there are no 
misunderstandings about the rights of all members to have 
access to all open rooms in the parliamentary precincts, barring 
of course the other place beyond the bar, washrooms of the 
opposite gender and common sense things. If you would do that, 
Your Honour, I think it might clear up the matter.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is a point of information; I am not sure it is a 
question of privilege. I will undertake to get more information 
on what precisely has been happening in the last few days 
especially with respect to room 130-S. I will give the 
information to the hon. member or indeed share it with the 
House if I feel it is necessary.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFCANADIANHERITAGEACT">DEPARTMENT OF CANADIAN HERITAGE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-53, an act to establish the Department of Canadian Heritage, 
be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, once again it gives me great pleasure to discuss Bill 
C-53, an act to establish the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	It would be useful to state unequivocally that the Reform 
Party does not support the bill. The reasons for this are 
numerous. Since I have spoken on the bill during first and 
second readings and have participated in committee and report 
stages, I feel most of what I have to offer has already been 
stated. Therefore I will not deliberate at great length on the 
issue.
<P>
	However I would like to summarize the key aspects of the bill. 
First let us look at multiculturalism. As I mentioned yesterday in 
the House, as a member of the Standing Committee on Heritage I 
had the opportunity to listen to witnesses describe multicultural 
federal funded programs as divisive and that they focus on our 
differences rather than on our similarities. This is ultimately the 
opposite outcome to that which the government had intended for 
the program.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9156"> 9156 </A></B>
<P>
	I truly believe the intention was noble enough when the 
multiculturalism legislation was passed by the Trudeau 
government. However it was an experimental program that has 
failed its goals. The program does little to unify and seemingly 
everything to separate. The government must stop the waste.
<P>
	Multiculturalism is creating an entire generation of 
hyphenated Canadians by focusing on differences, not on 
similarities. The majority of Canadians believe there is nothing 
wrong with multiculturalism. Yet they believe it should not be 
funded by the government but by multicultural organizations. 
This is the position of the Reform Party we have been defending 
since the late 1980s. According to Neil Bissoondath, author of 
<I>Selling Illusions-The Cult of Multiculturalism in Canada</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Anyone critical of the multicultural policy-is immediately branded a racist.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Moreover it is my perception that this type of attitude is 
present today and is carried by the media, as anyone who speaks 
critically of funding for multiculturalism programs are labelled 
meanspirited or ignorant and intolerant. This is not an answer to 
the problem we are encountering today in Canada. I can 
unequivocally say that the Reform Party is not racist nor is it 
intolerant. However it is fiscally responsible.
<P>
	Multiculturalism programs cost Canadians over $30 million 
annually. This funding could be better spent on health or 
education. I am sure everyone knows that education and not cash 
is the true way to break down barriers between cultures and 
individuals. Therefore I think it would be wise for the 
government to rethink its multicultural policy.
<P>
	Next, overlap and duplication is a theme in which this 
Parliament will hopefully be remembered for decreasing, 
although for this to happen the Liberals must re-evaluate Bill 
C-53 as it is riddled with inconsistencies and duplications 
between departments, such as overlap and duplication between 
the Department of Canadian Heritage and the departments of 
industry, environment and transportation. Yet the Liberals seem 
quite content to allow the overlap to continue, which will only 
lead to confusion of responsibility and mismanagement.
<P>
	To illustrate the point I will use national parks. They were in 
environment but have since moved to heritage. I am still 
wondering why. Recently one witness, David Day, managing 
director of the Association for Mountain Parks Protection and 
Enjoyment, was before the standing committee discussing this 
issue. It is important to illustrate what he said because he made a 
great deal of sense.
<P>
	He spoke of the difficulty governments face in administering 
and managing our national parks because of the diversity of 
expectations. I could not agree more.
<P>
	What is it that we as a society would like to see from our 
national parks? Specifically talking about national parks, Mr. 
Day said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Many Canadians have questioned why the government moved Parks Canada 
from the Department of the Environment to a new and seemingly unfocused 
Department of Heritage. Over the previous 14 years Parks Canada has 
established a firm position within the Department of the Environment as a 
leader and innovator in matters affecting the environment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	With the increase in tourism in Canada national parks are 
more closely linked to industry and environment than they are to 
heritage. The question remains: Why are parks in heritage? 
Streamlining government activities not only makes financial 
sense but also creates accountability. Government should be 
held accountable for department mismanagement and project 
failures.
<P>
	Bill C-53 simply reinforces the perception of the process of 
government that needs reform as well as Reformers more so now 
than at any time before. Perhaps one of the most important 
changes or reforms the House needs is true free votes, free from 
party discipline. The Reform Party suggests changes to 
parliamentary rules to allow for more free votes and to ensure 
that the defeat of a government does not automatically mean the 
government must resign.
<P>
	Bill C-53 is a prime example of a bill that should be defeated 
because it is fundamentally flawed. However its passage is a 
foregone conclusion as we will see later this afternoon. What we 
are doing here is nothing more than an illusion. We have been 
constructively criticizing and proposing positive changes, yet 
our suggestions fall on deaf ears.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	What the Liberals have to understand is that less government 
will ultimately mean more freedom and more prosperity, not 
just for a certain few or a certain region but all Canadians. We as 
parliamentarians have an obligation not only to our constituents 
but to Canadians as a whole. We must start to make decisions 
that will enable the country to lower our deficit and ultimately 
our debt. Since the beginning of my speech Canada's national 
debt has increased $1,443 per second which equates to 
approximately $1,776,000.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Then you had better sit down.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanrahan:</B> Whether I am standing or not does not 
matter; they are still wasting the money.
<P>
	It is for these reasons I am opposed to Bill C-53. It does 
nothing to reduce government spending or waste, government 
mismanagement or incompetence, government overlap or 
duplication. Bill C-53 does not set an example for other 
ministries. Nor does it have the direction needed to lead the 
country out of the financial crisis we are presently facing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9157"> 9157 </A></B>
<P>
	It is for these reasons that we as parliamentarians should 
reject Bill C-53. We should send a message to Canadians that 
we are truly serious about parliamentary reform, deficit 
reduction, government streamlining and government efficiency.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when we 
talk about heritage, most people believe that we are dealing with 
ancient things, old things. However, this afternoon, I would like 
to show that heritage also means modern things, even highly 
advanced technology. I would like to do it from a cultural 
perspective, from the perspective of Canadian and Quebec 
culture.
<P>
	At the present time, right above the Equator, there are two 
American satellites beaming down to South and North America. 
They were sent into orbit by the Hughes Corporation, a 
subsidiary of General Motors in the United States. These two 
satellites have been nicknamed ``Death Stars''. What does this 
mean?
<P>
	These satellites can transmit TV signals nearly to every home 
from the North Pole to the South Pole. They can broadcast up to 
200 channels simultaneously.
<P>
	I must warn you that this is not science fiction; not only can 
these satellites do what I have just mentioned, they have been 
doing it for several weeks already. They now have customers 
mainly in the U.S., but also in Canada.
<P>
	These American satellites belong to the Direct TV 
Corporation and can be used by a Canadian corporation called 
Power Direct TV, itself a subsidiary of Hughes and Power 
Corporation.
<P>
	What does this have to do with culture? Think about it for a 
moment. These satellites broadcasts are, for the time being, 
totally foreign to what is happening on the cultural scene in 
Canada. Programs are produced in the US and the content is 
American, naturally.
<P>
	In fact, just about anyone in Canada can obtain the necessary 
equipment to receive these channels, and I will explain how to 
illustrate how real a danger it is for Quebec and Canadian 
culture.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	In the United States, right now, you can buy a dish the size of 
large pizza and a descrambler, and get the signal coming from a 
satellite on your television set. Now Direct TV is a business 
concern and the signal is not free; however the company has to 
know that you are receiving their signal to be able to bill you for 
it.
<P>
	How does it work? You go to the United States and you buy the 
box and the small dish for about C$900. I should add that as soon 
as the market picks up, the prices will fall to about half that 
much. You bring all this back to Canada, to Quebec, or any other 
province or to the Northwest Territories and you install your 
small dish outside, or even inside if you have a south-facing 
window. Next you connect your box to the phone line and you 
dial the 1-800 number.
<P>
	You automatically reach the U.S. company and register as a 
new customer willing to use their services. The company then 
sends a signal to one of their geostationary satellites above the 
Equator telling it to talk to your box. These satellites always stay 
above the same spot on the Equator. This is not science fiction, 
this is happening now. Your box has a number, and when the 
satellite sends it the right signal, it comes to life. From then on, 
it gives you access to about 200 channels.
<P>
	You can now view all the regular programming of the major 
American television networks and you can order up movies on a 
pay-per-view basis, which is like going to a video store, except 
that you do not have to get out of the house. You push a button 
indicating that you want to watch such and such a movie and, 
automatically, the box records the films that you ordered and 
your viewing time. At the end of the month, the parent company 
in the U.S. phones your box and reads the meter, so to speak. 
And the box provides the information. The company in the U.S. 
then issues a bill and sends it to you.
<P>
	However, since you are in Canada, you will not receive the 
bill at your home. It will be sent to an American address that you 
were provided with, and you will get the bill from there. No 
GST, no provincial sales tax. I think that the Department of 
Revenue should realize that services are being provided to 
Canada without any international agreement.
<P>
	I will quote officials from the American company working on 
the Canadian side. Mr. Kruyt, who works for Power Direct TV, 
appeared before the heritage committee on November 16.
<P>
	What was the question I asked? I had asked him why the 
company tolerated that Canadian consumers receive the signal, 
knowing that it was not complying with Canadian consumer law. 
He answered: ``We have no financial incentive to prevent these 
people from receiving the signals, but do have a financial 
incentive to charge them for doing so''.
<P>
	I then asked him what made him think that eventually, in 
providing the service legally to Canadians, signals could be 
screened to ensure that they receive Canadian rather than 
American signals. And the answer I got was that the American 
company would give them control over what they call the on-off 
switch if they could start business in this country. This is of 
course a situation where profitability is the only rule.
<P>
<B></B>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="9158"> 9158 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Culture in Canada and Quebec is now at risk. What can and 
must be done about it? First, we need our heritage minister to be 
properly equipped, to have the proper legislative tools to act. 
Instead, we have the Minister of Industry saying: 
``Communications. That belongs to me''.
<P>
	At this rate, telephone comes under communications, 
television comes under communications, banking transactions, 
specially those made at an automatic banking machine, come 
under communications. What about education then? Will it also 
come under the jurisdiction of the Department of Industry, when 
it is televised?
<P>
	When the medical profession will make use of 
telecommunication media, will it become one more thing under 
industry jurisdiction? Telecommunication can be such an area of 
responsibility, but only insofar as the equipment is concerned 
and at the exclusion of content, which much be the 
responsibility of other appropriate departments. My point it that 
there is nothing in the legislation before us, absolutely nothing, 
that gives the Minister of Canadian Heritage authority to act.
<P>
	I would even go further. With this chunk of the electronic 
highway -and we know that this highway is coming and that it 
will take many forms- how can we prevent goods and services 
from crossing our borders electronically, when we know full 
well that we have legislation in place to prevent them from 
entering in material form?
<P>
	Take hate propaganda, for example. In electronic form, we 
cannot do a thing about it. Terrorist instructions are already 
circulating on Internet, here in Canada and Quebec. This would 
never be allowed if it had to go through a border point. What will 
we do to stop this? Our heritage department must be able to 
negotiate GATT-type agreements with our global partners, so 
that all countries with approved electronic data links will agree 
to protect their mutual interests. Therefore, the Act to establish 
the Department of Canadian Heritage should enable our heritage 
minister to tell the countries with which we will have electronic 
links: ``If we receive a signal that should not be received, we 
expect you to take those responsible to task, and we will do the 
same for you''.
<P>
	We will thus be able to protect our cultural interests, first by 
avoiding invasion as we will have control over what is coming 
in. It is not a matter of hindering the free flow of information, 
but of seeing that what would not be allowed through a border 
point cannot get through electronically either. We can also agree 
to export our own cultural wealth overseas and not let barriers be 
put in place over there.
<P>
	In conclusion, the bill as it stands should not be approved by 
this House nor by the other place, as it does not meet the 
requirements Canadians and Quebecers are entitled to.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUMANRIGHTS">HUMAN RIGHTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
Friday, December 9, I put a question to the Deputy Prime 
Minister about the Prime Minister's timid stand on human rights 
and the Canadian government's inability to guarantee the 
security of Canadian business people travelling abroad.
<P>
	I made particular reference to the case of Mr. Tran Trieu 
Quan, a citizen from the Quebec City area who has been held 
prisoner in Hanoi for over eight months by the Vietnamese 
authorities. Charges have yet to be laid against him, which leads 
us to conclude that Mr. Tran is being unjustly held and that the 
Canadian government should demand his unconditional release 
without delay.
<P>
	In answer to the first part of the question, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of International Trade said that ``the 
Canadian government has raised the issue on several 
occasions''. We in the Official Opposition cannot forget that 
during his Asian Tour with Team Canada, the Prime Minister 
never talked publicly about the important issue of human rights. 
To justify his cowardice, the Prime Minister said that he was 
afraid that Canada would be made fun of.
<P>
	As regards the outrageous situation experienced by this 
Canadian who has been held prisoner in Hanoi for more than 
eight months now, the parliamentary secretary is merely taking 
note of the question.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	Why is the Canadian government unable to impose the only 
possible solution, that is to say the release of Mr. Tran, who is 
being held illegally in a country where Canada just opened a 
chancellery in Hanoi and a trade office in Ho Chi Minh City, in 
addition to having been involved in the settlement of the arrears 
owed to the International Monetary Fund? Let us be frank: the 
Government of Canada is directly financing a government that 
is holding a Canadian prisoner. Some justice, Mr. Speaker!
<P>
	The second part of my question dealt with the Canadian 
government's inability to ensure the security of Canadian 
business people abroad. In this regard, this whole affair has 
already taken its toll on the Quebec business community. For 
instance, the Sainte-Foy Chamber of Commerce recommended 
that its members stop trading with Vietnam. Last Friday, this 
organization also announced that it would recommend that 
chambers of commerce across Canada and Quebec adopt the 
same policy as long as Mr. Tran is held prisoner by the 
Vietnamese authorities.
<P>
	How then are we to understand the Deputy Prime Minister's 
answer, and I quote: ``I have personally reviewed every 
comment made by the Premier of Quebec when he was the host 
of the governor of a Chinese province and, each time, he adopted 
the same policy as the Government of Canada''? First, I would 
remind the Deputy Prime Minister that Vietnam is a sovereign 
state and not a Chinese province. Second, I would remind her 
that if I want to question the Government of Quebec, I would not 
do it through the House of Commons.
<P>
	Lastly, I am pleased to see that the Deputy Prime Minister 
admits that Quebec has the ability and the know-how to 
establish an international policy independent of the federal 
govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9161"> 9161 </A></B>
<P>
ment's. If that were not the case, I would really like to know why 
she would  waste her time reading and studying the public 
statements made by the Premier of Quebec on various subjects 
relating to foreign affairs.
<P>
	However, this partisan stand of the Deputy Prime Minister 
clearly shows the Canadian government's insensitivity to the 
fate of Mr. Tran, a Quebecer held prisoner in Vietnam.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want the hon. member to 
know that this government is not at all insensitive to the 
situation of Mr. Quan. He might be happy to know that the Prime 
Minister raised the matter of Mr. Quan's continuing detention 
during his meeting in Hanoi with the Vietnamese Prime Minister 
Vo Van Kiet.
<P>
	The Prime Minister received a full explanation of the details 
of the case and was assured that the matter would be handled 
fairly and in accordance with Vietnamese law.
<P>
	Mr. Quan has both Canadian and Vietnamese citizenships. 
Vietnamese authorities, however, do not recognize dual 
nationality and deny access to Mr. Quan by Canadian officials.
<P>
	However, as a result of repeated high level interventions from 
the Canadian government we have gained counsellor access to 
Mr. Quan. Canadian officials have visited Mr. Quan and 
confirmed he is not being mistreated.
<P>
	This is a very complex case in which a Vietnamese 
corporation lost a considerable sum of money. We understand 
that the Vietnamese are investigating the possibility of fraud.
<P>
	As part of its regular counsellor assistance Canadian officials 
are facilitating discussions between Mr. Quan and Vietnamese 
authorities with regard to the possibility of Mr. Quan's release. 
These discussions are private and confidential and it would be 
inappropriate for me to comment on them here.
<P>
	The Canadian government will continue to provide all 
appropriate counsellor assistance to Mr. Quan and will monitor 
the situation with vigilance. It would not be appropriate for the 
Canadian government to demand that the Vietnamese set aside 
their own legal procedures and immediately release Mr. Quan, 
nor would it be appropriate for the government to support a 
business boycott of Vietnam because one of its citizens is being 
held in connection with a criminal investigation.
<P>
	We have the right to insist upon counsellor access and due 
process. We are and will continue to do both.
<P>

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DRAFTBILLONQUEBECSOVEREIGNTY">DRAFT BILL ON QUEBEC SOVEREIGNTY</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, On 
December 9, I rose in this House to ask the Prime Minister about 
the referendum process in Quebec. The Bloc Quebecois wanted 
to know, and still wants to know, if the Prime Minister stands by 
what he wrote in his autobiography where he said: ``If we lose 
the referendum, we will respect Quebecers' wishes and accept 
separation''.
<P>
	The Prime Minister answered my question by saying, first of 
all, that he wanted a clear question, adding that he would not 
answer any hypothetical question. The Prime Minister should 
realize that he is inconsistent in his statements. By not clarifying 
his stand on wishes democratically expressed by Quebecers, the 
Prime Minister is refusing to give an opinion on the right of the 
Quebec people to decide their future.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Before being sovereignists or federalists, we must all be 
democrats. I dare hope that nobody wants to make Quebec an 
independent country or to maintain it within the Canadian 
federation against Quebecers' will.
<P>
	Moreover, the Prime Minister would do well by following the 
lead of his colleagues, the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine and the hon. member for 
Mount Royal, both of whom recently recognized that it is up to 
Quebecers to decide their future. The Prime Minister has shown 
partisan behaviour instead of political responsibility during 
Question Period last Friday. It is urgent that he display an 
attitude appropriate to his important responsibilities as a head of 
state.
<P>
	Besides, during the same debate last week, the Prime Minister 
wrongly accused sovereignists of hiding their option by using a 
question referring to a draft bill containing 1,600 words. He said 
that many federalists were refusing to participate in those 
consultations because of this little trick. Those were terrible and 
very inconsiderate remarks.
<P>
	Should we remind him of the consultations which surrounded 
the Charlottetown Agreement? Should we remind him that the 
Charlottetown Agreement contained not 1,600 words but well 
over 10,000 words? Yes, 10,000 words. The Prime Minister and 
his party were not at all shocked. On the contrary, they promoted 
the content of that agreement all across Canada.
<P>
	You must admit that the qualms the Prime Minister has today 
are quite recent and his rationale seems one-sided. The federal 
government and its Quebec branch have to talk about the real 
options. Let them remind us that they have nothing else to offer 
but the status quo.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9162"> 9162 </A></B>
<P>
	The truth of the matter is-and the Prime Minister should 
admit it-that federalists do not want to take part in 
consultations on the referendum because they have nothing to 
suggest but the old status quo. It may be Christmas and a time 
to eat traditional dishes, but that does not mean the federal 
government should serve us the same rehash.
<P>
	In fact, the federal Liberals do not want to travel across 
Quebec and talk with citizens of every region. When you cannot 
argue for your political ideas with logical arguments, you use 
every kind of trick to divert the debate onto procedural details.
<P>
	You cannot negotiate or manipulate the soul of a nation, nor 
can you put a price on it. No, the soul of a nation can only be seen 
if the people can democratically express their will. That is what 
the Government of Quebec is proposing and what the Prime 
Minister of Canada is rejecting. The Prime Minister must accept 
this inescapable fact and take part, with his colleagues, in 
particular the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, in the pre-referendum 
consultations the Government of Quebec will be holding.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
debating the result of the vote, let us address the process. It 
should be democratic and it should be clear.
<P>
	We are asking Mr. Parizeau to duly initiate the referendum 
process, to present his question to the National Assembly and to 
move on quickly to the Loi sur la consultation populaire.
<P>
	As indicated by Mr. Johnson, we are asking the PQ to end this 
masquerade, this so-called consultation and to get a clear 
mandate from the population. In other words, hold a referendum 
as soon as possible and put an end to the uncertainty. Let the 
public decide.
<P>
	The Bloc and the Government of Quebec claim that they are 
great believers in the democratic process. They talk solemnly 
about the need to respect this process, but their very first act is to 
attempt to pre-empt the referendum by introducing a draft 
declaration of sovereignty which will be voted on by the 
National Assembly before the people of Quebec have spoken.
<P>
	There can be nothing less democratic than forcing the 
National Assembly to vote on a declaration of sovereignty 
before the people of Quebec have had an opportunity to express 
themselves at the ballot box.
<P>
	The Bloc is asking, in the event that Quebecers vote yes to 
separation, to recognize the people of Quebec, to recognize the 
right to leave the Canadian federation. Will the Bloc agree that 
the decision to introduce the draft declaration of sovereignty 
and to have the National Assembly pass it before the people of 
Quebec have  spoken through referendum is fundamentally 
undemocratic and against everything they claim to stand for?
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	Will the Bloc recognize that the people of Quebec have the 
right to stay in Canada when they vote no in the referendum?
<P>
	Quebecers know that they live in one of the greatest countries 
in the world, a country that they built. This country is evolving 
and Quebecers have a part to play in this evolution. The burden 
of proof rests with the separatists.
<P>
	We are confident, Mr. Speaker, that a strong case will be made 
for Canada.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOCIALPROGRAMREVIEW">SOCIAL PROGRAM REVIEW</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
October 17 of this year I asked the Minister of Finance to come 
clean with Canadians about what the government's intentions 
were in terms of reducing funding for social programs in this 
country.
<P>
	Since that time there has been much speculation. One report 
indicates a potential cut of $7 billion contemplated by the 
government in our social programs envelope. Others, for 
example the Standing Committee on Finance which has just 
released a report, project that over the next two years there will 
be something like a $3.4 billion cut in social programs.
<P>
	This discussion that is going on certainly does not take into 
account the reality of what social programs have contributed to 
this country. Certainly as a New Democrat I am not against 
changes to social programs, but clearly Canadians are beginning 
to realize that the social security review has been merely an 
attempt to cut expenditures rather than to really and truly change 
our programs.
<P>
	If the intent was to change programs, to make them better, to 
make them more efficient, I think we would have seen a very 
different process. I think the government has to be clear with 
Canadians what the intent is around the reduction of revenues in 
the social program area.
<P>
	I would remind the government that in 1991 Statistics Canada 
was very clear that only 6 per cent of our debt could be attributed 
to social programs. I would suggest to the government that we 
need equal debate, indeed more debate, on that 94 per cent of the 
cost of our debt and deficit.
<P>
	One of the major costs of that is how we finance our programs, 
not simply what we do within the purview of those programs. 
Since October 17 when I first posed the question to the minister I 
continued to raise questions about the financing of the debt. For 
example, only yesterday I posed the question to the Minister of 
Finance suggesting that he should have a public inquiry into the 
role of the Bank of Canada in setting interest rates, because of 
course the amount of our foreign debt is certainly affecting the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9163"> 9163 </A></B>
<P>
interest rate policy, and to look seriously at how monetary 
policy in this country is formed and the role of the Bank of 
Canada in that.
<P>
	The minister did not respond to that particular request. I 
would suggest again that the minister instead of just simply 
looking at cuts to expenditures should also look at why they are 
necessary. Part of the reason for that is the monetary policy that 
was pursued by the previous Mulroney government and has been 
continued if not with even more zeal by the current Liberal 
government.
<P>
	There are several things that the minister should be looking at 
in this area. The minister might recall that before 1967 the Bank 
Act legislated a ceiling on interest rates that allowed for some 
control. Prior to 1991 the act ensured that the Bank of Canada 
had some control over interest on the national debt.
<P>
	I would like to ask the question why it is that the government 
will not be clear about the reduction in expenditures it wants to 
make to the social programs envelope? In addition, why will the 
government not look at the way and the role of the Bank of 
Canada, which has become I might add not the bank for 
Canadians but the bank for chartered banks, and how the 
government by looking at that could return the controls of its 
monetary policy to the people of Canada and not simply to the 
chartered banks.
<P>
	I would be very interested, Mr. Speaker, in again posing those 
two questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Government of Canada has embarked upon a significant reform 
of Canada's social security system in co-operation with 
provincial and territorial governments and with all Canadians. 
The social security review is allowing Canadians to consider 
options for structural reform of Canada's social programs. At 
the same time this review must respect fiscal realities and the 
government's deficit reduction targets.
<P>
	The 1994 federal budget established fiscal parameters for 
social security reform. It announced measures that would reduce 
spending on unemployment insurance by $2.4 billion. It also 
indicated that further UI savings leading to lower UI premiums 
would result from social security reform.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	The 1994 budget also announced that growth in social 
security transfers to the provinces would be curtailed by 
ensuring that Canada assistance plan transfers and the 
post-secondary education component of established programs 
financing are no higher in 1996-97 than in 1993-94. Savings of 
at least $1.5 billion will be realized from preventing the growth 
that would otherwise have occurred.
<P>
	The social security discussion paper confirmed these 
parameters and makes sure that the entitlements under EPF-PSE 
and under CAP will be no higher in 1996-97 than they were for 
each program in 1993-94.
<P>
	Beyond 1996-97, EPF-PSE funding will be at best kept stable 
at the 1996-97 level and no increase in funding for CAP or its 
successors should be anticipated beyond 1996-97.
<P>
	If any additional savings are required to help meet the 
government's fiscal targets they will be announced in the 1995 
budget.
<P>
	In the meantime the government is listening attentively to the 
views of Canadians and of the parliamentary committees that 
are now engaged in discussions about social programs and fiscal 
issues.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GLIDINGSCHOOL">GLIDING SCHOOL</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
eastern region gliding school at the Chicoutimi-Saint-Honoré 
airport in the Saguenay has been in operation since 1978.
<P>
	Sixteen years of operation during which the school was 
assessed yearly by the authorities of the Royal Canadian Air 
Cadets and given full marks. Also sixteen years of operation at a 
location that is considered ideal. The 
Chicoutimi-Saint-Honoré airport is located in a truly 
outstanding site, in a rural area offering numerous advantages in 
terms of room to maneuver and safety.
<P>
	In September, authorities in charge of the cadets asked for a 
feasibility study with a view to moving the gliding school from 
Chicoutimi-Saint-Honoré, in the Saguenay, to Saint-Jean.
<P>
	Last Wednesday, socio-economic stakeholders in the region 
presented Major Dumontet and Lieutenant-Colonel Chartrand 
with an analysis of the Chicoutimi-Saint-Honoré site. Besides 
stating advantages of the Chicoutimi-Saint-Honoré site that 
were never disputed, the study emphasized major security 
problems at Saint-Jean. We have proof and aviation experts 
agree that our concerns are justified.
<P>
	Nothing came out of the meeting with the people in charge of 
the cadets. Quite the contrary, the answers they gave us added to 
our concern. Therefore, because the decision appeared 
imminent, I asked the Minister of National Defence to impose a 
moratorium long enough to leave the Cadet headquarters 
sufficient time to address the concerns of the 
Chicoutimi-Saint-Honoré committee and, in particular, to 
make the best decision.
<P>
	Since the survival of a school which has been operating in our 
area for 16 years and which has generated substantial economic 
spin-off is at stake, we repeat our request for the feasibility 
study to justify the move to Saint-Jean.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9164"> 9164 </A></B>
<P>
	We also ask for a second evaluation by Transport Canada of 
both airport sites, mainly from a security point of view.
<P>
	The evasive answer the minister gave us led us to believe that 
everything was done behind closed doors and that he was not 
even advised. My question enabled him to learn that this whole 
reorganization was being planned in dark back rooms, away 
from the scrutiny of those concerned, and, therefore, without 
any consultation.
<P>
	The people of Saguenay-Lac Saint-Jean do not want to have 
to put up with the same bungling as the people of Saint-Jean, 
when the military college was closed. There should be greater 
transparency when consulting with the committee, for the 
preservation of eastern region gliding school. Why rob Peter to 
pay Paul? This is the question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Eastern 
Region Gliding School was situated in St-Honoré in the early 
1970s because suitable accommodations for the cadets were 
available and the airport was conducive to glider training 
operations.
<P>
	However several factors have resulted in the recommendation 
of the eastern region cadet staff to relocate the summer cadet 
gliding operations from the civilian airfield in St-Honoré to the 
municipal airport in St-Jean. The reasons are several.
<P>
	First, one has to consider the ongoing efforts to reduce costs 
and improve the efficiency of cadet training.
<P>
	Second, there is a substantial commercial cost required to 
house and feed the cadets in Chicoutimi.
<P>
	Third, there are operational inefficiencies involved in moving 
aircraft and personnel resources every summer from the home 
base at the St-Jean airport, where are located the hangar and the 
offices, to the training location in St-Honoré, which is located at 
a distance of approximately 350 miles.
<P>
	Finally one must note the decrease in the usage of the St-Jean 
megaplex coupled with improvement to the St-Jean airport.
<P>
	Prior to undertaking the operational and financial analysis, 
full support for the proposal was received from the city of 
St-Jean, subject to noise reduction concerns. In accordance with 
Canadian law an environmental impact analysis was conducted.
<P>
	A comparison of operations and flight safety measures 
between the airfields at St-Honoré and St-Jean clearly indicated 
the following benefits: an annual saving of approximately 
$300,000 generated primarily by reduced costs of housing and 
feeding of staff and the air cadets at the CFB St-Jean megaplex.
<P>
	Second is the availability of the main operating base hangar at 
the St-Jean airport to which the gliders and tow aircraft can be 
rapidly moved, thereby eliminating the possibility of 
environmental damage from the wind or  hail compared to the 
situation at the St-Honoré base where the gliders and tow 
aircraft remain in the open over the entire summer training 
period.
<P>
	Furthermore there is the non-restrictive glider takeoff and 
climb procedures at St-Jean compared to the restrictive ones 
imposed by the Chicoutimi airport authorities as a result of the 
noise concerns of St-Honoré residents.
<P>
	In conclusion, flight safety is our number one consideration. 
This proposed move would not have been recommended if we 
had any concerns over flight safety.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Let me express season's 
greetings to Canadians from coast to coast to coast.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To all Canadians, from coast to coast, season's greetings.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 38 the motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, 
pursuant to order made earlier today, the House stands 
adjourned until Monday, February 6, 1995 at 11 a.m. pursuant to 
Standing Orders 28 and 24.
