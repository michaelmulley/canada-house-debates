Restigouche-Chaleur had a chance to live a wonderful 
experience this summer in the young entrepreneurs program.

	Under a Canada-New Brunswick agreement on the

up a business. I congratulate these young people on their desire 
to contribute to the economic future of our country.

	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Ontario 
Minister of Finance has suggested that provincial sales taxes be 
transferred to the federal government, and the provinces be 
given a larger share of income tax in return. It is ridiculous to 
think that Quebec would agree to give up the area of taxation and 
its $5.7 billion in provincial sales taxes.
<P>
	It is also ridiculous to think that all the provinces share the 
same economic reality. Blanket solutions will no longer work. 
Furthermore, some provinces, such as Alberta and 
Newfoundland, have already pointed out that Ontario's proposal 
did not reflect their situation. The Bloc Quebecois is proposing a 
much more flexible solution, which would make it possible to 
eliminate considerable overlap. They suggest transferring the 
GST to those provinces who request it, with an equivalent 
reduction in provincial transfer payments.

issue, the current threat to freedom of speech in this Parliament.
<P>
	We are witnessing the decline of dialogue when a member in 
this House can be accused of hate mongering for expressing 
what she feels are the views of the majority of Canadians and 
which are rooted in her personal convictions.
<P>
	No member of this House should be afraid of expressing their 
point of view because of a threat of being labelled as a bigot. 
Nothing shuts down dialogue and the freedom of debate more 
quickly than labelling.
<P>
	It is extremely important to all Canadians that in the shaping 
of public policy alternate points of view must never be 
suppressed but must be allowed free expression.
<P>
	Members of this House must never fear to speak out in 
defence of the views of their constituents, the convictions of 
their conscience or on behalf of the concerns of Canadians.

erroneous basis of foreign investors' concern and get down to

best attitude still prevails. You can change the name from Tory 
to Liberal but the game seems to remain the same.
<P>
	The GST, FTA and NAFTA, to name a few, were shoved down 
the throats of Canadians by virtue of the fact that the we know 
best attitude was a hallmark of the Tory government. Now the 
Minister of Justice has effectively put his government in the 
same category by publicly proclaiming that any proposed gun 
legislation will not be determined by a head count. The justice 
minister does not take a head count. He is not influenced by 
numbers nor the message behind them.
<P>
	Democracy does not prevail because the philosophy of the 
Liberal cabinet is that it and not Canadians knows best.
<P>
	What can Canadians do about this atrocity? Their only 
recourse is to wait until the next election and remove this 
government from power as decisively as they removed the 
Tories from office in the last election.

<P>
	Domestic violence is a harsh reality which we can no longer 
choose to ignore. The report published by Statistics Canada 
found that one in three abused wives said they feared for their 
lives at some point in their relationship and that one in five 
abused women said that the assaults occurred while they were 
pregnant.
<P>
	These figures are horrifying. A man who uses his size and 
strength to assault or otherwise abuse a woman is not only a 
coward but a criminal. I challenge all Canadians to speak out at 
every opportunity, declaring that there is no excuse for abuse.

oppose this motion. They are familiar with the provincial public 
financing legislation in operation in Quebec since 1977 and 
should appreciate this basic democratic tool. By voting against 
the motion we tabled in this House, they show how little they 
care about the democratization of politics in Canada, which 
certainly does not do them credit.

neurosciences.
<P>
	In addition, the Bank of Commerce appointed a 
vice-president of learning organizations and leadership 
development. The function of this position is to provide a means

	We have reached the time when banks and other institutions 
will not measure worth exclusively in terms of tangible assets. 
Rather, the assets of the future will also be based on intellectual 
innovation and invention.

<P>

commitment to this fight as well as policies which will seriously 
address it.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="1992REFERENDUM">1992 REFERENDUM</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister said in the House last week that, and 
I quote: ``no trace of any commitment was found'' to reimburse 
Quebec for the expenses incurred in the referendum on the 
Charlottetown Accord. The truth is that there are not just traces 
but documents, including a letter dated December 15, 1993, 
from Mr. Bourassa, the Premier of Quebec at the time, to the 
then Prime Minister of Canada. This letter followed three other 
letters on the same subject to the federal Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Why did the Prime Minister hide these letters from the House 
and the public?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
did not hide anything from the House. I said that in the 
government's files I found no commitment by Mr. Mulroney's 
Conservative government indicating that it would compensate 
the Government of Quebec. I was aware that requests had been 
made, and I did not make a secret of that. Some were made 
publicly. I knew that Mr. Bourassa had talked about this in the 
National Assembly. But what I did not find is a commitment 
from the federal government. I got in touch with Mr. Mulroney 
to ask him whether he had made a commitment. I wrote him a 
letter about this, and I am waiting for his reply.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I may refer everyone to <I>Hansard</I> for September 22, 
where the Prime Minister says that no trace of any commitment 
was found. He knows perfectly well that to prove the existence 
of a commitment, one needs witnesses, and when the witness is 
one the parties, the case is clear. The letter dated December 15, 
1993, which Mr. Bourassa sent to the Prime Minister, contains 
clear and irrefutable evidence of an agreement between Mr. 
Bourassa and Mr. Mulroney.
<P>
	For the benefit of the Prime Minister, I will read an extract 
from this letter, in which Mr. Bourassa says: ``The Chief 
Electoral Officer of Quebec has established that the direct cost 
of the referendum for the Government of Quebec as $47.2 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6255"> 6255 </A></B>
<P>
million. That is the basis of our claim for federal compensation, 
which was transmitted to the federal Minister of Finance by Mr. 
Gérald-D. Lévesque on May 7, 1993.'' The letter goes on  to 
say: ``Unfortunately, no payment could be made before Mr. 
Mulroney left.'' Now for the crucial passage: ``although Mr. 
Mulroney indicated last March that Quebec would be fairly 
compensated in this respect''. How can the Prime Minister deny 
the existence of an agreement, considering Mr. Bourassa's own 
very clear testimony which he put down in writing?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Mr. Bourassa and Mr. Gérald-D. Lévesque wrote to the 
government about this. I am aware of that. The Minister of 
Finance also discussed the matter with the Minister of Finance 
of Canada. This is about a request, a claim made by Quebec. It is 
not a commitment. A commitment exists when the federal 
government agrees to pay. However, there is no indication in any 
document that the government agreed to do so. If conversations 
took place between Mssrs. Mulroney and Bourassa, I would be 
delighted to know what they were about. I called Mr. Mulroney, 
who did not give me an answer, but perhaps the Leader of the 
Opposition, who knows Mr. Mulroney very well, could call him 
and ask him whether he gave his consent, yes or no.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask hon. members to make their 
questions and answers as brief as possible.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Robert Bourassa, in the course of his duties as premier 
and bound by his oath of office, testifies in this letter to the 
existence of an agreement and a commitment made by his 
counterpart, the federal Prime Minister. That is the truth.
<P>
	On September 22 in this House, the Prime Minister 
challenged the Bloc Quebecois to give him, and I quote: ``proof 
that my predecessor and the previous government made a 
commitment, and we will gladly pay''. Here is the proof. Now, 
pay.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would not advise the Leader of the Opposition to go back to 
practising law, if he makes statements like that.
<P>
	He says that Mr. Bourassa said that Mr. Mulroney-whom 
you know very well, who took you at your word and then you 
went back on it-told him such and such a thing. I do not doubt 
that Mr. Bourassa wrote the letter, since I read it. However, I 
asked the Privy Council to go through all the documentation. 
Was there anything in writing? Did a discussion take place in 
cabinet or elsewhere to confirm this letter? I was told that 
nothing could be found.
<P>
	I called Mr. Mulroney and I told him: Mr. Mulroney, I am 
sending you a letter with a request to clarify the situation. He 
said that he would reply very shortly. I said in the House that if 
there was a commitment, it would be respected, and if there was 
no commitment, you can blame Mr. Mulroney.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
December 15, 1993, Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa wrote the 
Prime Minister of Canada, the hon. member for Saint-Maurice, 
to confirm the existence of a verbal agreement between himself 
and the former Prime Minister of Canada. This letter was signed 
and dated December 15.
<P>
	Following the questions Bloc Quebecois members have been 
asking in this House for several months on this subject, could 
the Prime Minister not have shown good will by checking with 
Mr. Mulroney, right after Mr. Bourassa made the request, if he 
really wanted to be fair to Quebecers? Should he not have done 
so a long time ago instead of waiting for the opposition to force 
his hand a few days ago?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the opposition says that there was an agreement. In my opinion, 
any agreement requires the consent of both parties. We found no 
evidence that the former government gave its consent. We 
recently asked Mr. Mulroney. We asked Privy Council officials 
and others who worked with these former first ministers, and 
they told us that there never was a commitment.
<P>
	I went one step further: I called Mr. Mulroney himself. I 
talked to him on the telephone and he told me that he would 
confirm his position in writing. Once we know his position, we 
will take action. If he made promises to Mr. Bourassa, I will be 
very happy to honour them. If he did not make promises at the 
time and personally refused to pay when he was leading the 
government, I am not responsible for the actions of another 
government that did not want to pay. I was not involved in this 
matter.
<P>
	I would like to say to the opposition that Alberta and British 
Columbia also wanted to hold provincial referendums but, under 
the circumstances, they preferred, to avoid the costs involved 
and to be sure they would get paid, to have the referendum held 
under federal legislation.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, given the 
attitude of the officials surrounding the Prime Minister who 
have been playing hide-and-seek for several months in this 
matter and the fact that the Prime Minister of Canada questions 
the very word of the former Quebec premier, does the Prime 
Minister not agree that his attitude, far from being a sign of 
co-operation with Quebec, points to a conspiracy against that 
province?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
prime minister cannot act alone. The opposition would be the 
first to blame me if I took on financial commitments without 
cabinet and Treasury Board approval. Of course, if I give my 
word, they will honour it; on the other hand, legally, without a 
cabinet decision and Treasury Board approval, there can be no 
government commitment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6256"> 6256 </A></B>
<P>
	If Mr. Mulroney made a personal promise to Mr. Bourassa, 
I will go before my Cabinet to ensure that the word of the 
former Prime Minister is honoured, even though he did not act 
prudently. If he promised something without having it approved 
by Treasury Board and the government then in office, I will not 
act illegally without the approval of cabinet, Treasury Board 
and my party.

<P>
	We are helping young children to have a better life by making 
sure they are nurtured. We are helping young people get an 
education so they will have the skills for the future job market. 
We are providing security for older workers and we are helping 
our senior citizens.
<P>
	As a country we have to stay strongly committed to the 
provision of an effective and improved social security system. 
This is the reason we will next week be putting forward a series 
of options, directions for Canadians to take a look at so they can 
become involved in the important debate as to the kind of social 
programs we want, how we will pay for it and how we make sure 
we improve them. That is the reason we are doing it.
<P>
	I hope the hon. member will actively participate in that 
debate, unlike some of her colleagues who are saying let us not 
have a debate at all.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, seniors 
and those planning to retire want to know if their government 
pensions are safe and secure and who will pay for the programs 
that retiring Canadians have been counting on?
<P>
	Will the minister's action plan deal with the reality that there 
will be a 40 per cent increase in the number of senior citizens in 
the next 15 years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, the social security review that 
we will be launching next week deals primarily with matters of 
the workplace, with matters of lifelong learning and income 
security.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member should recall we made very explicit in last 
February's budget that programs pertaining to the question of 
old age security and the Canadian pension plan were not being 
touched as part of this review.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance clearly indicated that we would be 
preparing and releasing a discussion paper to show what the 
demographic changes would be and what the long term impacts 
would be on some of our income security papers. That kind of 
analysis is now under way. It is the kind of thing that has to be 
shared with all Canadians to make sure we can reason together 
on very important issues.
<P>
	Once again I invite the hon. member to participate in a 
constructive way in that debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister should realize that Canadians cannot prepare an 
informed response to his action plan unless they understand the 
financial consequences.
<P>
	Will the minister help all Canadians deal with this reality by 
providing detailed financial projections next week with all the 
elements of his action plan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I could begin right at this 
moment to give Canadians one set of analyses. I heard the hon. 
member, in a press conference the Reform Party held, talk about 
a cut of $15 billion in social programs. A $15 billion cut would 
mean the total elimination of all assistance for children, all 
social services for seniors and all assistance for higher 
education from the federal level.
<P>
	In other words, the Reform Party's fiscal program would wipe 
out assistance for children, young people and workers. We do 
not need that kind of fiscal program.

UI benefits.

harmful effects on children?

doing so we will not only fulfil a commitment and provide for a 
matter of fundamental justice, but we will also bring the federal 
statute into conformity with eight provincial human rights acts, 
some of which date back to 1977 on that topic. We will have the 
federal law conform with what the courts have in any event been 
reading into the act for many years.
<P>
	In the view of this government it is about time that our federal 
statute reflect the reality in Canada.

that they should not travel in certain areas or that if they 
absolutely have to, they should see their doctor prior to leaving 
the country.

continue to be very vigilant and monitor what is happening. I 
have asked that all flights from India be met at international

	<B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 34, I have the honour to present to 
the House, in both official languages, the report of the joint 
parliamentary delegation's visit to Australia from June 26 to 
July 4, 1994.
<P>
	This visit took us to four communities: Canberra, Longreach, 
Brisbane and Sydney. As guests of the Australian Senate and 
House of Representatives, we were provided with the 
opportunity to meet and discuss matters with numerous 
parliamentarians, many of whom were ministers, both at the 
federal and state levels. Our discussions covered a wide range of 
topics: international affairs, including APEC, GATT, NAFTA, 
UN peacekeeping, economic and taxation issues, including the 
GST, aboriginal affairs, federal-state relations and 
employment, agricultural and educational issues, just to name a 
few.
<P>
	I know I speak for all the members of the delegation when I 
say that we felt as if we were still at home in Canada because of 
the numerous similarities between our two countries.
<P>
	Let me conclude by drawing the House's attention to a 
recommendation put forward by an Australian counterpart, the 
hon. Andrew Peacock. Mr. Peacock felt very strongly that 
because Canada and Australia have so much in common and so 
many areas in which expertise  can be shared and exchanged, 
some form of mechanism or association should be created to 
ensure that this type of exchange between Australian and 
Canadian parliamentarians takes place on a more frequent and 
regular basis.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	In closing, Mr. Speaker, I wish to express our gratitude to the 
Hon. Michael Beahan, President of the Senate and your 
counterpart, the Hon. Stephen Martin, Speaker of the House of 
Representatives for being such gracious hosts; Mrs. Carol 
Richardson, Australian Parliamentary Officer, who worked so 
hard and successfully on our program; and finally to Mr. 
Michael Berry, Canadian High Commissioner, and Mr. Gardiner 
Wilson, Canadian Deputy High Commissioner, who provided 
the delegation with much appreciated advice and support.

am pleased to report to the House that the Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs has studied private members' 
business and has reported that one motion and one bill should be 
made votable.

the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs which 
is deemed adopted when it is laid upon the Table.
<P>

	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-275, an act respecting the protection and 
rehabilitation of endangered and threatened species.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this bill is to protect biodiversity. It is 
aimed at identifying, protecting and rehabilitating endangered 
and threatened species and is a step toward the overall 
protection of Canada's biodiversity.
<P>
	In addition to identifying, protecting and rehabilitating flora 
and fauna in Canada when threatened or endangered by human 
activity, the Minister of the Environment would also have 
powers to develop and implement programs to restore the

populations of threatened and endangered species to 
self-sustain the numbers.
<P>
	Combined with the Canada Wildlife Act, strengthened by 
amendments in June of this year, this bill is intended to help 
ensure the protection of Canada's biodiversity and to enhance 
the biodiversity convention adopted at the UN Conference on 
the Environment and Development held in Rio de Janiero in

Lester B. Pearson for his contribution to Canada, the

<P>
	Whereas the majority of Canadians believe that the privileges 
which society accords to heterosexual couples should not be 
extended to same sex relationships, and whereas societal 
approval including the extension of societal privileges would be 
given to same sex relationships if any amendment to the 
Canadian Human Rights Act were to include the undefined 
phrase sexual orientation as a ground for discrimination, these 
people petition Parliament not to amend the Human Rights Act 
or the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in any way which would

<HR>
<B><A NAME="6264"> 6264 </A></B>

tend to indicate societal approval of same sex  relationships or

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the next petition is with regard to euthanasia and concludes by

Criminal Code of Canada prohibiting assisted suicide be 
enforced vigorously and that Parliament make no changes in the 
law which would sanction or allow aiding or abetting suicide or 
active or passive euthanasia.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="LIBRARYBOOKPOSTALSUBSIDY">LIBRARY BOOK POSTAL SUBSIDY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my final petition comes mainly from the constituents in the 
Stockholm area of my riding who have a concern regarding 
Saskatchewan's public libraries.
<P>
	They would like to draw the attention of the House to the 
following: that the library book postal subsidy is necessary for 
the continued operation of interlending services among libraries 
and plays a vital role in the distribution of cultural materials; 
that cancellation of the subsidy or changes in the amount of the 
subsidy would result in severely hampering public access to 
information housed in libraries outside the resident's immediate 
area; that maintaining the subsidy is a more effective, more 
efficient use of public funds than any other alternative. 
Therefore your petitioners call upon Parliament to continue the 
library book postal subsidy and ensure that there be no further 
erosion in the resulting library book postal rate.

Columbia.
<P>
	It calls upon Parliament to urge the Government of Canada to 
ratify the law of the sea. Among the many reasons given for this 
very important step, Canadian failure to ratify the law of the sea

except in police states there is no evidence that the incidence of 
criminal or suicidal misuse of firearms is impeded by restrictive 
legislation, whereas Canadian citizens are already 
overburdened by unnecessary and ineffective gun control 
legislation, we humbly pray and call upon Parliament to desist

petition. It has been signed by 4,801 of my constituents.
<P>
	These petitioners draw the attention of the House to the 
following: that everyone has to be accountable for the mounting 
debt burden; that members of Parliament should demonstrate 
self-restraint to the citizens by cutting back on their lavish 
pensions; that the qualifying time period for an MP's pension is 
far too short; that the eligible age to receive an MP's pension is 
much too young; that by MPs setting such an example of 
restraint the tolerance of the citizens would be more 
forthcoming.

	The petitioners ask the government not to impose any new 
restriction regarding firearm acquisition certificates. They also 
ask Parliament to instruct the judicial system to implement 
current laws more strictly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I believe we should all focus our attention on the real root 
causes of crime which are embedded in discrimination, poverty, 
familial dysfunction, inadequate parental responsibility and a 
myriad of other socioeconomic problems rather than focus on 
firearm control, the effectiveness of which is very questionable 
at best.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	While the safety of our communities concerns us all, I think 
that the problem is put out of proportion. The fact remains that 
Canada is no more violent as a society than before and that 
criminal acts against people are not increasing uncontrollably. 
To instill fear in people's mind without any regard for the facts is 
despicable.

extradition of Leonard Peltier from Canada to the United States.
<P>
	These petitioners point out that the information provided at 
the time in the mid-seventies with respect to Mr. Peltier's case 
was fabricated by the U.S. authorities and that since that time 
new information has emerged that indicates that Leonard Peltier 
was not guilty of the crime for which he has spent the last 18 
years in prison.
<P>
	Therefore these petitioners request that Parliament hold an 
external review of the 1976 extradition hearings and that Mr.

the last government now nearly a year ago. The agreements 
turned over the development and operation of terminals 1 and 2 
at Lester B. Pearson international for 57 years to a group of 
private developers.
<P>
	The agreements were examined and were found not to be in 
the public interest. The facts in arriving at this determination 
can be stated very succinctly. The agreements as I indicated 
were signed just weeks before an election. They did not contain 
a cancellation clause when the government of the day had to 
know it was going to lose the election and the deal was being 
widely questioned. The agreement was for 57 years, 20 years 
more than the normal amortization period for buildings and the 
time normally associated with the recovery of this kind of an 
investment.
<P>
	The after tax rate of return has been estimated by some at 14.2 
per cent. However, this figure does not take into account profits 
the individual partners would have realized on contracts they 
held with the partnership. The actual rate of return for the 
partners in this deal would be more in the order of 28 per cent.
<P>
	The original tender period was for 90 days, then it was 
extended to 120 days. The submissions that were received 
covered thousands of pages of technical and financial 
information because the process in effect had granted an 
enormous advantage to those companies that had lobbied the 
government for the project. They had made their preparations 
and they were ready when the tender call was issued.
<P>
	One of the proponents had commenced lobbying to achieve 
the privatization of these terminals in mid-1989, had submitted 
an unsolicited proposal, offered policy advice to then ministers 
of the crown. Surely this is not a normal tendering process or 
acceptable practice.
<P>
	The Leader of the Official Opposition, now the Prime 
Minister, indicated clearly before the election and while this 
deal was being consummated that the deal would be reviewed.
<P>
	I could go on with the list of unusual elements in this process 
that Mr. Nixon described in his report as flawed. I do not really 
think it is of much use at this stage. We have gone through it over 
and over again.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6267"> 6267 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to point out today that Canadians generally and voters 
in the metro Toronto area particularly understood the flaws in 
the deal were enough to reject it, and they did so massively. 
That is one on the major and principal reasons why the Liberals 
took every seat in metro in that election last fall. If no one else 
understood it, the voters knew a tender process is generally 
designed to provide a winner and some losers. The previous 
government cooked up a process which produced a winning 
loser and losing winner. Rather than permitting the merger of 
a financially strapped winner with a wealthy loser, as it turned 
out, a new tender call obviously would have been what was 
appropriate.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	One of the hired guns for the consortium has described Bill 
C-22 as an act worthy only of a banana republic. I contend quite 
the contrary because Bill C-22 provides for the correction of 
actions that are characteristic of what goes on in so-called 
banana republics.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government is firmly committed to reject the ways of the 
former government. This transaction is riddled with 
interference by lobbyists, favouritism, behind-the-scenes 
wheeling and dealing, manipulation of legitimate private 
interests and disregard for public service impartiality. As a 
whole, it is unacceptable.
<P>
	The government intends to protect the country's interests and 
the tqaxpayers' dollars. We believe that matters that can 
jeopardize our economy and our competitiveness as a country 
should be negotiated under a transparent and accessible process.
<P>
	In legislating an end to these agreements, the government 
took several factors into account: the need for a quick decision 
on future requirements at Pearson, once these agreements were 
set aside; the government's commitment to put public interest 
before favouritism and the quest for excessive profits; and the 
fact athat the private sector would have gained control of one of 
the most important assets in the field of transportation by means 
of an arrangement that would have generated unreasonable 
profits for a favoured few.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On July 13 I announced a national airport policy that would 
ensure the existence of a safe, efficient, competitive network of 
airports across the country and would be managed in the best 
interest of Canadian taxpayers and the travelling public.
<P>
	However the opportunity to benefit from the advice and 
competence of dedicated people representing regional and local 
interest is being denied to Lester B. International Airport, owing 
to the cloud that these agreements cast.
<P>
	There are some in this place who would have us believe that if 
the matter is before the courts for years somehow we could do 
what would be done in the other airports across the country 
through Canadian airport authorities. One would have to be very 
naive to think that any group of citizens would take on the 
operation of terminal 1 and terminal 2 while all the threat of 
litigation and all that could imply hung out there for months and 
in fact years, knowing the size and the magnitude of the 
problem.
<P>
	Terminals 1 and 2 at Toronto Pearson airport need upgrading. 
I agree with my hon. friend opposite on that. The parking 
garages are in a deplorable state. Safety and security are being 
put in question. The list is long of what has to be done at 
Pearson. The opportunity to provide travellers with newer, safer 
and more modern services is being denied to users of Pearson.
<P>
	We have stated time and time again that it is our intention to 
treat the T1 T2 Limited Partnership in a fair and equitable 
manner considering the circumstances. We have recognized that 
not all the partners were involved to the same extent in this 
flawed process and that private sector companies not part of the 
consortium should not be unduly penalized.
<P>
	We have asked that the partnership submit their out of pocket 
expenses as well as those of third parties. We wish and we 
undertake to see to it that all parties are repaid funds they have 
spent consistent with good business practice, but we will not 
compensate for lobbyist fees and charges.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	I am aware of the need for public accountability on the matter. 
I know members of the House of Commons, the Auditor 
General, the public accounts committee and the interested 
parties, the people who have the taxpayers' interest at heart, will 
review whatever decision is made by the government to pay 
those legitimate out of pocket expenses. I welcome that 
thorough review because I understand my responsibilities in the 
matter.
<P>
	Members of the House of Commons must understand that the 
out of pocket expenses were for financiers, planners, engineers, 
managers and designers. Not a single dime was spent on steel, 
concrete, lumber, escalators or other services normally 
associated with airport operations. Clearly the out of pocket 
expenses did not enhance the value of the property or provide 
any benefits to the taxpayer or the traveller.
<P>
	Responsibility to the taxpayer and fairness toward T 1 T 2 
Limited Partnership and third parties is what Bill C-22 is about.
<P>
	Let us take a look at the amount of the bill the Tory majority of 
members in the other place want to foist on Canadian taxpayers. 
The consortium has replied to our request for its appropriate out 
of pocket expenses by submitting claims to the Canadian people 
for approximately $445 million. Of this amount, $415 million 
represent loss of profits to the consortium or its  partners in 
various third party capacities. The consortium is not interested 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6268"> 6268 </A></B>
<P>
in fair compensation; it wants to sting the Canadian public for 
over $400 million.
<P>
	I have to ask all colleagues in the House and Canadians if they 
think the Conservative majority in the other place is being 
responsible when it says it is not concerned about the 
consequences of its action as far as money goes. It claims that all 
it is interested in is the principle of the bill. How can anyone be 
so irresponsible with taxpayers' dollars?
<P>
	I thank my Liberal colleagues in the other place. We have 
been through a lot on the bill; a lot has been said. I have the 
greatest respect for those members in the other place, including 
independent members who mounted a stout defence of the 
legislation and have spoken eloquently to protect the interests of 
Canadian taxpayers. I know those people with their hearts and 
their heads in the right place will rise to the occasion again.
<P>
	As for those who presently hold the majority they cling to in 
the other place, their method of dealing with the issue does not 
improve my opinion of them, which should not come as a 
surprise to anyone.
<P>
	I sincerely believe Canadians in every part of the country who 
support every political party represented in the House will be 
outraged when they understand the size and the amount of the 
bill the Tory majority in the other place is planning to drop on 
them. The bill for their defeat of Bill C-22 will be $445 million.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What is the Reform Party going to do?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Since my colleague refers to it, are my friends in 
the Reform Party prepared to go along? I have listened carefully 
in the months we have spent in the House together. Time and 
time again we disagree on some issues, but on one issue I think 
we have a lot in common. I have tried to do some things at 
Transport Canada that will improve services to the Canadian 
public but reduce the burden on the Canadian taxpayer. I think 
we understand what we are trying to achieve together.
<P>
	It is not just a question of principle or of letting people go to 
the courts or of trying to have due process and all the rest of the 
things we hear talked about. We are talking about Canadian 
taxpayers faced with cuts being levelled at them by every 
government in the country, no matter what their political stripe. 
Cuts are being requested of us by members of the official 
opposition and the Reform Party. We understand that.
<P>
	I cannot believe anyone would agree with those in the other 
place who say they do not care that their amendments would put 
at risk hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money. Do 
they believe or does anyone believe Canadian taxpayers should 
be asked to compensate developers for 57 years worth of lost 
profits because they cooked up a deal with the Conservative 
government that days later lost every seat in the greater Toronto 
area and only held on to two of them in the whole country? Tory 
senators do not want us to settle for  out of pocket and reasonable 
expenses. They want $445 million on this last trip to the trough 
for their friends.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	I cannot believe that at least some of the Conservative 
senators in the other place will not understand that Parliament 
cannot condone this outrageous raid on Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The leader of the Liberal Party, now Prime Minister of 
Canada, warned all the parties not to sign the agreement. If the 
promoters were so sure that this was a good deal for Canada, 
why did they not wait and try to convince a new government and 
the public? Was it because they knew their friends were going to 
lose if there was no cancellation clause in the contract?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our government is pledged to dealing with the private sector 
in an open, fair and responsible manner; but we will always take 
the taxpayers' interest into account. Our decision to cancel this 
contract came after a clear and absolutely unequivocal signal to 
all parties that abuses of the political process and practices we 
consider to be unacceptable would not be tolerated. Last minute 
deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars rammed through the 
system in many instances against the will of members of the 
public service will not be rubber stamped.
<P>
	The facts I have outlined today and the details we have 
learned in our negotiations to compensate out of pocket 
expenses have all contributed to my resolve to see the bill passed 
into law unamended.
<P>
	The House passed Bill C-22 to ensure the future of Pearson 
International Airport. The government is willing to consider 
paying an amount up to $30 million. It is a lot of money. We 
understand our commercial obligations and the need for the 
crown to respect appropriate undertakings.
<P>
	We have looked at the claims and we think a fair analysis of 
reasonable business practices will allow us to compensate up to 
$30 million to both the developers and third parties for the 
reasonable out of pocket expenses that are at the core of the bill.
<P>
	The majority in the other place wants the Canadian taxpayer 
put in the position of having to fork over maybe $445 million. 
The distinction is simple. The House recognized the need to 
right a blatant wrong. The House recognized the need to 
formally make the odious contract null and void. The House 
recognized the need to return the parties to their pre-contract 
status and to cover their legitimate out of pocket expenses 
incurred in the ordinary course of business.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6269"> 6269 </A></B>
<P>
	The other place, I regret to say, in its majority decision to 
bring in these amendments has ignored the interest of 
Canadians. It has amended the bill so as, if we accepted those 
amendments, to force the dispute into the courts where no one 
in the House or in the other place would then have anything 
to say about them. Then it would be a matter for the courts to 
decide on legal interpretation and on argument how much the 
bill would be for Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	I am not prepared to run that risk. I hope a majority of my 
colleagues in the House and a majority of senators in the other 
place will not run that risk either.
<P>
	One has to ask whether the Tory scheme all along was to 
ignore what was patently obvious in October 1993 and to set the 
scene to make one last snatch at the public purse. Quite a money 
grab it would be. If the majority of the other place perseveres 
and wins this case, this scheme could result in the biggest 
rip-off in Canadian history, $445 million of taxpayers' money.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I want to assure my friends through you that the 
government is not going to play Russian roulette with the Tory 
majority in the other place with half a billion dollars of 
Canadian taxpayers' money on the table. That is simply not an 
option.
<P>
	This deal resembles what might have been done in a banana 
republic by a dying government during its last gasps. There is no 
doubt and I readily admit it that this bill is an extraordinary 
measure to bring before Parliament but I do not believe that 
anyone in their right mind would deny that this was an 
extraordinary deal and it has to be undone.
<P>
	It is time to get on with the business of providing the country 
with a safe, efficient and affordable national airport system with 
Lester B. Pearson International Airport at Toronto at the centre 
of this hub.
<P>
	It is time to get on with the future of Canada's largest and most 
important transportation facility and it is time that the 
Conservative majority in the other place recognized that 
Canadians understood that this was a bad deal and agreed that it 
has to be dealt with resolutely.
<P>
	We intend to ensure that Canadian taxpayers are not going to 
get a $445 million bill from the consortium and their friends in 
the other place.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues in the House of 
Commons from all parties to join with us in sending a clear 
message to the Senate that Parliament will protect the interests 
of Canadians and that Bill C-22 must be passed without 
amendments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I 
begin my speech, I would like to address a few comments to the 
minister before he leaves. I hope that he will find it in his code of 
ethics to hear what I have to say despite his busy schedule. I 
would like to address three points of his speech.
<P>
	First of all, if it were not for the calendar in front of me 
confirming this is September 28, 1994, I could have sworn we 
were back in 1990, when the Liberal opposition in this House 
was criticizing former Conservative Prime Minister Brian 
Mulroney for appointing new senators to ram the GST bill 
through the other place. An action considered offensive.
<P>
	Now the shoe is on the other foot, with the Conservatives in 
the majority in the other place. The Liberals did make use of 
their majority in the Senate when the time came to oppose the 
GST bill. This is the first comment I wanted to make.
<P>
	My second comment is that throughout the election 
campaign, the Bloc Quebecois candidates stressed 
repeatedly-I know I did 250 times a day in my riding of 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans-the fact that Liberal or 
Conservative, it is one and the same. We have proof of that today 
in this debate and when we hear the minister's remarks about the 
Conservative majority in the other place.
<P>
	The third comment I wanted to make concerns the answer the 
minister gave me when questioned in a meeting of the Standing 
Committee on Transport. He said I knew full well that as part of 
the Auditor General review process, all compensation granted 
could undergo scrutiny. I just want to point out to the hon. 
minister that all this auditing by the Auditor General takes place 
after the fact. After irregularities have been detected, the 
Auditor General tables three books confirming they took place, 
but nothing can be done about it. That is why the Bloc Quebecois 
called for the creation of a royal inquiry commission that could 
have shed light on this whole matter.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	The minister revisited this issue in his speech today and 
apparently said that various institutions would shed light on this 
but only after the fact, after compensation has been paid. Of 
course, if no compensation is paid, the problem vanishes.
<P>
	On June 14, I addressed this House at the second reading of 
Bill C-22 and asked that a royal commission be mandated to 
shed light on the contract awarded to Pearson Development 
Corporation. I put all my heart and energy in that speech, 
because I really thought it was my last opportunity to sensitize 
the House to this deal which was, if not illegal, at least highly 
questionable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6270"> 6270 </A></B>
<P>
	Although I disagree with the amendments proposed by the 
Senate, I am still happy to have another opportunity to rise in 
this House to try once again to shed light on a deal the current 
Prime Minister himself promised to cancel before he was 
elected, but I cannot understand how the deal can be scrapped 
without getting to the bottom of this, once and for all.
<P>
	I must tell you that I had several opportunities in the Standing 
Committee on Transport to state, and I repeat it in this House, 
we heard a few witnesses who agreed to appear before us, before 
the transport committee. Still, even today, Canadians, 
Quebecers and transport committee members cannot really say 
that all the light has been shed on this deal.
<P>
	My argumentation will revolve around three main themes. 
First, the interference of an unelected house in an elected 
house's decisions; second, the compensation to be paid to 
Pearson Development Corporation; and third, the steps to be 
taken to shed light on this shady deal.
<P>
	Since the beginning, since Bill C-22 was tabled, the Bloc 
Quebecois, of which I am the transport critic, has been against 
paying any compensation to the developer before we find out the 
truth about this deal.
<P>
	Under the bill passed by the House of Commons, the 
developer cannot go to the courts to obtain compensation from 
the government. The Minister of Transport-remember the 
clause in Bill C-22-reserved the right to set the amount of any 
compensation to be paid. That is why we are still opposed to the 
principle of Bill C-22.
<P>
	The other place rose up against this bill and declared that the 
position taken by the House of Commons was unconstitutional. 
It has asked that Clauses 7 and 8 of the bill be deleted. As you 
may recall, these clauses prevent the developers from initiating 
court proceedings. What right does an unelected house such as 
the other place have to reject the democratic decisions made by 
this House whose members have been democratically elected by 
the people?
<P>
	I could perhaps take this opportunity to comment on the 
actions of a representative of the other place appointed by the 
government party, a former president of the Liberal Party, 
former leader of the Liberal Party of Manitoba, former Leader of 
the Opposition in Winnipeg, former killer of the Meech Lake 
accord, who bluntly stated that the elected members of this 
House were people with little education or at least less education 
than the members of the other place. I say to this representative 
of the other place that we at least have been elected by the people 
and not appointed because of our friendship with the Liberal 
Party of Canada, as she was.
<P>
	That is outrageous and offensive. It really shows the urgent 
need to abolish the other place, especially since it has been using 
senators appointed by the Conservative government that was 
repudiated by the people in the last  election to prevent 
democratically elected members of Parliament like myself from 
making essential decisions.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to any 
compensation to Pearson Development Corporation as long as 
all the facts surrounding this issue are not known, and I want to 
tell the members of this House why it is important to shed light 
on this case.
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, I represent my party on the 
Standing Committee on Transport. It is important to point out 
that, contrary to what Mr. Greg Weston wrote in the <I>Ottawa 
Citizen</I>, it is the Bloc Quebecois which submitted to the 
transport committee a list of 18 witnesses to appear before that 
committee, this after our request for a commission of inquiry 
was turned down by the House of Commons.
<P>
	Contrary to what Mr. Weston wrote in the same newspaper, 
the Bloc Quebecois is also the one which tabled motions to 
subpoena those who had refused to appear before the committee. 
It is unfortunate that a journalist would not recognize the good 
work done by the Bloc Quebecois in its role as Official 
Opposition. Instead, that person chose to give the credit to the 
Reform Party which, as the hon. member for Kootenay 
West-Revelstoke admitted, simply could not believe what was 
happening.
<P>
	I want to confirm once again that the Bloc Quebecois did 
submit a list of witnesses that it felt should be heard by the 
transport committee. That list contains 18 names. Here are those 
names, as well as the reasons why we wanted these people to 
testify and shed light on the whole issue.
<P>
	The first person on the list is Mr. Peter Coughlin, President of 
Pearson Development Corporation. The second one is Mr. Leo 
Kolber, a Liberal representative in the other place, who was an 
administrator of Claridge when the agreements were signed, this 
according to the <I>Financial Post Directory of Directors</I>. Mr. 
Kolber had organized, at his residence in Westmount, a 
$1,000-per-guest reception attended, among others, by Mr. 
Charles Bronfman, where the current Prime Minister of Canada 
showed up, in early October of last year, right in the middle of 
the election campaign.
<P>
	The third person we wanted to hear was Mr. Herb Metcalfe, a 
lobbyist with Capital Hill, as well as an official of Claridge 
Properties and a former organizer for the current Prime Minister 
of Canada. There was also Mr. Ramsey Withers, a Liberal with 
close ties to the current Prime Minister who was Deputy 
Minister of Transport when the call for tenders was made for 
Terminal III at Pearson airport, as reported in the <I>Ottawa 
Citizen</I>, on September 26, 1993. And there was Mr. Otto Jelinek, 
a former Conservative minister who is now president of the 
Asian affiliate of the Matthews group.
<P>
	Then, there was Mr. Don Matthews, who was president of 
Brian Mulroney's nomination campaign in 1983; he is also a 
former president of the Conservative Party and a  former 
president of the Conservative fund-raising campaign, as 
reported in the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>, on September 29, 1993. We also 
wanted to hear Mr. Ray Hession, a former Deputy Minister of 
Industry and senior civil servant at Supply and Services, where 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6271"> 6271 </A></B>
<P>
contracts are awarded-sometimes, maybe, to friends of the 
government, since it might be helpful during an election 
campaign. He was appointed president of Paxport and hired all 
the lobbyists who were to work on the privatization project for 
Paxport Inc. This Mr. Hession left his job as president in 
December 1992, after Paxport's bid was accepted by the federal 
government. He was to be replaced by Don Matthews's son, 
Jack, as reported in the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>, on September 26, 1993.
<P>
	There was also Mr. Fred Doucet, a Conservative lobbyist and 
Brian Mulroney's former chief of staff. He was also a senior 
advisor during Kim Campbell's campaign and was hired by Jack 
Matthews five days after Mr. Hession left his job as president. 
Three weeks later, Paxport created a consortium with its rival, 
Claridge Properties. Then there was Mr. Jean Corbeil, a former 
Conservative transport minister, who signed the agreement 
while all the attention was focused on the leaders' debate, 
during the election campaign. He had been Minister of 
Transport for less than three months but, already, there were 
information leaks to the effect that he was bent on privatizing 
Pearson airport.
<P>
	Then there was Mr. Robert Nixon, the investigator appointed 
by the current Prime Minister, who recommended that the 
contract be cancelled and who is a former Treasurer of Ontario 
under the Liberal government of Mr. Peterson, as well as a 
former leader of the Ontario Liberal Party.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	There was also Ms. Kim Campbell. Internal documents given 
to her last August supposedly described the risks associated 
with the transaction, and in particular the fee increase for 
carriers, which would have cost taxpayers a lot of money.
<P>
	We also asked the Standing Committee on Transport to 
summon the current Minister of Transport, and this request was 
agreed to.
<P>
	We made all those requests not only to get the information I 
referred to earlier, but also to prove that, despite the fact that 
lobbyist fees are not compensated under this bill, taxpayers will 
still have to pay part of the expenses incurred by the 
corporations to make up for the lost tax revenues due to the 
corporate tax exemption for lobbying services.
<P>
	What we wanted to ask the minister and what we did manage 
to ask him was: How can you justify the involvement of 
taxpayers in a patronage transaction? This fact alone justifies a 
public inquiry.
<P>
	Also, the Minister of Transport himself stated that lobbying 
services should not be tax deductible, as reported by the <I>Ottawa 
Citizen</I> on March 9, 1994.
<P>
	We also wanted to hear from Air Canada representatives, who 
were involved in this deal, since the government negotiated a 
decrease in rent for the next few years in return for a 
commitment by the corporation to remain at terminals 1 and 2 at 
the Pearson airport in Toronto.
<P>
	We asked to hear from Mr. William Rowat, assistant deputy 
minister at Transport Canada, who was appointed by the past 
Clerk of the Privy Council to help move things along. You have 
to remember that he was appointed in March of 1993.
<P>
	We also asked to hear from Mr. Bob Wright, closely tied to the 
Liberal Party of Canada, who is negotiating, secretly of course, 
the compensation to be awarded to the consortium.
<P>
	We wanted to hear from the Toronto Airport Authority, a 
public agency similar to the Aéroports de Montréal 
organization, which wanted to be considered as a potential 
manager for Terminals 1 and 2, but claims to have been 
intentionally overlooked by the Conservatives.
<P>
	We asked to hear from Ms. Huguette Labelle and, finally, 
from Mr. Robert Vineberg, Pearson Development Corporation's 
lawyer and board member.
<P>
	In each and every one of these 18 cases, there were 
discussions in the committee on transport as to whether or not to 
call these witnesses before the committee. If the Liberals have 
nothing to hide, why did they refuse systematically to summon 
the people on our list so that we could clarify this deal?
<P>
	Let us start with Mr. Robert Nixon, a key player in this issue. 
Mr. Nixon was the one who carried out the inquiry into Pearson 
Development Corporation at the request of the current Liberal 
Prime Minister. Last November, he recommended that the deal 
signed by the Conservatives and the Pearson Development 
Corporation be declared void.
<P>
	Yet, the Liberals have refused to ask Mr. Nixon to appear 
before the committee on transport. Our resolution was defeated, 
four to two, by the Liberal majority. Is this normal? Do they 
have something to hide?
<P>
	As for Mr. Robert Wright, who is no less important than Mr. 
Nixon, the answer of the Liberal majority in the committee was 
the same: ``No.'' Believe it or not, only six of the 18 people I 
invited were heard by the committee. These were Mr. Ray 
Hession, the current Minister of Transport, Mr. Peter Coughlin, 
Mr. Don Matthews, someone from Air Canada and Mr. Robert 
Vineberg, representing Pearson Development Corporation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6272"> 6272 </A></B>
<P>
	I have used up all arguments to convince my colleagues from 
the committee to subpoena people on the Bloc Quebecois's list 
of witnesses. At that time, I remember very clearly the 
chairperson of the transport committee, the hon. member for 
Hamilton West, telling me: ``Come on, sir, you know perfectly 
well that this is a procedure which has not been used in Canada 
since 1917 or 1918''. But that was totally false. I sincerely hope 
that the chairperson of the Transport Committee did not 
knowingly try to mislead me because I checked and I found that 
that procedure was used in 1989, in 1990 and in 1992 to 
summon witnesses.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	There was even one instance, in 1989 or 1990, when the 
present government House leader used that special procedure to 
summon witnesses to appear before the committee. I sincerely 
hope that the chairperson of the Standing Committee on 
Transport was not acting in bad faith.
<P>
	I will give you another example. I told the committee 
members that since Leo Kolber was a parliamentarian from the 
other place, he would surely co-operate with us given his duties. 
Furthermore, at the time the contracts were signed, the <I>Ottawa 
Sun</I> reported that on October 10, 1993, that parliamentarian was 
a member of Claridge's board of directors and owned 60 per cent 
of the shares in Pearson Development Corporation.
<P>
	You have to admit that he was a key witness who could have 
helped us shed some light on the matter. On top of that, the 
<I>Ottawa Citizen</I> reported on November 9, 1993 that the same 
member of the other place had given a reception at $1,000 a 
plate in his Westmount residence at the beginning of October, a 
reception attended by Mr. Charles Bronfman, among others, and 
by the present Prime Minister who, at the time, was in the 
middle of his election campaign.
<P>
	If I had the time, I could also talk about the cleaning up of 
political party funding. We saw again, as recently as yesterday, 
that some people preferred to receive contributions from large 
firms rather than to have a clean election fund. The Bloc's 
position is clear and that is why the hon. member for Richelieu 
moved such an amendment.
<P>
	I could give other examples. All those arguments that I put 
forward were useless since my request was denied by the Liberal 
majority on the committee. I could also mention the case of Mr. 
Otto Jelinek, a former Conservative minister who is now 
president of the Asian subsidiary of the Matthews group. The 
answer was the same as in most other cases. The Liberal 
members on the Transport Committee told me that it would be 
premature to subpoena Mr. Jelinek since he intended to appear 
voluntarily.
<P>
	You will understand that, given the refusal of my Liberal 
colleagues to summon the people who could have helped this 
House understand the situation, I have no choice but to say that 
this matter is not transparent. I  wonder if the Liberals are 
protecting the same people as the Conservatives or some other 
people. I also wonder if it is possible that the friends and backers 
of the system contribute to the election funds of both old parties.
<P>
	What is troubling is that Canadians still do not know all the 
facts as to why the contract was awarded to Pearson 
Development Corporation. And I find it sad that the Liberal 
majority is enjoying hiding the truth.
<P>
	It must also be pointed out that if the Bloc Quebecois does not 
know all the facts, it cannot be expected to decide on the validity 
of the financial claims made by each of the concerned groups.
<P>
	When we look at the Nixon report, some words leave us with a 
bitter aftertaste. We could wonder what Mr. Nixon meant when 
referring to malversation in connection with lobbyists. Did he 
have any real evidence of this? Do you know anything about it, 
Mr. Speaker? If you do not know, I do not know either. No 
witness knows. Nobody but the opposition seems to want to 
know about it on the Hill. But then, who does know? We are 
being asked to make a decision involving the expenditure of tens 
of millions of dollars when nobody really knows what the Nixon 
report meant.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport spoke about criteria governing 
compensation claims. Could the minister make these criteria 
public? If he has nothing to hide, I am sure he will not hesitate to 
do so.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you are a lawyer and you know very well that due 
process was not followed by Mr. Nixon. In French law too there 
is the rule of audi alteram partem, the right of both parties in a 
case to be heard. I am sorry, but this rule does not seem to have 
been followed, no more than due process, by Mr. Nixon.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	It is unfortunate that the minister should rely on a report full 
of half-truths to request-and that is what he is doing under 
clause 10 of the bill-the authority to spend tens of millions of 
dollars.
<P>
	When will the minister launch a public inquiry to get right to 
the bottom of this matter? Several Liberal members approved of 
this inquiry, but they were gagged and had to toe the party line.
<P>
	If the government motion is passed, obviously the bill will be 
passed too, but would the Minister of Transport agree? For want 
of a public inquiry, I ask him once more to have the Standing 
Committee on Transport examine any agreement and make 
recommendations before he signs it. If the minister says that the 
agreement was rejected because it was not acceptable for 
Quebecers and Canadians, why not give elected representatives 
the opportunity to make the necessary recommendations? The 
government would demonstrate its openness. Otherwise, a 
feeling of frustration will linger, and doubts will remain in our 
mind and that of the public in Quebec and Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6273"> 6273 </A></B>
<P>
	The best way to protect reputations is visibility and openness, 
and a public inquiry. Of course such an inquiry will be costly and 
will take time, but I ask this House if democracy costs 
something. Is democracy too costly? Are the costs more 
important than living in a democracy? I am sorry, but democracy 
is priceless. You cannot put a price on getting the facts and 
spending taxpayers' money wisely.
<P>
	However, if the minister refuses to conduct a public inquiry 
because of costs and delays, he could ask a parliamentary 
committee to do it. Does the minister realize that the whole 
tendering process was botched? Consequently, will the minister 
take the necessary steps to prevent such a fiasco from happening 
again?
<P>
	The government could refuse to order a parliamentary 
committee or the Standing Committee on Transport to conduct a 
public inquiry; this would bring us back to square one. If that 
happens, can the minister tell us how long the compensation 
claims process will take? As we know, the Nixon Report 
mentioned obscure dealings by lobbyists. Since these schemes 
were not revealed to the public, can we fear that such scheming 
will taint the compensation process?
<P>
	At the transport committee hearings, when Robert Vineberg, 
Pearson Development Corporation's lawyer, appeared before 
us, I had prepared some very tough questions. If you do not 
believe me, you need only refer to the proceedings of the 
Standing Committee on Transport. It is an aberration. We had 
written to the representative, Mr. Vineberg's client, who told us 
that Mr. Vineberg would answer for him. I asked Mr. Vineberg 
over and over again if he was speaking for his client and he 
assured me that he was not, that he was speaking in his own 
name and that he could not speak for his client.
<P>
	What happened was that two people were not only mocking us 
to our faces, but were arguing back and forth and we never got an 
answer. Mr. Vineberg is a well-known member of the legal 
profession here in Canada and I asked him four questions: 
Should an already flawed contract- because the rules of assent 
were flawed from the beginning-provide for compensation in 
case of cancellation? Would he agree with a public enquiry? 
Would his firm willingly submit financial analyses? Finally, I 
made a brief comment saying that those who live in glass houses 
should not cast stones.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	I will not quote the answers because not one of them is worth 
repeating in this House. We would also have liked to get answers 
to other questions. For example, while he was involved in the 
case, had he ever been aware of any malversation in connection 
with lobbyists or of civil servants or political personnel being 
too closely interested in the Pearson issue? Also, did he agree 
with the profit analysis in the Nixon report which indicated a 14 
per cent profit after taxes? I also asked him if he did not find it a 
little bit strange that bidders were only given  90 days to prepare 
their bid for a 57-year contract worth $1.6 billion? Are such 
things normal and reasonable in a democratic society? We have 
to wonder. The answer is obvious. There is not one Canadian 
who will find that it makes sense.
<P>
	I am only relating some of the juiciest parts of what Mr. 
Vineberg said. I understand that Canadians and Quebecers will 
be able to read the whole thing in the minutes of the proceedings 
of the Standing Committee on Transport. It is a jewel in its own 
right, but the answers are not worth repeating in this House.
<P>
	I could go on talking all day long about this famous Bill C-22 
and the proposed amendments. I have already spent a lot of the 
taxpayers' money to convince this House to satisfy Canadians 
by keeping them informed of ongoing negotiations between the 
government and Pearson Development Corporation.
<P>
	When I talk about money spent, I am talking about the 
transport committee's hearings, and the salaries of federal civil 
servants, researchers and MPs. This is a lot of money spent to 
achieve very little. I would like to add that my party and I agree 
with the government's motion to reject all the amendments 
presented by the other place. I am in agreement with the 
government but for different reasons.
<P>
	First, as I mentioned earlier, I cannot accept that non-elected 
individuals try to have the upper hand on decisions in this 
country. Second, I cannot accept that the Pearson Development 
Corporation be given compensation for any loss incurred before 
April 13, 1994 since the circumstances surrounding the 
awarding of the contract were flawed to start with. This being 
said, if we reject the amendments proposed by the other place 
and adopt the government's motion, a doubt will always linger 
in the minds of Canadians for lack of a public inquiry.
<P>
	Once again, I plead with my hon. colleagues to allow a royal 
commission of inquiry to get to the bottom of this so that trust in 
our leaders may be restored.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We will now proceed to 
the other stage of debate where members will have 20 minute 
interventions, subject to 10 minutes questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I understand that the Liberals may not have as much support in 
caucus for this motion as they might like us to believe. I am sure 
being good members of the old style party of the past that they 
will vote the party line as they are told. I understand that they 
cannot find anyone else to speak to this debate. I am really sad if 
that is the case because I have some questions I would like to ask 
and have answered here today. We will have to make of the 
process what we can.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6274"> 6274 </A></B>
<P>
	This whole business of Bill C-22 and the Pearson 
development contract was a very questionable process at best. 
We question the type of lobbying that was done, the allegation at 
least that there was an excessive amount, the close links that 
those lobbyists had with the Prime Minister's Office and a lot of 
the actions that the government itself took, the short duration, 
using one of the bidders to provide a lot of the parameters for the 
bid in the first place, the way it was signed at the last minute 
when it was known that the Tory government was on its way out. 
It was a very questionable deal. There is no argument on that at 
all.
<P>
	We have a backroom deal. One of the problems is the 
government is offering us a backroom solution to this problem. 
That is not acceptable.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	We have not heard a single piece of evidence stating 
specifically what improper, illegal action was taken by the 
bidder in this process. That is what we are trying to get to the 
bottom of.
<P>
	My colleague in the Bloc tried to get to the bottom of that. We 
tried to get witnesses in and had very little luck with it, either 
co-operation from the witnesses or for that matter co-operation 
from the government in subpoenaing those witnesses.
<P>
	On the other hand, it is said that during the time this was 
signed the leader of the Liberal Party said that if he got in this 
deal would be cancelled. That is not what he said. I want to 
clarify that. He stated that he would hold an independent public 
inquiry into this entire process.
<P>
	I have talked to the principals involved in this consortium. 
They said that did not hold any fear for them. They welcome a 
public inquiry into this. They will open their books to anyone, as 
they did when this so-called public inquiry took place. They 
said the have nothing to fear, they have done nothing wrong.
<P>
	What happened with our independent public inquiry? The 
government hired Mr. Robert Nixon. Is it really an inquiry when 
from start to finish in finished report the whole thing took 20 
days? It took place largely behind closed doors. We were not 
able to suggest who he might talk to. Several of the people the 
industry thought would be the obvious people for Mr. Nixon to 
talk to did not get called in. There was no opportunity to cross 
examine the evidence that was put in. Whether or not it was a 
fair inquiry or a public inquiry does not seem to be answered.
<P>
	To decide whether the inquiry was independent we have to 
look at who Mr. Nixon is. Mr. Nixon is the former leader of the 
Ontario Liberal Party. Mr. Nixon was the chairman of the 1987 
Liberal task force on Pearson Airport. Mr. Nixon is the father of 
a sitting Liberal member. Immediately after he put in his report 
in 30 days, Mr. Nixon was named as chairman of the atomic 
energy commission. Independent?-I hardly think so.
<P>
	There is another allegation. I think it is fair to bring the 
allegations into this House because all we have heard about this 
contract are allegations. In Mr. Nixon's so-called independent 
public inquiry there was no evidence. There were only 
allegations of possible improprieties, of possible wrongdoing. 
There was not one shred of hard evidence brought forward by 
Mr. Nixon.
<P>
	The allegation that is floating in industry right now from 
many sources is that there are two Nixon reports, one Mr. Nixon 
actually wrote and one that was written for him and actually 
submitted. Do I have proof of this?-no, I do not, any more than 
the proof we have seen of the wrongdoings by the Pearson 
consortium in this whole deal. Allegations are all we have seen.
<P>
	Then the Standing Committee on Transport decided it would 
hold hearings and we would have a chance to air all this out and 
find out what went wrong. As my colleague in the Bloc stated, 
many people were asked to come before the committee but very 
few of them showed up. This did not help the case of the 
consortium.
<P>
	I was not very pleased that a lot of these people who claimed 
that they were hard done by did not come forward to defend 
themselves. We also did not get very much co-operation from 
the Liberal government in trying to ensure that we got those 
people in.
<P>
	There were a couple of other interesting events. Aside from 
the people we asked who did not come there were several 
principals who asked specifically to come to the hearing and 
were denied. These were people like William Pearson, the 
president of Agra Engineering, George Ploder, president of 
Bracknell Corporation, and Scott McMasters, president North 
America, of Allders International Canada. One of the principal 
investors in this whole contract was denied the right to come 
before the committee. Why is the government trying to hide 
what truly happened in this whole process?
<P>
	The topic of the return on investment being excessive has 
been brought up, while we have heard figures that are all over 
the scale.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	The government was first alleging 18.5 per cent. Today we 
heard some figures going up to 28 per cent. The reality is this 
was examined by a firm I think the House would agree is 
credible. I am so overwhelmed by some of the stuff the 
government has done that I am at a loss for words on some of 
this. The firm I am talking about is Price Waterhouse. I do not 
think anybody here is going to question the integrity of Price 
Waterhouse. It said 14 per cent return.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6275"> 6275 </A></B>
<P>
	It is really interesting that the Canadian Imperial Bank of 
Commerce was one of the tentative investors in this. It invested 
at what looked like a 18.5 per cent return on that investment. 
When it dropped to 14 per cent, which is exactly what Price 
Waterhouse says it was, CIBC pulled out because it was not a 
good enough return for the risk involved in this type of 
investment. Maybe the government wants to suggest that CIBC 
is not credible, I do not know. It has not answered that.
<P>
	Included in this particular bill is the fact that there should be 
no compensation for lobbying fees. If there was something 
illegal about the way this corporation lobbied the government 
then certainly it should not get compensation for any illegal 
activity whatsoever, no matter what.
<P>
	If the lobbying was legal according to the government and we 
like many others do not like the fact that there is lobbying, then 
until such time that the rules are changed it is the same as 
somebody driving down the street at 90 kilometres an hour in a 
90 kilometre zone and someone pulls out from a side street in 
front of them and gets hit; an investigation after deciding that 90 
kilometres is too fast on that street. You do not charge the person 
who was doing 90 kilometres because he was doing it in 
accordance with the law, even if it was too fast for that street. 
That was not his fault. You change the speed limit but you do not 
do it retroactively. That is what the government is looking at in 
this particular case.
<P>
	It talks of third party contract liability. It is going to allow a 
few dollars to compensate the principles in this for third party 
contract liability. Third parties do not have a contract with the 
government. They have a contract with the Pearson consortium. 
They can sue in court for whatever amount they care to sue for. It 
could well exceed $30 million figure the minister threw out here 
today and there is absolutely no way for the principals in this to 
pay it. They have that much money out themselves, whether it is 
by regular and proper activities or whether it is some proper 
activity, notwithstanding they have already spent in excess of 
that. Now all of these third parties are supposed to be included in 
the settlement of $30 million. It may or may not be appropriate. 
We have not seen the figures.
<P>
	There is an ongoing problem with terminal 1 and terminal 2 
and the government has not told us what its alternative to this 
contract is. I tried to find that out from the minister today in 
Question Period. We did not get an answer, which of course 
surprises me. It is Question Period, not answer period. That 
seems to be a very common thing, we do not get answers from 
the government to our questions.
<P>
	This is something that should be brought out if we are going to 
deal properly with this entire business evolving around the 
Pearson airport.
<P>
	We are looking for something that is very open, very public 
and very honest. The government is looking to make a secret 
compensation deal behind closed doors.  The minister was asked 
when he came before the standing committee if he would make 
this process visible.
<P>
	I proposed an amendment both at committee and at third 
reading here in the House to say we would support this bill if 
instead of hiring another independent person linked to the 
government who was going to collect all these claims from the 
consortium, the minister could decide whether he was going to 
pay, who he was going to pay and how much he was going to pay 
them. We asked if he will make these figures public, if we will 
be privy to these figures and the process used to get to them. His 
answer was about as vague as it was here today dealing with T1 
and T2.
<P>
	He said they might be able to release some of the figures, but 
they are not sure because cabinet is involved. The minute we 
involve cabinet we could wrap the figures up for 20 years and 
know absolutely nothing about what went on. Under those 
circumstances there is no way to ensure fairness has taken place.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Today in his address the minister said that the threat of 
litigation was holding up a new solution. No, it is not. We can 
have all the solutions in the world telling us what to do. There is 
absolutely nothing that is holding up some alternative solution 
to the Pearson airport problem with terminal 1 and terminal 2. 
All the minister has to do is agree with what is being proposed in 
the House back from the other place. The contract will be 
cancelled; it will be over. The fact that litigation is going on in 
court will not hold up new solutions.
<P>
	We are looking for a court review of the entire process. That 
was not our solution; that was not what we desired. We wanted it 
done in the House through the Standing Committee on Transport 
where the entire process could be brought forth.
<P>
	One of the risks that actually happens if it goes to court is that 
the government could end up reaching a settlement and we 
would never know the true story about what happened in the 
Pearson bid process. That is not something we desire.
<P>
	To turn around at this point and simply close the door, to let 
the minister decide he will pay what he wants and there will be 
no recourse and no argument, the public will never find out who 
was at fault in the process.
<P>
	Was it the people who bid? Was it the Tory government and 
the way it was done? Or, do the Liberals have a large part in 
some of the problems that went on here? As it turns out they talk 
about the Tory cronies coming to the trough, but in the later 
stages of the proposal there were as many, if not more, Liberals 
involved in both the consortium and the lobbying. Is that what 
the government is really trying to hide?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6276"> 6276 </A></B>
<P>
	The salvage value of the work being done has not been 
answered. We want to know what the government has for an 
alternative process to deal with the problem at Pearson. All 
kinds of money have been spent on plans, drawings, 
engineering, passenger load surveys, negotiations with users 
and tentative contracts that could still be honoured by a new 
contractor. There is a tremendous value in that, but until we 
know what it is we do not know what compensation the 
government should pay out for those things specifically and 
what the Canadian taxpayer will be able to recoup through the 
process.
<P>
	The minister suggested that taxpayers are faced with cuts and 
therefore we should not consider going into court and allowing 
the contractors from Pearson to get a large settlement. Is that not 
interesting? Does that not send a wonderful message out to the 
business community?
<P>
	It says that the Liberal government is in trouble with its 
overspending. The Liberal government has to make some cuts 
somewhere. It does not particularly care if they are fair or 
normal as long as they will save a lot of money and as long as 
someone else can be blamed. That is where some of these cuts 
will come from.
<P>
	I do not want to see money wasted by the government any 
more than anyone else other than probably the government. We 
bring forward financially responsible proposals and the 
government seems to want to waste money. It is strange that it 
would suddenly turn around and want to be financially 
responsible. It is not proposing financial responsibility.
<P>
	The matter has to go back to the courts. The courts will decide 
what went wrong in the process. They will discover whether 
there was any illegal or improper conduct on the part of anyone 
involved in the process and they will set the compensation 
accordingly.
<P>
	If there was something wrong with the way the consortium 
lobbied the government it will be identified. The principals will 
not be compensated for illegal, improper type conduct. If they 
conducted themselves properly, just because we do not happen 
to like the way the rules work we cannot punish private 
enterprise for following the rules of the government. If that 
happens it sends out a message that no one should do business 
with the government, and that is not the kind of message we 
want to send out.
<P>
	As far as what is going to happen to the bill, the Liberal 
government has an absolute dictatorship for the next four years. 
Obviously it can pass anything it wants as long as it can keep its 
backbenches in order. So far it has been able to do that. We do 
not know how long it will be able to maintain that, but for now at 
least it has managed to keep its members voting the way they are 
told. We have to suppose that it will go back to the other place.
<P>
	How are we going to deal with it? I am going to meet with the 
Senate. It is very clear we want a triple E Senate, but as long as 
we have a Senate there has to be some function for it. If it 
provides the chamber of sober second thought, which is the 
function of the Senate, we will work with what we have to work 
with until such time as we can improve it. We will try to find a 
solution or an alternative way to bring the matter back to the 
House yet again until the government deals fairly and properly 
with the whole matter.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	We will not support the government's motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
listening very passively to the hon. member's speech until I 
heard the word ``dictatorship''. It was like being hit over the 
head with a two by four. It brought me to attention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Quorum, 
please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out that it 
is fine to call for quorum but we have many members in 
committees right now and doing House duty as do other parties. 
If we start these shenanigans about quorum, we are going to be 
spending taxpayers' money.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. A request has been 
duly made by the member. He has asked for quorum. By 
recognizing the other member on his intervention I believe we 
were getting into a matter of debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> The time the House was shut down with a quorum 
call probably resulted in another $100,000 being added to the 
national debt.
<P>
	My comments will be brief. The hon. member mentioned a 
four-year dictatorship and the government keeping the 
backbenches in line. He should know that the government was 
elected in the most democratic process existing on the face of 
the earth. Whatever he may think about that election forming a 
dictatorship, I suggest he is dead wrong. If he wants to compare 
what happens in this country with what happens in any other 
country on the face of the earth he is welcome to do it. I think he 
should do it before he makes accusations of the kind.
<P>
	I assure him the backbench is totally united on the issue. As a 
member who comes from the metropolitan Toronto area or its 
periphery and whose constituents work at Pearson, at ancillary 
industries at Pearson, in the airline industries and so on, I say 
that a successful outcome to the bill is very important.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, the term dictatorship suggests when 
those in power can do whatever they wish. That is exactly what 
we have. Any time we have a majority party it is the equivalent 
of a temporary dictatorship. It can be a benevolent dictatorship, 
if it wishes to get re-elected, but it has absolute power 
nonetheless. That is where that particular term comes from.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6277"> 6277 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned the people who work at Pearson 
and the fact that he comes from Toronto. I assume he was going 
to suggest they had argued in the political process of getting 
elected that they were going to challenge the Pearson deal. They 
did not challenge the Pearson deal. They simply overturned it.
<P>
	We are talking about contract cancellation. That is not what 
they are doing. They are trying to pretend the contract never 
took place. That is not what they said they would do during the 
campaign. They said they would have a public review. We are 
still waiting.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I welcome this opportunity to speak again on Bill C-22 and the 
amendments proposed by the other place.
<P>
	Everyone in Quebec and Canada knows what effect this 
shameless attempt at privatizing the airport could have had if it 
had gone through and who would have had their palms greased 
as we say in Quebec with such a patronage-prone, foul-smelling 
plan as that to privatize Pearson Airport.
<P>
	All the potential transactions, all the provisions of the 
privatization contract per se and all the people involved in this 
privatization attempt have not been brought to light yet.
<P>
	Again, not only did we not get right to the bottom of the 
matter, but Bill C-22 still contains provisions which could be 
conducive to patronage, that which the people and Quebec and 
Canada detest most about the politics of older parties.
<P>
	When you read in this bill that we continue to leave it to the 
Minister of Transport's absolute discretion to compensate 
promoters if appropriate, I find that is absolutely absurd. My 
colleagues have been pointing this out over and over since this 
bill was introduced and will continue to do so at every stage, 
unless the government changes course along the way.
<P>
	I must say that this government's attitude toward Bill C-22 
and privatization is worse than anything we have seen under the 
Conservatives. The Conservatives at least were upfront. They 
were open about their patronage deeds and about the fact they 
greased the palms of their friends, while the Liberals have a 
more underhanded, almost wicked, way of doing things. But 
they continue to do it after having rent their clothes, in fact a 
closet-full of made-to-measure shirts, starting with the 
Minister of Transport.
<P>
	On November 29, 1993, the Minister of Transport himself 
openly told the media that he was thinking about holding an 
inquiry, an exhaustive inquiry into the ins and outs of this 
attempt to privatize Pearson airport. It was after he realized that 
it was not just Conservatives involved in promoting this project 
or in the investments connected with the privatization of 
Pearson, but that  there were also friends of the Liberals, who 
had made contributions to the Liberal Party of Canada, that the 
Minister of Transport, probably on the advice of his cabinet 
colleagues, backed down and offered us instead the report by 
Mr. Nixon, a very close advisor to, not to say a member of, the 
Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	From the beginning of the debate on Bill C-22, we spent some 
time cross-checking contributors to the Liberal Party coffers, 
even Canadian companies who had made contributions, and the 
principal players involved in Pearson. And we found the 
connections very easy to establish. It was obvious that 
somewhere there were people who had such an amazingly 
underhanded, nebulous influence that it halted the process of 
inquiry into the privatization, the attempt at privatization of 
Pearson airport.
<P>
	Yesterday, the attitude of the Liberal majority to the bill 
tabled by my colleague from Richelieu on public funding of 
parties was proof to me that members of the Liberal Party of 
Canada are just as steeped in patronage as the Conservatives.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	They roundly defeated a bill that would have applied, at the 
federal level, the old dream that Mr. Lévesque made come true 
in Quebec, namely financing parties with contributions from 
individual citizens of Quebec and Canada who require defended 
after, who require that those they elect defend their interests and 
not the interests of the very rich friends of the regime, especially 
of the lobbyists who previously belonged to former Liberal or 
Conservative governments. Their attitude yesterday tells me a 
lot about the inflexibility they have shown every time we asked 
them to set up a real inquiry process that would fully elucidate 
the attempt to privatize Pearson.
<P>
	Why do we need to get to the bottom of it? Because, if we were 
able, with the fragmentary information at our disposal, to 
perceive the possibility of ethical problems and patronage in 
this issue, it may mean that there were many more in the past 
under the Conservative government and under the Liberal 
government before that as well. But above all, it means that the 
incongruities and strange happenings involving very powerful 
lobbies connected to the main federal parties may occur again in 
the future.
<P>
	The taxpayers of Quebec and Canada find that quite costly. 
They must find out what happened in the Pearson affair and 
especially they must be assured that such incidents will not 
recur in future, where friends of the party, former ministers, 
senators, people who worked very closely with the government 
as senior officials affiliated with the old parties got rich at 
taxpayers' expense. That is why it is important to clear this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6278"> 6278 </A></B>
<P>
matter up. To find out whether the lobbyists accused of having 
influence-and we are not the ones who say so; it is in the Nixon 
report, the Liberal Party's report-the lobbyists accused of 
having extraordinary influence in this  contract, lobbyists like 
Pat MacAdam, a Conservative lobbyist and friend of Brian 
Mulroney; lobbyists like Bill Fox, a Conservative lobbyist and 
college friend of Brian Mulroney.
<P>
	We have been naming names for a long time now, because 
they should be ashamed if they have done something wrong, 
they should be ashamed to continue pressuring the government 
not to order a public inquiry. As professional lobbyists, they are 
certainly still worrying about the possibility, perhaps only a 
slight one because, after all, these people are friends, that there 
will be a public inquiry that would reveal to Quebecers and 
Canadians the amazing extent of their influence.
<P>
	So, I go on because I want to make sure that Harry Near, a 
Conservative lobbyist and long-time supporter, Don Matthews, 
a former president of Brian Mulroney's nomination campaign in 
1983 and former president of the Conservative Party, Hugh 
Riopelle, a lobbyist and the strong man in Mulroney's office, 
and John Llegate, Michael Wilson's personal friend, exert no 
more untraceable influence. They can lobby in a normal and 
legitimate manner, but when a Liberal report, the Nixon report, 
says that they exerted an influence which went beyond the 
bounds of normal lobbying activities, I think that we should 
have greater doubts than those timidly expressed in the Nixon 
report.
<P>
	This deal did not just involve Conservative lobbyists or 
people close to the Conservative government. That is probably 
why the Minister of Transport, who went loudly after the Bloc 
Quebecois members when they told him the truth, that is 
probably why the Minister of Transport backed down within the 
space of a few weeks saying: No, there will be no inquiry, just a 
short preliminary analysis about the possible financial 
consequences for the Canadian government if we had privatized 
Pearson. He realized that friends of the Liberal Party were also 
involved.
<P>
	As my colleague, our critic for transport, said earlier, there 
was Senator Leo Kolber, well-known for his haute cuisine 
dinner at $1,000 a plate. During the election campaign, Mr. 
Kolber invited all those who could have, according to the Nixon 
Report, a somewhat obscure albeit overwhelming influence on 
the government to come and meet the next Prime Minister at a 
private dinner at $1,000 a plate.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	Among his distinguished guests was Mr. Bronfman, who was 
directly involved in the privatization of the Pearson Airport. 
Also involved in this deal were Herb Metcalfe, a lobbyist for 
Capital Hill, a representative of Claridge Properties and former 
organizer for the current Prime Minister, as well as Ramsey 
Withers, a Liberal lobbyist with close ties to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	I think only one or two of these worthy Liberal supporters 
would have been enough to persuade the Minister of Transport 
to have a change of heart, since the minister was already not 
quite convinced that he needed to go after not only the friends of 
the government, but also of Canada's financial establishment.
<P>
	The inconsistencies identified by a review and an in-depth 
examination of the privatization contract should have drawn 
anyone's attention. I have seen a lot of sales contracts in my 
lifetime, but none like this one. I have never seen, for example, a 
central government agreeing, like the Canadian government did, 
to insert a clause in the privatisation deal in order to cut the 
duration of the contract in half so that the promoters could avoid 
paying the Ontario sales tax which would have come to about 
$10 million.
<P>
	In complicity with the Canadian central government, which 
some people find so praiseworthy, the promoters were able to 
save $10 million in Ontario taxes. I think that is a first, that 
never before did a federal government deliberately cause 
prejudice to provincial finances as this privatization contract 
did.
<P>
	We also saw other discrepancies in the calculation of the basic 
rent. The agreement said that Pearson Development Corporation 
would normally pay to the government 30.5 per cent of its gross 
revenue from the previous year, up to a maximum of 125 million 
dollars in gross revenue, and that it would pay a rent equal to 
45.5 per cent of gross revenue in excess of this figure.
<P>
	But according to the Nixon Report, and remember it was 
prepared by a friend of the Liberal Party, the gross revenue was 
deliberately reduced in the contract because unusual deductions 
were included which lowered the rent required from the 
developers in the future. Given those deductions and the 
omission of all extraordinary income received by Pearson 
Development Corporation, the rent for airport facilities was 
reduced considerably.
<P>
	We also noticed a few things that made no sense, some very 
innovative clauses in the Pearson privatization contract; it said 
that even though the federal government would no longer be 
involved in airport activities after the privatization, it-that is 
the taxpayers from Quebec and Canada-would assume all of 
Pearson's debts. The government was no longer involved, but it 
would have to pay the debts; so I was paying, my colleague was 
paying, Quebecers and Canadians were paying for all the bad 
debts of the Pearson Airport. However, as taxpayers, we no 
longer had any say in the airport's activities.
<P>
	I could mention other flaws; we did so at the second reading. 
There is, for example, the absence of any serious financial 
analysis. Why should we privatize just about the only profitable 
airport in Canada without requiring some serious financial 
analysis? In the case of simple one million dollar deals, for the 
purchase of companies for example, financial analyses and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6279"> 6279 </A></B>
<P>
spin-off analyses are conducted. The absence of any serious 
analysis in the  case of a transaction of such a scope simply 
makes no sense.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	We could also have talked about the lack of a serious and 
independent analysis on projected revenue. We could have 
talked about the lack of analysis of the investors' situation. 
Those investors' were not very solvent, but with the overall 
benefits that the federal government was giving them, they were 
sure to be able to spend the rest of their lives in lavishness.
<P>
	This attempt to privatize the Pearson airport is highly 
outrageous. No wonder that Canadian government finances are 
in such a mess. Why is it that the federal accrued debt will be 
around $550 billion this year? Why is it that we have so much 
trouble reducing the deficit below $40 billion annually? Why is 
it that we cannot control our government finances any more and 
that we are expecting another warning from the International 
Monetary Fund in the near future?
<P>
	If there have been other transactions as dubious, as obscure, 
as appalling as this one, because it serves the friends of the 
Liberal Party, of the Conservative Party, in fact, the old 
Canadian parties, I understand why things are going badly in 
Canada. I understand why government coffers are being drained 
at an alarming rate and why the Minister of Finance is forced to 
take unpopular actions that affect the most powerless among 
Quebecers and Canadians, in order to serve the friends of the 
party, in the light of the millions of dollars that were in there, 
that were concealed there. Since there is no political will to get 
right to the bottom of that deal in order to avoid others in the 
future, I understand why Liberals tend to be more drastic than 
Tories used to be.
<P>
	Ever since the Minister of Transport introduced Bill C-22, the 
Bloc Quebecois has been criticizing the fact that no public 
inquiry, no serious analysis has been made by a royal 
commission of inquiry.
<P>
	Every time I look at all the benefits that deal had to offer, I 
keep asking myself: ``Will it be better with the bill?'' I think 
perhaps it could not be better, from a certain standpoint, because 
the Minister of Transport will still be able to bribe some friends 
of the Liberal Party of Canada, he will still be able to use his 
discretion to give his friends tens of millions of dollars, if he so 
desires, to make up for a potential loss without an analysis being 
made or a royal commission being established to get right to the 
bottom of the deal.
<P>
	I am looking at that in comparision with the decisions the 
Minister of Finance made when he tabled is last budget on 
February 22 and reduced the unemployment benefits and the 
credits for senior citizens. Over the last few days, the Minister 
of Finance seems to be suggesting that the registered retirement 
savings plans could also be taxed, but family trusts are still 
being maintained.
<P>
	Officials were told not to give any information to members of 
Parliament about the hundreds of millions that could be 
concealed there. This is precisely serving the interests of those 
same friends of the Liberal Party of Canada, or maybe the very 
rich friends of the Conservatives. It is also serving the 2,000 
Canadian millionaires who did not pay a dime in income tax last 
year.
<P>
	When I compare that to other decisions of the government, 
such as the possibility that the Minister of Transport compensate 
once more friends of the ruling party, I say it is a disgrace. The 
Liberals should be ashamed of themselves, the Minister of 
Finance first of all, as well as the Minister of Transport, his 
accomplice.
<P>
	As for the Senate amendment, like my friend said, in my view 
the Senate has no value. It is not a legitimate and democratic 
authority. Therefore we dismiss everything that comes out of the 
Senate, good or bad.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before moving on to the 
question and comment period that should follow the speech of 
the hon. member, it is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to 
inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the 
time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Bourassa-Immigration; the hon. member for Mercier-Social 
program reform; the hon. member for Quebec-National 
Defence; the hon. member for Red Deer-Haiti.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi):</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague 
just spoke on Bill C-22, the bill to cancel the privatization 
project of Pearson airport. I would like him to tell us about the 
millions of dollars that are being spent. It was said earlier that 
perhaps the Liberal government should give these companies 
thirty million dollars in compensation rather than wait for court 
action where they might get more. Could the hon. member tell 
me whether or not such monies are actually available, that is, if 
Pearson Airport brings in that much money, how come we have 
so little money to keep regional airports open, why is it that the 
Minister of Transport wants to close our regional airports?
<P>
	These airports mean a lot to us. In remote areas like Northern 
Quebec, where air travel is the only means of transportation, 
what are people going to do when they want to travel south? How 
do we measure the cost? If the Val d'Or airport, for example, is 
to be closed on the medium term for lack of money, why not 
divert some of the money from profitable airports, like Pearson 
and maybe Montreal, to bring some equity nationally and 
thereby permit us to travel by air?
<P>
	Maybe my colleague has an opinion on this and on the way to 
make the system equitable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6280"> 6280 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Abitibi for his excellent question. I believe there is only one 
possible answer to that question. For this government, like the 
previous one, it is not a priority to serve the population of 
Quebec and Canadians well. Its main interest is not there, as 
was revealed yesterday by the Liberals' position on public 
financing. The citizens of Quebec and those of Canada are not 
the ones who finance those two old political parties. It is rather 
the large companies, the very rich Canadian minority, and the 
ones who are served first when an old federalist party comes 
into office. That is crystal clear.
<P>
	The logical result of public fund raising is that the first ones to 
be served when a member, a government comes into office are 
the citizens. Not friends who contribute several hundred 
thousand dollars to the party's campaign fund but real citizens 
with genuine needs. Members of parties who have adopted such 
a public fund raising serve first of all those electors.
<P>
	If at the outset you have a predisposition to grease the palms 
of the very rich and mighty friends of the party, you are less 
disposed to think first in terms of equal services from coast to 
coast in Canada or, in the case of Quebec, in the regions as 
opposed to the big centres. You are also less disposed to think 
that way, you would rather choose to give $30 million to the 
party's friends who may have lost something. We do not know if 
they have lost or not because there was no inquiry. We are not 
saying that they are not entitled to compensation, but that we do 
not know what really happened, since there was no public 
inquiry into this matter.
<P>
	Thus, you decide to compensate the Liberal hacks, to 
maintain the family trusts in which these same hacks invested 
and still invest year after year without paying a single cent in tax 
for up to 80 years. You also decide to maintain tax treaties with 
16 tax havens around the world, again allowing the wealthiest, 
the very large and profitable Canadian corporations to file their 
profits overseas where these are free of tax and to report in 
Canada their losses made overseas, for example. These are the 
choices you make.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	You also choose to cut billions from the unemployment 
insurance fund, simply because the unemployed are not those 
who contribute to the Liberal war chest. Grassroot financing is 
not enough. The Liberal Party turns to the large corporations, 
their great and rich friends, for financial support. Kolber, 
Bronfman and friends, these are the ones who hand out the 
money because they will be served later by the Liberal Party as 
well as by the Conservative Party. Thus, to me, Liberals and 
Conservatives are the same: old parties which are against 
democracy. They are old parties which are against grassroot 
financing as they obviously showed us yesterday.
<P>
	Anyway, I am not surprised by the fact that such absurd 
decisions as the one to close regional airports which serve a 
specific population are being taken, while, in the case of Pearson 
Airport, they refuse any kind of inquiry or openness because 
they are afraid of the truth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the 
benefit of Canadians and Quebecers who are listening to us, I 
will say that my question is unsolicited. In other words this is 
not, as we say back home, a planted question contrary to what 
Canadians are used to seeing during Question Period when a 
government member puts a question to a minister who in turn 
reads the answer. We see that regularly, but this is not the case.
<P>
	I appreciated the speech by the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot who, by the way, is a well-known 
economist in Quebec. I do not know if his fame has reached the 
riding of Stormont-Dundas which you represent so well, Mr. 
Speaker, but I want to say that in Quebec the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot is renowned.
<P>
	I ask him if it is true that companies who hired these lobbyists 
can deduct their fees from their income tax report. Therefore, if 
compensation is granted in the Pearson deal, and we do not know 
if it will be, or if it is justified, which we do not know, and if the 
minister deems that it is, the cost of this tax loss will have to be 
added to it. I am not sure what words to use as I do not have the 
same background as the member, but I would like to hear what 
he has to say about this.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot has two minutes to answer the 
question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is true that one was not planted. 
You may be sure of that.
<P>
	To answer the hon. member's question: Yes, corporations can 
deduct lobbying expenses, and Jim will agree with me. 
Corporations can deduct lobbying expenses, just as they can 
deduct the taxes they have to pay every year. They can also 
deduct the cost of hiring experts to find loopholes in the 
Canadian tax system so that they can shelter hundreds of 
millions and even billions of dollars every year. We do not know 
the exact amount, because senior officials at the Department of 
Finance have been told not to comment.
<P>
	Yes, I can assure the hon. member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans that corporations can 
deduct lobbying expenses, just as they can deduct fees for 
consultants and experts to help get them around the tax system 
and avoid during their corporate duty every year, which 
represents a loss of hundreds of millions, or even billions of 
dollars to the federal treasury.
<P>
	We can afford it, with our cumulative debt of $150 billion and 
an annual deficit of $40 billion. Since we can afford it, that is 
what happens. Instead of closing these loopholes and tightening 
up the tax system, the Liberal government, and especially the 
Minister of Finance and  the Prime Minister, prefer to keep them 
and make them even bigger-to let $30 million slip through, as 
we see in the case of Bill C-22-while hurting those who are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6281"> 6281 </A></B>
<P>
hurting enough as it is, and I am referring to the unemployed, to 
senior citizens who have worked hard all their lives. Above all, 
they can do without the very serious threat of attacks on RRSPs 
and pension plans.
<P>
	This is unconscionable, immoral and obscene, and the 
Liberals should be ashamed of themselves.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak to the amendments to Bill C-22 sent to the House from the 
other place.
<P>
	The motion before us today is quite simply a slap in the face to 
each and every taxpaying citizen who felt that the previous 
government had gone too far by attempting to sell terminals 1 
and 2 at Pearson airport to a group of self-interested investors in 
the dying days of an endangered administration.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	Contrary to the statements made by some of our friends in the 
other place, the proposed amendments to Bill C-22 have little or 
nothing to do with protecting the legitimate collective interests 
of taxpaying Canadians. No, the motion before us today is about 
protecting the private interests and profits of a handful of 
self-interested individuals over and above the collective 
interests of the unknown hard working taxpayers of the country.
<P>
	As chairperson of the House of Commons Standing 
Committee on Transport I can report that due process was served 
when our committee conducted its thorough review of Bill C-22 
last May. In addition to a clause by clause analysis of the bill, the 
Standing Committee on Transport conducted hearings in order 
to obtain input on the legislation from individuals directly 
involved in the Pearson deal.
<P>
	We heard testimony from several witnesses including 
Transport Canada officials; Hession Neville and Associates, an 
organization that put an unsuccessful bid on a Pearson contract; 
Air Canada officials; and representatives of the Matthews 
Paxport Trust, Mr. Gordon Baker and Mr. Donald Matthews. Of 
course we will never forget the colourful and melodramatic 
testimony of the legal counsel representing the Pearson 
Development Corporation.
<P>
	In addition to the hearings, the committee considered the 
findings of a report on the Pearson deal submitted by Mr. Robert 
Nixon to the right hon. Prime Minister. On this point it should be 
noted that Mr. Nixon's report contained the following 
conclusion. Maybe members of the Reform Party would be 
interested in what it concluded. It stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To leave in place an inadequate contract, arrived at with such a flawed process 
and under the shadow of possible political manipulation, is unacceptable. I 
recommend to you that the contract be cancelled.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As stated in the report itself, Mr. Nixon's comments were 
based on what was considered to be in the best interest of 
taxpayers, the travelling public and general economic 
development of the area. That statement captures the very 
essence of my case against today's motion.
<P>
	Some of our friends in the Tory dominated red chamber and 
their friends in the Tory dominated Pearson development deal 
would like us to believe that Bill C-22 is a Draconian piece of 
legislation that, among other things, breaches the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Bill of Rights by taking 
away the fundamental right of Canadians to legal recourse in the 
courts. Indeed the level of romanticized fiction in that argument 
is similar to that which might be found on any given day in a 
cheap supermarket tabloid.
<P>
	With regard to the constitutional issues surrounding the 
legislation, it is worth while to examine an approach that has 
been used by the Supreme Court of Canada when interpreting 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in order to put 
things in their proper perspective. I am referring to the so-called 
purposive approach to interpreting the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, as stated by Canadian constitutional law expert, 
Peter H. Russell. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The main thrust of the purposive approach to charter interpretation, 
fashioned by Chief Justice Dickson in some early cases, is to inquire into the 
reasons a particular right or freedom came to be valued in the history of western 
civilization and thereby to identify the interests each right or freedom was 
meant to protect.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like to focus on the latter portion of that statement 
pertaining to identifying the interests each right or freedom was 
meant to protect.
<P>
	In most democratic societies, including our own, it is a 
generally accepted principle of democracy that with some 
exceptions the legitimate interests of the collective are held in 
higher regard than that of individual private interests.
<P>
	As I stated, however, there are exceptions to the rule: for 
example, a situation of some sort of social or economic injustice 
or inequity brought on by such social phenomena as racism, 
sexism, poverty or any number of things that might characterize 
a historical disadvantaged or disempowered minority group or 
individual in our society. Under such circumstances it is 
incumbent on us to ensure that the interests of the disadvantaged 
or disempowered minority are not overpowered by that of the 
majority. If we apply this approach to the current Bill C-22 and 
its proposed amendment we can see that in fact the government 
is attempting to act in a forthright manner.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6282"> 6282 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	In this particular instance, by cancelling the Pearson deal 
through Bill C-22, the government has clearly chosen to protect 
the legitimate interests of the collective taxpaying populace as 
opposed to protecting the individual private interests and profits 
sought by a handful of lobbyists and contractors.
<P>
	I do not have any sympathy whatsoever for those lobbyists 
and contractors because the deal they signed in the dying days of 
the previous administration was simply not in the best interests 
of the taxpaying Canadian public as a collective.
<P>
	In short, I challenge any hon. member in the House to prove 
that the organization this motion is designed to protect, namely 
the Pearson Development Corporation, represents the interests 
of a historically disadvantaged or disempowered group. Prove 
it.
<P>
	Are these lobbyists and contractors in a situation of 
significant disadvantage such that the interests of the majority 
should be over-ruled in this case? No. All members of the House 
know full well that the motion before us today was created in the 
interests of protecting the so-called foregone profits of a very 
small but extremely privileged minority in our society. It is 
simply a shameful attempt to impede the legitimate purpose of 
Bill C-22 which is to cancel a dubious contract made under 
dubious circumstances by a dubious administration that was not 
acting in the public interest.
<P>
	Let us not be fooled by the people in the other place who claim 
to be fighting for the rights of Canadians. Make no mistake. 
They are fighting purely for the profits of their corporate 
colleagues.
<P>
	In closing, I implore the members of the House to take a 
purposive approach to the legislation in question in order to 
properly identify which interests are most appropriate to protect 
in this case. Should we be looking out for the majority of 
taxpaying Canadians who stand to gain only what they deserve if 
the motion before us fails, namely justice? Or should we join our 
friends in the Tory dominated red chamber by giving their 
colleagues in the Pearson Development Corporation a chance to 
take the citizens of Canada to the cleaners on a deal Canadians 
never wanted the previous government to make in the first place.
<P>
	The choice is clear. This motion has no merit. Let us dispense 
with it and get on with serving the legitimate interests of our 
fellow Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Hamilton West, as Chairman of the Standing 
Committee on Transport, of which I am vice-chairman, has used 
his privilege as a member to speak in the House. I made a 
number of allegations in what I said earlier, and I would 
appreciate his thoughts on the following: When he told me in 
committee that  subpoenas had not be used to summon witnesses 
to appear before a committee since 1917, did he give me the 
wrong answer? Was he aware of the situation when I showed him 
proof that this had been done in 1989, 1990 and 1992, for 
instance, by the hon. member for Windsor, the present 
government House leader?
<P>
	Did he purposely answer that this procedure had not been used 
since 1917 or was he trying to evade the question? Because he 
knew perfectly well that if we had subpoenaed these people, we 
would have had genuine answers to our questions.
<P>
	I have an additional question for the hon. member. If Senator 
Leo Kolber had been a Conservative, not a Liberal, would he 
have agreed to be summoned to testify before the Standing 
Committee on Transport?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would only answer my hon. friend 
in an honest and straightforward fashion. Beyond that he asked 
me to bring forward a process which we discussed thoroughly at 
committee that he knows full well would have extended the 
debate on Pearson airport for a minimum of months, maybe 
years, a process that would have Canadian taxpayers watching, 
being frustrated with it. It would hold back any development, 
process and progress at Pearson airport.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Canadian taxpayers want to see Pearson airport succeed. They 
want it to become viable. They need that airport for economic 
reasons, to sustain what we see as an important, viable piece of 
infrastructure for travel across this country, to connect this 
country and the world.
<P>
	I would only answer my friend in the most honest, 
straightforward manner.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to thank the member for Hamilton West. I am glad to see 
someone from the government side speak that is subject to 
questioning.
<P>
	The analogy that the hon. member brings up is very 
interesting. He said that there were some allegations or 
possibility of impropriety, so it is in the best interests of 
Canadians to cancel the deal and not compensate these people. 
He did not say that it has been properly investigated or if 
anybody really even created an improper procedure in this 
whole thing.
<P>
	It is like being a person associated with somebody who drops 
dead. We do not know what killed the person, but we charge him 
with murder because after all he was around somebody that died. 
We do not even know if a murder happened, never mind whether 
this person contributed to it. Yet we want to find him guilty. That 
is what the government is saying in this bill: ``We think there are 
some improper things and if we think there is something 
improper, then by God there must be something improper, 
because we know it all''. I challenge that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6283"> 6283 </A></B>
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member if they are so anxious to cancel 
this bill because it is such a bad bill, they must obviously have 
something better in mind. I asked the Minister of Transport 
today what he had in mind, what he was going to replace this 
contract with, what he was going to do about the problems at 
Pearson airport terminals 1 and 2.
<P>
	The government must have something better in mind. I would 
like to hear from the hon. member what will replace this bad deal 
that is better?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, maybe the hon. member's staff has 
not kept him abreast with what has been going on in government 
but the Minister of Transport has a national airports policy 
which has been released that should be of profound interest to 
this member and the Reform Party.
<P>
	It takes away from the particular group that I spoke of, a very 
eclectic group of lobbyists and contractors and the profitability 
they might make, into a so-called Canadian airport authority, 
which has representation not just from government but from the 
community that it serves. It will give that opportunity to all the 
citizenry, not just around that airport but around that entire 
region, to have input into the process of decision making for the 
airport.
<P>
	Guess what? It is not a revelation. It is quite simply input by 
the community. What do they need done at this airport? This is 
what they need done. Who is going to pay for it? They are going 
to pay for it with good old fashioned, common sense business 
practices. That is something else the government stands for and 
which I hear being touted by that party opposite.
<P>
	On top of that I find it passing strange that we have a Reform 
Party, a third party in the House who stand opposed to-or in 
favour possibly of-this motion, when the motion says that we 
are looking at ensuring there is an opportunity for that eclectic 
group of contractors and lobbyists to strip away from the 
Canadian taxpayers a potential of over $400 million. This comes 
from a Reform Party, a third party that is concerned with cutting 
taxes, with ensuring that the debt comes down, with ensuring 
that the deficit is worked at. They stand and want to support this 
motion to possibly open the door to give $400 million to these 
contractors. It is incredible.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise again to speak on Bill C-22.
<P>
	Before I begin my main remarks I would like to correct a 
statement made earlier in the House today by the minister. I 
think the words the minister used were that the Liberals were 
elected to cancel this deal. I do not think that is quite accurate. I 
think they were elected to review the deal. That is what they 
were saying during the campaign, not to cancel the deal but to 
review it.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> I heard the Prime Minister say that. 
Review the deal and act accordingly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Not to cancel the deal with no 
regard for potential costs or the delay at Pearson airport, or due 
process. Let the record be straight, that was not what the 
Liberals were elected to office to do.
<P>
	The decision was made to cancel a project of this magnitude 
on the basis of a hurried 30-day investigation. The decision was 
made to cancel a project of this magnitude, in 30 days, without 
any input from the people involved.
<P>
	It smacks of a knee-jerk reaction to try to show a government 
in action, without due regard for the taxpayers of this country. 
They are the ones who are going to end up paying the bill that we 
are looking at here.
<P>
	Unfortunately the solution to this problem has the potential to 
cost the taxpayers some hard-earned tax dollars that will further 
increase our deficit. And they are mostly wasted tax dollars 
because it will do nothing to improve Pearson.
<P>
	I say mostly because I believe that by going through the courts 
and opening up this whole mess to the public, we will be doing 
something to restore some of the trust that has been lost between 
voters and all politicians. To me anything we can do to remove 
the cynicism that has developed between the voter and the 
politician is something at which we should seriously look. That 
is what we are talking about here.
<P>
	A major part of the dilemma the government is facing in the 
debate is the ``trust us'' to do what is fair and reasonable behind 
closed doors. The message during the campaign, the message I 
was getting and I am sure many members were getting was that 
the trust that had once there had been lost and needed to be 
regained. We have to re-establish that trust. This bill does not do 
that.
<P>
	Members may or may not agree with that, but the fact there 
were 205 new members elected to the House of Commons says 
to me very clearly that the voters were not happy with the old 
politics and wanted some changes in this place. There is no 
better way to achieve that goal than to open up this process to 
full disclosure. Let us review the facts that brought us to this 
point.
<P>
	First of all, we have a deal that was negotiated by the previous 
Conservative government behind closed doors. It was signed 
during the election campaign in the full knowledge that it was 
going to be reviewed. It was not just a Conservative deal, it is a 
deal that involved friends on both sides, Liberals and 
Conservatives.
<P>
	Second, we had a shady deal and now we have a shady review. 
Without questioning the abilities of Mr. Nixon who was asked to 
do the review, if we really believed in restoring the voters' trust 
and confidence in politicians, whoever was going to do this 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6284"> 6284 </A></B>
<P>
review absolutely had to be non-partisan. It had to be done by 
somebody who was completely removed from involvement in 
the political  arena. That was not the case here and that flawed 
review did nothing to restore the trust and confidence I am 
talking about.
<P>
	Third, the review raises many questions about the process and 
puts into question the names and reputations of many people and 
firms. An implication is that perhaps the law has been broken.
<P>
	In spite of this damning report this bill does nothing about 
giving those involved whose names and reputations have been 
put into question the opportunity to remove that cloud. Yet it 
does say that in spite of this secret and perhaps unlawful deal 
they will pay some compensation to these people. They are 
going to give them some money, but they are going to do it 
behind closed doors.
<P>
	If this deal is only half as bad as the Nixon report suggested, 
not one penny of taxpayers' money should be approved for 
payout.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The member will 
certainly have the option of continuing his remarks to the 
maximum of 20 minutes when this piece of business returns to 
the House.
<P>
	It being 5.30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business as listed on today's 
Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should ascertain whether 
current levels of immigration are sustainable in periods of high unemployment 
and slow economic growth or recession, and if it finds these levels to be 
unsustainable under such circumstances the government should develop a 
means of expeditiously adjusting immigration levels in response to economic 
conditions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, since you have just read the motion I 
will not read it again. I happen to care very much about the 
precise wording of the motion. It was worded as carefully as one 
could in an attempt to hit the target. I would like to explain to the 
House where the genesis of this motion came from.
<P>
	Once every four or five years members of this House go back 
to the people to seek re-election and others to seek election. 
During that process we have a very healthy experience of 
meeting the electors and hearing their concerns, not just by 
telephone or letters but right at their front doors. That is where 
they tell those seeking re-election and those seeking to be 
elected for the first time exactly what the score is from the 
perspective of the voter.
<P>
	During the 1993 election I was dutifully electioneering in my 
riding with several other candidates from other parties. At that 
time we believed we were in the tail end of the recession. 
Statistically it is fair to say that we were and at least in my riding 
of Scarborough-Rouge River we were waiting for the economy 
to spin up again.
<P>
	Many of my constituents asked me about the levels of 
immigration. They said if the unemployment rate is 11 per cent 
now it surprises them that we are taking in more immigrants this 
year than we did the year before and that the immigration levels 
are increasing.
<P>
	My riding is 55 per cent immigrants. It is actually an 
immigrant receiving community and we are very proud of that. 
It is a very healthy, vibrant community and that augments our 
lives there considerably. There was a high level of intake of new 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	A constituent said to me that she sponsored her sister as an 
immigrant last year. She was accepted recently and she is going 
to come but this is a terrible time for her to come because she is 
not going to find a job.
<P>
	The economy is in such miserable shape around here. The 
metropolitan Toronto area was hit very hard by the recession and 
I do not think we have recovered the jobs that we lost four years 
ago. We are down considerably by 100,000 or 200,000 jobs.
<P>
	She was expressing concern about the ability of her sister to 
find a job when she arrived in Scarborough and was suggesting 
to me, even though she and her sisters were current clients of the 
immigrant process, that maybe we did not have the timing quite 
right.
<P>
	That combined with many other questions put to me at the 
door caused me to undertake to my constituents that I would 
raise in the House the question of immigration levels when the 
economy is not growing, when we have a weak economy. That is 
why the issue is here. Although the economy has improved 
somewhat since last year the issue is still a legitimate one.
<P>
	A year later some events have overtaken the currency of that 
issue. It is worth pointing out that the Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration has undertaken a very comprehensive and 
broad ranging consultation process with a view to establishing a 
long run, a 10-year plus immigration plan for Canada that will 
take us into the next millennium. That process has begun and it 
is continuing. It is comprehensive. Canadians will play a 
definite part in that and I am looking forward to that process 
continuing.
<P>
	There are a number of questions raised in the consultation but 
I want to note two because they bear relevance to the subject of 
debate at the moment. Page 10 of the first consultation 
document it states while there may be increasing concerns about 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6285"> 6285 </A></B>
<P>
number of immigrants coming to Canada there is evidence to 
suggest that these concerns are linked as much to issues of 
unemployment and the economy as they are to issues  of 
diversity. That is in the government's own discussion paper.
<P>
	Another question asked on page 13 is a question not unrelated 
to the one we are debating here today: should immigration be 
managed in response to the business cycle or only on the basis of 
long term social goals?
<P>
	Right there the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and 
those who work with him have asked the types of questions that 
are related to the motion we discuss here today.
<P>
	Keep in mind that the motion addresses immigration levels in 
a weak economy; high unemployment and all of the other 
manifestations of a weak economy. It is clear that the issue has 
been addressed. At least if it has been addressed, it may not have 
been answered, but an answer is being sought from Canadians.
<P>
	Let us use this debate to focus on that particular issue, the 
issue of immigrations levels in a weak economy, and hopefully 
make a contribution to the broader consultation now under way.
<P>
	What are the issues related to this? In a weak economy some 
Canadians ask, at least the ones I spoke to at the doors did, if we 
are able to receive as many immigrants in a weak economy as we 
are in a strong economy. Looking back over the last few years: 
immigration levels in 1991, 206,000; 1992, 220,000; 1993, 
245,000; and the plan for 1994 would have us receive 250,000. 
There has been an increase and that increase took place at about 
the same time as the recession sucked the growth out of our 
economy.
<P>
	If one was unemployed in Toronto or Scarborough in 1993 
during the election campaign and simply took note of an 
increase of 30,000 or 40,000 people in metropolitan Toronto as 
immigrants, one might legitimately ask whether their arrival 
will decrease one's ability to find a job. It is a legitimate 
question and it is one that I do not think the government has 
definitively answered. It is a question we ask here today.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	There is something else going on here while the question is 
being asked and if we had 30,000 or 40,000 new Canadians in 
metro Toronto and they all started looking for jobs I think the 
unemployment rate would shoot through the roof, but it did not 
through that period. It went up in the recession but it never did 
shoot through the roof.
<P>
	It is clear that the arrival of new Canadians does not per se on 
a person per person basis directly cause unemployment. 
Nevertheless, the question I have already acknowledged is a 
legitimate one.
<P>
	We can look for the answer perhaps in some economic studies 
that have been done. There are some related economic studies 
which show that immigrants can create just about as many jobs 
as they would take as workers. The suggestion in some of these 
economic studies is that there is a balance.
<P>
	When immigration increases, when the people come here to 
Canada to start new lives, they immediately increase the 
demand for goods and services. They in effect become a part of 
the marketplace that generates jobs. I suppose that particular 
piece of economic news is a good one.
<P>
	There was a 1991 study by the Economic Council of Canada 
called Economic and Social Impacts of Immigration which 
states at page 62 that immigration may influence the incomes 
and job opportunities of existing residents. It also says the 
impact of immigration on unemployment is almost certainly 
negligible, at least over the long term. Even temporary effects 
seem quite unlikely unless immigration increases very rapidly.
<P>
	Immigration appeared to be increasing relatively rapidly 
between 1991, 1992, 1993, but in any event it has at least 
addressed the issue.
<P>
	There is another statement in that same study by the 
Economic Council of Canada which gives its recommendations 
as an economic advisory body. It recommends that the level of 
immigration be gradually increased above the average levels of 
the last 25 years to reach 1 per cent of the population, that is a 1 
per cent increase on a gross basis by the year 2015. These levels 
would be reviewed every five years to verify that the integration 
of immigrants is being successfully managed.
<P>
	While Canadians gain economically in terms of per capita 
income from more immigration, the gain is so small that it did 
not weigh heavily in our recommendation. Nevertheless, nearly 
every immigrant more than pays for himself or herself in scale 
economies and in lighter future tax burdens. These are positive 
things for our economy.
<P>
	We note that there is hardly ever an effect on unemployment 
rates. Nevertheless, at the doors in my constituency the fear was 
there. It may not be a justifiable fear but Canadians are telling 
me they are worried about it.
<P>
	I want to assume that in the discussion here the motion I have 
placed here is dealing with a period of high unemployment, 
weak or no economic growth, and a level of high immigration 
receipt. If you are from a community in Canada that did not have 
a lot of immigrants coming to it you would not care too much 
about the motion. You would not care too much about the issue 
perhaps. However, this is the way my constituents have put this 
to me.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6286"> 6286 </A></B>
<P>
	Research on this subject also shows two earlier studies, 1977, 
1982, which tended to suggest that there were materially 
recognizable costs with immigration.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	However, those studies second guessed the methodology and 
the computer models which were then called TRACE, 
CANDIDE and RDX2. These are 20-year old economic models 
which I understand are not used any more. Therefore the results 
of those studies are certainly in question.
<P>
	We leave the ascertaining of the economic impacts to the 
economists. I have referred the House to Economic Council of 
Canada study in 1991. There was another study done one or two 
years ago by the Mackenzie Institute. I take note of it because 
that particular body contributes quite a bit to public policy 
development in the country. Its conclusions are not always the 
conclusions that I would come to but they are a contributor.
<P>
	On page 124 of the Mackenzie Institute study is a quote I want 
to mention because it was written by a current member of the 
House, the hon. member for Capilano-Howe Sound. The 
assessment in that document was that the economic effects of 
immigration on the welfare of resident Canadians tend to be 
positive. I wanted to note as clearly as I could that overall the 
immigration impacts are very positive for Canadians.
<P>
	I would like to get back to what I think the focus of the House 
disposition should be. I and my constituents would like the 
government to ascertain whether high levels of immigration, 
when the economy is weak, impact negatively on Canadians 
especially in high immigrant receiving communities. I realize 
that an answer might not be forthcoming quickly and 
definitively but that is the issue we seek to have resolved.
<P>
	If the government finds that it does have a negative impact 
then it should take steps to alter the immigration levels in a way 
that would nullify those impacts.
<P>
	Last, I again want to recognize that the question will be 
addressed in the current consultation process. I hope that it will 
be done by the government, by officials in employment and 
immigration and with the assistance and in consultation with 
Canadians in a way which will recognize the concern that has 
been expressed by my constituents and in a way which will 
permit our immigration act and policies to serve Canadians in 
the best possible way for the decades to come.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
speak against motion M-157 tabled by the hon. member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	When I read the motion for the first time I thought it came 
from a Reform Party MP. However, I was wrong. It comes from a 
Liberal MP and I am very surprised.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member wants to know whether current levels of 
immigration are sustainable in difficult economic times. This 
motion rests on the premise that immigration interferes with 
economic prosperity or undermines efforts toward economic 
recovery.
<P>
	It seems to me that what the hon. member from the Liberal 
Party is suggesting is right along the lines of the longstanding 
Reform Party immigration policy to drastically reduce the 
number of immigrants admitted to Canada. The unemployment 
rate is not tied to the number of immigrants Canada welcomes. 
The economic crisis and resulting unemployment have much 
deeper causes. Let me quote figures for a few years. In 1991, 
while the unemployment rate in Canada was 10.3 per cent, 
having soared a full two points in one year, immigration levels 
were decreased by 7,813. On the other hand, from 1992 to 1993, 
while the average rate of unemployment remained more or less 
the same and extremely high in Canada, immigration levels 
were increased by 25,023.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	As the hon. member indicated, the unemployment rate is 
dropping slightly these days. There certainly does not seems to 
have been any correlation between the levels of unemployment 
and immigration for a very long time. As a matter of fact, it 
should be pointed out that British Columbia is currently the 
province with the highest growth rate in Canada. British 
Columbia welcomes the highest number of immigrants to 
Canada in proportion to its population.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, in Vancouver last July, I saw the vitality and 
dynamism injected by ethnic communities and new arrivals in 
that province's economy. I noted in particular the dynamism and 
contribution of the Asian community. I want to pay tribute to 
this very dynamic and lively community that has settled in 
Canada, particularly in Vancouver and British Columbia.
<P>
	The hon. member quotes figures from studies by the 
Economic Council of Canada which, in fact, contradict what he 
is trying to prove today in this House. Many Canadians fear that 
too many refugees and immigrants are dependent on social 
assistance. But, according to the statistics, the truth is that 
immigrants, including refugees, rely less on social assistance 
and unemployment insurance than native-born Canadians.
<P>
	So far, immigrants have brought more to Canada than they 
received by creating jobs, increasing the demand for consumer 
goods and housing and paying taxes.drastically
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6287"> 6287 </A></B>
<P>
	These facts have been confirmed in a recent study by Dr. 
Morton Beiser, a professor at the University of Toronto. He 
showed that only 8 per cent of the 1,300  refugees from 
Southeast Asia who were interviewed did not work in 1991, 
when Canada's unemployment rate rose to 10.3 per cent. One 
out of five had set up their own business. The study also found 
that 4.5 per cent of refugees collected welfare benefits 
compared with 7 per cent of all Canadians. My colleagues from 
the Reform Party should keep this in mind.
<P>
	In any case, the member for Scarborough-Rouge River 
should not be too concerned, because Canada will not take in the 
250,000 immigrants planned for 1994. Indeed, in the first half of 
this year, far fewer immigrants have come to this country than in 
the same period in 1993. Probably the total figure will not 
exceed 200,000 for 1994. The Liberal Party's program would 
increase immigration by 1 per cent a year, but the 250,000 
immigrants that Canada should receive in 1994 are only 0.86 per 
cent of Canada's population.
<P>
	We look forward to the document on immigration levels for 
the coming years which the minister is to table before November 
1. At that time, the minister should provide us with all the 
studies and results of the consultations carried on in recent 
months.
<P>
	I think that the Standing Committee on Immigration and 
Citizenship could then conduct a thorough study of this issue.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Any immigration policy must in the first place consider 
demographic factors. Currently most considerations are based 
on economics. One of the factors that has this last year justified 
higher immigration levels is the increasing preoccupation of 
many Canadians regarding the demographic decline in Canada 
for the coming years.
<P>
	The projections indicate that if immigration numbers and 
birth rates do not increase then Canadians will be faced with a 
reduction in their numbers. Studies show that post-industrial 
nations will have a birth rate between 1.4 and 1.7 per cent. 
However, a rate of 2.1 per cent is necessary only to maintain the 
current population numbers. This difference must consequently 
be adjusted by the immigration policy.
<P>
	In addition we must take into consideration the ages of the 
Canadian population. Young immigrants are needed to work and 
finance our social security system.
<P>
	Finally, there is an increasing number of countries that find 
themselves in conflict situations. There are more than 100 
million refugees in the world. Canada has a moral duty to do its 
share in solving this problem by welcoming refugees into our 
country.
<P>

<P>
	The motion tabled by the hon. member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River is totally opposed to his own party's 
policies, the Liberal Party of Canada, as they are worded in that 
red book which the Prime Minister and the members opposite 
often quote as though it was the Bible. As I said, increasing 
immigration levels so as to reach one per cent of the Canadian 
population is a promise made in that red book.
<P>
	The hon. member's motion is a barely veiled and disguised 
criticism of his party's policy. He told us that immigrants 
account for 55 per cent of the population in his riding of 
Scarborough-Rouge River. I think those people will not be 
very proud of their member of Parliament today, since he is 
squarely in favour of lowering immigration levels. In any case, 
let me tell you that, as a member of Parliament who came here as 
an immigrant, I am not proud of the member's motion. For all 
these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois opposes the motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to address this reasonable motion. It is only a shame 
that this motion did not originate with the government. It seems 
that the government has a great deal to learn, at least as far as 
immigration policy is concerned, from its own backbenchers 
and especially from my hon. colleague, the author of this 
motion.
<P>
	The fact that a motion like this even requires debate and is not 
already government policy is a reflection of the power that 
special interests have exercised and continue to exercise on 
government policy.
<P>
	We currently have an immigration policy as outlined in the 
Liberal red book that is literally based on nothing. This 
government is allowing nearly 1 per cent of the population to 
come into the country this year as immigrants; 250,000 
immigrants. At the same time Canada is experiencing a level of 
unemployment that is denying jobs to 1.5 million people.
<P>
	The government can offer no rationale for this level of 
immigration. It is not derived from economic research, since the 
experts are agreed that immigration does not add to the wealth of 
Canada. Over the long term economic forecasts suggest that our 
current levels will actually lower the average income of all 
Canadians. There is no evidence that immigrants create more 
jobs than they take. At best the job and wealth creating effects of 
immigration are neutral.
<P>
	There are data to back up arguments for restricting 
immigration during times of recession. There are data that 
clearly suggest that immigration should be tied to the economy. 
Moreover, it is only common sense that immigration should 
serve one primary role, to supplement our labour force to 
strengthen the economy and contribute to Canada's economic 
growth. That is not the agenda of this government at present and 
that is not the agenda of the immigration industry.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	There is no question that immigration could be made to work 
in the interests of the economy and the interests of Canadians. 
There is a simple recipe for success. That recipe is to cut the 
numbers of immigrants, especially during hard times such as the 
one that we are currently facing and ensure that immigrants who 
come into Canada are chosen for their ability to quickly and 
successfully integrate into the economy and to make an 
immediate contribution.
<P>
	The way that we can do that is to ensure that the bulk of 
immigrants come in under the point system. Currently however 
only 15 per cent of immigrants come in this way. The rest are 
family class and refugees.
<P>
	Over the summer a poll was conducted by the immigration 
association. One of the questions that was put to over 1,000 
people across the country is the following: ``Would you approve 
or disapprove of a proposal to place restrictions on the entry of 
immigrants who may compete with unemployed Canadians 
during times of high unemployment in the country?'' The 
answer to that question was an overwhelming yes. Canadians 
would approve of restricting immigration levels if it was 
determined that the job market could not accommodate 
newcomers. Sixty-seven per cent of Canadians approved. In 
political terms that is an overwhelming majority.
<P>
	That is not the only poll around. Earlier in the year the 
department of immigration commissioned the EKOS polling 
firm to survey Canadians on their feelings toward immigration 
policy. In this poll a majority of Canadians surveyed said that 
there were too many immigrants coming into Canada, period. 
That is very revealing.
<P>
	Canadians have always been among the most accepting 
people on earth. We have welcomed newcomers and believed 
that there was a place in Canada for them where they could 
contribute, where they could stake out a place and become 
productive members of society.
<P>
	Now the majority are saying: ``Let's tighten up. Let's shut the 
doors'', and many of them are immigrants themselves. Frankly 
there is little wonder that this sort of reaction is occurring. 
Officials from EKOS have told me that there is a direct 
correlation between the state of the economy and the desire of 
Canadians to limit immigration.
<P>
	They also inform me that this level of discontent with 
immigration levels was unprecedented. Some spin doctors call 
the results of the EKOS poll intolerance. It is nothing of the sort. 
It is a logical reaction to a strain on Canada's economy and that 
strain while apparently unnoticed by officials in the department 
of immigration and by the minister himself is being felt by 
Canadians who are on the streets competing for jobs.
<P>
	Canadians it seems have again demonstrated that they know 
more about the consequences of policy than do the 
policymakers. What Canadians want is an immigration policy 
that works for them. Canadians are not intolerant.
<P>
	This government and those in the immigration industry 
should bear in mind that when they call those who are opposed to 
current levels of immigration intolerant that they are indicating 
a sizeable majority of the population. Are we to believe that the 
majority of Canadians are intolerant? Absolutely not. They 
simply want change. They simply want an immigration policy 
that makes sense. They want an immigration policy that first and 
foremost ties immigration levels to the state of the economy in a 
real way, in a substantial way. Immigration can work in the 
interest of the economy.
<P>
	Tying immigration to the state of the economy would be so 
simple and the benefits would be immediate and would be 
profound.
<P>
	This minister and this government refuse to consider it. This 
minister and this government are at the beck and call of a small 
group of immigration lawyers, immigration and refugee 
advocates and government funded ethnic leaders who have a 
monetary stake in ensuring that immigration levels are 
maintained at the current level or even raised. If anyone doubts 
that the immigration industry has the ear of the current minister, 
they need only look at this minister's appointment to the 
Immigration and Refugee Board. That will give a clear picture 
of who is calling the shots.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	It is time to take immigration back from special interests. It is 
time to put the direction of immigration policy into the hands of 
Canadians. They should be consulted. It is time to do precisely 
what this motion demands. It is unfortunate that it is not a 
votable motion. It only makes sense. I surely hope that this 
minister listens to what the Reform Party along with the 
majority of Canadians have been calling for for some time.
<P>
	I hope the minister will look at the intent of the motion and 
recognize that it reflects Reform Party policy and the will of the 
majority of Canadians. I hope this minister does what is right 
and reduces immigration levels until Canada pulls itself out of 
this recession. I hope this minister does what is good for Canada. 
I am afraid he has not done this so far.
<P>
	I applaud my hon. colleague for his common sense and for the 
courage to table a motion that flies in the face of policies that his 
own party has generated up until now.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
motion before us today gives me an opportunity to outline for 
the hon. member some of the many initiatives this government is 
involved in to help newcomers to Canada settle in this country 
and quickly become effective, contributing Canadians and not a 
drain on our economy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6289"> 6289 </A></B>
<P>
	I wish to emphasize the importance of our settlement 
programs within this equation which assist immigrants 
integrating into Canadian society quickly.
<P>
	People who come to this country are not set adrift once they 
arrive. They do not have to fend for themselves in a strange 
country. Immigrants long ago had few resources available to 
them but today we realize that providing initial assistance can 
quickly translate into independence for the newcomer to this 
country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Department of Citizenship and Immigration is involved 
in a series of joint projects with non-governmental 
organizations, centres for social services and other levels of 
government. For instance, we are involved in co-operative 
enterprises through our Immigrant Settlement and Adaptation 
Program and our Settlement Language Training Program.
<P>
	In 1992, for instance, the federal government provided a total 
of $277,000 in funding for projects to promote immigrant 
settlement, and we know that is money well spent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The reception services point the newcomers to other 
settlement and integration programs we have in place and by 
promoting the many settlement services offered by governments 
and community organizations we acquaint newcomers with the 
programs they can tap into as they integrate into Canada.
<P>
	According to our reports this has eased the anxieties of many 
newcomers about the problems of successfully settling here.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These programs are not frills but an investment that is vital to 
the well-being of new immigrants. We see them as more than 
just projects. These programs are a way to work together with 
people who are deeply committed to the integration of 
immigrants in our society.
<P>
	I repeat, these projects are an investment that is vital to the 
well-being of new immigrants in this country. By working with 
community organizations across the country, we manage to 
involve all immigrants in every aspect of Canadian life.
<P>
	This kind of work is essential to help people who are often 
very vulnerable. It is money well spent, because this is a 
hands-on way to give people support and help them become 
independent. We have been very successful with these programs 
in Quebec, where I know the situation very well, and across 
Canada. Most refugees who participated in our settlement 
programs have managed to integrate remarkably well into their 
new communities in Quebec and across Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
It is the programs that help us build a multicultural society.
<P>
	The motion before us implies that immigrants have a difficult 
time adapting to Canada and hence they are a drag on our 
society. I would suggest otherwise. I would suggest that our 
settlement programs are doing their job. They are helping new 
people adapt and integrate into a complex and dynamic country. 
In so doing they are helping to build and maintain a vibrant 
society that the United Nations told us not once but twice was 
the envy of the world.
<P>
	Throughout our history immigration and nation building have 
gone hand in hand. Immigration has helped us to define a vision 
of a tolerant, caring and generous society. Today our 
immigration policy reflects these very ideals. To adopt the 
motion before us would diminish our success in immigration 
and refugee matters.
<P>
	Canada is also a respected world leader because we offer new 
life for refugees. In fact international agencies rank Canada's 
refugee program among the most generous in the world. Our per 
capita acceptance of refugees places us at the top of the list.
<P>
	My riding of Saint-Denis is made up of refugees and 
immigrants. Most are hard working and most contribute 
socially, economically and culturally to my riding and to the 
country. We have talked a lot about studies in the Chamber. A 
study was done by the Council for Cultural Communities and 
Immigration of Quebec, of which I had the honour to be 
vice-president. It was proven that in a very short period, in fact 
20 weeks, most refugees or immigrants had found one job and 
sometimes had found two. They are working and contributing 
economically to the betterment of our society, to the betterment 
of our economy.
<P>
	They do not, as some say, steal our jobs. They create jobs. 
They employ people. The hon. member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River cited certain studies that said 
immigration impacts were very positive.
<P>
	We have examples in the Chamber. We have examples of 
Canadians or children of immigrants who have contributed 
economically, socially, culturally and even politically to 
Canada. I would like the hon. member and the Chamber to take 
those facts into consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was struck by the initial part of 
the intervention of the hon. member for Saint-Denis.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. Through this 
period of business there are no questions or comments. Unless I 
am mistaken, I would like to remind members they must be in

<P>
	There being no further members rising for debate and the 
motion not being designated as a votable item, the time provided 
for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired and the order is dropped from the Order Paper pursuant 
to Standing Order 96(1).

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATION">IMMIGRATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, on June 16, I 
asked the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration a question 
regarding the fact that immigration officers were requiring from 
refugees whose status has been recognized by the Immigration 
and Refugee Board a passport from their country of origin. If 
these refugees could not produce a passport, they were asked to 
contact their embassy or consulate to apply for one in order for 
the authorities to review their application for permanent 
resident status. This practice varies depending on the 
immigration office and the rules are applied in a totally arbitrary 
fashion.
<P>
	This requirement can jeopardize the safety of those people 
and that of their families in their country of origin. It is 
sometimes very difficult if not impossible for a refugee to obtain 
such documents. I hope to get a complete and adequate answer 
regarding that issue today.
<P>
	I also take this opportunity to denounce the setting up of the 
claims processing centre in Vegreville, Alberta, which is a total 
flop. The decision made by the Conservatives and confirmed by 
the Liberals to centralize the processing of claims far from the 
users and the immigrants was irrational. Things started off on 
the wrong foot and the centre was immediately overwhelmed by 
the massive number of claims to process. Delays are very long. 
People cannot get information on their files when they phone the 
information centres set up for that purpose. Since May, the 
Vegreville centre has literally never had control of the situation. 
Files keep accumulating and the delays due to the insufficient 
number of employees processing those claims is unjustified.
<P>
	I learned that thousands of files which cannot be processed in 
Vegreville will be returned to local centres. These files are 
returned precisely in those centres where staff cutbacks were 
made, since it was believed that it would be more efficient to 
centralize the whole process in Vegreville. Now it is the local 
centres which will not be able to keep up with the demand. I 
denounce the  unjustified staff reductions at the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	In this regard, I must mention the intolerable situation of 
thousands of people in the Montreal area who try to contact their 
immigration department by dialing 496-1010. This number is 
the only one for answering all immigration questions, and it is 
always busy. In July alone, there were 126,000 calls to 
496-1010. There were exactly six officials there to answer the 
phone. Officially, there should be 15, but in fact, there are never 
more than nine employees. Service to the public is woefully 
inadequate.
<P>
	I also want to denounce another situation which clearly shows 
that the minister has lost control of the immigration centres. 
During the first week in September, Montreal had a list with the 
names of over 2,000 people who were waiting to receive kits by 
mail.
<P>
	I hope that the minister will take concrete action soon to 
improve this terrible situation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
order to become a permanent resident of Canada, refugees must 
be able to prove their identity. This is necessary to protect 
Canada from persons who may have committed criminal acts or 
human rights violations in their own country and who should not 
be given permanent residence and eventually Canadian 
citizenship.
<P>
	It is also necessary to establish a refugee's identity in order to 
clarify a refugee's relationship with family members. In order to 
prove their identity, refugees are asked to present a passport, 
even an expired one, a valid travel document or a satisfactory 
identity document.
<P>
	Refugees who are unwilling or unable to apply for a passport 
from their country may therefore obtain permanent residence by 
presenting a travel document other than a passport or an identity 
document.
<P>
	In some cases where none of these documents are available 
permanent residency may be granted on humanitarian grounds if 
it is unlikely that the person presents a criminal or security 
concern.
<P>
	In all cases, however, every effort is made with the individual 
concerned, through community and support groups, to help 
them produce acceptable evidence of identity for the purpose of 
applying for permanent residence.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, in a 
question I asked in this House on May 25, I mentioned a warning 
given to the minister in a communications strategy paper whose 
contents were leaked-there have been other leaks since. This 
paper referred to ``UI cuts seen by the population as evidence 
that the government wants to fight the deficit on the backs of the 
poor''.
<P>
	My question was this: ``Under the circumstances, will the 
minister tell us if the delay in tabling his action plan is the result 
of a split among cabinet ministers regarding what is at stake?'' 
That was on May 25. This question is still relevant today 
because, since May 25, we have learned that the minister's 
action plan, following which a bill will be drafted and action 
will be taken, has been postponed until the spring and perhaps 
until the fall. It will be a discussion paper on which Canadians 
and Quebecers will be consulted.
<P>
	The question I asked pointed out that the delay in tabling the 
action plan was no doubt the result of a split among cabinet 
ministers. This question is still relevant and I would say that it is 
even more relevant today. We must keep in mind that the only 
thing the government has done since the election to help the 
needy is to cut access and UI benefits except for a small number 
of cases which, as the minister reminded us today, had positive 
results.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	But for one thousand or so recipients to get enhanced 
protection at 60 per cent, all other claimants will see their UI 
benefit rate reduced to 55 per cent. More importantly, there is all 
those who will no longer qualify for UI, those who will be 
entitled to fewer weeks of benefits, which means more families 
and single parents ending up on welfare and increased poverty 
for children.
<P>
	We could read in the papers this morning that in Canada, one 
child out of five is poor and their numbers have increased 
dramatically since 1989.
<P>
	I repeat forcefully and will continue to repeat it as long as it 
takes: apart from talking -it bursts with generous, 
compassionate words- all the government actually did was to 
make matters worse on the whole for families and individuals in 
need.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have paid attention to the hon. member's comments and I can 
assure her that the expenditures that will take place to engage 
Canadians in consultations will be expenditures that are 
necessary to engage them in what we as a government feel is an 
important dialogue.
<P>
	There is great support throughout the land for the social 
security review. People understand that the present programs, 
although they have served us well in the past and have given us 
the security we need, are no longer valid for the contemporary 
reality.
<P>
	We are going to use this review to engage Canadians. It is not 
just here in Parliament but it will be in town hall meetings 
throughout the country. It will be with the parliamentary 
standing committee. It will be the type of consultation that this 
country really has not seen to date.
<P>
	The review is necessary. Canadians need change. We need to 
give our young people the tools required to compete in a very 
globally competitive society. We need to adjust our programs to 
take into consideration the changing configurations of the 
Canadian economy, the change in our families, the change in our 
incomes. All the changes that have occurred need to be 
addressed in a very serious manner.
<P>
	It is for this reason that the government had the courage to 
engage in a dialogue with Canadians. We are sure that 
Canadians, like the hon. member, will be a very effective partner 
in bringing about positive change to the lives of Canadians.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, following 
the release of the report of the Department of Defence Advisory 
Council on Women in the Canadian Armed Forces, the media 
reported that the department had taken specific measures to 
combat sexual harassment. On May 30, I rose in the House to ask 
the minister what these measures were and whether there had 
been an evaluation of the new complaint process.
<P>
	I have yet to receive a clear and substantial reply from the 
minister, who had promised something to that effect. 
Harassment is a problem that affects women throughout the 
workplace, especially in cases where women constitute a very 
small minority. I think everyone will agree that the Department 
of National Defence still fits that category.
<P>
	All studies have shown that the effects of sexual harassment 
are many and varied. They may lead to physical discomfort 
(headaches, fatigue), personal and family problems or problems 
directly related to the job (unfair evaluation, poor references 
and, in extreme cases, resignation or release from employment). 
Linda Geller-Schwarz, who compiled information on sexual 
harassment in the workplace for the Women's Bureau, Human 
Resources Development Canada, wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Harassment is no joke. It upsets the life of the victim, threatens her 
livelihood, is detrimental to the career of the harasser and poisons the

	I realize the Minister of National Defence intends to take 
action, and I commend him for it. However, I would appreciate it 
if he would tell the House how he intends to rid his organization 
of the social poison of sexual harassment in the workplace. I 
would also ask the minister whether the main victims of 
harassment, his female employees, have been or will be asked to 
participate in the evaluation of measures taken to deal with a 
problem that concerns them directly.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to thank the hon. member for giving me the 
opportunity to address this important issue and to respond to her 
question once again.
<P>
	On June 20, I tabled in this House on behalf of the Minister of 
National Defence a series of documents describing the measures 
taken by the Department of National Defence to address the 
issue of harassment in the Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	Changes have been made to ensure that DND's commitment 
to eliminating harassment is reflected in our programs and 
policy. Minor changes to the Canadian forces administrative 
orders that include the concept of zero tolerance are embedded 
in this policy.
<P>
	The goal of the policy is simply the elimination and 
prevention of harassment. Every member has the right to work 
in an environment that is harassment free and to have any 
complaint of harassment dealt with in an expeditious, impartial 
and sensitive manner without fear of retaliation, and that is very 
important to add.
<P>
	Our goal is to prevent and eliminate harassment in the 
workplace and this will be achieved by this policy and by 
educating and training members on harassment issues, policies 
and procedures.
<P>
	Specifically, the new policies include revised complaint 
reporting procedures, the designation of harassment advisers, a 
DND harassment co-ordination office, a monitoring system to 
track the incidence of harassment and a comprehensive 
education and training program.
<P>
	Harassment education and training for all members at the unit 
and base level is mandatory. The new policy is in the process of 
being printed and will be published in the upcoming months.
<P>
	Once again I thank the member for allowing me the 
opportunity to stress the fact that the Department of National 
Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces remain committed to 
the implementation of a zero tolerance policy on harassment.

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am here today 
simply because so many Canadians are asking the same question 
and are demanding an answer, not an answer that we can come 
up with in the months to come, but an answer that we need right 
now because the decisions are being made right now.
<P>
	For Canada to think that we have the resources or the ability to 
be the 911 emergency for the world, we are far beyond that.
<P>
	The minister would agree that there are many hot spots in this 
world, that there are many that can explode tonight, tomorrow, 
next week, next month, and we have to establish some criteria 
that we are going to follow when we make foreign affairs 
decisions, particularly in the area of peacekeeping.
<P>
	We need to look at things like the economic implications, the 
humanitarian reasons. They are good reasons but then every 
single place would have these same reasons. We have to come up 
with a set of fixed criteria. We have to look at the geographical 
relationship. The people who are closest should be the ones who 
can help the best.
<P>
	We have the OAS which should definitely have been more 
involved in the Haiti situation. The African states should have 
been more involved in Rwanda. We have to look at the effect on 
international stability. We have to look at the media 
relationships-should we always be driven by CNN and 
Newsworld? We have to ask those questions.
<P>
	Canadian people want to know what it is going to cost. How 
much is this going to cost? How much money are we going to 
budget to handle all of these emergencies? Again, that all comes 
into criteria.
<P>
	We have to look at the resources that we have and of course we 
have to ask ourselves what our commitments are. We look at the 
whole military situation and see an awful lot of generals but we 
are certainly running out of front line troops. We are expecting 
our men and women in the forces to do so many things and they 
are not able to be stretched any further.
<P>
	We hear talk about the equipment not being adequate. We get 
letters from parents who have lost a loved one because they felt 
our ability to deliver was inadequate.
<P>
	We have to ask, what are these resources? How far will they 
go? We have to have a plan. We cannot just trust politicians that 
say: ``We will send them and we will let you know what we hope 
to accomplish after''. We must know, we must ask questions. If 
my son or daughter was going I would want to know why they 
were going, what they are going to accomplish and how it is 
going to help Canada. For how long are they going?
<P>
	The closest thing I have seen on how long we are going to be 
Haiti was when RCMP Chief Superintendent Pouliot said 
yesterday on ``Canada AM'' that we are  going to be there for 
seven to ten years to train the police forces.
<P>

<P>
	We need to know the criteria, the costs, the resources that will 
be expended and of course the plan and how long we are going to 
be there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, in reply to the hon. member's 
question and intervention, I have taken the liberty to note the 
first interview given by Chief Superintendent Neil Pouliot in his 
capacity as commissioner of the United Nations civilian police 
contingency in Haiti.
<P>
	Commissioner Pouliot has clearly indicated that Canada's 
commitment in Haiti has been set for approximately 18 months, 
that is until the inauguration of Haiti's next president which is 
slated for February 1986.
<P>
	He has also said, and this became the basis for the member's 
question in the House today and his intervention now, is that he 
thought Haiti might need eight to ten years before its police 
force reforms were fully implemented. This comment made in 
his capacity as UN commissioner referred to the need for a 
complete change of attitudes and the time needed for all ranks of 
the future 5,000 strong force to assimilate the concepts of a 
modern police force.
<P>
	He certainly did not imply that Canada has committed itself 
for that length of time. That is certainly not our intention. 
Canada has pledged to assist Haiti in the area of police reform 
through our participation in the United Nations Mission in Haiti. 
For this purpose we have sought 100 volunteers who will be 
deployed in the weeks or months ahead once the Security 
Council has authorized the United Nations Mission in Haiti.
<P>
	The cost of this participation has been estimated at $12.8 
million for the 18-month period I have just mentioned. This is 
what the member was asking. CIDA will cover those costs.
<P>
	The task of the RCMP officers will be to monitor the 
behaviour of the new Haitian police, accompany them on their 
daily rounds and give them on-the-street training. The RCMP 
will not take official duty. They are there to train, not to do the 
policing themselves.
<P>
	We do not know yet how long such monitoring will be 
required and if, after a certain lapse of time, all of the 100 
Mounties will be needed. Once a formal training program has 
begun it is quite possible that smaller numbers will be required.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for raising this. He has made 
excellent interventions in the standing committee on foreign 
affairs and in the joint committee reviewing foreign policy. I 
know he views this issue with great interest and importance.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly the House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.48 p.m.)
<P>
