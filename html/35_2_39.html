Nos. 1, 2 and 3.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am delighted to rise in the debate on unemployment insurance 
reform. Like my colleagues, I will speak with the aim of shedding a 
little light on its impact on the world of culture.
<P>
	This reform being proposed by the Liberal government will have 
a profoundly negative impact on people and employment, as the 
hearings of the parliamentary committee have shown. It appears to 
a number of people, including the Bloc Quebecois, that 
employment insurance, new terminology defined by the reform, is 
nothing more than impoverishment insurance. In other words, the 
unemployed have no more assurance of employment, but they have 
the certainty of going poor.
<P>
	The conditions of eligibility have been tightened. Eligibility 
under this bill increases the threshold level from 12 to 15 15-hour 
weeks to 12 to 20 36-hour weeks, in fact more than double. The 
effect of this new eligibility criterion is to make the system less 
accessible to most employees, especially those who are currently 
working part time.
<P>
	Whereas all workers will have to contribute as of the first hour, 
in Quebec, as in Canada, tens of thousands of workers will have to 
pay premiums without being assured of receiving a single cent of 
benefits in the event their job is terminated, and, in this regard, 
artists, creators and people working in culture will be penalized 
first.
<P>
	Bill C-12 provides for employment insurance protection to part 
time workers and to those holding a number of jobs, but provides 
no such protection for self-employed artists. Artists are considered 
to be  self-employed and therefore are not eligible for employment 
insurance. The government's main argument for excluding 
self-employed workers from the system lies in the fact that workers 
in this category can terminate their employment themselves, 
therefore voluntarily.
<P>
	Of the 156,000 people working in the cultural sector surveyed by 
Statistics Canada, 29 per cent were self-employed, 47 per cent were 
employed and 24 per cent were both self-employed and employed. 
In other words, more than half the people working in the arts and 
culture are partially or fully self-employed and are therefore 
considered independent.
<P>
	The number of independent jobs, that is, part time jobs and 
multiple jobs held by a single individual, increases much more 
quickly than the number of so-called traditional jobs.
<P>
<B>(1005)</B>
<P>
	Basically, the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, feels that 
Bill C-12 should be withdrawn. Our party wants the government to 
withdraw this bill and to have another consultation process to 
ensure a reform of the unemployment insurance system that is 
suited to the new realities of the job market, including the job 
market in non traditional areas.
<P>
	Amazingly this bill on unemployment insurance reform does not 
allow self-employed workers to benefit from the system even 
though it was estimated that the costs to the system would be 
relatively low. Indeed, according to projections, extending 
protection would entail, percentage-wise, a relatively low increase 
of the system's net costs by the year 2004.
<P>
	If Bill C-12 does not allow artists and many others workers in the 
creative and cultural fields to benefit from what is now called 
employment insurance, why levy premiums on their low wages 
when they are systematically excluded from the system? That does 
not make sense.
<P>
	These people are denied access to the employment insurance but 
we levy premiums on their wages from the very first hour worked. 
Considering that most artists as well as numerous other workers in 
the cultural field cannot claim UI benefits or take advantage of 
employee assistance programs-they do not even have a pension 
plan-it is outrageous that Bill C-12, this UI reform project, does 
nothing to remedy the situation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2294"> 2294 </A></B>
<P>
	The employment insurance system conceived by the federal 
government and supposedly in tune with the 21st century's reality, 
offers no coverage to artists and workers in the cultural field. And 
I repeat, the new provisions concerning part time jobs and multiple 
jobs are no help at all for self-employed artists, who are not 
eligible for employment insurance benefits.
<P>
	As official opposition critic in matters of heritage and cultural 
industries, it is my duty to condemn this government's lack of 
action and this reform's unfairness, since there is no definition of 
self-employment or independent work, and no rule or regulation is 
suggested concerning these cases.
<P>
	The government did not deign to take into consideration the brief 
submitted by the cultural sector human resources council. To quote 
only one example, Revenue Canada recently communicated with 
several theatrical booking agencies in Toronto to tell them that 
since they were hiring actors, consequently they should contribute 
as employers to the unemployment insurance system. But the fact 
is actors are self-employed, they are the ones paying for the 
services of booking agencies, it is not the other way around.
<P>
	It should be noted that in this particular case, Revenue Canada 
and its management are acting in such a way that they add insult to 
injury. Not only are actors, artists and creators not entitled to UI 
benefits, but Revenue Canada wants to extort UI premiums from 
casting agents or others, on behalf of people who are not entitled to 
benefits under this plan. We recognize here the Liberal way to do 
things for the sole purpose of padding the public purse and getting 
the deficit under control at the expense of ordinary people, 
especially artists, creators and cultural workers.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by reminding this House that, in 1980, 
over 15 years ago, the federal government signed the UNESCO 
Belgrade recommendation concerning the status of the artist, 
clearly upheld in the Status of the Artist Act, which received royal 
assent on June 23, 1992.
<P>
	The status of the artist, clearly defined by the Belgrade 
recommendation, endorses the notion that artists must be eligible 
to the same UI benefits as any other citizens.
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	As the opposition critic for heritage and cultural matters, I 
condemn this government's ignorance, its blatant ignorance 
regarding the Belgrade recommendation it signed. Nowhere in the 
bill on unemployment insurance reform, nowhere in Bill C-12 is 
there mention of the status of the artist, of the words artist, creator, 
cultural workers.
<P>
	The words artist, worker, creator are not part of the vocabulary 
of the government or the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. We have every right, on this side of the House, to ask 
this government, in the name of justice and fairness, to withdraw 
this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this bill. In 
particular, I want to comment on how disappointed I was to sit 
through part of the committee's deliberations on the bill. This 
committee meeting went on for 24 hours, three full working days. 
During that time the Bloc Quebecois did not put forward one single 
amendment of any substance whatsoever and certainly not on the 
issue of artists and employment, about which the member has just 
spoken.
<P>
	I wonder where the lack of interest in this important sector of our 
economy is: on this side of the House or on the other side of the 
House.
<P>
	I want to speak on what this legislation does for women who, as 
all of us know, have significant barriers to advancing in the 
workplace, to having equality economically as workers, and to talk 
about some of the ways in which this bill has significant 
advantages for women.
<P>
	The bill ensures that women will have their benefits reduced less 
than men. Whereas men in the workforce will see a 10 per cent 
reduction it will be 7 per cent for women by the year 2001. This is 
important because Canada has been a world leader in its 
commitment to gender analysis of major new policy initiatives. 
This is the first major new policy initiative on which a gender 
analysis has been done and for which the minister, cabinet and 
members of Parliament have the full ability to understand how a 
piece of legislation affects women differently from men and 
ensures that we are moving toward equality rather than away from 
it in the measures we take.
<P>
	All part time work will now be insured. This is a major boost to 
women in the workplace who are nearly 70 per cent of Canada's 
part time workforce. For the first time a quarter of a million women 
who hold down part time jobs will have their work insured. They 
will be entitled to claim employment insurance benefits if and 
when they lose their jobs.
<P>
	Under employment insurance many women will be able to 
escape the so-called 14-hour job trap. Because all jobs will be 
insured, employers will no longer have an incentive to keep jobs 
under 15 hours a week. Women who hold down more than one job 
to make ends meet will now be fully insured.
<P>
	Under the new process all hours worked, every single hour, will 
count toward a claim for people who become unemployed. This 
means that multiple job holders will be fully covered if they take 
sick, if they take maternity or paternity leave or lose one or more of 
their jobs for one reason or another.
<P>
	While more women will be covered, many others will have 
premiums refunded. About 700,000 women who earn $2,000 or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2295"> 2295 </A></B>
<P>
less a year will receive a refund, including  495,000 who pay 
premiums today and have little chance of qualifying for benefits.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	Equality of opportunity is a basic Canadian value. We have 
implemented measures to help single parents and low income 
families get back on their feet. Low income families, two-thirds of 
which we know are headed by women, will see their employment 
benefits actually increased by 12 per cent thanks to the family 
income supplement and other measures. Benefits for single parent 
families specifically will increase by 13 per cent.
<P>
	The family income supplement will boost the weekly income of 
many low income families, many of which are headed by women. 
It will boost the living standard of children in this country. The 
family income supplement will provide an average top up of $800 
per family for families with incomes of under $26,000 a year.
<P>
	Exceptions to the intensity rule will also help women. We have 
also made a provision so that women returning to the workforce 
perhaps after having taken five years off to care for a child will 
have access to employment programs. It also means that low 
income women will be able to increase their weekly income while 
claiming benefits. The increased earnings exemption will mean 
women are able to earn up to $50 a week or 25 per cent of their 
benefits, whichever is higher, while on claim.
<P>
	Because there has been so much discussion about this issue in 
the House and in public particularly in the last few weeks, I would 
like to talk about the role members of Parliament have played in 
this legislation. One of the commitments our government made 
when it was elected was to give members of Parliament a stronger 
role in developing legislation and in representing their constituents. 
This bill is a very good example of that process.
<P>
	The bill was referred to committee before it was debated in 
Parliament and before it was subject to any approval or voting 
whatsoever. Through that process members of Parliament from all 
parties had an opportunity to shape the bill, to suggest changes to it 
and to bring back a full report without the constraints of it being 
government policy and something to which they had to adhere 
before Parliament debated the bill. Therefore, Parliament would be 
able to debate it in full awareness of the views of members of 
Parliament from all parties and from all regions of the country.
<P>
	When the bill went back to committee, members of Parliament 
were very instrumental in amending the bill. I want to mention 
three members of my own party in particular who brought forward 
significant amendments. They told the minister this was not good 
enough for their constituents. This is the way members of 
Parliament effectively represent their constituents, by identifying 
problems and working to solve those problems.
<P>
	I pay particular tribute to the member for 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury who dealt with the seasonal 
employment workers who work a bit, then do not work and then 
work again. He made sure it was their total working time that 
counted and that the gaps in between those periods of working did 
not discount their benefits.
<P>
	I pay tribute to the member for Halifax West who ensured that 
there were higher payments in high unemployment regions.
<P>
	I pay tribute to the member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore who 
made a significant change to encourage people to find work, which 
is one of the fundamental principles of this bill. This bill 
encourages people to find work and does not penalize them when 
they find an extra day, a week or an hour of work. The member for 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore was key in making a change that would 
make it more productive for people as they would not lose benefits 
by taking on extra work that supplemented their income.
<P>
	This is the way our government has encouraged Parliament and 
members of our caucus to work. Through that, I believe it has 
encouraged members of Parliament from the different parties to 
work together more closely. That is why the consideration of this 
bill over the last few days has been very discouraging.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois simply filibustered in the committee. It kept 
the committee sitting all night, not doing any work on the bill, but 
just debating. Bloc members talked endlessly, hour after hour 
throughout the night. Not one single amendment to the bill was put 
forward. There were no constructive ideas, no positive 
contributions. They just sat there and talked over and over again.
<P>
	I am pleased to support the bill. As with every piece of 
legislation that passes through this House it is not perfect but it 
does make major progress for the workers of this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is unanimnous agreement on Bill C-12 dealing with 
employment insurance. For two years now, in Canada and in 
Quebec, we have seen Canadians and numerous groups 
representing them oppose this unfair bill which will only make 
workers poorer, especially young workers and women who already 
have a most difficult time on the labour market.
<P>
	If government had not gagged the human resources committee, 
these groups could have explained once more how the bill will not 
help the jobless because the reform it proposes will create even 
more poverty and, by modifying eligibility criteria, will send more 
people onto welfare.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2296"> 2296 </A></B>
<P>
	During the last election campaign, the Liberals, besides 
promising to scrap the GST, also used another very important 
slogan: jobs, jobs, jobs. Now, Quebecers and Canadians know 
quite well the value of promises made by members of this 
government. What has the government accomplished since 
October 25, 1993? The answer is simple: it has just carried on with 
the previous government's program, the Mulroney agenda. Cut 
after cut, social programs, and therefore the have-nots, are the 
main targets.
<P>
	Our harsh judgment is not based on an erratic bias against an 
intelligent reform of social programs or a logical reform of our 
unemployment insurance program. The proposed reform makes no 
sense. These programs must be reviewed so that they will equitably 
meet the real needs of people who are having a hard time finding 
and keeping jobs. But there is only one objective to the current 
reform: to make blind cuts that will hit hard the poorest and 
workers. The government is artificially reducing the deficit at the 
expense of employers and workers who contribute to the 
unemployment insurance fund.
<P>
	Indeed, since 1990, that is for the last six years, the government 
has been pulling out of financing the fund, while continuing to 
manage it. The very substantial surpluses realized by the funds 
these last few years have been used to reduce the deficit. Premiums 
have been slyly disguised as a tax to reduce the deficit. Those who 
are lucky enough to work have the exceptional privilege of paying 
this new tax called unemployment insurance contribution, even 
though it is not being used exclusively to meet the needs of those 
who are not as privileged.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois, in its minority report on social program 
reform, proposed ``that the unemployment insurance fund be 
treated as a non-budget entity managed by an independent 
organization. The way the program is controlled and contributions 
used must be changed''. Therefore, the preferred route chosen by 
the Bloc Quebecois would be to give management of the program 
to the provinces. We could also set up a new organization which 
would exercize a better control over unemployment insurance and 
would not come under the control of the Department of Human 
Resources Development.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	Major labour confederations in Quebec and Canada, as well as 
organizations like the Canadian Manufacturers Association and the 
Conseil du patronat du Québec were highly critical of the the 
government's accumulation of surpluses in the unemployment 
insurance fund. Such surpluses, combined with the fact that the 
government continues to cut into the program, do not contribute in 
any way to job creation. On the contrary, they are a major obstacle.
<P>
	As for unemployment insurance eligibility, Bill C-12, if passed, 
will have a devastating effect on the possibility of  benefiting from 
unemployment insurance in case of job loss. In 1990, 87 per cent of 
unemployed people were receiving benefits, while only 46 per cent 
do today. It does not make sense to think that this percentage could 
decrease even further.
<P>
	Yet, what the minister is proposing to us in his bill will not 
increase this percentage, quite the opposite. In fact, the number of 
hours required to qualify for benefits is more than doubled, going 
from 420 to 700 hours, instead of the 180 to 300 hours required at 
this time. For new workers, it will be even more dramatic, because 
they will have to work for 910 hours before qualifying.
<P>
	Furthermore, the maximum benefit will decrease from $448 to 
$413 per week. This $35 cut thus reduces by more than 7 per cent 
the maximum a person losing his job will be entitled to, provided, 
of course, he meets the eligibility criteria. So, their reduced buying 
power will force the unemployed to curtail their lifestyle and cut 
into some of their most basic needs. It is a bread and butter matter. 
Everyone understands that, except the government, of course.
<P>
	So, people will have to work longer to receive fewer benefits and 
for a shorter period. That is how the Liberal government sees the 
improvement of the system. These new eligibility criteria will 
particularly affect young people and women. Since these groups 
represent the majority of part time workers, they will need a very 
high number of hours to qualify for benefits.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development should take 
example on his colleague from the finance department who, as 
recently as yesterday, in the House, during question period, 
reiterated his statement that the promise to abolish the GST had 
been a mistake. He even said he was making this statement on 
behalf of the government of the Liberal Party. It is high time the 
minister admitted that his bill is a gross error and that it must be 
withdrawn without delay.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to draw the attention of the House to 
a statement in the May 1, 1989 issue of <I>Hansard</I>: ``The point I am 
trying to make, which many of us will have to look at seriously, is 
the whole notion of trust and credibility. Canadians are prepared to 
share the burden, if they think it is being done fairly. 
Unemployment insurance, family allowance, and old age pensions 
are a sacred trust. We must not allow the trust of Canadians to 
deteriorate to a point where they become cynical. I have listened to 
people talk about New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and about 
other countries and how they do it. This country is very special in 
how it deals across the board with men and women in every part of 
the country. There are basic standards, basic programs, universal 
programs, and programs that allow people to deal with their future 
with some degree of security''.
<P>
	What stands out from these remarks made by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development when he was  in opposition is that, 
with Bill C-12, the degree of security the minister is referring to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2297"> 2297 </A></B>
<P>
will certainly turn into income insecurity for those who will lose 
their jobs under the Employment Insurance Act. It is unfortunate 
that logic is dependent on which side of the House one sits on.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, B.Q.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to Bill C-12, concerning 
the unemployment insurance reform. This bill has been shamefully 
entitled an act respecting employment insurance in Canada.
<P>
	Through this bill, the government claims, and has clearly said so, 
to be pursuing two goals: first, to promote job creation, and, 
second, to improve the system's fairness. However, we will see that 
this bill will do exactly the opposite and that, here again, the 
government is about to increase the unfairness of the system, as 
was pointed out by my colleague who spoke just before me.
<P>
	First, there will be no job creation. Why? As we all know, the 
Prime Minister has been repeating ad nauseam for a few weeks that 
the government is not there to create jobs. With the massive layoffs 
in the public service, the privatization of ports, airports, railway 
lines and bridges, and now the disposal of railway cars announced 
in Bill C-31, where at least 10,000 railway cars will be sold, it is 
clear that, instead of creating jobs, the government is organizing a 
gigantic closing sale.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is perfectly right in saying that a government 
does not create jobs. However, the Prime Minister says: 
``Government does not create jobs. I urge the private sector to join 
with us to make that job growth happen; the private sector will 
create jobs''.
<P>
	Again, this is only partly true, because it is not large companies 
that create jobs. In fact, these companies are the ones laying off the 
largest number of people, this at a time when their profits are 
higher than ever before. General Motors made profits of $1.39 
billion, but laid off 2,500 employees. In 1995, Bell Canada made 
profits of $502 million, but laid off 3,200 employees, in addition to 
the 8,000 that had already been let go since 1990. Petro-Canada, 
which sort of belongs to us since we paid for it, made profits of 
$196 million, but laid off 564 employees. Shell made profits of 
$523 million in one year, but laid off 471 employees. Imperial Oil 
made profits of $514 million, but laid off 452 employees.
<P>
	And, last but not least, the five major Canadian banks, which 
made total profits of $4.9 billion. This means 5,000 million dollars 
in profits. Still, these banks laid off 2,800 employees.
<P>
	Do not tell us that major companies create jobs when they make 
profits. Do not tell us, as the Prime Minister did, that private 
companies are the ones that will create jobs.
<P>
	The presidents of these banks are paid incredibly high salaries. 
Jeffrey Simpson, from the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, recently wrote a very 
good article on this issue. He said the situation was totally 
unacceptable, because these undue benefits and enormous salaries 
are not related to performance. Just remember Canary Wharf, in 
which Canadian banks lost hundreds of millions because they made 
bad investment decisions. The banks do not always make the right 
decisions. Yet, not one of these bank presidents had his salary cut. 
There is no connection between performance and salaries. Their 
salaries go up each year, while employees are being laid off. This is 
what is happening.
<P>
	If, as the Prime Minister says, it is not the government that 
creates jobs, and if, as we can see, it is not large companies either, 
then who will create jobs? It is small and medium size businesses, 
it is, as Mr. Parizeau said, the ``tiny, tiny businesses''. They are the 
ones creating jobs; yet, they are also the ones that will be penalized 
with Bill C-12, as we shall see.
<P>
	Under the old system-I use the word ``old'' but I should say 
``current''-workers and employers start paying unemployment 
insurance premiums after 15 hours of work or $163 in earnings. 
The amount earned is called the insurable earnings. This is what the 
current system provides for.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	But with the changes being introduced, employees and 
employers will pay UI premiums from the very first hour of work. 
Who usually hires people for less than 15 hours a week? Not large 
corporations, not Bell Canada, not General Motors, not Petro 
Canada; small and medium size businesses do. What will it mean 
for them?
<P>
	Previously, people could work for up to 15 hours a week without 
either the employee or the employer having to pay UI premiums. 
Now, as soon as a person works an hour, both that person and the 
business will have to pay premiums. That means that the whole 
payroll is covered, from the first hour of work, which directly hits 
small and medium size businesses.
<P>
	This new grab for premiums will bring close to $1 billion into 
the unemployment insurance account, and that huge amount will 
come from low wage earners and from all small businesses, which 
are the only ones creating jobs in Canada. And they talk about job 
creation.
<P>
	Meanwhile, what is happening at the other end of the system? 
They are lowering the contribution ceilings. Previously, people 
were contributing into the UI account up to maximum earnings of 
$42,380. This meant the worker contributed up to that amount and 
the employer was also paying his or her share up to that amount. 
That ceiling is now being lowered to $39,000 and both workers and 
businesses will pay less.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2298"> 2298 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore, that billion dollars will be taken from the small 
business sector, the one that creates jobs, which will  allow for the 
same amount of savings for large corporations that are laying off 
people in droves. So, Bill C-12 will not create, but kill jobs.
<P>
	It is easy to understand. Here is an example. Under the present 
plan, if a company has an employee who earns $40,000 a year, both 
the employee and the company contribute to the UI fund on those 
$40,000.
<P>
	Since the earnings ceiling is $42,000, contributions would be 
paid on the whole amount. But under the new plan, if the company 
has a surplus of work, it will be much more profitable to have the 
same employee work overtime for $30,000 or more, with his 
annual earnings going up to $70,000 a year or more, because there 
are no contributions for the earnings over $39,000.
<P>
	Instead of hiring another employee to do the work, it is much 
better for the company to have its existing workers work overtime. 
This bill will not accelerate, but slow down job creation. We talk 
about work sharing, but it is obvious that this bill does not deal with 
this issue at all.
<P>
	We have also been told that greater equity was another goal. That 
was their second argument. But the bill will actually make things 
more unfair. High income earners will pay $900 million less in 
premiums.
<P>
	With Bill C-12, high income earners and big companies, which 
do not create jobs, will get a $900 million cut in contributions. That 
is a nice little gift. But to compensate that, low income workers and 
small businesses, which do create jobs, will have to pay more. That 
is what is happening with Bill C-12.
<P>
	I remind the House that 82 per cent of all spending cuts across 
federal programs are in unemployment insurance. Needless to say, 
Mr. Speaker, as you are indicating that my time is almost over, that 
with Bill C-12, the government not only breaks its promises to 
create justice but also balances the budget with the workers's 
money. This is a collective salary grab of $5 billion, since the 
money in the UI fund is not the government's money but has been 
contributed by workers and businesses, and the government is 
using this money to reduce its deficit.
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	In our view, this bill will stimulate poverty instead of 
employment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues 
did earlier, I would like to say a few words about this bill, not about 
each of its clauses, because it is a rather thick, not to say dense, 
document and I would need more than one day to go over 
everything.
<P>
	The fact that some 220 amendments to what the government 
thinks is a perfect or almost perfect bill have been moved goes to 
show that it is in fact far from perfect and needs a few alterations at 
least to make it better.
<P>
	We only need to look at the title to see all the problems the 
government had to deal with to make this bill look more attractive. 
The government wants to replace an insurance against 
unemployment by an insurance that almost goes against 
employment, but of course, it cannot put it this way. I had a 
professor, at university, who used to teach us about insurance and 
explain the principle behind insurance, as was developed by the 
British, as follows. He would say it in English and we would be 
very impressed since, at the time, although we did not speak 
English fluently, we paid a lot of attention to whatever was said in 
English or to English principles.
<P>
	The professor used to say: ``The principle behind insurance is as 
follows: ``To divide amongst the many the losses of the few''''. He 
would then explain in French, for those who like me at the time did 
not understand a word of English, that it meant to divide amongst 
the majority of the people concerned the losses of a number of 
them. So, the object of the unemployment insurance program we 
used to know was to divide among the majority of the people who 
were lucky enough to have a job the losses incurred by the few who 
had the misfortune to lose their jobs and end up on unemployment. 
That is the fundamental principle behind ou unemployment 
insurance system.
<P>
	Now, we see that the government wants to change the name, 
probably to suggest that we want to divide among as many people 
as possible or among the majority the losses incurred by those who 
would find a job. I hope that is not what it means. You do not get 
insurance against a job, although that could make some kind of 
sense, because the government kept talking about jobs, jobs, jobs, 
and people could say: ``What if I suddenly find a job, maybe it 
could hurt me. It might be better to keep receiving UI benefits or to 
find something else'', since the jobs currently available are not 
enough to make a decent living.
<P>
	I am kidding when I say that, because it would be ridiculous for 
the government to seek passage for a bill that would protect us 
against the risk of finding a job. What the government tells us, and 
I think this is how we must interpret it, is that this bill seeks to 
assure people that they will keep or find a job on the labour force.
<P>
	Now we must ask ourselves this: Does the bill, as drafted, reach 
this goal? I cannot demonstrate that every section of the bill does 
not meet this goal, but I would like to give some examples of real 
cases in our ridings, particularly in mine.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	I will give the example of women or men, but as it happens it is 
more frequently women, who want to re-enter the labour force after 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2299"> 2299 </A></B>
<P>
having raised their children or for some other reason, after having 
been outside the labour force for some years. What happens to 
these women? Those who are lucky enough to find a job  will have 
to pay UI premiums as soon as they start working. But to be 
entitled to benefits, even if their job is a short term one and if they 
work only for a few weeks or months, they will have to have 
worked at least 910 hours. What does that mean, in practical terms? 
We have to compare because for people who are already working 
and lose their job, the number of hours is not as high. I believe it is 
something like 700 hours.
<P>
	What does that mean in practice for these women? After having 
raised their family, they cannot rest on their laurels because they 
want to get back to work. Let us say a woman finds a job where she 
works 3 hours a day, from 9 to noon, 5 days a week, which amounts 
to 15 hours. If this person is very hard working and really wants to 
make more money, she also works on Saturday. So she works 6 
days a week, 3 hours a day, for a total of 18 hours. At a rate of 18 
hours a week, this person will have accumulated at the end of the 
year-and I am counting only 50 weeks because this person really 
deserves 2 weeks holidays-900 hours of work. It would only be 
750 hours if she worked 15 hours a week. Since the law requires a 
minimum of 910 hours to be eligible for employment insurance, 
this person, after having worked 900 hours during the year, will not 
be deemed eligible for employment insurance if she loses her job.
<P>
	So this person pulls herself together and tries again the following 
year. She starts working in January at a rate of 15 hours a week 
because there is no other job to be had, and her boss needs her for 
only 15 hours, or 18 hours, a week. She starts working again, and 
will accumulate 750 hours if she works 15 hours a week or 900 
hours if she works 6 days a week. At the end of the second year, she 
will have accumulated 900 hours again. If she loses her job at the 
end of the second year, she will not be eligible for employment 
insurance again. But she will have paid premiums from the 
beginning.
<P>
	From the very first hour of work, this worker has paid premiums 
for unemployment insurance, or employment insurance as we must 
call it now. At $2.95 for each $100 earned, her contribution will 
total $186 at the end of the year. After two years, it is two times 
$186. After 5 years at $186 a year, those contributions amount to 
close to $1,000. However, that worker would still not be eligible for 
employment insurance. If that is what the government calls helping 
people to get back to work, I think that it will have to realize that it 
is not the right way of helping people.
<P>
	We could take the example of day care workers. In remote areas, 
families where the father and the mother work have difficulty 
finding people to take care of their children. These people do not 
want to declare their earnings because, of course, they do not make 
enough and they would be penalized. How does unemployment 
insurance help those people? It cannot help them because there is 
no way for them to become eligible for unemployment insurance.
<P>
	I would also have liked to give the example of training courses 
denied to people who are already too resourceful. When they find 
themselves unemployed and they want to improve their skills to 
redirect their career, they are told that they are too resourceful or 
too highly educated to have access to the courses and that they must 
continue to get unemployment insurance benefits and look for a job 
without additional training. This is ridiculous.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	I would have liked to talk about self-employed workers but, 
since my time is running out, I will leave that to my colleagues. 
Maybe I will have an opportunity to do so myself later on if the 
government allows us to debate this bill all day today and again 
next Monday and Tuesday. We will have the opportunity to deal 
with these points and to say how this legislation does nothing to 
help people who are unemployed or who want to find steady 
employment.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I see that you are listening to me with great interest 
and respect, as you always do, and I thank you for that. Once you 
leave the Chair, you will no doubt help me convince your 
colleagues of the validity of my remarks.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am sure the member for 
Joliette understands full well that, as your Speaker, I never let party 
politics get in the way of my work.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in the 
House today to speak to Bill C-12, an act respecting employment 
insurance in Canada.
<P>
	This is certainly a strange name for a bill that will be harmful to 
certain groups of Canadians and Quebecers, denying them the 
protection of the UI system and plunging them deeper into poverty. 
1996 is the International Year for the Elimination of Poverty, a fact 
the government seems to have forgotten.
<P>
	I would like to begin by saying that Bloc members are not 
opposed to social program reform. We are, and have always been, 
in favour of UI reform in order to keep the system up to date.
<P>
	In our opinion, Bill C-12 fails completely to meet this need to 
move with the times. Under the reform now before us, the poorest 
members of society would essentially end up paying for the 
financial irresponsibility of the financial government, and the latter 
would see its role in provincial areas of jurisdiction increased.
<P>
	In fact, this is quite the opposite of the promises made by this 
government barely six months ago in Quebec. One that is 
particularly representative comes to mind, something about having 
to face the music. In light of what has happened since, it is clear 
that the Prime Minister was addressing not just the Quebec 
government, but also had in mind Quebecers who were 
unemployed, particularly women and young people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2300"> 2300 </A></B>
<P>
	We must analyse this bill for what it is and not for what certain 
Liberal members would have us think it is. It is estimated that 
over 30,000 Quebecers and Canadians will be forced to turn to 
welfare if this bill is passed. As recently as yesterday, an article 
in <I>Le Devoir</I> reminded us, and I quote: ``According to a study 
commissioned by the Quebec Department of Manpower and 
Income Security, single mothers were the group particularly 
affected by unemployment insurance reform. A sizeable number 
of them would be forced onto welfare rolls''.
<P>
	The situation is clear. Several of the measures contained in the 
bill will affect the disadvantaged, whose jobs are generally 
unstable and at the bottom of the scale. For example, at present, 
workers are required to contribute to unemployment insurance 
once they have worked 15 hours in a week, or have earned $163. 
Bill C-12 proposes to make everyone contribute from the first hour 
worked.
<P>
	Workers get their contributions back only if they have earned 
less than $2,000 in a year, and only when filing their income tax 
return. Until then, the government has the use of the workers' 
contributions, and the interest earned on them. This simple 
measure will affect part time workers in particular, and 70 per cent 
of these are women or young people. Let us not forget, as well, that 
the government can dip just as freely into the UI fund, to which it 
does not contribute one red cent.
<P>
	The reform proposed by the Liberal government will also restrict 
access to the plan. At present, a worker has to work at least 15 
hours a week, for 12 to 20 weeks, to be eligible for unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	Amendments in Bill C-12 will force possible claimants to work 
at least 35 hours a week for 12 to 20 weeks, depending on the area. 
Keep in mind that 31 per cent of women in Canada and Quebec 
work less than 35 hours a week. Therefore this is a double penalty.
<P>
	Moreover new workers will be forced to work more than 910 
hours before being eligible, a three-fold increase. This measure 
will seriously impact on women who return to work after have 
stayed home for a while. Young people just coming onto the job 
market are also hard hit. Many women and young people will 
contribute to the unemployment insurance fund but will not 
accumulate enough hours to be entitled to claim. They will pay 
premiums without ever being able to receive UI benefits.
<P>
	It is no wonder therefore that so many women's groups and 
student associations have submitted briefs against the proposals. 
They understood, just as we did, that because of those measures 
they could very well be prevented from ever participating in the 
system. The Syndicat de la fonction publique du Québec maintains 
that this legislation is violating section 15 of the Canadian  Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms because of its discriminatory impact on 
some disadvantaged groups.
<P>
	Moreover, certain provisions of the bill provide for a 1 per cent 
reduction in benefits for workers who have claimed benefits for 20 
weeks or more during the last five years, up to a maximum of 5 per 
cent. Again, this will have a negative impact on seasonal and 
contract workers.
<P>
	Again, women and young people can be found in great numbers 
in areas where seasonal and contract work is the norm. The 
government wants to punish women and young people for being 
too often on UI, treating them as if they were to be blamed for 
losing their job and for the precarious nature of the labour market.
<P>
	Using family income to determine eligibility for the family 
supplement has harmful effects. This is a form of income support 
which is closely related to welfare. This is not the role of 
unemployment insurance. Why not increase the child tax benefit 
instead? Shamefully, this measure brings women back to square 
one with regard to their financial autonomy.
<P>
	Finally, since I am running out of time, I would like to mention 
one last measure contained in Bill C-12, which discriminates 
against women in the area of maternity leave. Fewer and fewer 
women are entitled to maternity leave. Current statutory provisions 
require a minimum of twenty 15 hour work weeks to be eligible for 
maternity leave. Under the new provisions, over 700 hours of work 
will be needed.
<P>
	However, the very person in charge of the status of women keeps 
on denying that these measures are disastrous for women and 
young people. The Secretary of State for the Status of Women, 
appearing before the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, 
claimed that, far from penalizing women, the unemployment 
insurance reform would benefit them.
<P>
	And yet, even the Minister of Human Resources Development 
has recognized that his reform would be harmful and that the bill 
should be amended. This incident reminds us that since the 
government abolished the Canadian Advisory Council on the 
Status of Women, there is no longer any group defending women's 
interests within government.
<P>
	What can we say about this government's attitude and its lack of 
compassion for young people? The only measure it implemented 
was to create a training program called ``Experience Canada'', 
which constitutes another intrusion into provincial jurisdiction. But 
the best part is, just listen to this, the program is managed by the 
Council for Canadian Unity. As young people would say, things are 
not cool between the Council for Canadian Unity and young 
people. Do not treat us like a bunch of twits.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="2301"> 2301 </A></B>

<P>
	Ultimately, what we are asking today is that the Minister of 
Human Resources Development do what his ex-colleague Sheila 
Copps did and keep his word by withdrawing his unfair Bill C-12.

	It was not an act of God that produced his government's

	It was not God that tried to cover up facts in the Somali affair, it 
was trusted officials. Nor did God start the multimillion dollar 
lawsuit against a former Prime Minister over Airbus. It was 
government officials.
<P>
	God did not tell Public Works to push Anne Rainey off the Peace 
Tower project because she was a woman, nor did God cause the 
discrimination against Chander Grover at the NRC. Government 
officials did and they gave financial backing to the perpetrators of 
this inequality.

	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I wonder if the people of the Atlantic provinces really are aware of 
how much extra tax they will have to pay because their provincial 
Liberal governments have come to the rescue of the federal Liberal 
government as it desperately tries to save face on the GST 
nightmare.
<P>
	The actions of their governments will mean that consumers will 
now pay taxes on such things as children's clothing, second hand 
goods, heating oil, gasoline, new homes and funerals. While the 
rest of the country's taxpayers will pay for their government's 
inability to keep a promise, the people of the east coast will 
ultimately be the ones to suffer under this harmonization scheme.
<P>
	The GST rate may be lower for the time being, but when the 
so-called subsidy runs out and the provincial governments find 
they have to make up this difference, where will it come from? 
According to the memorandum of understanding it could come 
from the Atlantic Canadians themselves as they face increased 
provincial taxes to cover the shortfall.
<P>
	Harmonization is not what the government promised on the 
campaign trail and harmonization, plain and simple, means higher 
taxes for all. Talk about government by broken promises.

	Events of the past week cause all of us to examine our actions

party will take seriously the challenge to tackle the roots of racism 
and not try to paper it over by simply cleaning up some language.
<P>
	Since the last election we have seen a pattern in the intolerant 
statements of members of the third party. Sometimes they are 
dismissed, like the slur on Chinese culture, or blaming blacks for 
crime. Sometimes there is an apology for the language, like the 
comments about Muslim veils, but no change in position or action.
<P>
	This time I hope we will see some action and change in position 
to show that they have really learned something about the meaning 
of equality in this country.

am sorry, it is not the media that is responsible for the long record 
of intolerant statements made by Reform Party members.

	Was it the media that prompted the member for New 
Westminster-Burnaby to blame gay men for violence against

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today is the world day in favour of freedom of the press.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois joins with all those who will rise to remind 
us of the importance of a conscientious and honest press in a 
democratic society. We deplore the killing, the imprisonment and 
the disappearance of journalists whose only crime was to want to 
inform. In 1995, in Algeria alone, 22 journalists were killed while 
fulfilling their duties.
<P>
	Although such a tragic situation does not exist in Canada, we 
must be vigilant, as evidenced by recent statements by Joan 
Crockatt, news desk officer of the <I>Calgary Herald</I>, who said that 
Southam News should create news on national unity and that it had 
a plan to promote national unity. This shows how fragile our 
system is.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have a correctional system which is no longer effective 
in deterring criminal behaviour because it has lost the will to 
punish.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2304"> 2304 </A></B>
<P>
	Three decades of correctional experiments in which many 
violent and serious criminals are forced against their will to 
participate in rehabilitation programs has proven costly and 
largely ineffective. The collapse of Edmonton's facility for women 
illustrates the failure of Canadian corrections to manage criminals, 
let alone change their behaviour.
<P>
	Making prison conditions too easy only undercuts the deterrent 
effect of imprisonment. The philosophy that dangerous, violent and 
repeat offenders serving hard time should live in residential style 
cottage units, benefit from taxpayer funded perks such as 
university education, cable and colour television and special meals 
is wrong-headed.
<P>
	Canadians want dangerous offenders held in maximum security 
institutions, not in prisons where the electronic door locks and 
alarm systems do not work. Canadians are demanding public safety 
first, punishment second and rehabilitation third. When will the 
Liberals learn from their mistakes?

	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
for the third time in one week we have witnessed offensive and 
hurtful comments being spread by members of the Reform Party.
<P>
	I am referring to the comments made on Wednesday by the 
member for Yorkton-Melville. Once again a member of the 
Reform Party has lashed out against a minority group, this time 
Canada's aboriginal community. This Reform member made 
derogatory remarks about Canada's native leadership when he said 
that its leadership will turn native self-government into fascist 
states. These statements are inexcusable. He has chosen to condone 
Neanderthal sentiments by repeating them in this chamber.
<P>
	The Reform Party leader has assured Canadians he would no 
longer tolerate this behaviour in his caucus. Further outbreaks 
would warrant their expulsion.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	Canadians must count on the leader of the Reform Party to keep 
his promise and ask for the resignation of the member for 
Yorkton-Melville. Canadians must be assured that even 
Reformers can keep their promises.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ORALQUESTIONS">ORAL QUESTIONS</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Quebec is exasperated. On January 18, 1996, Minister of 
Employment Louise Harel submitted to the federal government a 
proposed agreement to implement the Quebec consensus on the 
repatriation of manpower training programs. On April 17, a 
meeting between that minister and the Minister of Human 
Resources Development was cancelled without being rescheduled. 
On April 25, the Société québécoise de développement de la 
main-d'oeuvre in turn urged the federal government to respond to 
Quebec as quickly as possible. As far as we know, it did not get an 
answer either.
<P>
	Instead of announcing programs that only increase overlap and 
complicate the situation even further, does the minister not 
recognize that the time has come for him to sit down at the 
negotiating table with Quebec and at last fulfil his government's 
promises?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Yes, Mr. Speaker, I do think the time has 
come to see how we can negotiate with all the provinces of Canada 
in order to meet our commitment with respect to training programs. 
However, since the consensus the hon. member is referring to was 
confirmed in Quebec after my meeting with Mrs. Harel in Quebec 
City, I think it is important-once all the provinces are sitting down 
at the negotiating table with us-to have an offer reflecting the 
reality in Canada, in Quebec of course, but also elsewhere.
<P>
	I hope that, with the co-operation of all our provincial colleagues 
responsible for manpower and employment, we can come to an 
agreement. But I can assure the hon. member that, once we are 
sitting down at the negotiating table, our intention is to have a very 
legitimate, clear, comprehensive, unambiguous offer so that we can 
enter into negotiations that will finally lead to the conclusion 
everyone is hoping for.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister is far from reassuring. The Quebec consensus includes 
manpower adjustment programs, manpower policies, and not only 
manpower training. That is clear, as the Chambre de commerce de 
Québec and the Conseil du patronat reiterated before the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Does the minister not agree that Quebec's exasperation is 
justified? It is this consensus Quebec is asking the minister to act 
on by finally sitting down at the negotiating table with Quebec. 
When will the minister do so?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as I understand it, the Quebec 
consensus is very clear. I agree with the hon. member. It is in this 
context that I and the Government of Canada want to be sure we do 
not sit down to another failure at the negotiating table.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2305"> 2305 </A></B>
<P>
	But, as the hon. member might agree, dealing with active 
measures can be very complicated. As far as manpower is 
concerned, I agree with the hon. member that we have already said 
we would indeed withdraw.
<P>
	As for the other elements, commonly referred to as Part II of the 
Employment Insurance Act, it is a very complex matter because the 
needs across the country vary widely. We are familiar with 
Quebec's demands, and that is why we will go much further than 
simply withdrawing from the area of training. We want to look at 
all these other elements the hon. member was referring to.
<P>
	Once we sit down at the negotiating table, I can assure the hon. 
member that the Government of Canada will put forward a 
straightforward proposal that, I hope, will meet the demands made 
by Quebec and all the other provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
taking good note of the minister's answer. I am also taking good 
note of the fact that no date has been set for these negotiations.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Does the minister not agree that the federal government seems 
much more concerned about its plan B, the Guy Bertrand version, 
than about recognizing in concrete terms the Quebec consensus on 
manpower policies?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is precisely-at least in 
part-to avoid bringing into the debate all the other well-known 
elements related to manpower training and the active measures to 
help create jobs that we want to be certain our proposal will be very 
easy to understand. In my opinion, we will then have a legitimate 
hope of reaching an agreement not only with Quebec, but also with 
all the other provinces.
<P>
	Once our work is done, and we are almost there-I do not like to 
set deadlines when we are not certain we can meet them-I am 
confident that, in the near future, we will be able to sit down at the 
negotiating table with our colleagues from all the provinces. Of 
course, there is always the possibility that the Prime Minister will 
hold a conference with his provincial counterparts from across the 
country; there are all kinds of timetables that must be considered.
<P>
	We want to assure the hon. member as well as all those interested 
in this issue that we will go ahead. We want to make sure that our 
proposal, when it is presented, will be well thought out and meet 
the needs not only of government officials but also of the people we 
really want to help: the men and women working in all kinds of 
jobs across the country and those looking for work.
<P>

to please make their questions and answers a little shorter.

	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.
<P>
	Yesterday, in this House, the Minister of Finance stood by his 
statement to the effect that his government had made an honest 
mistake in promising to abolish the GST. He even said that he was 
speaking on behalf of the government when he made that comment.
<P>
	Will the President of the Treasury Board confirm that the 
comments made yesterday by the Minister of Finance do reflect his 
government's thinking?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was privileged to be a member of 
the finance committee which travelled across the country for the 
consultations with respect to the GST. I was accompanied by 
members of her party and of the third party.
<P>
	We heard Canadians, we consulted with Canadians and we 
responded with a package of changes and a harmonized national 
value added tax. We listened to Canadians. We did what they asked 
us to do and it is consistent with our red book commitments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my supplementary is also for the President of the Treasury 
Board.
<P>
	When the Prime Minister refused to recognize he made a 
mistake regarding the GST, he spoke on behalf of his government. 
When the Minister of Finance openly said it was a mistake, he 
claimed to be also speaking on behalf of the government. Who are 
we to believe: the Minister of Finance or the Prime Minister?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no 
divergence from what the Prime Minister has said, what the 
Minister of Finance has said and what the former Deputy Prime 
Minister has said.
<P>
	The fact is this government is committed to the elimination of 
the goods and services tax. We are achieving that goal by the 
vehicle of harmonization of sales taxes with the provinces which is 
now well in train. I think in the next few months we will see even 
further progress on this issue.
<P>
	This government is working to fulfil its promises and is doing so 
in a very difficult financial context. Despite the  best of intentions 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2306"> 2306 </A></B>

sometimes reality confronts us. The Minister of Finance and the

that.

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
the Prime Minister said that politicians cannot be held to their 
election promises because acts of God can knock them off track. 
This is the same man who promised Canadians during the last 
election ``there will not be a promise in the campaign that I will not 
keep''. The Prime Minister cannot have it both ways.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	I ask the government, which is it? Will the Prime Minister keep 
every commitment he made to Canadians during the last campaign, 
or will he admit that his government has broken election promises?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, time and time 
again the Prime Minister has stated that this government has a very 
proud record of discharging its promises as laid out in the red book 
in the last election. We are discharging our promises.
<P>
	Perhaps I could ask the hon. member about his party's promise. 
His party campaigned on doing things differently in politics, a new 
way of politics. Is the new way of politics reflected in the 
statements of the hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan, the 
statements of the hon. member for Athabasca, following on 
statements I could cite from other members in this House? That is 
not the new way of doing politics.
<P>
	I would submit our record in discharging our promises on this 
side stacks up very favourably compared to that of the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps 
the defence minister is rehearsing for when he becomes a member 
of the opposition again. It is the opposition that asks the questions. 
The government answers them.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said that acts of God prevented him from 
keeping some of his promises. Was it an act of God that made the 
Prime Minister sign NAFTA? Was it an act of God that made the 
Prime Minister cut CBC funding? Was it an act of God that cut 
provincial transfer payments to social services and health care? 
Was it an act of God that cut old age security by 10 per cent?
<P>
	The Prime Minister can blame God, floods, famine or locusts for 
his failure. He is the one who broke his promises. Will the Prime 
Minister simply admit that his promises are worthless?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is this 
government that has delivered on its  commitment to reduce the 
deficit. It is this government that has delivered on its commitment 
to restore faith and integrity in public office in this country.
<P>
	The right hon. Prime Minister has led the way in many of these 
promises which we have outlined in the red book. We feel that by 
the time the next election comes, Canadians will judge us on our 
performance and they will see that we have delivered on the 
promises we made in that election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister claims that he has fulfilled 75 per cent of his red book 
promises which is not true. It is simply not true.
<P>
	There are 157 promises in the red book and his government has 
only kept 37 of them. That is barely 25 per cent. It must have been 
some act of God, a huge tornado that swept away 75 per cent of the 
red book promises. The Prime Minister's signature in the red book 
is not worth the paper it is written on.
<P>
	Does the government still intend to implement all the promises 
in the red book, those promises it made to get elected?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when it comes 
to credibility and believing promises, I certainly would put my 
faith in the Prime Minister.
<P>
	When it comes to adding up the promises we have kept, the 
figures of the Prime Minister are more reflective of reality than 
those of the hon. member.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, next May 13, the Quebec superior court will be hearing 
the case of Guy Bertrand, the lawyer who claims the 1995 Quebec 
referendum was illegal under the 1982 Constitution. Yesterday, the 
Minister of Justice indicated to us that the government is seriously 
considering intervening in this case.
<P>
	In order to inform the public and to demonstrate his good faith, 
is the Minister of Justice prepared to table in this House the legal 
opinions he has in hand concerning the Bertrand case?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is true that the federal 
government is contemplating taking part in the proceedings before 
the Quebec superior court. I would, however, like to point out that 
our reason for this is not connected with the positions of either Mr. 
Bertrand or Mr. Singh, but rather the position taken by the 
Government of Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2307"> 2307 </A></B>
<P>
	On April 12 for the Bertrand case, and May 1 for the Singh case, 
the Government of Quebec presented two requests for dismissal 
without a hearing of the two cases which challenged the legislation 
or other measures being used to make a declaration of sovereignty 
legally binding.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	In support of those requests, the Government of Quebec takes 
the position that neither Canadian courts nor the Canadian 
Constitution have anything to do with Quebec's declaration of 
sovereignty.
<P>
	The question we are asking at this time is whether the 
Government of Canada ought to have something to say in response 
to this position, that is to say the position of the Government of 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, </B><B>BQ):</B>Mr. 
Speaker, we totally subscribe to the Quebec position, particularly 
since Quebec is absolutely not in agreement with the 1982 
Constitution, having never signed it.
<P>
	If his government intervenes actively in the Bertrand case, will 
the Minister admit that this confirms the existence of a Plan B on 
the rules of secession, and that he is preparing for a legal denial of 
the fundamental right of the Quebec people to determine their own 
future?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>No, Mr. Speaker. Our consideration of these 
questions, our consideration of the possibility of participation 
before the courts is merely, as I have said, related to the position 
taken by the Government of Quebec. I would also like to stress that 
we have not yet made a decision on this; we are considering our 
decision.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I could not 
find anywhere in the Liberal red book where the Liberals promised 
to replace the GST with a billion dollar cash incentive to three 
provinces. Nowhere, not even on page 22.
<P>
	On the campaign trail the Prime Minister did not say: ``I hate the 
GST, I will kill the GST and I will spend a billion dollars to do 
that''.
<P>
	What act of God is this government hoping for to convince 
Canadians that this government did not break its GST promise and 
that it is not wasting a billion dollars on a cash incentive to hide this 
broken promise?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad the hon. member has asked 
that question. It gives me a chance to remind the hon. member that 
on numerous occasions when we have had structural adjustment the 
government has responded with assistance to those  regions that 
require it. That is what is taking place in the implementation of the 
national harmonized value added tax in the Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	I will repeat again what the member and others in his party have 
heard time and time again. It is worth repeating one more time in 
the hopes that they will absorb it this time. It is going to be an 
enormous improvement for those Atlantic provinces. We are 
sharing the cost of adjustment with those provinces, consistent with 
what we have done for instance out west in western grain payments 
to grain producers when we ended the Crow rate subsidy.
<P>
	I do not recall-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. The hon. member for

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Finance and now his parliamentary secretary object to 
the word B-R-I-B-you get the picture. They call it the cost of 
adjustment.
<P>
	I am starting to wonder if it is only the government that is paying 
it and the premiers who are receiving it who have a problem with 
that word. The premiers of Alberta and Ontario, the B.C. 
government, journalists across the country and Canadians from 
coast to coast see it for what it exactly is.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would ask the hon. member 
for Calgary Centre to put his question, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, when will the finance minister stand up 
and admit that this billion dollar cash incentive, this billion dollar 
cost of adjustment has nothing to do with good policy but 
everything to do with political expediency?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has everything to do with good 
policy and it is good for the country.
<P>
	I do not recall the hon. member suggesting that fishermen were 
bribed or that western grain producers were bribed. This is how we 
do things in this country. We are implementing a national value 
added harmonized tax. It is good for the Atlantic provinces and it is 
good for Canada.

	For a number of years now, the federal government has been 
trying to privatize several regional airports. Last December, it also 
announced its intention to turn over harbour management to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2308"> 2308 </A></B>
<P>
regional bodies. However, the Government of Quebec rightly 
maintains that several of  these harbours and airports are presently 
in need of extensive repair that could result in costs to the 
provincial governments.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Can the Minister of Transport assure us that he will respect the 
opinion of the Government of Quebec in the process of privatizing 
federal harbours and airports?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I had some very constructive discussions with Quebec's 
transport minister, Mr. Brassard. We spoke about the need to 
exchange information with regard to the transfer of airports to 
municipalities, the province or private interests.
<P>
	We will continue with the program, but it is my hope that in 
future we will be able to continue to have, in a spirit of 
co-operation, discussions that are productive for both parties and 
for these airports during the transfer period. There are, I believe, 
$35 million set aside to help with the transfer, that is to improve the 
infrastructure of these airports before they are turned over to 
municipalities.
<P>
	What I am waiting for from the province of Quebec is a decision 
on its part to allow the 12 municipalities who wish to enter into 
discussions with us to do so. In the province of Quebec, they cannot 
deal directly with the federal government without Mr. Brassard's 
permission. I hope to have this permission within a few weeks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Government of Quebec is wary of Greeks bearing 
gifts. We need to know the conditions and repercussions of 
decisions.
<P>
	Does the minister intend to make the necessary repairs to federal 
harbours and airports before privatizing them, or to make financial 
compensation available in order to ensure the viability of these 
privatized facilities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Of 
course, Mr. Speaker. We have $35 million for the airports 
throughout the country. I hope that that will be sufficient; we will 
see. The money is there, set aside for this program and for the 
purpose mentioned by the hon. member.
<P>
	At the same time, it should be pointed out that $125 million have 
been earmarked for the same reasons, to help with the transfer to 
the private sector, to municipalities. Sometimes, for example, in 
ocean harbours, provincial ferries may now have a harbour under 
federal authority that we want to turn over to the province.
<P>
	The money is there. We will see how many requests we get. I am 
certain that with the help of my hon. colleague, and of the Quebec

yesterday we learned more about the systematic cover-up in 
national defence. This is the same cover-up that government 
lawyers wanted to keep the commission from investigating. It is the 
same cover-up that has seen evidence destroyed and documents 
hidden right under the minister's nose. It is the same cover-up the 
minister has been evading since day one.
<P>

department is not his fault nor General Boyle's fault. Are we then 
to believe that it was an act of God?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can only 
repeat some of the points I have raised in the House in answering 
other questions over the last couple of weeks.
<P>
	The commission of inquiry is an independent commission that 
will hear all the evidence and will get the answers the hon. member 
and other Canadians want. This government wants to get to the 
bottom of the problems surrounding the deployment to Somalia in 
1993 and the commission will do that. We have to allow the 
commission the opportunity to do its work in an unfettered way and 
not raise questions every day in the House based on the previous 
day's testimony. That is a recipe for disaster.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the problem here is leadership in the department as well as in 
cabinet.
<P>
	After Nancy Fournier's testimony, no one can deny the fact of a 
cover-up. Rightly or wrongly, General Boyle is widely seen as 
involved. Surely he cannot continue to run the department while 
this crisis remains unresolved.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	In light of the increasing evidence, why has the minister failed to 
provide the leadership his department so desperately now needs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have said that 
we owe all those people involved in this matter the courtesy of 
being allowed to give their views at the commission so that it is 
done in a very systematic, calm and rational way. I think most 
Canadians feel that is the appropriate way to go about it.
<P>
	Contrary to the comments of the hon. member and his leader in 
the last few weeks, it now seems the hon. member's leader is 
coming to that view of justice. This morning on ``Canada AM'' 
when he was asked why he took so long in reacting to the 
statements by the hon. members for Athabasca and 
Nanaimo-Cowichan, the  hon. member's leader from Calgary 
Southwest said: ``It took us two days before reacting because we 
have to give these 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2309"> 2309 </A></B>
<P>
people a hearing. We have to ask them what they really meant. If 
we do not do that we would be accused of being discriminatory 
ourselves''.
<P>
	I think the hon. member should reflect on his own leader's 
statements and in future let the commission do its work before he 
makes any judgments.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Human Resources Developmnet.
<P>
	For the second consecutive month, a large number of concerned 
and destitute seniors have not received their guaranteed income 
supplement. Last week, at the Saint-Léonard office, in Montreal, 
135 seniors were turned away by overburdened officials who asked 
them to make an appointment even though the phone lines were 
always busy. Worse still, when an official could finally be reached 
on the phone, he said that he did not know when the situation would 
be rectified.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Human Resources Development confirm 
that, not only have these seniors been deprived of their guaranteed 
income supplement without knowing when the problem will be 
resolved, but they have also been unable to obtain adequate service 
from his department?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I agree with the minister-my 
mistake, the member-that this situation is totally unacceptable. 
We have had bad experiences over the past two months with the 
delivery of certain programs. There have been flaws in the system 
which I find utterly deplorable.
<P>
	You will understand that our department serves hundreds of 
thousands of people. These people are among the most vulnerable 
in our society. It is totally unacceptable to cause them concern 
because of this kind of problem.
<P>
	I can assure my colleague that I did all that could be done, 
considering the technology involved which makes these things 
very complex, to try to prevent this type of situation from occurring 
again in the future. In the meantime, we took immediate action by 
calling these people to explain to them what the problem was and to 
assure them that they would receive their cheques as soon as 
possible.
<P>
	I sincerely apologize to these people who did not get good 
service from my department.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would urge the 
minister not to call me minister because I am afraid he will hold me 
responsible, with him, for the present situation.
<P>
	What guarantee can the minister give the House that seniors 
affected by this problem will be reimbursed without delay?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to give the hon. member 
every assurance that we have already begun the process. Many of 
the people who have been affected by this unacceptable technical 
error have already received their cheques or have been contacted 
directly.
<P>
	I give him every assurance we are taking every measure possible 
to make sure senior citizens who have been upset by this 
inappropriate kind of situation will receive the money coming to 
them as quickly as we can do it.
<P>
	In addition, I repeat to the hon. member that we are doing 
everything we possibly can to ensure it does not happen again. 
These people have enough to worry about without having to be 
concerned about whether they will receive the appropriate amount 
they are due each month.
<P>
	I share the hon. member's concerns. I want to say to Canadians 
who have had to put up with this glitch that it is unacceptable and 
we will do everything we can to make sure it does not happen 
again.

	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
	The minister is no doubt aware that in Canada's second 
submission to the NAFTA panel there is reference to the fact that 
Canada should have been more specific on whether tariffs for 
supply management are a GATT or NAFTA issue.
<P>
	Could the minister assure the House this admission in no way 
compromises our position with respect to our commitment to 
protect supply management?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, media coverage in the last several 
days clearly demonstrates how vigorously we are defending, as 
promised, our made in Canada supply management system before 
the NAFTA panel.
<P>
	This defence is a truly Team Canada effort because it involves all 
relevant farm organizations and all provincial governments. We are 
all working very closely together.
<P>
	Canada is fully convinced that on any plain reading of the words 
of the FTA and the NAFTA we in Canada have the full legal right to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2310"> 2310 </A></B>
<P>
do what we have done with  our tariff equivalents under the WTO. 
The United States in our view is entirely misconstruing the 
negotiating history of the NAFTA and the WTO. It is now trying to 
obtain by the dispute settlement mechanism what it could not 
obtain at the bargaining table, and Canada will stand up for itself.

	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	On March 29 in a press release the minister said conservation 
was the purpose of the B.C. fisheries buy back. As recently as two 
days ago the minister did a flip-flop and admitted his plan has no 
teeth and will not do anything to conserve salmon.
<P>
	We would think that with that admission he would reconsider the 
plan before turning the lives of fishermen in British Columbia 
upside down. Will the minister admit conservation was just a 
cynical excuse to sell his plan?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the time the hon. 
member raises his question the minister is in the west. He has had 
24 hours of extensive discussions with stakeholders in the fishery 
industry on the west coast. He is meeting today with people for an 
exhaustive study.
<P>
	I thought the member's comments on the minister were perhaps 
imaginative but I think we would have to read the text of what the 
minister said. It has very little to do with what the member 
suggested.
<P>
	It is our expectation that as a result of the minister's discussions, 
the plan the government has, which stresses conservation but which 
recognizes conservation is the key to the survival of the industry, 
will be fully implemented.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I remind the 
minister that on March 29 he said: ``A reduction of 50 per cent of 
the commercial fleet in British Columbia is necessary to promote 
conservation of the resource. Conservation is our top priority''.
<P>
	Two days ago in the House he said: ``The plan may not result in 
fewer fish caught''. He admitted the plan is a complete failure even 
before it starts, yet his government is recklessly going ahead with it 
anyway.
<P>
	Why is the government pursuing a plan that will destroy the 
livelihoods of thousands of fishermen and B.C. coastal 
communities when the minister has admitted in the House that the 
plan will not work?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are not in a game 
of playing with words. If we were, we would look at the words 
more closely.
<P>
	The minister and the government are engaged in preserving an 
industry that was on the point of disaster in 1996. We are making 
emergency planning for 1996. The committee of which the hon. 
member is a member is hearing from key experts in the field this 
coming week. We are looking to long range planning as well.
<P>
	The plan is not a failure. The plan is being considered in the light 
of the thoughtful recommendations made by everybody, the three 
categories of fishers, the union, the food processors, the wildlife 
people and the habitat people. It will be a comprehensive approach 
to solution of something in the best interests of the west coast.

<P>
	Since the Liberal government took office, federal public servants 
have been hard hit, despite the promises made by the hon. member 
for Hull-Aylmer during the election campaign. Bill C-31 now 
goes even further to undermine the rights of federal public 
servants.

Act while, at the same time, amending the Public Service Staff 
Relations Act so as to suspend binding arbitration?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, this 
year, Bill C-31 provides for the resumption of collective bargaining 
and for possible wage increases for our employees. This was well 
received by our employees.
<P>
	We are suspending binding arbitration, because, in the years to 
come, we want to be directly accountable to Parliament for wage 
increases granted to public servants, so that we can meet our fiscal 
objectives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, will the minister admit that, by denying access to

government when it says it is committed to stable multi-year 
funding for the CBC, but management knows better.
<P>
	The Liberals do not keep their promises because in spite of their 
so-called commitment the government's 1996 budget and main 
estimates cut almost $400 million from CBC funding.
<P>
	Will the minister admit the government has not kept its promise, 
is sowing discontent and confusion at the CBC bargaining table and 
has no long term plan for the CBC?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. It gives me an 
opportunity to clear the air.
<P>
	There were no new cuts announced in this year's budget for the 
CBC. The government has announced its long term plans for CBC 
with regard to funding. Almost a billion dollars in funding, $800 
million within the next fiscal year, which has been allotted to CBC 
is plenty of money for it to operate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, by 
comparison with the Liberals, the Reform Party policy is clear and 
consistent on the CBC. We call for the privatization of the CBC.
<P>
	In spite of spending $2.5 million trying to come up with this 
funding on the wasted Juneau report, Liberals are still going ahead 
with the $400 million in cuts. They are getting into privatization 
through the back door, and the union knows it because its jobs are 
being contracted out to private industry.
<P>
	Why will the parliamentary secretary not admit the government 
is doing privatization at the CBC in spite of the fact it is saying it is 
not, and this without public debate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we well know the policy of the Reform Party with regard 
to the CBC. It wants to gut it completely. It wants to eliminate it.
<P>
	The government has committed CBC funding for the next 
number of years on a long term basis. We have committed to 
responding to the Juneau report in the very near future. We have 
committed to helping our cultural  industries and there will be a 
cultural fund set up that all cultural industries will be able to 
access.
<P>
	I can honestly say in this regard when it comes to the Reform 
Party talking about cuts, here it is on one side complaining we are 
not cutting enough and all of a sudden it is complaining we are

	Serious problems have for some time disrupted the peaceful life

serious. The school is still closed, people are leaving their homes 
and the community is torn apart.
<P>
	Could the minister or his parliamentary secretary tell the House 
what efforts the government is making to bring back harmony 
within the Lake Barriere community?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for his question. Last November, the Lake 
Barriere community chose an interim band council by petition. 
This interim band council was given the mandate by the 
community to write down the band's custom for the purpose of 
ratifying it. Once ratified, the custom would be used to elect new 
leaders.
<P>
	But a group opposed to this interim band council has control 
over the road to the reservation, which is the reason why the school 
was closed. Considering the continuing stalemate, the dissenting 
group asked for the help of a mediator, which the interim band 
council also agreed to on April 25. I can announce today to the

<P>
	On November 17, 1994, during debate at second reading on Bill

opposite: ``the bill will have a major impact  on the rigths of 
management and members or the RCMP''.
<P>
	The minister clearly contradicted Mr. Sims' analysis. Therefore, 
is he prepared to review his position and allow members of the 
RCMP to form a union and to undertake collective bargaining, like 
their provincial and municipal counterparts?

cars it said it would consider all proposals put forward for the 
acquisition of the cars and that the government would take into 
account the interests of producers, shippers and railways.
<P>
	Since then the committee was told yesterday that the transport 
department has already protected the interests of the railways in an 
agreement signed between the federal government and the railways 
in 1993, which is said to give the railways not only the right of first 
refusal in terms of any sale but also a virtual veto over who can get 
the cars if the railways decide not to exercise that first right.

deal with the hour I spent with the committee earlier this week, 
which apparently the hon. member did not bother to attend. It is 
difficult in one minute.
<P>
	Let me try to point out to him that shippers, that is the people 
who move grain, the producers, the railways and other groups such 
as pension funds that might want to invest in a transportation 
system will all have the opportunity to bid on the hopper cars when 
the time comes for us to dispose of them.
<P>
	We will have open bidding. Obviously we have put restrictions 
on this to protect western shippers and western grain growers, to 
ensure there is an efficient transportation system. Nothing could be 
more damaging to the western producer and the western shipper 
than to have the railways in such a situation where they cannot 
meet costs and thus will continue to operate or use equipment 
which is inefficient or not in the best of condition.

and geographic conditions. We have to make sure we have an

which specific farm organizations have indicated opposition to the WGTPP in 
written form along with the date of that opposition?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> The issues surrounding the reform and 
upgrading of western Canada's grain handling and transportation 
system have been the subject of intense study and debate across the 
prairies for at least 25 years. Within days of the 1993 election, the 
newly elected federal government was required to begin dealing 
with these issues in the context of the Uruguay round of world trade 
negotiations because those negotiations were beginning the process 
of eliminating ``trade distorting export subsidies'', and grain 
subsidies under Canada's Western Grain Transportation Act, 
WGTA, were included, in part, within that definition. 
Consultations were appropriately undertaken at that time by the 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-food through the grain 
representatives serving on the sectoral advisory group on 
international trade, SAGIT. These included the Saskatchewan 
Wheat Pool, the United Grain Growers and the Canadian 
Federation of Agriculture, among others.
<P>
	The consultative process has been intense and ongoing ever 
since. This has included a great deal of correspondence and, more 
important, dozens of face to face personal meetings and 
teleconferences involving virtually every major western farm 
organization, several national organizations with an interest in the 
western grain handling and transportation system, untold numbers 
of individual producers, grain companies and co-operatives, the 
railways, municipal organizations, and provincial governments.
<P>
	It would be impossible to reconstruct an absolutely all-inclusive 
listing of all those consulted prior to the February 27, 1995 federal 
budget, but the more prominent groups included in these 
consultations were: Canadian Federation of Agriculture, Keystone 
Agricultural Producers, Canadian Cattlemen's Association, 
Unifarm, Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities, 
Alberta Association of Municipal Districts and Counties, Union of 
Manitoba Municipalities, Western Canadian Wheat Growers 
Association, Western Barley Growers Association, Canadian 
Canola Growers Association, Canadian Dehydrators Association, 
Western Canadian Flax Growers, Western Canada Pulse Growers, 
Manitoba Pool Elevators, Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, Alberta Pool, 
United Grain Growers, Canada Grains Council.
<P>
	In addition, at the request of the minister's address to over 90 
industry stakeholders in November of 1994, more than 30 other 
groups provided written input on WGTA and grain transportation 
reform prior to February 27, 1995. These included, most 
prominently: Prairie Farm Leaders Group, Alberta Canola 
Producers Commission, Alberta Cattle Commission, Prairie Pools 
Inc., Saskatchewan Cattle Feeders Association, Manitoba Pulse 
Growers, National Farmers Union, Canadian Special Crops 
Association.
<P>
	Prebudget consultations were, of necessity, general and broad 
ranging, but they clearly signalled the government's direction 
toward a western grain transition payments programs, WGTPP. 
The nature of the WGTPP, as announced in the 1995 budget, 
required ongoing postbudget discussions with farm groups about 
specific aspects of the program's design and delivery and related 
adjustment measures. The minister therefore continued to seek 
broad producer and industry input through further correspondence, 
teleconferences and personal meetings held through the spring, 
summer, fall and winter of 1995.
<P>
	Through all these consultations in whatever form, opinions have 
been expressed both for and against the reform which have been 
undertaken. While there is general agreement that the reforms were 
necessary and unavoidable for trade, efficiency, diversification, 
innovation and fiscal reasons, it must also be noted that few 
organizations unequivocally approved of each and every aspect of 
the WGTPP. Advice and reactions were typically mixed. It is 
therefore very difficult to characterize any given organization as 
totally supportive or opposed. In most cases they were a bit of both. 
Not unexpectedly, everyone would have preferred to have more 
money available for distribution through this program. On the other 
hand, those consulted also acknowledged the compelling 
imperative of fiscal responsibility.
<P>
	One point is clear. Few other initiatives in the history of 
Canadian agriculture have been subject to such open, lengthy and 
comprehensive consultations before, during and after 
implementation. The process continues.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EMPLOYMENTINSURANCEACT">EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-12, an act respecting 
employment insurance in Canada, as reported (with amendments) 
from the committee; and Motions Nos 1, 2 and 3.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am both happy and sad to rise this afternoon to 
contribute to the debate on Bill C-12, an act respecting 
employment insurance in Canada. I am taking this opportunity, at 
report stage, to join in the discussion on the work by the standing 
committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2317"> 2317 </A></B>
<P>
	The day when, after third reading of Bill C-12, the government 
will ring the bell to call us to the House to vote, will be a day 
of national mourning. All Quebecers and Canadians should fly 
their flag at half mast. The government is so ashamed of its reform 
that it has used very special measures at each stage, when 
democracy was calling us to debate this bill here in this 
Parliament.
<P>
	After first reading-a misnomer, at this stage, one looks, rises, 
and sits down, first reading is over-the government did away with 
second reading. Usually, at this stage, the official opposition has 
the opportunity to present, discuss, and debate all its objections to a 
bill. It has the opportunity to do so in the House since second 
reading takes place in the House.
<P>
	What did the government do this time? It decided to do away 
with second reading, following instead a rather odd procedure 
called preliminary study; the opposition was allowed to make six 
ten-minute speeches, for a total of one hour, to explain and voice all 
its objections against a bill containing 190 clauses. It was then 
referred to committee. In committee, the bill was again under a gag 
order. Not one of the groups wishing to appear was unable to do so 
for lack of time.
<P>
	Usually, committees travel across Canada when the game is 
worth the candle. However, this time, for an in-depth reform of the 
unemployment insurance program, the government deemed it 
unnecessary for the committee to travel and hear people's views on 
this reform. The government preferred to stay on the hill, 
completely disconnected from reality, and to go ahead with a bill 
that nobody wants. Perhaps the government got a little scared, 
given the strong and unanimous opposition to this legislation 
across the country.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	I dare the Prime Minister to let members of his party vote freely 
on this bill, as he did in the case of Bill C-33, which sought to 
recognize a basic right. Should the Prime Minister do that, I think 
his party would bring the government down.
<P>
	The committee only had 10 hours to do a clause by clause 
review. This is a big joke, given that there are 190 clauses in the 
bill. The government, with its arrogant majority, could not care less 
about democracy and Canadians.
<P>
	Now, the minister on call wants to gag the official opposition. 
When the government wants to gag us it asks the labour minister to 
table a notice of motion; or at least he is the one who always did it 
for this bill. The minister responsible for the reform does not even 
have the courage to rise to gag us. He prefers to ask a Quebecois to 
do the job for him. Barely 10 minutes before I took the floor, we 
were told by the government that, on Monday, it would table a 
motion to gag us once again, to keep us from speaking in this 
House about a reform that does not make any sense and that 
Canadians do not want.
<P>
	There are 190 clauses in this bill. Since it could not stop the 
train, the official opposition tried to propose amendments. Would 
you believe that a total of 221 amendments, more than the number 
of clauses, were proposed? A Liberal member decided to propose 
one. His party will probably support it, to reward him for having 
dared to say something. Eleven amendments were made by the 
Reform Party, 13 by the minister, including 6 that are insignificant 
and of a purely technical nature, and 196 by the Bloc Quebecois, 
including several which have the support of the New Democratic 
Party.
<P>
	These 221 amendments were put in 15 different groups to 
facilitate their discussion in the House. The first group included 
Motion 9A, proposed by the Bloc Quebecois. That motion referred 
to the Quebec consensus concerning Quebec's reclaiming all 
manpower training programs and job creation programs, along 
with financial compensation.
<P>
	Unfortunately, we shall not be able to debate this matter, because 
the Chair has refused to admit it, seemingly because it involves a 
royal recommendation, or so I was told. I myself must admit I do 
not know what that means. What are we doing here if we are 
refused the right to table an amendment because it needs a royal 
recommendation? Can anyone be more alienated than a people that 
requires a recommendation from someone else? Why are we not 
capable of dealing with the necessary amendments on our own? As 
a citizen, and even less as a member of Parliament, I have no idea 
what the expression ``royal recommendation'' means.
<P>
	The government, however, in my understanding of the situation, 
is caught in a trap. Once again, it is speaking out of both sides of its 
mouth. When responding to questions in the House, or when 
speaking to the public, it claims to want to get along with Quebec, 
and that it is Quebec that does not want to get along with Ottawa. 
This is what we have been hearing for nearly 10 years, as this 
government is reforming this and that, since Meech anyway, that 
Quebec is supposedly never satisfied. Yet, when the government is 
invited to put its money where its mouth is, when there are 
meetings with the Quebec minister, meetings cancelled with no 
reason given, the minister not turning up, not submitting what he 
was meant to, not responding to the Quebec consensus, when we 
want to repatriate manpower training and employability 
enhancement programs in Quebec, hypocritically the government 
digs its heels in every time. What a farce. Mark my words, though, 
the farce is nearly over. This morning's survey, as reported by 
<I>l'Actualité</I>, was very clear. Every step this government has taken 
since the last referendum has added to the popularity of 
sovereignty. This morning we reached 56 per cent, the highest 
since Meech Lake. You better not forget it. This is only the 
beginning, the ascent to secession, as you call it, or to sovereignty, 
as we see it.

<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	The people of Canada and Quebec will recall as well at the next 
elections that the old traditional parties have nothing more to offer. 
They are all cast in the same mould. Whether it is the Liberals or 
the Conservatives, there is no difference. In official opposition, 
they criticize. On the campaign trail, they promise the world. In 
government, once elected, they do nothing. They take the issues of 
their predecessors and do what they had previously criticized.
<P>
	For the benefit of those listening, I would just like to quote 
something I find quite admirable: ``The point I am trying to make, 
which many of us will have to look at seriously, is the whole notion 
of trust and credibility. Canadians are prepared to share the burden, 
if they think it is being done fairly. Unemployment insurance, 
family allowance and old age pensions are a sacred trust. We must 
not allow the trust of Canadians to deteriorate to a point where they 
become cynical. I have listened to people talk about New Zealand, 
the United Kingdom, and about other countries and how they do it. 
There are basic standards, basic programs, universal programs, and 
programs that allow people to deal with their future with some 
degree of security''. Who said this? None other than the hon. 
member for Gloucester, the father of the reform we reject.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to echo the words of my colleague, the member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata. During the whole process leading to this 
moment in the House, not only the official opposition, but also the 
people who wanted to be heard, did not have the opportunity to 
voice their concerns.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Rarely have the people concerned been prevented from truly 
speaking their minds on such an important issue as this one, which 
will affect the lives of millions of people in a very practical way, 
since it will deny them access to a minimum level of security if 
they lose their jobs, it will reduce their benefits and it will cut the 
period of eligibility for those benefits. Millions will be affected by 
this bill, which has not been discussed adequately and about which 
the official opposition and the people have not had the opportunity 
to voice their concerns.
<P>
	The government seems utterly unconcerned about what will 
happen to men, women, young workers and older ones, workers 
living in seasonal work areas and pregnant women. The 
government could not care less about the fate of these people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2319"> 2319 </A></B>
<P>
	This unemployment insurance system is the pillar not only of 
economic stability in times of recession, but also of a minimum 
security for those who do not have total job security or who cannot 
rely on personal or family wealth. That affects a wide segment 
of the population, and if the government had not acted as it did, 
it could have designed a real system by widening the assistance 
and especially by widening the base for those who can contribute 
to make this system a real one.
<P>
	This government did not want to have a real system. It has 
preferred to reduce benefits and to make them unavailable to many 
people.
<P>
	We now know that time is running out for us, which is a shame. 
We now know that the party in power does not want us to expose 
the true nature of this bill. We will try, during what time we do 
have, to repay it back in kind, because this is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	All the people at home who may listen to members opposite 
were told, regarding this reform, which proposed a new concept 
based on hours worked, that they would get a better system, but that 
is totally false. At first glance, it might seem interesting to take 
hours worked into account, but the truth is the government took 
advantage of this change, to a great extent, to multiply by three the 
eligibility criteria.
<P>
	Someone who was not in the system, a young person or a woman 
who got out of the workplace to have a child or who never got into 
it, or whoever has not been in the system for more than two years, 
for whatever reason, could go back into the system by working 
twenty 15 hour weeks. There was a threshold. The government had 
said that twenty 15 hour weeks, or 300 hours, was a threshold.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	From now on, how many hours will the government require for 
these same persons to become eligible? The bill stipulates 910 
hours, or twenty-six 35 hour weeks in a year, instead of twenty 15 
hour weeks each. Those are the facts. Some will have to wait two 
years to become eligible. Even if they are in need, there is no 
eligibility until they have reached the number of hours required.
<P>
	In a way, those affected are really those who need the system 
most. A researcher said that young people in particular must have 
access to real unemployment insurance, because jobs are so scarce. 
According to researchers, one of the main differences between 
someone who is eligible for UI benefits and someone who is not, is 
that the former will stay on UI for one more month, and use it to 
look for a job, a better paid job.
<P>
	Is that wrong, considering the cost of living and the fact that 
young people, especially those who are thinking about starting a 
family, cannot possibly do so on minimum wages and will have 
trouble doing so if they are the only breadwinner and earn $10 or 
$12 an hour?
<P>
	Good jobs, like good bosses, are extremely hard to find. 
Nowadays, what we are seeing is that businesses that provide stable 
well paid jobs are more likely to be closing down rather than 
starting up. Companies that paid good salaries are closing and are 
replaced by small businesses which, in many cases, do not pay 
salaries that allow people to live decently. This is, and will be, 
extremely hard on a lot of people.
<P>
	What about someone who is in the system? Since the last change 
was made, when the unemployment rate was at its highest, the 
person must work twelve 15 hour weeks. What will happen now? 
From now on, the same person will have to work twelve 35 hour 
weeks. This is for the regions where the unemployment rate is 
highest.
<P>
	In regions where it is lower, such as Victoria and Vancouver, 
people will have to work twenty 35 hour weeks. When the human 
resources development committee went there, it found out that, 
yes, there are rich people, but there are also many for whom this 
affluence only makes the cost of living higher, including their rent. 
The result is that so-called ordinary people have a hard time. They 
may lose their job and it may take time before they find another 
one. Still, these people will have to work twenty 35 hour weeks.
<P>
	Between these two extremes, there is a whole scale of variable 
conditions. For the Montreal region, the requirement will be 
fourteen 35 hour weeks, or 490 hours. The bill went from weeks to 
hours worked, but the government has used the opportunity to 
increase the basic requirements considerably.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	The bill does not take into account the fact that, for many people, 
one hour of work does not necessarily equate with one hour of 
wages. Part time teachers who often earn very little money and 
work in difficult conditions need a true unemployment insurance 
system between periods of employment. For these people, one hour 
of work does not equate with one hour of wages.
<P>
	The same is true for musicians, actors and many people in this 
``new economy'', where an hourly wage is not the rule. This bill is 
unfortunately legislation right out of the past. It is a pretext to make 
the system more inaccessible to those who need it. It is a bill that 
the population will reject.
<P>
	The next government to be elected will pledge to change it. Jean 
Chrétien, leader of the official opposition-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. Without getting into 
the issue of using titles rather than names, I must inform the House 
that the member's 10 minute period is over, unfortunately.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, being 
from Atlantic Canada, it is certainly important for  us to present our 
views on the employment insurance act. It is particularly important 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2320"> 2320 </A></B>
<P>
to bring to the House some of the important concerns we have in 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	As Liberals, we have always prided ourselves in introducing the 
original unemployment insurance bill, changing it in the 1970s and 
promoting and encouraging it, and to see that Canadians who are 
unable to find work are protected by legislation and by a program 
that will enable them to have a satisfactory standard of living.
<P>
	Since the Liberal Party formed this government, we have been 
involved in discussions across the country through the HRD 
committee and through our members of Parliament meeting with 
constituents to discuss the ramifications and look at their concerns 
about unemployment.
<P>
	Jobs are the major concern of many Canadians. Many of our 
young people, especially those in the 15-24 age group, have great 
difficulties finding jobs. Nearly 10 per cent of our labour force at 
any given time has difficulty finding work.
<P>
	In Atlantic Canada, as in the rest of the nation, people do not 
want to be unemployed. They would prefer to find work, to have 
steady income. We as members of Parliament and as a government 
must attempt to bring forward measures to encourage programs, to 
develop an environment that will enable Canadians to find 
satisfactory and worthwhile forms of employment.
<P>
	Since the bill was originally introduced last December, most of 
us went home to our constituencies and held town hall meetings. 
We attempted to find the concerns with the legislation originally 
introduced.
<P>
	In Atlantic Canada there were two major concerns. Some people 
were concerned with what is called the gap, the idea that weeks 
were being presented on a consecutive basis. If one were to file for 
unemployment, HRDC would look at the consecutive weeks of 
work. In many cases in Atlantic Canada that was a major problem.
<P>
	Others were concerned with what is called the intensity rule. It is 
the concept that those who filed annually or were unemployed 
annually were being penalized because jobs in their areas were not 
available year round.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	In Atlantic Canada a lot of jobs are seasonal in nature. We do not 
have seasonal workers, we have seasonal jobs. In the forest, the 
fishery and the tourist industries people generally are only able to 
work when the season is right. When three feet of ice covers 
Miramichi Bay it is impossible to fish. When the snow is four feet 
deep it is impossible to conduct forestry activities. Even though 
New Brunswick has promoted winter activities in recreation and 
tourism, this industry is basically one which is conducted in the 
summer.
<P>
	The committee which studied the bill when it was reintroduced 
has come up with solutions to the gap in the  system. The system 
will apply so that one may go back 26 weeks to pick the best weeks 
that will add up to the required number of weeks in order to qualify 
for unemployment insurance. The committee also recommended 
that the intensity rule would only apply to those with family 
incomes of over $26,000.
<P>
	We as Liberals are able to protect those people in society. We 
have not been able to bring forward a guaranteed annual income, 
but we certainly have brought forward a system of protection so 
that those who are most needy are able to gain the most benefits 
from the program.
<P>
	There are some other positive aspects to the bill. The system of 
hours of work for example will assist many people in terms of 
qualifying. Many workers in the past who had small numbers of 
hours in any given week were not allowed to count those hours 
toward their benefits. Now all hours will qualify. For those who 
might criticize that system we must point out that those who have 
paid in on an hourly basis and are unable to draw because they are 
students or are involved in a short term enterprise may apply for a 
refund of their contributions. The hours system is good because 
those who work long hours for example in the construction industry 
will be able to use the 35 hours as the basis of a week.
<P>
	There are five cornerstones here which will help people who are 
unemployed. There is the system of wage subsidies and earning 
supplements. More money is being put into the self-employment 
assistance program. More than 45,000 people across the country 
are involved in becoming entrepreneurs and developing their own 
companies and businesses, thereby being able to employ others and 
continue in full time employment. Money is going to be put toward 
skills and loans grants for enabling people to further their job skills 
to better qualify for employment.
<P>
	There will be a fund which will enable communities to 
participate in providing work. The fund will enable environmental, 
community and other groups to develop programs and improve 
their communities. They will use money from the fund in order to 
make their area a better place in which to live.
<P>
	I have listened to members opposite. I know they have many 
concerns, as we in Atlantic Canada have many concerns. We are 
concerned with the fact that people need jobs. By the same token 
we are concerned about the fact that people need help when those 
jobs are not available.
<P>
	We must respect those 90 per cent of Canadians who on any 
given day are working full time and who through their 
contributions to the system are paying 3 per cent of their wages into 
a fund which will help those who are unemployed.
<P>

<P>
	This week the fishermen in Atlantic Canada, especially in my 
area, went out in their boats for their annual fishing season. The 
fishermen's UI is separate from the major part of the program.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	I hope when we eventually bring before the government an 
unemployment insurance system for fishermen that we will be able 
to have a dialogue and hear their concerns. It will bring to the 
people of Atlantic Canada and those on the west coast about whom 
they spoke this morning a program which will enable them to 
remain a viable part of our economy. It will enable our fishermen to 
go out and fish each summer. The fishery is a very important part of 
our Canadian economy.
<P>
	I support the bill. It certainly is not perfect. There are some 
members who would like to have a perfect bill. We never have 
perfection but we as Liberals try to work toward that degree of 
perfection. We try to work toward the concept that we as a party 
and as a government will look after those people who are most in 
need. We want to assure them of our concern and support of their 
best interests.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think it is a disgrace that the government has decided to 
move a time allocation motion on such an important bill. Let me 
explain why it is a bad decision.
<P>
	Under the definition provision, which is part of the amendments 
before us, insurable employment is defined. The definition of 
insurable employment has been a major problem for several years 
now: there is an incredible backlog of applications waiting for a 
decision by Revenue Canada. There are more than 20,000 
applications on hold.
<P>
	This bill had been under consideration for two years now, and we 
still have not found a solution to the problem; we have not come up 
with a way to deal with this very real problem. The government has 
only one goal, to recover $2 billion through this reform. That is its 
only goal. To get $2 billion in cuts. In the meantime, the problem is 
not going away.
<P>
	Let me explain the problem with insurable employment. In some 
cases, employment can be considered non-insurable because the 
employee and the employer are not dealing with each other at arm's 
length, and the people concerned often file an appeal. It is true that 
sometimes the employment is proven to be non-insurable, but in 
thousands of cases, nothing can be proven and the people are 
successful in their appeal. The government has not dealt with this 
problem; it has not even come up with an amendment on this issue, 
even if we suggested some changes and mentioned the problem to 
the minister when he appeared before the committee.
<P>
	By moving time allocation, the government is only prolonging 
these kinds of problems. The people affected by this issue are not 
the banks, nor the individuals who make billions of dollars in 
profits, but rather wives who work alongside their husbands on the 
family farm, for example, or spouses who open a business together 
or the sons and daughters who work with their parents. These are 
the kinds of situations we see in real life. No, the government is not 
ready to correct these situations, it is not ready to solve them. It 
will rather gag the House by skipping debate at second reading and 
limiting to ten hours consideration in committee.
<P>
	As for the report stage, the government will also limit debate 
next week while there are concrete examples of problems that need 
to be addressed. The only way to settle these problems is to put an 
amendment forward or, ultimately, to send this bill back to 
committee so that it can do its job and solve these problems 
because this is totally absurd.
<P>
	Pursuant to the appeal process, people who are not satisfied in 
the first stage must then deal with the revenue department. Across 
this country, Human Resources Development Canada has 
employment centres providing first line services. These centres are 
close to the people and can give advice, interprete the legislation. 
However, the government could not find a way to give them the 
authority to make the decisions in this process. No, they wanted the 
revenue department to do it, although it must deal with a 
mind-boggling number of cases, more than 20,000 cases, like I 
said. This is utterly unacceptable.
<P>
	At the same time, on the subject of definitions, they tried to pull 
a few fast ones on us. First, they decided to give the definition of an 
affidavit. Do you know what an affidavit is? It is a statement which 
you make when you lost a document or when you witnessed an 
event that you have no proof of other than to swear it is true. 
Affidavits can be made in all sectors of life. But a definition is 
added here in the legislation to limit its application. And I can 
assure you that, when going after persons guilty of fraud and 
offenders, this legislation is a regulatory jungle.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	The Unemployment Insurance Act can be compared to a 
highway on which there would be ten or fifteen different speed 
limit indications on a two-kilometer stretch and police everywhere 
making sure you are not over the limit. Often, it is not a question of 
being dishonest, it is just a failure to understand. The definition of 
affidavit will be a means to catch people, to ensure that we will be 
able to catch them. It is unacceptable and we have asked the 
government to withdraw it.
<P>
	The same can be said of the word document. They put in a 
catch-all definition of what a document is for the purpose of the 
Unemployment Insurance Act. They did this to reinforce again the 
principle that people who receive unemployment insurance are 
trying to abuse the system. To consider that Canadians are neces-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2322"> 2322 </A></B>
<P>
sarily trying  to rob the system is an unacceptable basic element of 
the government's bill.
<P>
	According to statistics we have received, it is proven that fraud 
amounts to no more than 4 per cent. Four per cent of 2 million UI 
claimants-last year's figures-is not much. If we submitted 
businesses and taxpayers to such an inquiry, I believe we would 
discover a higher rate of fraud. But they decided to go after these 
people because they are less organized, less resourceful. That is 
where the government wants to go.
<P>
	This time allocation motion will prevent us from doing an 
in-depth study of this bill. It is an important piece of legislation that 
will govern unemployment insurance for years to come. There will 
not be such a reform every year. The government has enough 
trouble as it is dealing with the impact of this reform on workers. 
You can be sure that it will not impose another reform on the 
maritimes because if the Liberal members from that region vote for 
this bill here in the House, they will certainly pay the political price 
for it in the next election.
<P>
	What is the impact of this reform? It is a one-way street to 
poverty. One of my constituents told me on the phone yesterday 
that the Liberals argue that changing the system from weeks to 
hours worked will improve the situation, but we need concrete 
examples to support that. Here is a concrete example.
<P>
	Previously, to become eligible for unemployment insurance, a 
person had to work 20 15-hour weeks, a total of 300 hours. Now, a 
new entrant on the job market will have to work 910 hours, or 26 
35-hour weeks. So the government has dealt a fatal blow to CEGEP 
graduates who work in seasonal industries such as tourism, 
recreation and applied ecology. All those who have seasonal jobs or 
even those who just started their first job will be systematically 
forced onto welfare. And the present government has the audacity 
to use the term employment insurance to refer to a piece of 
legislation that will do nothing but send people on their way to the 
welfare office.
<P>
	Because that is what awaits those who went to school, who 
attended primary school, high school, college, university. If they do 
not work 910 hours the first year, or 26 weeks at 35 hours a week, 
that is 26 weeks of full-time work, they will not be eligible. There 
are a lot of seasonal industries where it is impossible to work 26 
weeks. Just try working in a peat bog or in the forest for 26 weeks 
to see what it is like. Just try working 26 weeks in the woods.
<P>
	Yesterday, a Liberal member said that this legislation would 
motivate people to work a little more. I can tell you that, where I 
come from, the problem is not motivation but finding jobs. Things 
will be a lot more difficult for people who, even now, must keep 
two or three different jobs to accumulate the 12 weeks presently 
required.
<P>
	True a system based on the number of hours may be interesting 
for some people. However, it is totally false to say that the 
government has tried to improve the situation. Besides going from 
weeks to hours, the government raised all the system's criteria and 
standards to make unemployment insurance less accessible. The 
savings give us an example of that.
<P>
	The UI program will produce surpluses averaging $5 billion 
every year. It is not an underfinanced program, but a program used 
by the government to reduce its deficit. Since it was unable to get 
that money from foreign markets, it decided to penalize UI 
claimants without raising taxes.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	It is a sad thing to see because, in the past, Liberal governments 
showed from time to time that they cared for the regional economic 
development by putting in place a good regulating system in 
periods of economic downturns, but the present government is 
killing it. Unemployment insurance plan is supposed to help 
alleviate the overly severe effects of recessions and prevent 
depressions like the one we had in the 1930's.
<P>
	Today, we can say without a doubt that if the measures proposed 
by the government are allowed to stand, in the next recession we 
will find ourselves facing situations that are going to aggravate the 
economic crisis, which will have the effect of driving people from 
the regions to the cities, where there will not necessarily be any 
jobs. We are in the process of creating a model seen in certain 
developing countries, but that we never thought we would see here. 
The present government is creating this type of situation.
<P>
	Another thing I find completely unacceptable is keeping the 
intensity rule. Under this rule, someone who draws UI benefits for 
20 weeks loses 1 per cent of his benefits, another 20 weeks, another 
1 per cent. At this rate, within three years, anyone who regularly 
draws UI benefits will drop from 55 to 50 per cent.
<P>
	I will conclude my remarks with this. Twenty-five dollars a week 
is perhaps not much for people earning $60,000, $70,000 or 
$80,000. But people getting $500 a week will end up with $25 less, 
which now can be used to buy things, to keep the economy going, 
but especially to help people put bread and butter on the table. 
Canada's present government, with its reform, will bring all this to 
an end. I think it should be made very clear that gagging us will not 
solve the problem. This problem will dog them for many years to 
come.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron Fewchuk (Selkirk-Red River, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the report stage of 
Bill C-12 concerning employment insurance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2323"> 2323 </A></B>
<P>
	It is evident that a change is required to our unemployment 
insurance program. The old UI program is outdated and out of 
touch with today's working environment.
<P>
	I have spoken with many of my constituents who are looking for 
employment. Some of my constituents have over 100 CVs floating 
around in the employment market. It is a very competitive market 
today.
<P>
	Employers can pick and choose from an enormous number of 
candidates. It is not uncommon to hear that 200 or 300 people are 
applying for one job opening. That is incredible. It is why 
Canadians who are looking for work today need, require and 
deserve protection. It is why they require a safety net called 
employment insurance to help them during this critical time of job 
hunting.
<P>
	A growing number of Canadians are holding down more than 
one job to make ends meet. In most cases, they are not permanent 
jobs. Chances are they are working just as many hours per week as 
the traditional full time single job worker. Their work is not insured 
under the old UI program. These jobs hold no benefits if employees 
are sick. They do not get maternity or other benefits. They do not 
qualify for many government employment programs if they find 
themselves out of work.
<P>
	The reasons why this unfortunate situation occurs is because 
eligibility for UI benefits in any job is based on weeks of work, 
with a minimum requirement of 15 hours per week. One can work 
five different 10-hour per week jobs, totalling 50 hours per week, 
but as far as UI is concerned, it counts for nothing.
<P>
	I am pleased that Bill C-12, employment insurance, will rectify 
the situation. Employment insurance eligibility is based on hours, 
and all hours count, whether one puts those hours in for one, two or 
five different employers.
<P>
	Working counts with EI. Many people who work two or three 
part time jobs will get insurance protection for the first time. In 
fact, statistics show that some 500,000 more part time workers will 
be insured under the EI system than were under UI.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Another example of improvements under the new EI system is 
that a worker who holds down a full time job which pays $500 a 
week and also works at a part time job which pays $100 a week will 
now be better off. Under the previous program of UI only the first 
full time job is insured but under employment insurance both jobs 
will now be insured.
<P>
	This will make a difference to a worker if he or she loses his or 
her full time job. In this situation the benefits under UI would be 
considerably lower than under the new employment insurance. 
That is because when UI  calculates the insured weekly earnings, it 
ignores the part time job that pays $100 a week. That part time job 
is not insured.
<P>
	The new employment insurance takes that extra $100 into 
account. When the calculations are done the worker ends up with 
$275 per week in benefits. Under the previous system the benefits 
would be reduced by $31, as a result of continuing to work while 
receiving UI benefits. Therefore the benefits would fall to $244 a 
week.
<P>
	Under the new employment insurance system the worker will 
receive $330 and the benefits would be reduced by only $18. The 
worker would be able to earn up to $82 from a second job without 
reducing the worker's weekly benefits. Therefore the worker's 
cheque actually amounts to $68 more than under the old UI system.
<P>
	Bill C-12, employment insurance, simply works better for all 
Canadian workers. I believe that this new EI system better protects 
working Canadians and addresses the problems that they face in a 
more realistic way.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I called last week 
the week of the gag. We have just be notified that there will be a 
time limiting motion once again, to be announced Monday. So, 
here we are headed for a second week of the gag.
<P>
	This current week, however, has been the week of problems 
relating to keeping or not keeping one's word. Without going into 
great length, I would like to take a few seconds to read certain 
paragraphs of a letter by the present Prime Minister. As I have 
already read it out in the House, I will not read it all, but some parts 
of this letter, written to the Mouvement Action-Chômage when he 
was Leader of the Opposition, merit rereading.
<P>
	On March 26, 1993, he wrote as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you for your fax indicating your opposition to the legislative measures 
taken by the government to change unemployment insurance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You have my assurance that the Liberal Party shares your concerns about this 
attack on the unemployed, and we also do not believe that the recent superficial 
amendments change the fundamentally unfair nature of these measures in any 
way.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Skipping several paragraphs, he goes on to say in the second-last 
paragraph:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Liberals are appalled by these measures. By reducing benefits and penalising 
even more workers who voluntarily quit their jobs, the government shows it 
cares very little about the victims of the current economic crisis. Instead of 
addressing the problem at its core, the government picks on the unemployed. 
Besides, these measures will have disturbing consequences because they will 
discourage workers from reporting harassment cases and unacceptable labour 
conditions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2324"> 2324 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Finally, rest assured that Liberals will continue to demand that the government 
withdraw this unfair bill. As Leader of the Opposition, I appreciate your taking the 
time to let me know your position on this issue.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Since then, he has heard plenty of ``positions on this issue''.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	It started in the human resources development committee. 
During six weeks of conducting hearings across the country, we 
heard a good many positions. We also witnessed a good many 
demonstrations. Let me only recall what happened in Montreal. I 
do not say that I approve, but at some point, people get fed up. We 
have said this repeatedly. Last week, they wanted to gag us, now 
they want to do it again. It will not work. We will be heard.
<P>
	In summary, after the hearings held by the committee, the 
Liberals decided to wait until after the referendum in Quebec. They 
waited all that time. Then in December, after the referendum, they 
came out with a special step called a pre-study, they eliminated 
second reading, supposedly to give the committee more time. What 
was done in committee? It was just before the holidays, not a 
proper time to look at a bill. Not only that, people did not have 
much time to present submissions. There were many submissions. 
Therefore, the committee started examining them.
<P>
	However, the government came up with the most brilliant idea. It 
decided to have a speech from the throne. It wanted to make 
something new out of old stuff. It wanted to reintroduce, and in fact 
did reintroduce some ten bills, under new numbers. Bill C-12 is the 
same as Bill C-111, as it was called before. So, during that time, we 
waited again, because the throne speech put an end to the session 
and the committee's proceedings. We resumed work hurriedly after 
the throne speech.
<P>
	Last week, the committee began clause by clause study. We got 
as far as clause 2. The government wanted to limit study of each 
clause to five minutes. In the group of motions dealing with clause 
2, we ask that the whole clause be deleted. What is in that clause? 
All the definitions. Take the first one for example: ``affidavit''. It is 
an addition, it did not exist before and people did not know exactly 
what it meant.
<P>
	But there is worse than that; because I have very little time, I will 
read a clause we wanted to examine more thoroughly. At the 
bottom of page 3, it says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) A document or other communication under this Act or the regulations 
may be in electronic form.</BLOCKQUOTE>
We are talking about electronics. But what did we hear this 
morning? For the second year in a row, people are waiting for old 
age security payments. Last year, about 50,000 people have seen 
their payments delayed. The minister admitted it this morning. 
This year, the same  thing happened again. Now they would like the 
unemployment insurance reform to bring a similar system.
<P>
	Frankly, I think we were right to voice our concerns in 
committee. For the second time, the government gagged the 
committee. Its imposed time allocation on a very important bill to 
bring it back to the House as quickly as possible. Now, we were just 
told that after a day and half of debate, there will be time 
allocation, the same system used in the case of the rail strike. This 
government is going to be known as the gag government, because 
there are no precedents, except once under the Conservatives. 
Before them, this had never happened in the history of Parliament.
<P>
	There is another clause I would like to talk about and on which 
we had proposed an amendment, which is to strike the two clauses 
denying people the opportunity to appeal decisions relating to the 
unemployment insurance bill. We find that is very important.
<P>
	As an example, so that our listeners can understand, we wanted 
to correct the bill so that anyone could challenge a government 
decision under any program. Why did we want to do that? It is 
because the Mouvement action-chômage, in Quebec city, among 
others, told me that, when a decision of the unemployment 
insurance commission was challenged, the claimant was found to 
be right in 75 per cent of cases, and the government itself admits 
that.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	I will show the House a report we asked for in which the minister 
makes alarmist comments about the increase in fraud cases. So 
what does the report say? In 1991-92, 130,081 people were charged 
with and convicted of unemployment insurance fraud. By 1995-96, 
that figure had fallen to 116,603.
<P>
	Some may say: ``Wow, that is a lot of people''. True, that is a lot 
of people, but the figure applies to all of Canada. The total is not so 
high considering that some 3 million benefit claims are submitted 
in a year-which does not mean 3 million unemployed. Some 
claims may be for a short period only. Out of a total of 3 million, 
the number of fraudulent claims amounts to less than 6 per cent. 
The auditor general has already determined that there are always 
cases of fraud in any government program, regardless of what 
segment of the population it is intended for.
<P>
	What is happening? We could have recovered $272 million last 
year. In cases of fraud, however, only $93.4 million were 
recovered. The remaining $179 million was due to honest mistakes, 
occasionally by recipients but, three times out of four, by the 
unemployment insurance commission.
<P>
	This explodes the myth of fraud, which is, in fact, the basis for 
this reform. They want stricter controls and increased mechanisms. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2325"> 2325 </A></B>
<P>
They want better control of  measures. Why? To catch more people 
because unemployed Canadians are seen as potential cheats.
<P>
	We object to this kind of approach, because we know that, in 
many cases, UI benefits keep people from starving after they lose 
their jobs.
<P>
	There is something else we find quite extraordinary and 
revolting. I often tell this story to help people understand. 
Everyone knows the story of Robin Hood. I am not saying he was 
right, but he used to take from the rich to give to the poor. But what 
is the Liberal government doing by lowering the contributory 
earnings ceiling from $43,380 to $39,000? It is saving $900 
million. It is giving a present to the better off in our society. I am 
not saying that people making $40,000 are rich. The government is 
giving a present to business, to large corporations. But what is it 
doing to compensate for this $900 million? It is collecting this 
$900 million from those working less than 15 hours a week, who 
had not been paying UI premiums. And 70 per cent of those 
working less than 15 hours a week are women and young people. 
This is unacceptable.
<P>
	By calculating benefits based on the number of hours rather than 
the number of weeks, the government is heating up the competition 
for McJobs. People who want to qualify for benefits will apply left 
and right to take someone else's job.
<P>
	This bill is unfair. It is not an employment insurance bill, as it 
ensures that fewer people will qualify for benefits, thus hurting the 
most disadvantaged in our society. That is why the Bloc Quebecois 
is spending all its energy fighting this bill to have it withdrawn by 
the government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had 
intended to address some of the points raised by the member for 
Mercier. Instead I must address some of the points raised by the 
member for Lévis.
<P>
	Is there a reason the member for Lévis is dealing in rhetoric 
rather than in substance? What he is doing in dealing in rhetoric is 
the same thing that was done at the committee hearings. They do 
not want to deal with the substance because it will show what is 
really in the bill, that the bill has been improved for the working 
people of the country.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Opposition parties led by the Bloc filibustered debate for 
approximately 26 hours at the beginning of clause by clause 
examination of Bill C-12. The filibuster took place from 
approximately 9.30 a.m. on Tuesday, April 23 until 4 p.m., 
Wednesday, April 24. As a result, we missed being able to debate 
the substance of the issue and really get the facts out there.
<P>
	Let me address the points raised by the member for Mercier, the 
Bloc critic for HRD. I grant that her heart is  in the right place and 
that she does care, but she should look at the facts as they relate to 
the bill. Her remarks were long on rhetoric and extremely short on 
facts.
<P>
	The member argued the issue was not debated and she alleged 
the government does not care what happens. She is just plain 
wrong. The social security reform committee, which I believe she 
was a member of, held 600 hearings. There were public meetings 
held by MPs. The idea was to hold 100 hearings, and I believe close 
to 90 hearings were held.
<P>
	The people of Canada showed their concern. The difference 
between the Bloc, the Reform and the Liberals is that when Liberal 
members heard those concerns we proposed amendments to the 
bill. If we look at the Order Paper, at the positive changes made by 
the minister and other members of the Liberal Party to that bill, we 
looked at the concerns of Canadians and have tried to address them.
<P>
	In my past life as a farm union leader I had considerable 
experience dealing with legislative committees. In all my 
experiences before legislative committees I have never seen such 
substantial change come to a bill addressing the concerns of 
Canadians. Very seldom does a minister say he recognizes there are 
some problems with it. Both the previous and present Ministers of 
Human Resource Development have said there were some 
problems with Bill C-11 and C-12 and asked the committee to 
address them.
<P>
	The difference is that Liberals on the committee said ``yes, we 
will go the people, we will put forward positive amendments. All 
the Bloc, the Reform and some labour unions could say was scrap 
the bill. That is not productivity.
<P>
	Members on this side of the House have addressed the gap, 
which was a serious problem. We have addressed the divisor, which 
was a serious problem. We have addressed to a great extent the 
problem of the intensity rule. Through the amendments we will 
address the concern that there may be too much control by the 
governor in council so that debate in the future on the divisor in 
terms of weeks will be done in the House. We have made major 
improvements. The bill has become an expression of what 
Canadians want.
<P>
	The member for Mercier talked about shorting access to 
benefits. Let me again clear the record for the member. The fact is 
350,000 claimants in low income families will get a supplement. 
With regard to part time workers, 500,000 more individuals will 
have their work insured; about 380,000 of these will have all their 
premiums refunded; 140,000 part time workers who pay premiums 
today will also have their premiums refunded. The list goes on. 
Some 90,000 unemployed people who not now eligible for UI now 
will become eligible for EI. Those points should be put on the 
record.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2326"> 2326 </A></B>
<P>
	Again let me correct the member for Mercier on the point about 
women. On eliminating the 15 hour per week job trap, to avoid 
paying UI premiums some employees restrict part time workers 
to less than 15 hours per week. An hour based system will 
eliminate this 15 hour trap. Extending coverage to part time 
workers, the hour based system broadens coverage to 270,000 
women who work part time. Of these, 204,000 will have their 
premiums refunded.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	In terms of women holding multiple jobs, a greater share of 
working women hold multiple jobs and under the EI hours based 
system all hours count toward an EI claim. This means multiple job 
holders will now be fully insured should they take sick, maternity 
or paternal leave or lose one or more of their jobs for another 
reason.
<P>
	There are exceptions to the intensity rule which will help 
women. The intensity rule, which reduces the benefit rate by 1 per 
cent for every 20 weeks of regular benefits claimed over the past 
five years, will not apply to 108,000 women who receive the family 
income supplement and have a history of past use of EI. It is 
important that I put these points on the record and correct some of 
the rhetoric of the member for Mercier.
<P>
	I want to correct a point by the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup on his concern about Revenue 
Canada. Since 1971, for administrative and cost efficiency reasons, 
responsibility for the determination of the insurability of 
employment earnings and assessment of premiums was legally 
transferred from the commission to Revenue Canada. The hon. 
member was informed of that at the committee but because of their 
filibuster it might not have sunk in.
<P>
	Of some three million UI claims per year only some 60,000 or 2 
per cent are sent to Revenue Canada for insurability rulings. These 
requests are an important control feature to ensure UI benefits are 
properly paid, thus saving the UI program some $116 million 
annually.
<P>
	I point out for the member's benefit as well that there are 10 
Revenue Canada tax service offices in Quebec which provide 
rulings on the insurability of employment. Five of these offices 
handle appeals to the minister in terms of minister's determination, 
and with this are the fewer than 28 human resource Canada 
commissions adjudicating claims in Quebec. These are more than 
sufficient to handle the 3,938 appeals to the minister in a typical 
year.
<P>
	The member for Mercier talked about UI as economic stability. I 
point out to her that is what we see as a major important plank to 
the EI system. It is an economic stabilizer in the country. That is 
why we are trying to target the benefits to regions and to people 
with low incomes.
<P>
	We have the clawback provisions and we recognized long ago 
that EI is important in terms of working men  and women's lives 
and in terms of having an insurance program. It is an important 
economic stabilizer for the country as a well. It ensures that 
workers are available and that skills are available in the various 
regions throughout Canada.
<P>
	In terms of the amendments in the bill put forward by the 
Liberals, we will improve that and ensure economic stability so 
there is prosperity in the future across the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have let the hon. 
member speak have his say, but he mentioned that we, the members 
of the opposition, had not made a positive contribution to the work 
of the committee and that we had not proposed any amendment. I 
wish to get things straight. We proposed some 15 amendments, 
which were all rejected except the amendment I proposed, which 
dealt with a single word.
<P>
	I wanted to get things straight in order to avoid leaving the 
impression-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I regret to interrupt the hon. 
member but that was a point of clarification and, insofar as the 
issue has been settled, I think it will be generous enough to say that 
it was rather a matter of debate.
<P>
	It being 1:30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of private members' business as listed on today's 
Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-213, the Constitution Act, 1996 (balanced budget and 
spending limit), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a great honour for me to speak on Bill 
C-213, which one might call the bill to prohibit deficits and limit 
the size of government. In order to avoid this mouthful of a 
description, from now on I will call it the taxpayers protection act.
<P>
	This bill addresses one of the most fundamental problems facing 
Canada and other modern democracies. It addresses a problem 
which has already been taken care of by similar legislation in many 
of the provinces.
<P>
	It is unfortunate the government has decided all we can do is 
speak about it for a few minutes today and publish an obscure text. 
It will not be made a votable bill. I am very disappointed about this. 
However the people of Canada will have to judge whether or not 
this was justified.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2327"> 2327 </A></B>
<P>
	In the next 20 minutes I will present my arguments for the 
necessity of this bill. I will provide a background. I will outline 
briefly the main provisions of the bill. I will take care of the 
objections which are certain to arise in the speeches the 
government has prepared in response to my analyses.
<P>
	The need for a taxpayers protection act has arisen since the 
1970s when suddenly outside of wartime, governments in Canada 
and in other western democracies began to spend money that they 
had not raised through taxes. In other words, they ran deficits.
<P>
	It is well known that very soon the federal debt will reach $600 
billion. That amount of money is incomprehensible to most people. 
Suffice it to say that very soon, in order to service the debt 
approximately one-third of every dollar raised from Canadians will 
go to pay the interest on the debt. This is more than a transitory 
problem.
<P>
	I have attended a large number of university seminars. I have 
read many studies. I am personally acquainted with a man who 
received the Nobel prize in economics for developing a theory 
which I will sketch briefly. It explains that the deficits in the 
western world run by governments have been called the Achilles' 
heel of modern democracy. It is called the public choice theory.
<P>
	Governments have found it to their advantage to increase 
spending targeted at providing benefits to special interest groups, 
groups which have assembled and organized themselves for 
whatever reason. As a result of those spending allocations and tax 
concessions these groups receive benefits which in the aggregate 
make it very worthwhile for them to respond positively to the 
government. It has also led them typically to resist any opposition 
party which would promise in an election campaign to cut those 
special benefits.
<P>
	Those special benefits typically are not in the interests of all of 
society. Clearly, they benefit the group to whom they are given but 
not society as a whole. In looking carefully at subsidies to industry, 
to agriculture, to wherever our money is going, we clearly see a 
pattern for many. It is such that if there were a free vote and 
average Canadians had been asked whether they wanted to be taxed 
to serve this type of program, they would have said no.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	How do politicians get away with giving these benefits to special 
interest groups? Who is paying for it? The answer of course is that 
the rest of Canadians are paying for it. Why do Canadians not rise 
up and say to stop this? The answer is quite simple. The cost per 
Canadian for each individual program is very small. As a result, it 
does not pay for them to organize and provide politically effective 
opposition to these kinds of tax concessions.
<P>
	What is worse, there are Canadians who will have to pay for this 
bribing of special interest groups, this buying  of votes and these 
people cannot protect themselves. They are our future generations. 
They will have to pay the interest on the debt because some 
governments, rather than raising the money now to pay for the 
special interest groups, have found it more convenient to let future 
generations pay. Nobody is speaking for them.
<P>
	This is the modern theory of public choice. It is widely accepted 
as a fair description of processes that have haunted all modern 
societies. While we have begun to take care of the current deficit, 
there is no guarantee these problems will not be repeated in the 
future. That is why we should have legislation, preferably 
constitutional requirements to limit deficits and the size of overall 
government spending.
<P>
	In all those issues the question always arises, why did all these 
spending explosions take place in the 1970s? Why were 
governments suddenly able to get away with adding to the debt and 
letting the unborn and unprotected generations pay for it, rather 
than facing the voters and taxpayers of the day? The answer comes 
in two parts.
<P>
	Modern communications technology has made it possible even 
for relatively small interest groups to get together and become very 
effective in making themselves known to government. They make 
it known that they can deliver the necessary marginal votes which 
will bring about a victory in crucial electoral districts.
<P>
	Also, a revolution in thinking about the nature of capitalism 
which was brought about by Keynesianism removed the previously 
existing stricture on deficits. Until the 1970s deficits had been a sin 
for governments which they engaged in only at the expense of 
severe punishment by the voters.
<P>
	Then came a revolution in economics. I was a graduate student at 
the time and learned and absorbed it. I was soon cured of it and 
have been fighting against it ever since. Even today there is still a 
generation of economists who believe that deficits do not matter, 
that they can be piled on to future generations in order to maximize 
output today. I believe this is also being reversed.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	Having set the stage for explaining the necessity for Canada to 
have a constitutional provision or at least an act that prohibits 
deficits and limits the size of government, I will sketch briefly in 
non-legal form the provisions in my bill.
<P>
	The first provision is that the government must balance its 
budget every year. The second provision is that the size of 
government must be limited to the extent that we take today's 
spending and allow increases in spending only to reflect inflation 
and population growth.
<P>
	What is innovative in the bill is the third provision. If the 
government does not meet the deficit target, that is, it does not have 
a balanced budget in any year, there will  be penalties. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2328"> 2328 </A></B>
<P>
penalties will be reductions in the pay of members of Parliament 
who voted for the budget. For example, if there is a budget of $200 
billion with a deficit of $10 billion, that is 5 per cent. According to 
my proposed legislation, the pay for that year of members of 
Parliament would be reduced by 25 per cent, the 5 per cent deficit 
times five.
<P>
	Similarly, there would be provisions for penalizing government 
members of Parliament who voted for a budget which resulted in an 
increase in the size of government going beyond that which was 
specified. In other words, spending in the next year must increase 
by no more than inflation and population growth.
<P>
	Turning now to the topic of the objections I am sure both the 
government and the opposition will raise to my proposed bill, the 
first is that the sovereignty of Parliament will be violated. I must 
confess that for many years I was on the side which I am sure they 
will represent. In my naivety as a young man I believed that every 
four years voters had the right to throw out those bastards and 
therefore there was no reason at all for there to be an externally 
imposed limit on government. Democracy works that way.
<P>
	I have written a major study and have read a lot of different 
thinking on this matter. One thinking is that all parliaments of the 
world have had limits imposed on them. We could look to England 
and the Magna Carta and the United States with its constitutional 
amendment on freedom of speech. Yes, even Canada has put limits 
on the freedom of Parliament.
<P>
	Parliament is not able to pass legislation which violates the 
charter of rights and freedoms. It embodies our fundamental rights 
which are not to be violated by a simple majority vote in 
Parliament. I believe that future generations should be protected 
through a similar charter which would protect their right to their 
income, unburdened by obligations incurred by past generations 
over which they had no democratic influence.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	An amendment to the Constitution is as important as the charter 
of rights and freedoms. It does no more than the charter of rights 
and freedoms does on certain legislation. Democracy cannot be run 
by simple majority on issues which affect fundamental human 
rights. It has to be limited because sometimes people, overrun by 
the heat of a current debate, by a current issue, will be tempted to 
ask Parliament to pass laws which in themselves will destroy the 
very foundation of a democracy.
<P>
	That is the justification for having freedom of speech as one of 
the most fundamental rights; the right to a fair trial, to be innocent 
until proved guilty. Those are fundamental rights which no 
Parliament may override.
<P>
	I believe that in the same vein we need protection for future 
generations which cannot be overridden by Parliament.
<P>
	The second objection that I know will be coming is that it is 
impossible to balance the budget every year. Here too I had a 
conversion. I believe the Minister of Finance in this government 
has given me the clue on how it is done. The government builds in a 
contingency reserve. It simply makes sure that its estimates of 
spending are conservative, that its estimates of revenue expected 
are conservative. If they happen to go in the wrong direction, the 
government has a cushion so that it does not have a deficit.
<P>
	In spite of such conservative attempts to make sure there are no 
deficits, there may be unforeseen contingencies. It could be an 
earthquake, it could be a war, it could be almost anything. Under 
those circumstances Parliament should be protected.
<P>
	I cannot go into the details here. If Parliament is asked to define 
what is an acceptable contingency, it is in the same position where, 
in the English style democracy, the government really is a dictator 
and can say: ``We simply define it is a contingency and therefore 
we can run deficits''.
<P>
	Other parliaments have handled those situations by requiring 
that there be a 75 per cent majority vote in favour of accepting what 
is an acceptable contingency which would permit the government 
to run a deficit in that year.
<P>
	Similarly, on limits of spending levels I have provided a 
flexibility that they must be equal only over a three-year period. 
There will be a downward bias in overall government spending. 
This is all deliberate because a bias is also offset by the fact that the 
contingency spending every year will result in a reduction in the 
debt. Therefore, more money is becoming available every year 
because the interest cost on the debt decreases and therefore this 
will sort of wash out.
<P>
	Finally, I know a general objection which probably will never be 
raised by the Liberals who have such unlimited faith in the ability 
and honesty of government. The Canadian public is cynical. They 
will say: ``What good does it do to pass such a bill?'' I am an 
accountant and I could cook the books such that whatever the limits 
are, they can be got around by redefinition and by the shifting of 
expenses between periods and categories and all that kind of thing. 
I was very much aware of this. Therefore I have some technical 
provisions which suggest that it should not be possible to do so.
<P>
	I hope we will have a lively debate on this subject and I look 
forward to the comments from the other members who are here 
taking their Friday afternoon to debate with me.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak against Bill C-213.
<P>
	The hon. member's proposals at best reflect, as he admitted, a 
fundamental mistrust of the parliamentary system and the 
Canadian public, doubts I do not share. At worst, they amount to 
fiscal foolishness.
<P>
	This bill is really the Reform Party's zero in three budget in 
disguise.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On February 21, 1995, the leader of the Reform Party presented 
what was called the taxpayers' budget, the Reform Party's strategy 
to eliminate the federal deficit in three years.
<P>
	The public did not accept it. In fact, the Reform Party has 
stopped making proposals in view of the response they have 
received.
<P>
	So, here we are today before a desperate attempt to revive this 
failed budget in the form of a private member's bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Reform Party's slash and burn taxpayers' budget paid no 
regard to the consequences of the actions it proposed. If one is 
willing to institute mindless cuts, a favourite Reform strategy, 
indeed one can achieve short term savings and a balanced budget, 
but only if one believes in substituting decisiveness for 
thoughtfulness and fairness.
<P>
	The hon. member's proposed bill would surely result in 
substantial long term costs. The proposed fiscal straitjacket could 
mean gutting social programs, leaving the vulnerable in society to 
fend for themselves.
<P>
	It could mean cutting assistance programs without giving 
Canadians the tools to help them get back to work. It could mean 
eliminating tax preferences for small businesses which over the 
long run would result in less innovation, fewer companies and less 
employment. When one's only tool is a hammer, everything one 
sees looks like a nail. That would be the effect of this bill.
<P>
	In short, the member's strategy would be more hardship, a 
weaker economy and much greater spending pressures in the end, 
sabotaging the very goal of his legislation.
<P>
	The proposed private member's bill would put the government 
and the economy into a straitjacket. To meet its balanced budget 
goal would require that taxes be raised and spending be cut during a 
recession, rather than allowing the automatic stabilizers built into 
the tax system to work. The legislation would force government to 
make any recession worse because it would not be allowed to take 
action to assist Canadians.
<P>
	The Reform Party, the hon. member, and the government have a 
fundamental disagreement about the role of government. 
Canadians want a government that has the flexibility to act and to 
tailor its actions to meet the circumstances of the day. Canadians 
will not be fooled. The Reform Party goal, reflected in the hon. 
member's bill remains what always has been, to emasculate 
government as an end in itself. Canadians do not want a 
government that stands aside. Canadians want a government ready 
and able to stand alongside them.
<P>
	This legislation would put controls on total government 
expenditures without any regard to whether these spending 
pressures came from national or international developments, from 
developments over which the government has little or no control.
<P>
	Does the hon. member believe Canadians want to see their 
government respond, for instance, to interest rate swings by 
immediately slashing elderly benefits, unemployment insurance 
benefits, transfers to the provinces for medicare and social 
assistance? That is not what Canadians want and that is not the 
policy actions of a responsible government.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member is under the mistaken impression that 
because the United States has balanced budget legislation, Canada 
too should have the same. There is a bit of faddishness to what is 
going on here. Let me remind the hon. member that our systems of 
government, as he well knows, are quite different.
<P>
	In the United States, the executive branch, the president and 
cabinet, is separate from congress. Both prepare budget plans on 
which consensus must ultimately be achieved. That consensus is 
difficult to arrive at. Balanced budget legislation proposals came 
about in the United States because of a lack of consensus among 
legislators and the executive.
<P>
	In Canada, there is no similar distinction between the branches 
of government. Parliament is ultimately responsible and 
accountable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In 1991, the sponsor of this bill claimed, in a document entitled 
constitutional limits on public spending and Canada's deficit, that 
in practice deficits could not be prohibited, quite simply. It was 
also not desirable to do so for reasons of economic efficiency.
<P>
	I suppose if it were true then, it is still true now. We have no need 
for this type of legislation. The ultimate aim of this government is a 
balanced budget. We have come up with a balanced and fair 
strategy to achieve this end.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member and his colleagues have a fundamental 
mistrust of government. But we are proving every day that a 
govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2330"> 2330 </A></B>
<P>
ment can be fiscally responsible  and do it in a way that does not 
gut the country in the process.
<P>
	It has set two-year rolling deficit targets and it is committed to 
achieving them. It is accountable to the Canadian people year after 
year in meeting those targets and at every election we are ready to 
be judged.
<P>
	To date, the government has bettered the targets it has set and it 
will continue to meet its future targets for a number of reasons. 
First, for budget making purposes it is using economic assumptions 
that are more prudent than the private sector average.
<P>
	Second, it has built into its fiscal targets a contingency reserve 
which provides an extra measure of back-up against errors and 
economic planning assumptions. The proposed bill calls for a 
contingency reserve to be put in the legislation. There is no need to. 
It is already included in the fiscal plan.
<P>
	Finally, the government is undertaking fundamental reforms to 
provide for a stronger economy which in turn will lead to lower 
deficits.
<P>
	In closing, I would like only to say that there is no need for this 
proposed bill. The member's proposal would amount to a triumph 
of dogma over good sense. The government's finances are on track. 
It is pursuing a deficit reduction strategy that is measured, 
deliberate and responsible. I urge members of the House to reject 
Bill C-213.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on the bill of my colleague for 
Capilano-Howe Sound, Bill C-213, The Constitution Act, 1996 
(balanced budget and spending limit).
<P>
	The preamble to the bill states as follows: ``Whereas section 44 
of the Constitution Act, 1982-and I emphasize this 
point-provides that, subject to sections 41 and 42 thereof, 
Parliament may exclusively make laws amending the Constitution 
of Canada in relation to the executive government of Canada or the 
Senate and House of Commons''. Then, when the actual bill 
begins, it states: ``The Constitution Act, 1867 is amended by 
adding the following after section 57''.
<P>
	After that come 11 sections focussing on regulating government 
expenditures and forcing it to balance its budget. Included are all of 
the mechanisms, and even-as my colleague from the Reform 
Party has said-penalties set for senators, MPs, public servants and 
so on. This is, therefore, a very strong commitment and a bill with a 
very precise method of implementation.
<P>
	We are convinced that my honourable colleague's bill is well 
founded on a desire to force the government to balance its budget. 
In three years, we in the House have seen Canada's debt go up by 
$100 billion, and it is still rising. That debt was created by the 
Liberals.
<P>
	Recently, the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>-as my colleague is already 
well aware-referred to the possibility of bankruptcy in the long 
term. Our Reform colleagues, or the majority of them, have 
referred to that same possibility, stating quite openly:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``If we do not do something rapidly, we are going to probably hit 
the wall quite soon''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is why I think my hon. colleague is being true to himself in 
tabling such a bill. Obviously, the Bloc's position is different. We 
advocate an analysis of government spending budget item by 
budget item along with a full review of the use of tax shelters.
<P>
	We have just been promised a complete review of tax shelters. 
We note that it will be done outside the House by the very people 
who use them most. So there has been no follow up to what the 
Bloc wanted. For the time being, the government is satisfied with 
garnishing collective salary from unemployment insurance in order 
to balance the books and shift part of the deficit onto the provinces.
<P>
	The requirement for this government to balance its budget could 
be presented by my colleague simply in legislation before the 
House. However, as my colleague is a man of action, he decided to 
take the bull by the horns and propose a constitutional amendment. 
I think he knows what he is doing. The Constitution establishes an 
obligation not just for one government, but for each successive 
government, and is very difficult to change.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	The Constitution would be a very restrictive framework for the 
government. The hon. member states in his bill that the 
government would have to achieve fiscal balance within three 
years. Given this year's deficit of $24 billion and the anticipated 
deficit of $17 billion for next year, it is inconceivable that, under 
the circumstances, we could have a balanced budget in three years 
without making massive cuts-and I mean massive-in social 
programs, which would jeopardize the future of generations to 
come.
<P>
	I remember the hon. member for Chambly clearly saying in this 
House that the Reformers' economic or fiscal policy could often be 
summarized as follows: ``If you are in debt, stop eating for a year. 
It will solve the problem''.
<P>
	Achieving fiscal balance in the long term is a good principle. 
However, Bill C-213 is much too compelling and its provisions are 
way too strict.
<P>
	That being said, the hon. member is making a totally surprising 
suggestion at this point in Canadian history, by proposing a 
constitutional amendment. The word Constitution has almost 
become taboo.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2331"> 2331 </A></B>
<P>
	In January, the president of the Bank of Montreal travelled to 
Reform country, I believe it was in Calgary, and said: ``I am a 
banker. I know how important the economy is. However, under 
the circumstances, I think we will have to stop talking about the 
economy and start dealing with the Constitution. There is not 
much time left. We have 15 months to solve the issue''. This was 
in January, which means that we now have 11 months to solve 
an issue which seems much more important than the one being 
raised here.
<P>
	Following that statement, businesspeople from everywhere got 
together. Some met here in the Château Laurier, others in Montreal, 
to start seriously thinking about what should be done in the months 
ahead, given that this milestone is fast approaching. As well, 
Gordon Gibson started travelling across Canada with an extremely 
well made book entitled <I>Plan B</I>, which I recommend to everyone. 
The book provides a perfect description of the current situation, the 
constitutional deadlock, and points a finger at the federal 
government.
<P>
	We have also seen just recently the statements made by Peter 
White in <I>La Presse</I>, I think: ``The Prime Minister does not realize 
that the constitutional problem is serious, according to the 
president of the Council for Canadian Unity-he is definitely not a 
member of our party. Canada has two or three years to settle the 
constitutional problem. After that, it might be too late and-I quote 
the exact words-if these two or three years' respite are not put to 
good use, we are done for; if nothing substantial is proposed during 
that period, Lucien Bouchard will have the right to win his next 
referendum''.
<P>
	Mr. White is fully aware of the seriousness of the situation, but I 
think he is not aware of its urgency, because we do not have two or 
three years to settle this problem, we have a few months.
<P>
	It is therefore somewhat ironic, in light of the bill before us 
today, that at a time when bankers are telling us that we must stop 
talking about the economy and start talking about the Constitution, 
a first in Canadian history, now politicians are telling us that we 
must reopen the Constitution to sort out economic problems. The 
world is full of surprises.
<P>
	In his bill, my hon. colleague refers to the 1982 Constitution, and 
that is the problem. Quebec is not a signatory to this Constitution. 
And in accordance with the provisions included, naturally we 
cannot allow anything to be enshrined in this Constitution. Quebec, 
it will be recalled, was excluded from this Constitution. Federalists 
or sovereignists, we in Quebec did not give our agreement. And 
this unilateral patriation without Quebec's agreement was an 
obvious breach of contract.
<P>
	Then came Meech and Charlottetown, events everybody would 
like to forget, which were supposed to get Quebec to sign the 1982 
Constitution so that it could apply to all Canadians, including 
Quebecers. This  deadlock led to the 1995 referendum which, as we 
know, was won by the skin of the teeth, but was in fact a photo 
finish.
<P>
	Quebec's expectations are still as urgent as ever. The 
Constitution must be reviewed before April 1997. We have a few 
months ahead of us.
<P>
	Instead of invoking the 1982 Constitution, as my colleague did, 
to deal with economic problems, I think he should see to it that 
Quebec signs the Constitution to make it legally binding on all 
Canadians, including Quebecers if they sign it.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	We are now faced with another deadlock and we cannot count on 
the Liberals to sort this one out. That is why, I think, my colleague 
from the Reform Party could perhaps help us. We cannot count on 
the Liberal Party because the Liberal Party has never kept its 
promises.
<P>
	In 1974, it got elected by promising not to impose wage controls. 
Once elected, it did the opposite. In 1979, it got elected by 
promising not to tax gasoline or not to increase the tax. Once 
elected, it did the opposite. In 1989, it promised, if elected, to tear 
up the Free Trade Agreement. As we know, the Free Trade 
Agreement is still with us today. In 1993, it wanted to scrap the 
GST, we should know, we talked about it for one full week, but it 
never did.
<P>
	Constitutionally, and I will conclude with this, in 1980, Mr. 
Trudeau was fighting for his life. The solution arrived at was the 
1982 patriation, which resolved nothing, and led to promises that 
have not been kept. If my colleague truly wishes to resolve 
Canada's economic problems, I think he should first sort out the 
constitutional problems, for only then will we be able to find 
answers to these other problems.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to debate this motion. I congratulate the member for 
Capilano-Howe Sound for the work he has obviously put into his 
proposal. I know he is a very reflective person, one who has studied 
these matters deeply, being an economist. Being a lawyer myself I 
will refrain from the usual economist jokes about the gloomy 
profession and I am sure the member will be pleased that I am so 
doing.
<P>
	Perhaps he will forgive me if I start by saying I had some 
problems with this bill from a technical perspective when I first 
looked at it in terms of how it would work. Having heard the 
member introduce it I now have some profound problems about 
where it is coming from.
<P>
	I was listening to the member and I wondered why he did not 
propose we go back to the gold standard. It might have been about 
the same sort of proposition to achieve the same ends, to create a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2332"> 2332 </A></B>
<P>
rigid system within which governments cannot function, cannot 
move out of  straight-jackets and which is generally to the benefit 
of the moneyed classes, generally to the benefit of those who have 
large investments because they can be guaranteed that governments 
will not impinge on them by inflation or other measures which the 
member referred to.
<P>
	The member began by reminding us, and quite appropriately so, 
that we in Canada have become familiar with the fact that deficits 
are dangerous things, that we are mortgaging our children's future 
if we spend unwisely and put it into debt. I respect what the 
member had to say on that.
<P>
	However, the conclusion he came to was rather startling for me 
coming from the Reform Party. Its members day after day in the 
House hesitate to say how they are voting because it must be made 
very clear that they wish the appearance at least to be there that 
whenever they vote they are reflecting the immediate wishes of 
their constituents. How often have the member's colleagues stood 
in the House and told us ``I am not voting on this, my constituents 
are voting; I have consulted my constituents and I am the 
representative of direct democracy''?
<P>
	The member introduces the bill by telling us he does not believe 
in democracy. The bill is an anti-democratic bill. The member 
wants to introduce a constitutional change which will inhibit his 
constituents, my constituents and every other Canadian from 
voting for individuals or governments that intend to address 
economic problems in a way that would be inconsistent with the 
bill. It would put a straight-jacket around government functions in 
a way that is quite extraordinary. That this is coming from a party 
which pretends to be in favour of democracy is quite extraordinary.
<P>
<B>(1410 )</B>
<P>
	This party will not vote a change to the human rights code to 
prevent discrimination against a class of individuals based on their 
personal characteristics, but it will propose a bill which would 
make it impossible for the government to affect the economic 
well-being, the money they have in their pockets.
<P>
	The member is assimilating the bill to the charter. The member 
does not even know about the charter. The charter contains in it a 
notwithstanding clause. Did the member for Capilano-Howe 
Sound not realize that? It has a provision whereby if Parliament 
wishes to deal with something outside the constraints contained in 
the charter both the federal and provincial houses can do that.
<P>
	He does not even propose that in his bill. His notwithstanding 
clause is a narrow technical clause which gives war, acts of God 
and revolution an opportunity to get around the provisions of the 
bill, and I will come to  that when I move into problems with the 
way the bill operates.
<P>
	I start by fundamentally pointing my finger to my real 
philosophical problem with the bill. It is totally and utterly 
inconsistent with every precept of government and democracy that 
I have heard advanced by the members of the Reform Party so far 
in the House.
<P>
	That being as it is, it is passing strange but it often happens in 
politics that people propose inconsistent measures. It is curious that 
inconsistency from that party comes when it comes to a question of 
protecting money but there is no inconsistency when it comes to 
protecting basic human rights of human characteristics.
<P>
	The second problem I have with the bill is its inspiration is, I 
believe, fundamentally American in nature. This is an American 
concept. One can understand the American concept of government. 
In the congressional system one can understand why members of 
Congress have proposed such a bill. They are trying to constantly 
deal with that struggle between the legislature and the executive as 
represented in the president. The bill which has been introduced in 
the United States is a part of that dynamic of the constant fight 
between Congress and presidential authority. Congress is seeking a 
way to impose its will on the president and on the spending of the 
president as well.
<P>
	That may make sense in the American system but it does not 
make sense in a parliamentary democracy like ours where we 
function under very different rules.
<P>
	Those are my basic problems with the bill. I now will deal with 
the recognition by the member that such a strait-jacket could never 
be automatically applied. Even the member has said we could not 
lock a government in completely. I recognize his intellectual 
honesty in that. Then we have to be straightforward and honest 
about it. We have to look at the nature of exemptions which he has 
provided in the bill. War is an obvious one.
<P>
	I suggest that in an international interdependent world in which 
Canada presently lives creating a bill as simplistic as this does not 
recognize the problems that will come. The Mexican currency 
crisis was one. There will be others like that. We will be called on 
to be involved in many international events that will be imposed on 
us.
<P>
	I am not suggesting we as Canadians wish to adventure outside 
the country into foreign adventures. The integrated world we live in 
will be imposing things on us which are unforeseeable and 
unforeseen in the bill. They will then require expenditures. They 
may involve peacekeeping. These are large expenditures of billions 
of dollars in order to preserve the integrity of Canada. Whether we 
are talking about its security, its environment or its health, these 
expenditures will be necessary.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2333"> 2333 </A></B>
<P>
	Because the bill imposes a strict limit on the expenditures of 
government the inevitable consequences will be that this will be 
paid for out of the domestic side of the economy and the social 
programs of Canadians, their health, their unemployment 
insurance. The guarantees they have for a healthy productive 
society will be threatened because we have not been able to deal 
flexibly with the immediate challenges which are bound to come 
in 21st century.
<P>
	I leave it with the member that my other problem with the bill is 
I do not think it is adapted to the modern world in which we are 
entering. I do not think it is adapted to the enormous complexity of 
the new international world into which we are moving which will 
require a great deal of flexibility on behalf of Canadian 
governments.
<P>
	Another problem I have with the bill is that it fails to recognize, 
if I may go back to its anti-democratic roots, the nature of the 
Canadian people.
<P>
<B>(1415 )</B>
<P>
	In electing this government with the promise it made to reduce 
the deficit to 3 per cent, by efforts it has been making to do so, it is 
clearly foreseeable that within two years Canada will be the lowest 
deficit country of any of the G-7. We are on the deficit reduction 
track.
<P>
	Canadians have, through the course of this lesson, learned what 
are the consequences of overspending. All of us are pulling in what 
we are doing. In my riding of Rosedale, which is a downtown 
riding in an urban centre, there are enormous problems of social 
housing, crime and issues that require a lot of government action 
and attention, most of the citizens there have willingly recognized 
that we have to rein in what we are doing.
<P>
	We wish to discipline ourselves in an intelligent way. We do not 
just wish to discipline ourselves automatically. The member from 
St. Paul's called it hitting the nail with a hammer because you 
happen to have a hammer in your hand and nothing else.
<P>
	What we need in today's social circumstances is a surgeon's 
scalpel and not a hammer. The member has provided us with a 
hammer. In so doing, he will not allow us to adjust in a way in 
which the government is already indicating governments can adjust 
and will adjust.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that the government has a different 
approach. It was shown in the last budget, and I am sure that future 
budgets will show it as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, this proposal is fundamentally undemocratic and 
impracticable, and serves only the interests of the richer members 
of society, not those of average citizens.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I have taken note of the 
request from the hon. member for Capilano-Howe Sound in 
whose name the motion stands before the House today that, under 
right of reply, if the time permitted, we could grant him up to no 
more than two minutes of final comment.
<P>
	We recognize the work that goes into private members' bills. 
This one is not votable but the House must understand clearly that 
he will be the last to speak. After his two-minute conclusion, we 
will move on to the last order of business.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate having two minutes. I 
will be very fast. I appreciate the thoughtful comments from the 
members for St. Paul's and Rosedale. It is rare that we have a 
discussion at this level of intellectual rigour. Nevertheless, some 
rhetoric sneaked in.
<P>
	The main point I would like to make in response to what was said 
is this. It was said that this is an ideological position embodied in 
this bill. It is.
<P>
	I have asked my colleagues, my friends, constituents, this 
question. The governments of Canada are now spending over 
one-half of your income. Are you getting your money's worth? I 
have never yet met anyone who said: ``Yes, I am''.
<P>
	The question that has to be addressed when we talk about the 
ideological basis of this kind of an approach to limiting 
government is, how did we get there and how can we protect 
ourselves from going even further because of all of the good 
sounding arguments being made for specific cases of people 
needing help. Measures get put into place. They never get 
eliminated. That is the main issue.
<P>
	I find it somewhat below the intellectual capacity of these 
individuals to call my ideas faddish or incorporating unreasonable 
dogma, or go back to the gold standard or that an idea that comes 
from America is the worst of all possible things.
<P>
	I will write a letter to all the members of the legislatures of the 
provinces in this country that have adopted a similar bill to tell 
them they are faddish, dogmatic and influenced by Americans. 
There was nothing about the merit of the bill itself. That is very 
sad.
<P>
	Almost all the objections that the members raise have been taken 
care of by provisions in my bill. The fundamental difference is that 
I represent that segment of Canadians who believe government is 
too big, has become too bloated and we need some institutional 
device for slimming it down. We cannot trust the same system that 
got us here simply on the promise that now that we have learned in 
the future we will not do it again.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2334"> 2334 </A></B>

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired and 
the order is dropped from the Order Paper.
<P>
	It being 2.20 p.m., the House stands adjourned until Monday 
next at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24.
