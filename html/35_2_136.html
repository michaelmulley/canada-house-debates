	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should enter into discussions with 
provincial governments to limit the social assistance available to failed refugee 
claimants who are  remaining in Canada to make appeals to the courts and transfer the 
onus of providing further assistance to these individuals to immigrant and refugee aid 
societies and other organizations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, my motion, which calls on the government 
to reduce the financial burden of failed refugee claimants on 
Canada's social assistance network, is the result of considerable 
research and communication with a number of organizations and 
agencies in this country, in particular in the province of Ontario.
<P>
	At the outset I wish to say that there is little question that 
Canadians willingly accept the responsibility of providing safe 
refugee accommodation to an internationally proportionate number 
of refugee seekers. In fact, Canadians welcome the opportunity to 
provide a new home to those who through no fault of their own are 
persecuted or displaced by political events and turmoil.
<P>
	To be clear, Canadians do not want to stop accepting refugees. To 
be equally clear, that is not what this motion is about. What this 
motion is about is to recognize that failed refugee claimants can 
represent a tremendous burden to Canadian taxpayers. 
Consequently, the federal government should limit the opportunity 
for failed refugee claimants to receive welfare.
<P>
	In the context of this debate let us define what criteria are used to 
determine an individual refugee.
<P>
	The United Nations High Commission for Refugees cares for 
and repatriates or resettles some five million refugees and 
displaced persons each year. A distinction must be made between a 
displaced person and a convention refugee.
<P>
	A displaced person is one who, as the result of a natural disaster 
or political turmoil, has been rendered homeless and who is outside 
his or her own country. A convention refugee is one who, because 
of membership in a particular political or social group, religion, 
race or nationality, cannot return to his or her home country for fear 
of serious persecution. Obviously not all displaced persons are 
convention refugees. Most can, at one time or another, be 
repatriated.
<P>
	According to UN estimates there are approximately 20 million 
displaced persons or refugees in the world, but only approximately 
60,000 of them are genuine convention refugees. This number is 
particularly important. In 1993, when I acted as the party's 
immigration critic, the immigration department claimed that 
Canada had accepted about 25,000 convention refugees. This 
position was maintained by the  immigration department despite 
the fact that the UN said that only about 25,000 of those 60,000 
convention refugees who were in need of immediate resettlement 
were resettled worldwide. In other words, there were something in 
the neighbourhood of 35,000 convention refugees who needed a 
new home who could not be placed anywhere. Yet our country, 
through our refugee determination process, took in somewhere 
around 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8476"> 8476 </A></B>
<P>
35,000. If we took in 35,000 through our process, why were there 
still 35,000 genuine refugees not placed? That is the question that 
begs to be answered. Unfortunately I have received no answer to 
that dilemma from the Liberal government.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> And never will.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> And never will, as my colleague points out. The 
question has been asked numerous times.
<P>
	In my travels to many of the points of entry in this country, I 
have determined there is a flow of refugee claimants, tens of 
thousands a year, coming into the country, and many are 
determined not to be true refugees.
<P>
	Consider the border crossing at Fort Erie. In 1993 over 7,000 
entered through that port and claimed refugee status. By law, 
according to the present situation at least, the department of 
immigration is obliged to give them oral hearings.
<P>
	Of the 30,000 to 35,000 who claim refugee status every year, 
slightly under half are really accepted as refugee claimants. That 
leaves in the neighbourhood of 15,000 to 20,000 who have been 
rejected as refugee claimants. We can read in the 1994-1995 
estimates on immigration the cost that has been initiated by the 
department of immigration for hearing a claimant, a failed 
claimant, in our process through our court system once that 
individual has arrived here.
<P>
	The figure from those estimates is between $30,000 and $50,000 
per claimant. Of course, much of that cost is generated as a result of 
the state's having to support the claimant. Unfortunately many of 
the refugees do not speak the language and are not really expected 
to either. The provisions for refugee claimants will certainly be 
different than they would be for those who immigrate through 
normal channels. It is understood that many refugees will not have 
the skills, which I believe for the most part is acceptable to 
Canadians.
<P>
	However, a failed claimant with an estimated cost of $30,000 to 
$50,000-I have heard that estimate as high as $100,000 per 
claimant-is a substantial burden to the taxpayer. Those claimants 
are supported at every turn by the present government. It is tax 
dollars that support them, although they are not legitimate 
claimants.
<P>
	The reasons for this motion is to see that some form of 
communication be established with the provincial  counterparts to 
curb this excessive cost and to take much swifter action for 
removal if the claimant is not legitimate.
<P>
	On the issue of cost, there are 15,000 to 20,000 illegitimate 
claimants at a cost of between $30,000 and $50,000 per claimant. 
What does that add up to? We are talking about legal aid, welfare 
costs, support services right across the board, many of which are 
downloaded on to the provinces. There is a hit on the three levels of 
government, federal, provincial and municipal.
<P>
	The motion I have presented here speaks to that concern. It 
certainly speaks to the concern of a lot of Canadians who are aware 
of what is happening. However, many are not aware. It is 
incumbent on opposition to point these very glaring discrepancies 
out. Unfortunately the government across the way chooses to 
ignore much of the concerns expressed. It chooses to ignore what a 
lot of people have been telling it.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	Why is it that the government refuses to deal with an issue that is 
so clear? From my experience thus far and from those people I have 
spoken to at this point I have come to one conclusion. The 
government is not listening to the concerns of the average person. 
It is listening to a very small group of special interests, many of 
whom are supported by and receive compensation from federal 
government grants. Lobbyists, advocates of all sorts, and 
consultants are seeking to keep the situation as is and for it not to 
be changed.
<P>
	The public is growing weary of having to contend not only with 
the burden of cost but with some of the problems that have resulted 
because of poor screening processes of those people who are 
accepted as refugee applicants.
<P>
	The list of concerns grows. It has become clear through several 
examples of refugee claimants-and I say claimants and not 
refugees themselves-being accepted in the country who were not 
given any status whatsoever and were involved in some very 
violent crimes. Many of those individuals have a tendency to be 
protected by the state in spite of the fact that they have been a 
burden on the state and should be removed immediately.
<P>
	There have been clear violations of some individuals coming 
from overseas who have the means. They have the money or the 
wherewithal to end up in this country. They also have this very 
questionable chequered past. Mr. Abdirahman is one such 
individual who has been cited as having been involved in genocide 
in his own country. The list can be extended beyond what presently 
exists that may have hit the news. The recommendations and the 
policies set forth by the Liberal government encourage for some 
unknown reason selection of people like Mr. Abdirahman and those 
from questionable organizations in other countries of the world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8477"> 8477 </A></B>
<P>
	To my way of thinking and the thinking of a lot of Canadians 
these are not acceptable refugees. Certainly they are running from 
something else, but many of them should be tried in their own 
countries for some of the things they have done.
<P>
	Let us get back to the point in question, the support level 
generated by both the federal and provincial governments because 
of federal legislation of those who have failed in their claim. When 
a claimant has failed in his application to be accepted as a refugee it 
is clear that the government should withdraw services. Why should 
legal aid continue to be pumped into the inexhaustive appeal 
process to follow? Why should the people of this country have to 
pay continually through their tax dollars for the support of such 
individuals?
<P>
	It is obvious the average Canadian has not been heard in this 
debate at all.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	When the matter was first raised in the House there was reaction 
from the other side, from some of the special interest groups and 
from the immigration bar association trying to squelch debate on 
the topic. The terms so often used were: ``You are discriminatory. 
Those are racist comments''. Is that what government and debate 
have resorted to, to squelch a legitimate issue? Those comments 
are wearing rather thin.
<P>
	The Reform Party has put forward some proposals. In 1994-95 
my office printed a document on a proactive approach to the 
protection of refugees in Canada. It is an alternative and it is 
important that we look at alternatives.
<P>
	The Reform Party is suggesting the target number of persons 
accepted by Canada as convention refugees should stabilize at 
approximately 10 per cent of the total immigration intake.
<P>
	We have talked about immigration levels. There has always been 
a history of fluctuation in the immigration levels in Canada, up 
until the last few years when it has been extremely high and there 
has been no adjustment or opportunity for the newcomers to 
integrate into Canada, into society and into the workforce. As a 
result other tensions have built up.
<P>
	We are suggesting that it be 10 per cent of the total intake, in or 
around 15,000. The target of immigration levels would be 150,000 
per year or thereabouts. The number of self-declared refugees 
arriving at our ports of entry would be sharply reduced if the word 
was clear out there in the immigration and refugee channels. It is 
known worldwide that Canada is a soft touch. All they have to do is 
land on our shores and declare they are refugees. Then they are 
entitled to all the support the Liberal government liberally 
generates in that direction.
<P>
	With this restriction, and making it clear that the level of support 
on these appeals will not occur, the numbers  will drop. The number 
of persons accepted as convention refugees through the inland 
determination process would be sharply reduced.
<P>
	What will that do? It will open up slots for legitimate refugees. 
On the compassionate side of things that is what we should look at, 
not what we are experiencing here where legitimate refugees are 
being shut out because of a process that pays no heed to them. The 
inland process must be sharply curbed. With this form of 
communication to provincial governments since many on the 
provincial side are footing the bill in some respects although there 
are social transfer payments, it would be more of a legitimate 
concern expressed to the Canadian people and much more 
acceptable than what is happening at the present time.
<P>
	To make sure the balance takes place it is our suggestion that the 
Government of Canada work in conjunction with the UN first to 
identify those who are legitimate. Second, it never hurts to have a 
watchdog over the process and encourage the UN representatives to 
examine our record of refugee determination.
<P>
	There is a need for trade-offs. Looking at it from the 
compassionate side, Canada is doing an injustice to tens of 
thousands of genuine refugees overseas who are much easier to 
settle than those involved in the expensive inland determination 
process, many of whom are actually queue jumpers of the 
immigration line.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	I encourage members across the way to give serious 
consideration to the motion. We are entering a time of substantial 
restraint This is one area that can be shored up and supported by the 
Liberal government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we on the 
government side certainly encourage debate on this topic. It is very 
important to all Canadians.
<P>
	Over the years our country has developed a reputation as a good 
international citizen. We take our responsibilities to others very 
seriously. When we sign a deal or shake hands with a partner we 
know they are getting a good deal from Canada. They respect our 
abilities for doing that.
<P>
	We have always played a role of honest broker. Many times it is 
a role that suits us very well. This is something of which I know 
every member of the House is very proud. People know they can 
count on Canada when the chips are down.
<P>
	This has shone through our actions over the last 50 years. We can 
see it in our commitment to United Nations peacekeeping, a 
Canadian invention. Canadians have worn the blue beret with a 
great deal of pride in hot spots around the world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8478"> 8478 </A></B>
<P>
	It shows in our commitment to third world development. 
Organizations like CIDA have allowed disadvantaged areas to gain 
the skills and expertise they need to promote sustainable growth 
and development.
<P>
	We can see it in our support of international organizations like 
UNICEF and the World Health Organization. We can see it in our 
commitment to offering protection to refugees and people fleeing 
misery and death. Our humanitarian record is second to none. It 
should be a source of pride.
<P>
	Over the last 50 years we have provided a safe haven in the 
world of desperation and fear. We have been a symbol of hope to 
people who have come all but a circle of very difficult times. We 
have given refuge to those who have been subjected to experiences 
almost beyond our imagination.
<P>
	We have been compassionate in both word and deed. We have 
not allowed our hearts to cloud our heads. At no time have we let 
our desire to make difference override our common sense.
<P>
	This is reflected in our refugee determination system. It is a fair 
system that balances our desire to help others with our clear need to 
protect Canadians and the integrity of the institutions we value. It is 
a good system that has been recognized as being one of the world's 
best.
<P>
	I understand the hon. member's concern that there are people 
abusing the system and taking advantage of our generosity. That is 
clearly unacceptable. The refugee determination system is 
designed to protect individuals who most need it, individuals who 
through no fault of their own are in desperate circumstances. It is 
not a back door for unscrupulous people wanting to circumvent 
proper immigration channels.
<P>
	We need to guard against these few criminals because their very 
presence impacts on the reputation of our system and causes us to 
lose sight of the plight of genuine refugees. That is why safeguards 
are in place. We have good screening methods to make sure that 
people who are not convention refugees are identified and dealt 
with properly.
<P>
	I understand there is concern about failed refugee claimants 
accessing Canada's social assistance programs. I share this 
concern. However, to suggest that these people simply be cut off 
betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the refugee 
determination system and the plight which many people in the 
system face.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Implicit in the motion is the idea that all failed refugee claimants 
are trying to abuse the system. It suggests that because someone in 
the refugee determination system is not found to be a convention 
refugee, they must be trying to pull a fast one on the Canadian 
people and should be punished. This simply is not the case. In fact, 
it could not be more wrong.
<P>
	The definition of a refugee was set out in the 1951 United 
Nations convention relating to the status of refugees. It established 
that a refugee is someone outside his or her country of origin who 
could not return home for fear of persecution for reasons of race, 
religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a 
particular social group. Over the last five decades this definition 
has worked well and has proven to be flexible enough to deal with 
many different types of persecution.
<P>
	However, there are exceptional circumstances where it does not 
necessarily fit. In these cases men and women are declared failed 
refugee claimants even though they find themselves in desperate 
situations. Does the hon. member really want to punish these 
individuals at their time of crisis?
<P>
	I am happy to say that the system looks out for these cases. 
Mechanisms have been built into the system to take care of people 
in exceptional circumstances. There are provisions for judicial 
review in certain circumstances. There is a built-in risk assessment 
in the system as well. It ascertains the potential risk that failed 
refugee claimants may face should they return to their country of 
origin. This allows us to identify whether or not removing a person 
from a country of origin will constitute a real threat to the person's 
life.
<P>
	Finally, there is also the potential for a humanitarian and 
compassionate review if a claimant feels that his or her case merits 
special attention due to extenuating circumstances. These are all 
means to ensure that people who genuinely need help get it.
<P>
	Perhaps I should clarify something. These are the exceptions, not 
the rule. That is why we continue to be vigilant about finding and 
removing people who do not merit our humanitarian concerns. That 
is why we are making every effort to ensure that people do not 
linger in the system for longer periods of time. The key is not to 
punish people who are in the system. It is to make sure that people 
get in and out of the system as quickly and efficiently as possible.
<P>
	The government recently introduced two measures to do just 
that. The first, Bill C-49, proposes to reduce refugee hearing panels 
from two members to one, thereby allowing quicker scheduling of 
hearings and faster decisions.
<P>
	The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration also introduced 
proposed regulatory changes to streamline the risk assessment 
process for failed refugee claimants. Under these proposed changes 
the risk review will no longer be automatic. Instead failed refugee 
claimants will have to apply. For some, the review is just a 
formality and therefore a way to delay the process. The proposed 
changes will ensure that appropriate risk reviews are done 
thoroughly and efficiently.
<P>
	It has been said that a country can be judged by the way it treats 
the most vulnerable in its society. By this  criteria I think Canada 
has a lot to be proud of. We take care of our people. We feel the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8479"> 8479 </A></B>
<P>
obligation to share our prosperity with others. We have developed 
humanitarian policies which are fair and compassionate but they 
also make sense. They recognize that we cannot help everyone and 
that we must target our resources to helping those who most need 
our protection.
<P>
	The motion before the House does not recognize certain realities 
of the refugee determination process or the situation of individuals 
using the system. It was developed from a false premise that those 
who have been found not to be convention refugees are scoundrels 
and should be punished. That is faulty reasoning which is reflected 
in a faulty motion the House should not support.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy 
to have this opportunity to speak to Motion M-126, tabled on 
February 27, 1996 by the member for Calgary Northeast.
<P>
	With this motion, the Reform member is asking the federal 
government to enter into discussions with the provinces in order to 
limit the social assistance available to failed refugee claimants who 
appeal or challenge the ruling concerning their status. Furthermore, 
the motion also suggests that immigrant and refugee aid societies 
be responsible for supporting and helping these individuals.
<P>
	This motion is typical and representative of Reform values and 
of its anti-immigrant and anti-refugee policy. That party is hostile 
to strangers and minorities. It disregards the history of Canada and 
forgets that it was built on immigration and that it needs 
immigrants to survive as a prosperous nation. That is the case 
especially in Alberta, where the member's riding is located, and in 
the other western provinces.
<P>
	Is the author of this motion unaware of the fact that social 
assistance comes under provincial jurisdiction and that the federal 
government has no jurisdiction whatsoever in that area? Ottawa has 
no business interfering with the rules governing access to social 
assistance. Therefore, this motion is unacceptable because it leads 
to direct federal interference in an area of provincial jurisdiction. 
Also, this motion transfers the financial onus from governments to 
immigrant and refugee aid organizations, which is totally 
unreasonable and unjustified.
<P>
	We must remember that these not-for-profit organizations lack 
the necessary funds to take on such financial responsibilities. Since 
it came to office, the Liberal government has made many cuts to 
the grants awarded to these organizations. It must be well 
understood that, according to the motion, only the obligation to 
provide assistance is transferred to the  organizations. Nowhere is a 
transfer of money mentioned.
<P>
	The very spirit of this motion is disturbing in that it is aimed at 
punishing people who are exercising their rights. Indeed, if 
someone decides to appeal the decision denying him refugee status, 
his social assistance benefits would be withdrawn or limited. When 
did our legal system start punishing people for exercising their 
rights?
<P>
	The Reform member's motion also goes against the universality 
principle, which is fundamental to our social security system. Why 
should a fundamental right be denied to a group of people, in this 
case refugee claimants? Yet, the Supreme Court of Canada clearly 
ruled that these people are protected by the Canadian charter of 
rights.
<P>
	Refugees do not choose their situation, let alone to live on social 
assistance. These people are already in an extremely precarious 
position. Consequently, withdrawing or limiting their only source 
of income is totally unacceptable. Moreover, we see that social 
assistance benefits have been reduced throughout Canada, 
particularly because of Ottawa-imposed cuts in social transfers to 
the provinces. If an additional reduction is made, we may ask 
ourselves what tiny amount will ultimately be left. Do we want 
people to die of hunger in this so-called ``best country in the 
world'', as the Prime Minister likes to claim?
<P>
	Refugee status determination is incumbent upon the federal 
government, more specifically the immigration and refugee board, 
whose management and administration leave much to be desired. 
Time frames and delays in this matter are too long.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	I recently questioned the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration about this. Her answer showed very little will to act to 
ensure that less time was needed to process refugee status claims. 
At present, it generally takes more than a year, and often as long as 
two, three, four or more years. That is unacceptable.
<P>
	Since the Liberal Government was elected in 1993, the refugee 
claim backlog at the IRB has risen to over 30,000, a 75 per cent 
increase, and more than half of this number is in Montreal. This is 
especially unacceptable since the number of claimants has 
diminished these past few years. The IRB should work on stepping 
up productivity and enhancing its efficiency. Board members 
should be required to process a larger number of claims each year.
<P>
	The 140 or so members currently process 140 claims per year on 
average. That is not enough. This excessively long turnaround time 
and the lack of productivity at the IRB and the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration are responsible for the skyrocketing 
cost of refugee status determination.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8480"> 8480 </A></B>
<P>
	The minister should also put an end to the patronage system 
used to appoint IRB members. So far, the best qualification for 
getting appointed to the board was to be a member of the Liberal 
Party or a defeated Liberal candidate in the last election, a 
contributor to the Liberals' campaign fund or a friend of the 
Liberals.
<P>
	Meanwhile, many claimants require social assistance from the 
provinces, which end up footing the bill for the federal 
government's negligence and neglect, as well as for the 
unreasonable backlog at the IRB. Citizenship and Immigration 
Canada is also responsible for issuing work permits to refugee 
claimants. Often, permits are denied or take forever to be issued.
<P>
	The vast majority of these individuals want to work. They are 
prepared to take any job that will earn them a livelihood. Only as a 
last resort do they apply for social assistance benefits.
<P>
	It is imperative that a fair, efficient and, more importantly, 
diligent system for the processing of refugee claims be set up. 
Those whose claims are legitimate should have their status 
confirmed within a reasonable length of time, so as to minimize 
costs and the time these people are held in limbo.
<P>
	All the federal government has to do is refund the provinces the 
expenses generated by the arrival of refugee claimants. Ottawa has 
sole responsibility for determining the rules and outcome of the 
refugee status determination process as well as for more general 
issues, such as admission to Canada and the return of refugees.
<P>
	Why should the provinces, including Quebec, have to pay for 
providing refugee claimants with reception and support services, 
including health care? I said, and I repeat, that the refugee status 
determination process is a federal responsibility.
<P>
	These people should have access to basic financial support when 
in need, to legal assistance, temporary housing, elementary and 
secondary education for children and language training, in French 
in Quebec and English in the other provinces. Funding for these 
programs must come from Ottawa.
<P>
	For all these reasons, we are unable to support either the 
principle or the letter of Motion M-126.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to put this private member's motion in context. It 
does not bar the door to legitimate refugees. That is the last thing 
our country should do. As a matter of fact, throughout all of the 
world Canada stands as a beacon of hope to thousands and 
thousands of people. That should never change.
<P>
	However, putting out the welcome mat does not mean that we 
have to be the doormat. That is what we are talking about.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	Most Canadians intuitively understand the difference between 
welcoming people, in particular refugees, to our shores and being a 
doormat to anybody who wants to use and abuse the system. That is 
what we are talking about in this bill. We are talking about sending 
a message to the world, to people who would misuse our generosity 
and say to them you have an opportunity to come to our shores and 
apply for refugee status but if it is determined under a fair system 
that you are not a genuine refugee, then you cannot use taxpayer 
money indefinitely to try to work your way around the system. That 
is all we are talking about here.
<P>
	We are not talking about barring the doors. We are not talking 
about being meanspirited. We are talking about using a little 
common sense.
<P>
	We need to understand that new Canadians come to our shores 
through three separate doorways. One is the sponsored immigrant 
status. A sponsored immigrant is usually when someone has a 
relative who has come here before and sponsors them. Another is 
the landed immigrant status whereby someone applies on their own 
merit under the point system and is able to come to Canada because 
they have the ability. We also have the category where people are 
able to buy their way in. The category that we are talking about 
right now is the refugee status.
<P>
	Canadians should really think about how we handle refugees and 
people who come to our country under the refugee status. I ask 
members to think about this. By definition how is it possible for 
someone to arrive on our shores from the United States, from 
England or from another safe country and apply for refugee status? 
Would it not make more sense if our country were to go to those 
places in the world where people who are genuine refugees, who do 
not have the wherewithal or the money to find their way to our 
shores, and would it not make more sense for us to make the 
refugee determination on site so that when people come to our 
shores they do not have to have this sword dangling over their 
heads of are they going to be granted landed refugee status or not?
<P>
	That brings to mind the Somalis in Toronto who were invited to 
our shores by our government, welcomed by our government and 
then put into this limbo for all of those years where they are not 
granted landed immigrant status. They are left in this limbo, where 
they must utilize Canada's social safety net because they cannot 
work. We cannot assume that refugees coming to our shores do not 
want to work. Everybody knows that is not true. The vast majority 
of people who come to our shores are just dying to contribute, just 
aching to be part of our country. But if we do not allow them to 
work, then they have to access our social programs.
<P>
	We need to make sure that our refugee claimant process is swift, 
accurate, compassionate and once a decision has been made, allow 
people to get on with their  lives. It is this never ending opportunity 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8481"> 8481 </A></B>
<P>
for people to appeal and appeal. Meanwhile all the time they are 
doing so they are accessing the very short funds that all provinces 
find that they have for social security.
<P>
	One of the reasons that the provinces have a dramatic shortage of 
funds for social security is, as we all know, that under the Canada 
health and social transfer the transfers to the provinces have been 
reduced by $7 billion by this Liberal government. Therefore the 
provinces find themselves having to deal with more and more 
expenses with fewer and fewer resources.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from the Bloc who spoke earlier mentioned 
that this motion was out of order because welfare and items of this 
sort were a provincial responsibility and not the purview of the 
federal government in any instance.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	While it is true that welfare is a responsibility of the provinces, 
we are in a federal state. This government will be announcing today 
that the Prime Minister is on the west coast in Vancouver and that 
he will make a great to-do about making a deal with the 
government of B.C. for residency requirements for welfare 
recipients. As long as the federal government has its oar in the 
water through spending and taxing power, it has a role to play in the 
purview of the provinces whether the provinces like it or not.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that on every single bit of legislation that 
comes before the House, members of the Bloc are very quick to 
defend the honour and the jurisdiction of their province but they are 
not so quick to say that they would be quite happy to pay for it 
themselves. The idea is ``send us the money and let us make the 
decisions on what we are going to do with it''.
<P>
	There is a very genuine role for the federal government to play. 
The federal government makes the determination for what the 
international covenants on refugee status and claimants will be. 
The federal government has a role in the transfer of resources from 
the provinces to pay for social assistance and the federal 
government sets the rules by which all members play. The federal 
government has a very real involvement in this issue.
<P>
	This is our obligation as a nation. When we open our doors to 
refugee claimants, we should do so expeditiously. We should make 
it possible for people to come to our country, to become landed 
immigrants and eventually citizens, the vast majority of whom will 
make great contributions to our country. We can see in the mosaic 
that is Canada there are people of all nations from all parts of the 
world who are coming together to build the democratic land that is 
one of the most cherished in the world.
<P>
	Our doors should always be opened to genuine refugees. But 
again, we do not need to be a doormat in  order to extend the 
welcome mat to genuine refugees. When people who have come to 
our shores as refugees have under fair and impartial hearings been 
determined not to fit the refugee classification, then it makes sense 
to me and to thousands of other Canadians that the taxpayer not be 
obligated to foot the bill indefinitely. That is what we are talking 
about here. It is not meanspirited; it is merely common sense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to speak to Motion No. 126 
as proposed by the hon. member for Calgary Northeast. This 
motion advocates that the federal and provincial governments 
co-operate in order to limit the social assistance available to failed 
refugee claimants who are remaining in Canada to make appeals to 
the courts and to transfer the onus of providing further assistance to 
these individuals to immigrant and refugee aid societies and other 
organizations.
<P>
	I understand the hon. member's concerns regarding the strains 
our social assistance programs are under. In this time of fiscal 
austerity and deficit reduction it is important to find ways to 
maintain the institutions which are truly important to our society.
<P>
	In many respects our social welfare system shows that 
Canadians care about offering a helping hand to those in need. This 
commitment is also evident in the way we treat refugees and 
refugee claimants. For decades Canada has opened is arms to 
people who have fled from terror and repression around the world. 
As Canadians we have an obligation to not look away.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	As signatories of the Geneva convention on refugees we pledged 
to do our part as good international citizens. This is a responsibility 
I am proud to say we continue and we shall continue to meet.
<P>
	We must be vigilant and not tinker with our refugee system in a 
needless or careless fashion. To suggest that we should take 
punitive measures against individuals who are not found to be 
convention refugees is a little misguided. I agree with the hon. 
member that we should not tolerate people who would abuse our 
system, but acting rashly or in a draconian manner is not the way to 
deal with that problem. There are people who do not fit the strict 
definition of a refugee but who are nonetheless in need of our 
assistance.
<P>
	I think the hon. member is ignoring this group. He is simply 
implying that all failed refugee claimants are somehow charlatans 
or criminals seeking to capitalize on our generosity. This simply is 
not the case. There are some people who do not fit the strict 
convention refugee definition but who still deserve to have their 
cases examined as a humanitarian consideration. It would be 
distinctly un-Canadian to punish these people who have already 
experienced great suffering.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8482"> 8482 </A></B>
<P>
	The definition of a convention refugee is very specific. Some 
individuals may find themselves in a refugee like situation but will 
still not qualify to be protected as refugees. As a compassionate 
country we should keep an eye open for these special cases. While 
it is important that the refugee determination process be governed 
by strict rules, it is equally necessary to have some flexibility and 
room for compassion. I am glad to say that our system allows us 
this latitude.
<P>
	We have some mechanisms in place which help ensure that 
failed refugee claimants who are in genuine trouble do not slip 
through the cracks. There are instances in which a person, though 
not technically a refugee, may face torture or violence if they go 
home. We have a moral obligation to see that does not happen.
<P>
	Moreover, there is also the potential for humanitarian and 
compassionate review of a claimant's application should the 
claimant feel that their case merits special attention due to 
extenuating circumstances. We should continue to be vigilant about 
finding and removing people who do not merit our humanitarian 
consideration. We should not let people linger in the system for 
long periods of time.
<P>
	The key is not to punish people for using the system. Instead we 
need to ensure that the system works effectively and can process 
refugee claimants rapidly. Yes, there will always be those creative 
minds who create ways to financially benefit from any rule and 
regulation established by any level of government. We recognize 
that.
<P>
	The Department of Citizenship and Immigration has recently 
proposed changes that will protect the integrity of the system while 
at the same time speeding up the rate at which claims are 
processed. Bill C-49, for instance, proposes to reduce refugee 
division panels from two members to one. This will allow the IRB 
to schedule hearings more quickly and will permit it to render 
faster decisions.
<P>
	The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration recently 
introduced proposed regulatory changes intended to streamline the 
risk assessment process for failed refugee claimants. Currently risk 
assessments are automatically made to ensure that failed refugee 
claimants will not be at risk if they return to their home country. 
Often this assessment is nothing more than a time consuming 
formality at great expense which is not even requested by the 
client. We have changed that and under the proposed changes the 
risk review will no longer be automatic. Instead failed refugee 
claimants will have to apply. This does not change our 
humanitarian commitment to people who are genuinely in need. 
This will simply ensure that appropriate risk reviews are done 
quickly and efficiently.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	These changes will exclude certain groups such as those 
convicted of serious criminal offences. This will allow the 
government 
<P>
to continue helping legitimate refugees and removing people who 
do not need or deserve our protection.
<P>
	We must be vigilant to ensure that individuals who are found not 
to be convention refugees are treated fairly and with compassion. 
We have programs that do just that. We must continually look for 
positive ways to improve the good system we already have.
<P>
	However, the motion before the House simply does not offer a 
constructive or workable solution. It fails to balance compassion 
with common sense. It fails to strike that fair and just balance 
which is a hallmark of our refugee determination system.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 1</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-66 be amended by adding before line 4 on page 1 the following new 
Clause:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``0.1 The definition of ``federal work, undertaking or business'' in section 2 of the 
Canada Labour Code is amended by adding the following after paragraph (j):</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>but not including any flour mill or other undertaking for the milling of grain;''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wonder if there might be a 
disposition in the House to facilitate the efficiency of debate by 
agreeing that the motions be deemed read and seconded as we go to 
each and every one of the groupings, as you have already clarified.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The House has heard the 
suggestion of the chief government whip. Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, you realize that the official opposition is very pleased to 
address a bill that has taken a lot of our time, but deservedly so, as 
it is an important bill. The idea is to establish a balance in our 
society, since Bill C-66 deals with the whole issue of labour 
relations.
<P>
	The amendment that we propose, and which we believe will get 
the government's support, is based on common sense.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	If we were to ask parliamentarians why, in 1997, flour mills still 
come under federal jurisdiction, we would probably have a hard 
time getting a rational explanation.
<P>
	This amendment was suggested to us by a witness who is very 
knowledgable and very concerned about the situation of flour 
mills. I am referring of course to Ogilvie Mills Ltd., which is 
unionized under the CSN. I want to make things very clear and say 
that, with this amendment, we are proposing that flour mills be 
deemed to come under provincial jurisdiction. In this regard, I 
would like to quote a short excerpt from a submission which is very 
forceful, like anything done by the CSN, and which explains why 
we should, as parliamentarians, as opposition and government 
members, accept such an argument.
<P>
	I am quoting workers from Ogilvie Mills, who made the 
following statement before the parliamentary committee: ``Most 
people who get involved in our labour relations for the first time 
are surprised to find out that mill workers come under the Canada 
Labour Code. As for us, after having been unionized for over 30 
years, we are still wondering about this situation''.
<P>
	They do have a point. Why is that? It is because, before modern 
laws governing labour relations come into effect, the federal 
government used its declaratory power. We know this is not a rare 
occurrence. Indeed, in the past, the federal government used its 
declaratory power a number of times to appropriate jurisdictions, 
which it claimed to be of national interest. So, the federal 
government used its declaratory power to rule that flour mills came 
under its jurisdiction. ``Such an initiative may have been justified 
in an era of world conflicts and protectionism'', said the witness, 
``but not today. Especially since the Americans have gained control 
over most of this production, especially since the Crow's Nest rate 
was abolished and since it is easier to move wheat over the U.S. 
border''.
<P>
	The argument no longer holds; just like beer production-can a 
more eloquent example be ever found?-flour production should 
fall under provincial jurisdiction. Then, the witness added 
something that ought to make the government happy, by saying: 
``No difficult constitutional amendments would be needed; the 
federal government only has to modify the Labour Code or its 
wheat legislation to remove any reference to flour mills''.
<P>
	That is exactly what our amendment proposes, and I hope that 
the parliamentary secretary would nod to show us that he intends to 
accept our reasoning. I still want to use the time I have left to 
remind the House how important this amendment is and that we 
owe it to the Ogilvie employees. These workers, as you know, were 
involved in an extremely long labour dispute, which brings me to 
the connection I want to make between the two issues.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8484"> 8484 </A></B>
<P>
	These Ogilvie employees were the ones who really made us 
aware of the need to have extremely clear and unequivocal 
provisions within the Labour Code concerning replacement 
workers, as my colleague, the hon. member for Mercier, could 
confirm. These workers were on strike for quite a while and some 
violent incidents occurred, which were directly related to the lack 
of protection and the banning of replacement workers.
<P>
	There is no longer any argument, any reason for the mill workers 
to still be subject to the Canada Labour Code. As parliamentarians, 
we could very easily pass this amendment, insert it in Bill C-66 and 
ensure that the flour mills fall under provincial jurisdiction. I think 
that would make things easier for everyone involved.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	It must be pointed out that we do not suggest it is irrelevant to 
afford some protection to a number of workers in the air 
transportation industry, in banking and in other sectors under 
federal jurisdiction. Besides, we all know that the Canada Labour 
Code applies to 10 per cent of the Canadian workforce only.
<P>
	We agree that when the federal government position is based on 
clear and explicit jurisdictions, and when the intent of the 33 
Fathers of Confederation is clear, there should be a clear 
protection. But in the case of the flour mills, I think we should 
accept the request of workers and pass our amendment to the effect 
that they should be under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	This is the intent of our amendment, and I am confident that the 
parliamentary secretary to the labour minister will accept our 
arguments. If not, I certainly hope he will take the floor and explain 
why. He tends to keep nodding, but you know that silence gives 
consent.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
have liked the member opposite to stand up and tell us if he agrees 
with our amendment or, if not, at least why he does not.
<P>
	This revision of the Labour Code should lead to its 
modernization. A minimum condition of modernization should be 
to abolish this clause, whereby the federal government at one time 
used its declaratory power to bring flour mills under federal 
jurisdiction. That was understandable druing the second world war, 
but it is not any more. My colleague for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve 
quoted and read eloquently testimony given by the Ogilvie 
workers.
<P>
	It has to be stated forcefully that this strike, which has weakened 
the union and even the Quebec position in the milling industry, 
would certainly not have lasted as long and a settlement would 
have been reached sooner if Quebec laws had applied.
<P>
	I am thinking more specifically about the antiscab clause. This 
clause was included in the Quebec Labour  Code in 1977 by the 
then Minister of Labour, Pierre-Marc Johnson, and was maintained 
by the Bourassa Liberal government that took power in 1985.
<P>
	Mr. Bourassa himself, who had been subjected to very intense 
pressures from management earlier in the year, told these people 
that social peace was a very precious thing in Quebec and that he 
would not change the labour code. The antiscab provision allows 
for a more rapid settlement of labour disputes. It creates a power 
relationship that forces both parties to come to an agreement more 
rapidly instead of letting the situation deteriorate. Without this 
protection, unions often have to resort to other means that appear to 
be the only ones available to defend their fundamental right to 
organize and to protect the work and working conditions of their 
members.
<P>
	This is one of the provisions that would give this union and flour 
mills an opportunity to benefit from a faster settlement of disputes.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	I said that the minister wanted to modernize the legislation. If 
that is what he wants to do, then he should make his legislation as 
consistent as possible. In this context, flour mills seem really out of 
place because they do not meet any of the criteria under which the 
Privy Council decided, in 1927, that some businesses in Canada 
should come under federal jurisdiction while the rest should come 
under provincial jurisdiction. I remind you that, in this regard, it 
went against the Supreme Court, which had a tendency to say that 
the Canadian government should look after all labour relations 
matters.
<P>
	Therefore, it seems to me that the declaratory power the federal 
government is using is inspired more by this centralizing tendency 
than by the need to be consistent in determining which unions must 
come under federal jurisdiction and which unions must come under 
provincial jurisdiction, in this case, under Quebec's jurisdiction.
<P>
	There are other provisions which union members cannot benefit 
from. For example, pregnant women cannot benefit from the 
precautionary cessation of work provision. We could go on this 
way to show that there is no reason why a business located in 
Quebec cannot benefit from the same labour code as the rest. There 
is absolutely no reason for that.
<P>
	That is why we want the government to correct this anomaly 
which should not exist in this day and age and which caused a 
labour dispute that lasted a long time, that went sour and that gave 
labour relations a bad name, all because of the previous version of 
the Canada Labour Code. We can say right away that it will be even 
worse with the new version if it is adopted in its present form.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we 
resume deliberations on Bill C-66, an act to amend Part I of the 
Canada Labour Code, it is relevant to look back at the purpose of 
the bill, as stated by the minister. He said at the outset that he 
wanted to seek a balance. That was the direction he was going to 
take. It is now obvious that there are many differing opinions on 
what constitutes a balance.
<P>
	In today's fast paced business climate neither employers nor 
employees can afford prolonged disputes that distract from their 
real goals. Workers want job stability, job satisfaction and 
reasonable compensation for their efforts. Employers want a 
competent, reliable and productive workforce. Both sides look to 
us as parliamentarians to give them the tools to settle 
disagreements in an expeditious, cost effective manner.
<P>
	The first and only motion in Group No. 1, standing in the name 
of the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, proposes to 
remove flour mills and other undertakings related to the milling of 
grain from federal jurisdiction. Aside from his party's quest to 
remove all aspects of Quebec life from federal jurisdiction, I am 
sure the hon. member submitted the amendment because of the 15 
month work disruption at the Montreal location of ADM 
Agri-Industries Ltd., otherwise known as the Ogilvie flour mills.
<P>
	The collective agreement between the workers and the original 
owner, John Labatt Ltd., expired January 1992. When the mill was 
sold to the U.S. owner, Archer-Daniels-Midland, in June 1992, a 
new collective agreement had not been signed. The strike, which 
began on June 6, 1994 lasted until September 1995. That was a long 
15 months for everyone concerned.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Members on all sides of the House are concerned when 
prolonged strikes or lockouts occur in their ridings. We in the 
Reform Party are concerned about impacts that strikes or lockouts 
have on workers, employers and Canadians who most often have to 
bear the brunt of the costs of inconveniences when services of 
monopolistic industries are withdrawn.
<P>
	Hon. members will know that my Reform colleagues and I have 
long been concerned over the effects of work stoppages in the west 
coast ports where grain shipments are concerned.
<P>
	In the first session of Parliament my colleague, the hon. member 
for Lethbridge, sponsored a private member's bill that if passed 
would have provided a dispute settlement mechanism to all parties 
involved in the grain transportation and grain handling sectors. Of 
course, I am referring to final offer selection arbitration.
<P>
	When the problems of Ogilvie flour mills were debated in the 
House in May 1995, I suggested that the matter  could have been 
resolved quickly in the Canada Labour Code contained this 
provision. The previous speaker talked about the union breaking 
tactics. If we had given both union and management those tools of 
final offer selection arbitration at that time the 15 months of 
heartache would not have been endured.
<P>
	We see final offer selection arbitration as a tool that is useful to 
both labour and management. When all efforts to solve disputes 
through the regular collective bargaining process have been 
exhausted, final offer selection arbitration should be available to 
the parties.
<P>
	Final offer arbitration is the most effective and impartial means 
of obtaining a solution to the concerns of labour and management 
where an impasse occurs that inflicts significant damage on 
Canadians and on the Canadian economy. It requires both parties to 
negotiate in good faith while keeping in mind their overall interest 
as an organization. It does not prevent either side from achieving a 
deal provided they are being fair and open with one another. In fact, 
there is tremendous pressure on both sides to reach an agreement 
because the arbitrator is in a position to adopt either side's 
proposal.
<P>
	In cases where fundamental issues are at stake, such as 
employment security, an agreement may never occur through 
collective bargaining and a strike or lockout may only make 
matters worse.
<P>
	The best solution is for someone respected by both sides to make 
a decision on the fairness of one proposal for the process to be 
viewed as legitimate to both sides.
<P>
	The answer is to give employees and employers the mechanism 
to resolve their problems without the pressures of strike, lockouts 
or back to work legislation. Oftentimes back to work legislation 
includes final offer selection arbitration.
<P>
	For those reasons I propose amendments to this bill which we 
will debate in Group No. 8. I am sure the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve will recognize that if final offer 
arbitration had been available to the workers at Ogilvie mills, 
months of hardship could have been avoided.
<P>
	The answer is not just to turn grain related matters over to the 
provinces, as the hon. member suggests, but to offer them means to 
solve their problems. The member through his amendment is 
mistaken if he thinks the amendment to the Canada Labour Code 
would automatically exempt flour mills and other milling 
operations from the Canada Labour Code. He seems to have 
forgotten that flour mills and grain elevators have been governed 
by federal law since World War II when they were considered to be 
in the national interest and in fact are protected by the Constitution 
and the Canada Grain Act. No doubt he has just forgotten. I am sure 
he would not want to initiate another round of constitutional talks. 
Obviously he cannot be serious about this amendment.

<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I address the motion put 
forward by the official opposition in Group No. 1, I will say a few 
words about the purpose of Bill C-66 and about the consultation 
process that preceded its introduction.
<P>
	Bill C-66 is the result of extensive consultations with 
representatives of labour and management and other interested 
parties in the context of a review of Part I of the Canada Labour 
Code which began over two years ago. An independent task force 
of industrial relations experts was established to review the current 
code and to recommend legislative changes.
<P>
	Following the release of the task force report entitled ``Seeking a 
Balance'' in February 1996, the Minister of Labour held 
cross-country consultations. These extensive consultations have 
resulted in a bill that is fair and balanced. Its provisions reflect the 
labour and management support for a legislative framework that 
allows them to develop their own solutions to industrial relations 
problems without the need for government intervention or imposed 
third party solutions.
<P>
	There is a clear relationship between a positive labour relations 
environment and a productive viable economy. A stable positive 
labour relations climate is essential if Canada is to meet the 
competitive challenges of the new global economy. Collective 
bargaining legislation should encourage and facilitate co-operative 
labour-management relationships and the adoption of innovative 
workplace practices. We believe Bill C-66 succeeds in meeting 
these goals.
<P>
	With respect to Motion No. 1, the official opposition is seeking 
to exclude flour mills or other undertakings for the milling of grain 
from the application of the Canada Labour Code. As the hon. 
member who has proposed this amendment is aware, the grain 
industry has been declared by Parliament to be, as my colleague 
from Wetaskiwin said, for the general advantage of Canada. As 
such, the industry lies within the federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	I understand there are two declarations by Parliament that affect 
the grain industry in Canada. One is found in the Canada Grain Act 
which establishes the Canadian Grain Commission, and the other is 
found in the Canadian Wheat Board Act. The designation of flour 
mills as works for the general advantage of Canada is found in the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act.
<P>
	Industries declared to be for the general advantage of 
Canada-uranium mining and processing is another one such 
industry-are subject to federal labour jurisdiction even if they are 
situated wholly within one province. Section 2(h) of the Canada 
Labour Code confirms this jurisdictional fact.
<P>
	I believe the hon. member had a specific undertaking and a 
single province in mind when he proposed this amendment. 
However, the grain industry and its related activities extend across 
this vast country and touch every region. The amendment would 
cover all three parts of the code: minimum standards in safety and 
health, the labour relations provisions dealt with, and the part we 
are addressing today.
<P>
	To exclude the grain industry from the application of the code at 
the stroke of a pen, as is proposed, would create chaos and is not 
acceptable. Furthermore, removing the industry from the 
application of the code would not remove it from federal 
jurisdiction. The declarations in the two statutes I cited previously 
would remain.
<P>
	Declarations for the general advantage of Canada cannot be 
partial. Consequently, the amendment would create a vacuum with 
no labour legislation legally applying to the industry. I am sure that 
is not what the hon. member intends. In short, I cannot support this 
proposed amendment.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, you have before you a man who is 
surprised, to say the least, to see the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Labour rising in this House to make the barefaced 
statement that national chaos will result if the federal government 
adopts this amendment. I think that the parliamentary secretary has 
both erred a little, and overdone it a little, since he himself ended 
up with flour on his face when the amendment by the official 
opposition was under discussion.
<P>
	This does, however, give us some idea of where we stand. You 
will agree that, if the government does not even have the little 
courage required to put flour mills under provincial jurisdiction, 
we will not be able to reach agreement. It must be agreed that the 
government will be acting in an authoritarian, even despotic, 
manner, by adopting such a hard line.
<P>
	With this second group of amendments, we will attempt to get 
the parliamentary secretary out from under the flour in which he 
has buried himself, and to get him to understand another level of 
rationality.
<P>
	What we are proposing with these amendments is what was 
asked of us in committee by the representatives of the Public 
Service Alliance of Canada and the Professional Institute of the 
Public Service when they met with us. Both unions asked, in a 
completely rational manner and as mandated by their rank and file, 
to come under the Canada Labour Code, Part I, and not the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act as they do at present.
<P>
	I trust that the government will broaden its horizons a little, be a 
little bolder, and have the courage to acquiesce to this demand. 
Why did the two unions in question ask to be brought under Part I 
of the Canada Labour Code? Because they felt this would give 
them greater leeway in their negotiations, and particularly because 
they felt that  a number of their key priorities relating to the quality 
of everyday life in the workplace could be negotiated immediately.
<P>
	As we know, under the Public Service Staff Relations Act, the 
process is somewhat unwieldy, because Treasury Board is 
involved. Things are not always easy, nor is there much flexibility, 
yet extremely important elements are at stake.
<P>
	So if the government went along with this amendment, which 
was inspired by nothing else than common sense, public service 
employees represented by those two unions would be able to 
bargain directly on the following points: job security, which is not 
an easy matter to negotiate, as I think the hon. member for 
Terrebonne will agree, and protection against technological 
change.
<P>
	As you know, we have been an enlightened and very advanced 
opposition. We have tabled a series of amendments-and we will 
get back to them in due course-that would ensure that no major 
technological changes are introduced in a company or the public 
service without the employees having their say. This will be the 
challenge of the years to come, and there will be further debate on 
this.
<P>
	Both PIPS and PSAC have asked to be covered by the Canada 
Labour Code, and this demand goes back several years. They want 
this first of all because they feel they will be in a far better position 
and have more leeway when negotiating job security, protection 
against technological change and also a third element that is 
crucially important, and I am referring to position classifications 
and task definitions. A fourth group of concerns includes 
appointments, promotions and transfers, which could conviently 
come under the heading career plan.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	In committee it was pointed out that there were two major 
advantages to accepting such a demand. The Canada Labour Code 
allows unions to negotiate their members' working conditions 
more directly. There is no limitation in the code on the rights of 
employees, such as the right to strike or to refer all grievances to a 
third, impartial, party.
<P>
	These are very important considerations, and I hope the 
parliamentary secretary will take a more vigorous and bolder 
approach, as opposed to the almost die hard conservativism he has 
shown so far.
<P>
	In concluding, since I believe my time is running out, I may 
remind you of another of our concerns about this so-called 
modernization, since when the minister spoke in committee and in 
the House about undertaking a review of the Canada Labour Code, 
Part I, he told us it was to modernize labour relations, and of course 
we all agree that labour relations are quite different today from 
what they were in the seventies.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8488"> 8488 </A></B>
<P>
	We tried to deal with this and, personally, as the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and labour relations critic, I tabled a 
motion in the House asking the government to give the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police the right to collective bargaining. The 
connection with the public service as a whole is extremely 
tenuous, since the RCMP has the status of sole employer as far 
as Treasury Board is concerned. Imagine my reaction, imagine my 
consternation when I discovered that the government, totally 
unreasonably and obsessively to some extent I would say, rejected 
such a motion.
<P>
	Is it appropriate that the RCMP should be the only police force in 
Canada without the right to collective bargaining? I was very 
pleased by what I read in <I>Hansard</I>. It says there that the third party 
in the House, the Reform Party, gave its approval, as expressed by 
one of its members. I think the member for Calgary rose to say he 
recognized the situation as discriminatory.
<P>
	We must recall that the RCMP is not claiming the right to strike. 
They are asking for the right to negotiate their working conditions, 
as all police forces do across Canada, with outside arbitration. 
There are those, who are a bit muddled, who say that they already 
have arbitration. In fact, this is the subject of the entire rather weak 
speech by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General, 
who rose in this House to say that an internal negotiation system 
known as divisional representation already existed.
<P>
	Obviously, for those who are looking in from the outside and for 
those who know a little about labour relations, it is like a sort of 
small shop union, which does not provide a solid base for 
collectively negotiating working conditions.
<P>
	I hope the parliamentary secretary will rise to explain the reason 
for the fear. If the Labour Code is useful in providing a balance in 
labour relations, as the minister says, why not include the 
employees of the public service who want to be included and who 
have given their union representatives a mandate. I am thinking of 
course of the Professional Institute, the Alliance and the 
spokespersons of the RCMP. We are not talking about speculation 
or guessing, these are duly authorized union spokespersons, people 
who have mandates.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	They came to see us in committee, and explained that, as regards 
the five indicators I mentioned concerning job security, protection 
against technological change, position classification and career 
advancement, ``We think it would be more beneficial for our 
members, and this is a motivating factor: it is significant for an 
employer to be covered by part I of the Canada Labour Code''.
<P>
	I hope that, in all lucidity, the minister and the parliamentary 
secretary will rise in the House, thank the opposition for the acuity 
of its remarks and support the amendments before the House today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the comments of my colleague from 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. He tried to put the case that somehow 
the RCMP is at a terrible disadvantage because we do not allow its 
members to join a union.
<P>
	One very important fact has escaped my colleague. By no means 
does the majority of members of that force want the option of 
joining a union. That has been made very clear in the House several 
times. Perhaps those were days when my friend should have been 
paying attention and was not.
<P>
	Had he paid attention I am sure he would have picked up on that 
fact. It has been brought to the House several times by me and by 
my colleague from Calgary. It is a well known fact. I have had 
several representations from members of the RCMP in my 
constituency and elsewhere who say that the divisional 
representative situation is working just fine for them.
<P>
	I also find it interesting that my colleague would like to pick and 
choose. He would like to say that the flour mill workers, for 
instance, should be taken out of federal jurisdiction and another 
group of people should be moved into federal jurisdiction. The 
more legislation we create in this place, the more need there is for 
legislation.
<P>
	If we come up with a plan whereby members of the RCMP could 
join a union, what good will the union do? Will it give them the 
right to strike, or will they immediately be declared an essential 
service? If so, what has been gained? We would have passed two 
pieces of legislation, one really nullifying the other.
<P>
	I do not want to belabour the point so I will not take up the full 
10 minutes to make my point.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to take part in the debate on Motion No. 2 regarding Bill C-66, and 
in particular on RCMP members' right to unionization and to 
collective bargaining.
<P>
	I have, on a number of occasions, taken part in the debate and 
asked that the Canada Labour Code be amended in order to allow 
RCMP members to unionize, like any other federal public servants, 
and like any other police force in Canada. Members of these police 
forces have the right to unionize. Why deny members of the RCMP 
this legitimate right?
<P>
	The International Labour Organization gives all wage earners 
without exception the right to unionize. But in Canada, a country 
espousing the principles of the ILO, a police force that is very 
important to the country is denied this right.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8489"> 8489 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	I think that labour relations at the RCMP would benefit from 
collective bargaining, discussion of working conditions by the 
parties, and a collective agreement. I think that there would be 
advantages to RCMP management and members alike. I am in 
favour of the RCMP's right to unionization and collective 
bargaining.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the official opposition has submitted 
two related motions to make part I of the Canada Labour Code 
applicable to the Professional Institute of the Public Service, its 
members and the employers of those members, and the Public 
Service Alliance of Canada, its members and the employers of 
those members.
<P>
	At the outset let me say that we have some difficulty 
understanding the purpose of the motions. It would appear that the 
purpose is to repeal the Public Service Staff Relations Act or, at the 
very least, significantly reduce the numbers of federal public 
service employees subject to the act. If that is the case-and let me 
say that such a proposal is unacceptable to the government-in 
essence these motions would bring 80 per cent of the public 
servants currently covered by the Public Service Staff Relations 
Act under part I of the code, leaving 20 per cent of the public 
service represented by the 14 other unions under the public service 
collective bargaining regime.
<P>
	Quite frankly we fail to see the rationale behind these motions 
which would effectively split public servants into two groups: one 
covered by the private sector labour relations regime and the other 
covered by the public sector labour relations regime. The basis for 
such distinction escapes us.
<P>
	While the task force established to review part I of the code did 
not address the issue of applying this statute to the federal public 
sector, it did note the potential for achieving benefits by 
consolidating the Public Service Staff Relations Board and the 
Canada Labour Relations Board. Although a merger of these two 
tribunals is not being proposed at this time, value and efficiencies 
could be realized in an administrative consolidation of the private 
and public sector boards.
<P>
	Among the benefits that could be achieved through such 
rationalization we could easily identify cost savings for the boards, 
savings to the parties who would benefit from a single source, and 
harmonization of procedures which would eliminate unnecessary 
diversity in dealing with essentially similar topics and broader 
based coverage.
<P>
	Although collective bargaining in the private sector and in the 
public sector have much in common, there are important 
distinctions which would require careful  consideration before any 
decision to harmonize the two regimes is made.
<P>
	In the private sector labour legislation is designed to regulate the 
relationship between private parties with economic power being 
the main disciplining mechanism. In the public sector the 
legislation is largely designed to take into account the 
government's role in protecting the public interest. Such 
fundamental differences have resulted in the application of 
separate labour relations regimes to govern employees in most 
Canadian jurisdictions.
<P>
	The public service has been through some significant changes in 
the past 10 years as many of its activities have been removed to 
new forms of agencies outside the traditional public service or have 
been simply transferred to private or crown corporations. In those 
two last situations the collective bargaining of employees affected 
by such transfers is currently being governed by part I of the code.
<P>
	Some would argue that these changes in the nature of the public 
service are the most persuasive reasons for revisiting the rationale 
for the creation and maintenance of the two separate legislative 
regimes. However we have to be careful before rushing into 
harmonization. Such an exercise would require extensive 
consultations of all the interested parties.
<P>
	The minister has already expressed his intention to pursue 
further the analysis of the amalgamation and harmonization 
concepts with interested colleagues and parties.
<P>
	For the reasons just outlined we ask the members of the House to 
reject both Motions Nos. 2 and 3 as they raise complex issues that 
were obviously overlooked by the official opposition and would 
require further study.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am always 
pleased to speak on motions such as the ones at report stage of Bill 
C-66. The motions were hopefully introduced to improve the bill, 
but from our perspective we do not see much being improved by 
the motions in front of us at the moment.
<P>
	One of the things I would like to talk about this morning is the 
concept of contracts with unions should the government divest 
itself of a department, for example air navigation which will be 
taken from the government and put into a not for profit 
organization called Nav Can.
<P>
	I have a problem with the contract with employees in situations 
such as these flowing through to the new employer, not just Nav 
Can but all situations. We are trying to achieve flexibility in 
management-labour negotiations and responsibilities. If we take 
the contract that exists today between the government and its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8490"> 8490 </A></B>
<P>
employees we find it is fossilized, if I may use that term.  It needs 
to be brought up to date with modern management techniques.
<P>
	By entrenching in other sectors such as Nav Can and perhaps the 
new agricultural food inspection agency, the contract that exists 
today between the government and public servants guarantees the 
problems inherent in the contract will remain inherent in the 
relationship in the new organization. It will prevent the 
organization from evolving and improving its management 
efficiency.
<P>
	We must move to the concept of merit being one of the major 
criteria by which we evaluate the compensation package we 
provide to employees. As we open negotiations with the federal 
public service and government I hope the government recognizes 
the need for merit, the need to compensate people according to 
their production and contribution and not according to age or 
number of years of experience regardless of whether or not they are 
productive.
<P>
	The type of motion would continue to entrench the one salary 
pays everybody, one shoe fits all employees. That cannot be 
tolerated much longer in the new competitive world we are 
entering into.
<P>
	I attended a conference last September in Victoria of people 
from around the world, for example the auditor general of the 
United Kingdom and people from the United States, Australia, 
New Zealand and other parts of the world. We were discussing 
accountability in government. It became quite apparent that 
Canada lags way behind the United Kingdom when it comes to 
being visionary in the way it will improve the efficiency of 
government in the years ahead.
<P>
	The United Kingdom realizes that the role of government 
primarily is to develop public policy. The implementation of public 
policy can quite easily be handled by other institutions such as not 
for profit institutions, competitive institutions and private sector 
institutions, so the role of government is reduced to its real 
function of development of public policy.
<P>
	As the delivery of public services have been spun off into 
competitive environments, it recognizes the need to protect the 
current employee and therefore says that the currently existing 
contract shall flow through to protect current employees in the new 
institution they are working for. In Canada it could be Nav Can.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	The organization by which they are employed has the 
opportunity to set new terms, new employment conditions and new 
wage rates for newly hired employees. This is a wonderful way to 
reach a compromise. It ensures that current employees are 
protected and are slowly introduced to a competitive environment, 
giving the competitive institution providing the service the 
flexibility to deal with its employees in a much more enlightened 
environment, and giving them the opportunity to introduce the 
concept of merit that  those who work hard get more and those who 
work less get less.
<P>
	That is how the private sector is changing. That is why when so 
many businesses downsize the employees who lose their jobs 
create new little home based businesses or perhaps larger 
businesses. Through their flexible working conditions they are able 
to thrive and prosper in a flexible environment that allows them to 
make profit, compared with the monolithic dinosaur for which they 
were working before.
<P>
	These motions are regressive. They prevent the 
worker-management relationship from evolving into a much more 
competitive and dynamic relationship. Opportunities to improve 
the working environment, to recognize the efficient and hard 
working employee and to compensate people who deserve the best 
compensation are being denied through these motions.
<P>
	That is why the Reform Party is opposed to the motions we are 
dealing with in group No. 2. The rationale I have found in my 
experience is that we need to give flexibility, opportunity, 
motivation and desire to every worker so they do the best they can. 
When they are locked into one contract that fits all they lose 
motivation. They find they cannot break through and be the best 
they can be.
<P>
	I hope the government, not only in Bill C-66 but in its 
relationship with its employees, will recognize the need for new 
enlightened management-labour relationships is long overdue.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all along we have noticed the government's lack of 
co-operation on amendments dictated by common sense.
<P>
	We are speaking on behalf of the witnesses who testified before 
us. They told us that in general this bill contained interesting 
things. We never pushed partisan politics to the point of saying that 
this piece of legislation was altogether bad; however, we believe it 
does not go  far enough, it could have contained what we already 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8492"> 8492 </A></B>
<P>
have in Quebec, very clear provisions dealing with unfair practices 
regarding replacement workers.
<P>
	We would have liked this bill to be more explicit with regard to 
technological change and board membership.
<P>
	Why not have made sure the wording was clear? As a lawyer, 
Mr. Speaker, and a brilliant one at that, you know how important it 
is for a piece of legislation to contain provisions which are very 
clear, which cannot give rise to ambiguous interpretation on the 
part of tribunals, either administrative tribunals or ordinary courts 
of law, and we would have liked the way members are appointed, 
not so much how they are appointed as whom they represent, to be 
extremely clear.
<P>
	We would have liked to be able to proceed from lists submitted 
by both management and labour, along the lines of what we had 
suggested during consideration of Bill C-64, which established the 
Human Rights Tribunal and reviewed the Employment Equity Act. 
We had asked for lists which could have been used by the 
government.
<P>
	You will understand that the minute it becomes clear, the minute 
it requires a commitment, the government tries to evade the issue. 
All the amendments in the third group follow the same logic: We 
say that it is true that, in the whole issue of labour relations, we 
should, as legislators, seek some balance between the rights and 
obligations of the employer on the one hand, and the rights and 
obligations of the unions on the other hand, keeping in mind that in 
our society we recognize the right to strike, as the ultimate pressure 
tactic, but according to very clear guidelines.
<P>
	What we were trying to do, regarding the board and some 
governance issues like the creation of new tribunals, as allowed by 
Bill C-64, regarding compensation for their full or part time 
members, regarding travel and entertainment expenses, was give 
the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development the 
power to examine all the questions relating to the Canada Labour 
Code, so that it could study the whole matter and hold hearings.
<P>
	I think this is a very healthy reflex we have always had since 
becoming the official opposition in this House, to make sure that 
the committees are involved in making decisions on a number of 
questions.
<P>
	Never did we think an amendment like this one could obstruct 
the work of the Canada Labour Relations Board and the various 
tribunals that will be created; never did we intend or think, even in 
the boldest of our amendments, that this could be a stalling tactic 
preventing us from having a diligent board and a speedy process.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Let me give you an example. During the clause by clause 
consideration of the bill, I was with the hon.  member for Mercier, 
who has 20 or so years of experience in the field of labour relations. 
Not many parliamentarians in this House can match that.
<P>
	I would like to remind you that, when, as the official opposition, 
we were presented with a provision which we really felt would 
enable the Canada industrial relations board, formerly the Canada 
Labour Relations Board, to operate much faster and much more 
efficiently, we gave it our unconditional support-as the minutes 
will testify-because, when the clause by clause study of Bill C-66 
first began, we as parliamentarians realized that there were a 
number of concerns about the board.
<P>
	Some stakeholders, labour in particular, felt the internal 
workings of the board itself were cumbersome. We welcomed with 
great pleasure and enthusiasm the preliminary hearings on 
disclosure of evidence. I sense a certain reaction from you, Mr. 
Speaker, because you are very concerned about anything that 
relates to the law. We are very pleased by the fact that the board can 
sit with only one person. Obviously, when there is only one person 
involved, the issues discussed are very specific.
<P>
	Therefore, anything that helps streamline the process will get the 
unequivocal support of the official opposition. For the sake of the 
board's legitimacy, integrity and effectiveness, it would be a good 
thing if, as regards the issue of travel and living expenses-and the 
makeup of a panel when deemed appropriate by the chairperson, 
since it is a prerogative of the chairperson to convene such a panel 
and to direct its composition according to very specific 
instructions-the human resources development committee could 
take part in the process.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary will correct me if I am wrong, but it 
seems to me that, during the last election campaign, government 
members, that is the Liberals, said they hoped that House 
committees would play a greater role, that parliamentary 
committees would be much more closely involved in the 
decision-making process than they currently are.
<P>
	This is precisely the underlying philosophy behind the 
amendments now before the House. Is democracy not something 
that is very healthy? Is it not reassuring for those who are watching 
us to know that the official opposition hopes that House 
committees, which are made up of duly elected members of 
Parliament, can be involved in a number of decisions that are 
important to the governance of this country? This is what we are 
talking about.
<P>
	Again, on a number of occasions, we have been very supportive 
of any clause in the bill that streamlines the process, so as to 
alleviate the backlog of cases before the Canada Labour Relations 
Board.
<P>
	I simply cannot imagine the government rejecting these 
amendments, since they are directly inspired by the Liberal Party's 
philosophy, as stated in the red book.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad 
to speak on the motions in Group No. 3, which includes several 
motions, following the speech made by my hon. colleague from 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	First of all, I want to say that I find this stage a bit restrictive, 
since the human resources development committee considered this 
piece of legislation at an almost unacceptable pace, since we were 
deprived of a true second reading stage and since we have now 
reached report stage without having had the opportunity to criticize 
the bill as much as it deserves.
<P>
	The bill contains provisions concerning the representativeness of 
the board. The minister clearly stated his willingness to have a 
representational board. However, it is extremely disquieting to read 
in this bill a clause that says: ``The members of the Board other 
than the Chairperson and the Vice-Chairpersons are to be appointed 
by the Governor in Council on the recommendation of the Minister 
after consultation by the Minister with the organizations 
representative of employees or employers that the Minister 
considers appropriate''-therefore, the minister can appoint whom 
he pleases-``to hold office during good behaviour for terms not 
exceeding three years each, subject to removal by the Governor in 
Council at any time for cause''.
<P>
	If what we want is a representational board, we have to stipulate 
right from the start that the organizations involved will appoint 
their own representatives. Otherwise, the board will never be able 
to claim to be representational and the minister will have to eat 
humble pie.
<P>
	I think it was extremely important to clarify this particular point, 
because the government would have us believe that this will be a 
representational board, but it is even more important, as the hon. 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve mentioned, to ensure that 
parliamentarians make their presence felt and exert continuing 
control over this new organization, this newly appointed Canada 
Industrial Relations Board.
<P>
	There is one amendment in this group of motions that I have to 
criticize. It was put forward by the third party who wants board 
expenses to be reimbursed in equal parts by the parties to the 
dispute. This provision is extremely dangerous since the board will 
have to carry out its duties whenever needed and not only 
according to the capacity of the parties to pay.
<P>
	This would introduce an unspeakable bias, because it could very 
well be that a small union with few members, that was able to 
emerge only after a very long fight, may not be able to afford the 
services of the board, while the employer or the group of employers 
could easily afford them. This would fly in the face of common 
sense, because the search for a harmonious settlement or, at least, a 
final settlement in accordance with the the rules  governing labour 
relations, as well as the board's judicious intervention, cannot be 
dependent upon the parties' ability to pay. There is something 
absolutely absurd and regressive in this idea which, I think, is not 
even worth considering.
<P>
	The provisions included in this grouping lead me to talk about 
another amendment which has been put forward by our party. This 
amendment to clause 34 is designed to allow the board, in cases 
where an employer representative has been appointed, to revoke 
the appointment of this representative for reasons other than what 
is specified in the bill. I invite the minister's representative to listen 
carefully because this small amendment could be most useful.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	In clause 34, on page 15, the bill specifies a reason for revoking 
an appointment. It reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On application by one or more employers of employees in the bargaining unit, the 
Board may, if it is satisfied that the employer representative is no longer qualified to 
act in that capacity, revoke the appointment of the employer representative and 
appoint a new representative.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It need not be because the employer representative is no longer 
qualified to act in that capacity. This requirement could complicate 
things for the board. It could be for another reason, which should be 
left to the board's judgment, without requiring it on top of that to be 
critical of someone that should not be there, but not for the reason 
that he is no longer qualified.
<P>
	I make this comment in the hope that the minister's 
parliamentary secretary will take note. It is a minor point, but one 
which could be useful to the board's work.
<P>
	I will take the few minutes remaining to me to return to this 
deeply disturbing issue of the board not being representational. The 
board is being transformed, supposedly to make it more 
representational. But, if we rely on the terms on the bill, and not on 
the good faith of the minister, the board will not be 
representational.
<P>
	I predict a rocky road for this board that is nonetheless so vital to 
labour relations in Canada. When the minister has full latitude to 
decide who will make up the board, and then to pronounce it 
representational, how can anyone think that a employer or 
employee organization would feel it was well represented when 
someone from this organization could appear on the board, unless it 
was someone appointed by the organization? All this is possible 
under the bill as it now stands. It makes no sense at all. I can tell 
you that I was not at all surprised by all the intense lobbying from 
organizations on this issue.
<P>
	There is still time for the government to redeem itself, but it 
seems to me that the fact that the board is not representational is a 
very serious obstacle, when it has been announced like this, and 
when they want to transform its role, as they are doing here.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
support the motion tabled by the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, especially where it concerns the 
CLRB, the Canada Labour Relations Board.
<P>
	At one time I wrote to the minister responsible for this board 
about the problems facing this body, the lack of leadership shown 
by the chairman and the lack of representative members on the 
board. That is why I support this motion, which asks the minister to 
appoint board members from lists provided by management and 
labour.
<P>
	In Quebec we do not have a labour relations board. We have an 
office of the labour commissioner-general. So we have one person 
who hands down a decision. However, we do have grievance 
adjudicators, who are appointed from lists submitted by employers 
and the unions.
<P>
	I think this would also be a way to limit the use of patronage 
appointments, thus giving the board far more credibility with 
labour and management.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	I would also like to point out that unfortunately, this bill contains 
no provisions for federally regulated businesses concerning the 
preventive withdrawal of pregnant women, especially the many 
pregnant women in the federal public service. We are not 
discussing part II of the Canada Labour Code, but amendments to 
part I.
<P>
	Nevertheless, I want to emphasize the need for passing 
legislation as soon as possible concerning the preventive 
withdrawal of women. I know that a petition to that effect is being 
circulated throughout Quebec.
<P>
	It will soon be March 8, which is International Women's Day. As 
you know, women are becoming increasingly aware of this 
fundamental right, which all women have in Quebec in provincially 
regulated businesses. I fail to see how a woman working for the 
provincial government can have this right while a woman in the 
same building who works for the federal public service does not. I 
will continue to insist on this in the weeks to come.
<P>
	I also support other demands put forward by my colleagues from 
Mercier and Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, especially the need for 
including provisions dealing with technological change in the 
Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	There is some legislation in Quebec that contains very clear 
provisions on technological change, but these should also be 
included at the federal level. I know that many unions have been 
able to negotiate very clear cut and advanced provisions on 
technological change. However, not all unions are in a position to 
negotiate such provisions, hence the need for providing specific 
provisions on technological change in the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	Once again, I wish to commend the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve on the fantastic job he has done on the 
subject as the official opposition's labour critic. Congratulations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
now debating Group No. 3 which contains amendments proposed 
by the Reform Party.
<P>
	I would like to speak specifically to Motion No. 5. The Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development should have some 
scrutiny over the remuneration paid to the CLRB. The main 
estimates for 1996-97 show that the total program budget for the 
CLRB is $8,791,000. That budget is not broken down enough to 
show much detail. By bringing this to the board it would allow 
parliamentarians to scrutinize how the money is spent and on what 
it is spent: how much of it is wages, how much is travel, how much 
is expenses, et cetera.
<P>
	Further, a motion suggests that part time members of the CLRB 
should be absorbed by the parties that are involved in the dispute. 
That should apply only to part time members and would go a long 
way in helping parties resolve their problems themselves rather 
than bringing so many decisions to the board. At least it would not 
be overloading the taxpayer to settle one argument after another.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Reform supports Motion No. 5. We agree that the board should 
have some scrutiny and knowledge of where the taxpayers' money 
is being spent in this particular area. We are not interested in 
micro-management but we are interested in the overall picture. If 
the matter did come to the standing committee it would at least 
give us an opportunity to question departmental officials.
<P>
	There was a lot of talk in committee regarding the certification 
of unions and whether that can be accomplished for off site workers 
with or without their permission. Can it be accomplished only 
when a majority of the workers agree on the certification of a union 
or if the CLRB can decide when there was interference or at least 
undue pressure put on the employees.
<P>
	To back up my point, recently there was a case where the 
majority of the people did not support the formation and 
certification of a union but the board ruled in favour of the union 
because the company suggested that the formation of a union might 
jeopardize jobs and it might have to shut down some of its 
operations. The board ruled in favour of the union and the union 
was certified without a majority of employee members wanting it. 
That is wrong. It is against our democratic principles. I believe that 
if a majority of the employees in any operation would like to certify 
a union then they should be allowed to do so. The key word here is 
majority.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8495"> 8495 </A></B>
<P>
	There are several other amendments in Group No. 3 that I would 
be pleased to speak to at a later date.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the official opposition has put forward 
motions that would give the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development a role in the remuneration of board 
members, the establishment of regional board offices and the 
tabling of the annual report with respect to the information 
obtained under the Corporations and Labour Unions Returns Act.
<P>
	Bill C-66 reflects the consensus of the labour management 
working group and the recommendations of the Sims task force 
with respect to the establishment of a new representational Canada 
Industrial Labour Relations Board.
<P>
	The new board is structured to ensure effective and efficient 
administration of the code and to better reflect the labour and 
management communities it serves across the country. With 
respect to the remuneration of board members, as is the case with 
other governor in council appointees, remuneration and fees will be 
set by the governor in council.
<P>
	GIC positions are evaluated using a position classification plan 
which ensures that appropriate relativities are maintained between 
different levels of responsibility not only within a given 
organization but between organizations. It allows for outside and 
inside compensation relativity comparisons and application of the 
principle of salary equity. Such factors could not be ensured if the 
remuneration of the board members were to be determined through 
a different process from other governor in council appointees.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-66 as drafted authorizes the board to establish regional 
offices that the chairperson considers necessary for the proper 
performance of the board's mandate. I fail to see any rationale for 
giving a standing committee of the House a role in determining 
what is strictly an operational issue.
<P>
	Motion No. 50, the filing of the CALURA report with respect to 
the Corporations and Labour Unions Returns Act. There is a 
requirement in the act for the minister responsible to table a report 
in Parliament. Standing Order 32(5) already provides that where a 
report is provided to Parliament pursuant to a statutory obligation it 
is deemed to have been referred to the appropriate committee.
<P>
	Motion No. 6, expenses of part time members. My colleague in 
the Reform Party seeks to introduce in the code the cost recovery 
concept, but only with respect to expenses incurred by the part time 
representative members of the board. To require the parties to 
reimburse the expenses of the part time representative members 
would impose a financial burden on small  employers as well as on 
individual employees who wish to exercise their fundamental 
rights or seek redress of unfair labour practices. Such financial 
barriers would limit the benefits of this new representational 
structure of the board to those parties who can afford it.
<P>
	Motion No. 9, revocation of employer representative. The 
official opposition is also asking to modify the provision in Bill 
C-66 which would allow the board at the request of one or more 
employers to revoke the designation of an employer representative 
in the longshoring industry if the board is satisfied that the 
employer representative is no longer qualified to act in that 
capacity.
<P>
	This provision was included in Bill C-66 in order to address the 
current lack of explicit statutory authority to change employer 
representatives, an issue which was brought to the attention of the 
task force by the employers active in the longshoring industry in St. 
Lawrence River ports. No views or positions were put forward by 
the unions involved in the geographical certification regime in 
those ports with respect to this provision. Quite frankly, we fail to 
understand the rationale for this motion.
<P>
	Motion No. 45, certification as remedy. With respect to the 
motion by my colleague from the Reform Party to delete clause 46 
of Bill C-66 which authorizes the Canada Industrial Relations 
Board to issue a certification order as remedy for employer unfair 
labour practices, I would like to underline once again that this is a 
recommendation of the task force. While in the majority of cases 
existing remedies in the code for unfair labour practices are 
sufficient to discourage violations or to redress illegitimate actions, 
in some cases employee efforts to unionize are met with vigorous 
employer opposition tactics such as firing of known union 
supporters.
<P>
	Such illegitimate acts may not only put a chill on organizing 
efforts, they may make it impossible to measure union support 
because of workers' fears of retaliation. With the exception of the 
Alberta board, labour boards in Canada have the statutory 
discretion to certify an applicant trade union when employer tactics 
are such that the true wishes of the employee cannot be determined 
by holding a representation vote. Labour boards exercise this 
discretion cautiously and use certification to remedy only the most 
egregious cases of employer misconduct.
<P>
	The board will retain the discretion to hold a representation vote 
in any application. However, it will have the means to remedy these 
exceptional cases where employer misconduct has made it 
impossible to determine the true wishes of the employees by 
holding a representation vote.
<P>
	On a related issue, we have heard the view expressed that the 
Canada Labour Code should provide for a mandatory 
representation vote. I would like to point out  that the Sims task 
force studied this issue in detail. The task force was not persuaded 
that the card base system is an ineffective way of gauging 
employee wishes with respect to certification applications. The 
task force found that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8496"> 8496 </A></B>
<P>
timeliness is important in dealing with certification applications 
and noted that the practical impediments to timely votes in the 
geographically extended federal jurisdiction and the cost of such 
votes cannot be ignored and concluded that no legislative 
amendment was warranted.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	Motion No. 49 is with respect to off site workers. The Reform 
Party is also seeking to require the board to obtain the consent of 
individual off site workers prior to providing their names and 
addresses to an applicant trade union. This provision of the bill has 
been the subject of some controversy which has been fuelled 
primarily by a poor understanding of its purpose and scope.
<P>
	Contrary to what some of it intimated, this provision is in no way 
intended to give trade unions physical access to the private homes 
of off site workers which without the workers' consent would 
clearly violate their rights to privacy.
<P>
	As recommended by the task force, under this new provision the 
board will be responsible for determining under what 
circumstances the names and addresses of off site workers will be 
provided in order that the union may communicate with them by 
mail, by telephone or by electronic means. The board must specify 
in the order the conditions to be met by the trade union to ensure 
the protection of privacy and the safety of the employees 
concerned.
<P>
	We ask the members to support clause 50 of Bill C-66. As 
drafted it strikes a fair balance between the rights of the off site 
workers to exercise their freedom of association and their rights to 
privacy and safety.
<P>
	Motion No. 54 is with respect to transfer of appropriations. The 
Minister of Labour has put forward an amendment with respect to a 
transitional matter. Adoption of Motion No. 54 will allow 
unexpended appropriations for the current Canada Labour 
Relations Board to be transferred to the new board when it is 
established. This will permit the new board to be established 
without undue delay and ensure there is no interruption in the 
administration of part I of the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I look at 
the motions in Group No. 3, I must state that I cannot agree with 
my hon. colleague who tried to speak on behalf of the Reform 
Party, which seems to be one of those things the Liberals think they 
are good at. I would rather that they try to justify the legislation 
they bring forward, but I realize that can be hard. Surely we can 
speak for ourselves and we hope they would justify their position.
<P>
	Motion No. 7 requires the Canada Industrial Relations Board to 
seek approval from the human resources development committee 
on the location of its head office and regional offices. This the type 
of blatant political interference we want to stay away from. I 
cannot think of any reason whatsoever that the HRD committee 
would be in command of better knowledge, better decision making 
ability or more information as to where these offices should be 
located than the institution itself.
<P>
	That is why the Reform Party, legitimately and with common 
sense, is opposed to this type of motion. Politics has no real place 
in the management of allowing these boards to do their own jobs. 
Do we in the House of Commons think we are going to get into 
micromanagement right down to where the offices are going to be 
located, how much rent they are going to pay, how much square 
footage per employee they will have, how many telephone lines 
they are going to put in? Surely we would be able to delegate some 
authority. It seems absolutely preposterous that we would reserve 
this for ourselves, that we alone could make this type of decision. It 
is commons sense that we would oppose this motion. I hope 
everyone else would do the same.
<P>
	Motion No. 9 of the bill would allow the CIRB to revoke the 
appointment of an employer representative if it believed the 
representative no longer qualified to act, et cetera. I am a little 
concerned about the one sidedness of this motion. It would allow 
the CIRB to revoke the appointment of an employer person on the 
board but it says absolutely nothing about a union representative on 
the board. This type of imbalance in legislation is what we do not 
want.
<P>
	Again, with common sense and with a normal type of 
representation in this House, the Reform Party says surely this type 
of motion does not belong in the legislation on the books of 
Canada. Therefore we legitimately oppose this motion.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	I have a concern about Motion No. 45, which deletes the section 
allowing certification of a union without the majority support. I am 
concerned about the House getting involved in legislation giving 
power to the CIRB to basically be its own judge, jury and 
execution. This is the type of information that we see coming 
forward in Motion No. 45.
<P>
	When I look at Motion No. 49, it is not a bad motion, giving an 
off site worker the option of having names and locations provided 
to the union representative and organizers. I am opposed to the 
Liberal position that the CIRB, again in its wisdom of being judge, 
jury and executioner, will be given the right to determine on what 
basis private information is going to be given to a third party.
<P>
	I understand that there has been a study done by the government. 
It has spent a significant number of dollars,  I understand about 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8497"> 8497 </A></B>
<P>
$600,000, to study this type of information. It is still waiting for 
that report to come back. However, government has decided to 
proceed, to go ahead with the legislation anyway, rather than 
waiting for any kind of return on its investment.
<P>
	Speaking to this issue, I find it very disconcerting that time and 
time again in this House we find that individual rights are being 
trampled on. The legislation would give the CIRB the right to pass 
on the names without the person's having any real input, saying 
``no, I do not want that to happen''.
<P>
	Is that not much different from when the government introduced 
its gun legislation and gave the peace officers the right to search 
and to seize without a search warrant? We see this type of 
legislation creep in in various other areas.
<P>
	We are trampling all over individual rights with this type of 
legislation. We are doing it again in Bill C-66. If this government 
has its way, it will do that whenever it wants. Canadians will rise up 
and say ``it is time that these guys got out of here and we put in 
somebody who does recognize that individual rights are there for a 
reason''. That is why we are opposed to this motion.
<P>
	The acrimony that can exist between management and unions in 
the event of a strike can be quite serious. It is our position to do 
everything we can to try to foster harmony and to bring that broken 
relationship together again so that management and labour can 
continue to produce goods and services to earn a living.
<P>
	If we think the CIRB will be the font of all knowledge, be 
endowed with wisdom beyond the average man, be given powers 
that are vague, undetermined and yet very significant, and if we 
think these people will be able to do this type of job as a 
middleman, especially if it happens to be filled with patronage 
appointments by Liberals who are passed over or who did not win 
the election, we would find it rather difficult to put any credibility 
in the board whatsoever.
<P>
	Therefore the Reform Party and common sense say surely this 
bill which says that this information can be passed to the unions 
under certain circumstances should be changed to allow it provided 
that the people agree.
<P>
	Otherwise we will find that there will be a backlash down the 
road. It may be a backlash that the government does not come back 
after the election. Would that not be nice? It would be nice. Perhaps 
the government would have to reconsider.
<P>
	Motion No. 50 would have the corporation returns act tabled in 
the House. I understand that our hon. colleagues from the separatist 
party want it referred to the HRD committee. I imagine that would 
be a matter of course. If we see a return tabled in the House we 
would, as a matter of course, refer it to the individual committee. I 
do not know exactly what my separatist friends are trying to 
achieve by this motion.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	However, it may be like all the rest of the motions they have 
proposed which basically are to disrupt the entire management of 
the government and the affairs of Canada. I will just leave it at that.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, members of Reform believe Motion No. 
11 in Group No. 4 will have a beneficial effect on this legislation.
<P>
	Let us look back at what the minister had hoped to accomplish. 
His aim was to seek a balance. The more we see of the legislation, 
as he outlined it, the more we see that there needs to be a balance, 
yet he has not attained that.
<P>
	In the area of successor rights, we have suggested that section 
47.3 of the bill, which relates specifically to  airline industries, 
should be deleted. That is pretty self-explanatory. The Sims report 
does not mention successor rights. This whole bill seems to have 
been drafted after the recommendations in the Sims report and yet 
there was no reference to successor rights in the Sims report. I 
wonder where the minister came up with this idea.
<P>
	The successor rights package is a wide ranging provision. It goes 
all the way down to baggage handling, telephone services and 
would interfere with existing collective agreements. For those 
reasons, Reform supports the deletion of section 47.3.
<P>
	The people who provide the ground services to the airlines, for 
example, can have contracts with a number of carriers. That might 
mean that a truck driver who was supplying services to one, two, 
three or as many as seven different employers could have as many 
rates of pay. It is an untenable situation to put any employee in. 
They would spend more time in the day keeping track of who they 
worked for and what the pay rate was than they would accomplish 
in doing what they were really there to do in the first place.
<P>
	Reform amendments 41 and 51 are consequential amendments 
necessitated by the foregoing motions.
<P>
	I think it is extremely important that there is a balance set up 
between management and labour. If the scales are tipped too far in 
either direction there is going to be acrimony. We certainly are not 
in favour of one side having a huge advantage over the other.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	I commend the minister for what he has set out to do. His goal is 
to seek a balance. What the Reform Party has suggested in its 
amendments would do exactly that.
<P>
	The minister will say that the motion which the Reform Party 
has put would specifically apply to the pre-board security screening 
service. That is not important. It is not necessary because of the 
arrangements which are in place between the airports and Transport 
Canada. The second part of the amendment gives cabinet the 
authority to make regulations designating any other service or any 
industry which would have to comply with same successor rights 
provisions.
<P>
	We have noticed in this legislation, as in any legislation which 
has been brought in by the government, that the governor in council 
has been given sweeping powers. We realize the governor in 
council has to have some latitude. Not every little thing should be 
brought back to Parliament for ratification or discussion. We 
recognize this is an accepted way of doing business in any 
legislature in Canada-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, you still have about four and a half

	<B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
feel I must share with all of my colleagues in this House the 
concern felt by the francophone community of eastern Ontario at 
the Health Services Restructuring Commission's recommendation 
to close Montfort Hospital.
<P>
	I cannot help but be pleased to see that the Prime Minister has 
made representations to the Premier of Ontario, encouraging him to 
consider the importance of properly serving not just the 
francophone minority but all of the population in the eastern part of 
this province.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The commission has demonstrated its lack of sensitivity and 
understanding of the reality of the French speaking population of 
eastern Ontario. This was more than apparent in its ineptitude in 
not producing a French version of its report on release of the 
English version and the inability of its members to respond to 
questions in French at the recent press conference.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
summer, the Prime Minister did not hesitate to support Howard 
Galganov in the Quebec signage matter. He has, however, always 
been in less of a hurry to defend the interests of francophones in 
English Canada.
<P>
	His first reaction to the announced closing of the only French 
language hospital in Ontario was to refuse to support the 
francophones. In so doing, the Prime Minister clearly demonstrated 
what Canada is: a country which rushes to the defence of the 
slightest complaint by English Quebecers, but barely reacts to the 
conditions in which francophones in English Canada find 
themselves, particularly when those conditions favour their 
assimilation.
<P>
	The Prime Minister finally gave in to public pressure and spoke 
to the Premier of Ontario. He must, however, do more than that; he 
must also speak out against all of the other English speaking 
provinces which, like Ontario, offer neither health services, social 
services or cultural  services in French, thus making it clear that the

they reduced it? Mainly by increases of $25 billion in tax revenue

They even announced a major CPP hike on the backs of Canadians 
days before the budget and hoped it would be overshadowed.
<P>

	The government has implemented 36 tax increases and craftily 
used the deindexed income tax system to its benefit. The Liberal 
government has increased the national debt by $100 billion, and we 
still have unemployment rates of nearly 10 per cent.
<P>
	If the last four Liberal budgets were so successful why were 
there a record number of bankruptcies last year? Why are 
Canadians carrying record debt loads? Why are personal savings at 
record lows?

<P>
	Yet these organizations which are really one and the same have 
been receiving $500,000 yearly from Health Canada. This is 
unacceptable. Health Canada should not be bankrolling an

	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today marks the beginning of International Women's 
Week, a global celebration of women's accomplishments in 
seeking gender equality.
<P>
	Since women's struggles were officially recognized through the 
first International Women's Day in 1911 great strides have been 
made but much remains to be done.
<P>
	In Canadian politics, for example, less than 20 per cent of the 
members of the House are female compared to 52 per cent of the 
general population.
<P>
	A more shocking imbalance occurs in science where less than 5 
per cent of faculty and engineering are female, a statistic women 
like Dr. Lillian Dyck are working hard to correct. A biochemist at 
the University of Saskatchewan, Dr. Dyck takes very seriously her 
duties as a role model for girls and women in science.
<P>
	Having completed her own chemistry degree without ever 
encountering a female professor, Dr. Dyck hopes to encourage 
more female students to seek careers in science and engineering. 
The supportive atmosphere and changing stereotypical attitudes are 
crucial if the imbalance in this male dominated field is to be 
corrected.
<P>
	Just as in politics, women in science need to see other women in 
the jobs to which they aspire. Scientists like Dr. Lillian Dyck are 
making sure this happens.

	Last week at the meeting of national chiefs the AFN agreed to 
stage a national day of protest on April 17 due to Liberal inaction. 
Again last week the Prime Minister and the minister refused to 
meet the AFN to discuss the $60 million royal commission. Why 
do they duck and weave?
<P>
	Two weeks ago an aboriginal Liberal senator said the federal 
government should stop funding the Assembly of First Nations. 
This week the minister is barging ahead on the misguided Indian 
Act II to give the appearance of doing something.

	The Liberals are so compromised on aboriginal affairs that their

that some three million Canadians applied for unemployment

<P>
	On another point I want to congratulate every hard working 
Canadian for contributing a total of $26 billion over the past three 
years toward reducing the federal deficit. I am pleased the Prime 
Minister has acknowledged their contribution. These Canadians are

	There is no better example of this than South Africa's use of the 
Whitehorse mining initiative as a means of bringing stakeholders

or of any other grand prix later this season, and that the health 
minister's bill will mean the end of the Montreal Grand Prix, 
something Quebecers can never accept?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we introduced a bill that was supported by the official 
opposition party.
<P>
	I could point out a number of the members' concerns. I could say 
that the whole purpose of this bill is to protect the health of young 
people. I believe that the age at which people take up smoking is 
lower in Quebec than elsewhere.
<P>
	We are not banning all forms of advertising. We are proposing 
regulations making it possible to operate under stricter rules, so as 
to mitigate the effects. The minister's bill is being considered by 
the House of Commons. We have made a few concessions to 
accommodate people. The government's concern, however, is to 
ensure that the health of Canadians and of Quebecers is properly 
protected.
<P>
	In this connection, I quote Quebec's health minister, Mr. 
Rochon, who said: ``It is a step in the right direction''. He told the 
press: ``Sponsorship is subliminal advertising. It is a very powerful 
way of encouraging consumption of the product, particularly by 
young people''.
<P>
	With this in mind, we must focus on people's health, and try to 
work out an arrangement in so far as possible. There were 
restrictions with respect to sports events throughout the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister can leave Jean Rochon in Quebec City. 
We are speaking to the federal government, to the federal health 
minister, to the Prime Minister himself, because he is the one 
jeopardizing the very existence of most of the major cultural and 
sports events, which are held primarily in Quebec. That is what we 
are talking about.
<P>
	Yes, it is true that the opposition supports the principle of 
limiting tobacco consumption, but the advertising measures are 
going to jeopardize culture and sports. And that is what we are 
against.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister turn a deaf ear to the militant members 
in his own Liberal Party who met in Quebec over the weekend and 
expressed their concern about the fate reserved for cultural and 
sports events, and who spoke critically of the health minister's bill 
to the responsible ministers in the Quebec government? Can the 
Prime Minister turn a deaf ear even to the federal Liberals from 
Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when we spoke with those involved, they asked us for 
more time. The legislation was to take effect immediately in 
December, and we decided to grant an extension until October 
1998, in order to give the organizations in question time to adjust.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> They are not happy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Listen, Mr. Speaker, I am being 
asked to accommodate people, to help. We are saying that the 
deadline will be October 1, 1998 in order to help those affected 
make the adjustment. The legislation was to take effect on the date 
it was passed by Parliament. It is a bill that opposition members 
supported. They voted in favour of it. But they are behaving like 
political opportunists and no longer care right now about the health 
of Quebec's young people.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister is showing his ignorance of the 
Standing Orders.
<P>
	<B>Some hon members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, I would simply like to ask you 
not to use too many words that could be construed-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know what to say. 
Ignorance means that one does not know. I will put it another way. 
It is scandalous that, after 30 years in Parliament, the Prime 
Minister does not understand that it is possible to vote in favour of 
a principle at second reading, because that is what is being voted on 
at second reading, and against a bill at third reading, because we do 
not like the means being proposed. That is what I meant.
<P>
	The fact is that the same minister who wanted to ban raw milk 
cheese because it was a risk to people is now presenting us with a 
bill that makes no sense.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister whether there is a minister or a Liberal 
member from Quebec who will rise on that side of the House to 
defend Quebec and Quebec's interests? Let him rise so we can see 
him.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is the very reason we agreed to give two years to the 
group in question so it could adjust to the situation.
<P>
	When the bill was introduced, it was to take effect this year. 
Because of the representations made, we allowed a one year 
extension. We have not completely banned sponsorships by the 
tobacco companies. We have compromised in this connection. 
They can still advertise. There will be regulations allowing them to 
advertise in certain locations.
<P>
	But one thing is important, and that is that we must look after the 
health of young people. It is not acceptable to have an attitude-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Either we do something, or we 
do not. The fact is that the opposition party does not have the 
courage to say that it puts the health of young Quebecers, of young 
Canadians, first.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are ways of discouraging smoking and  improving 
the health of our young people, without at the same time jeopardiz-

ing the future of cultural and sporting events. It is like chewing 
gum and walking at the same time, some people just cannot do it.
<P>
	A number of cultural and sporting events are in danger. The 
Montreal Grand Prix, the Trois-Rivières Grand Prix, the jazz 
festival, the Benson and Hedges fireworks, the Just for Laughs 
festival, the Quebec summer festival, the Montreal international 
tennis championships.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that all of these events are now 
in jeopardy because of this bill, which the Montreal Chamber of 
Commerce labels as fundamentalist legislation by the ayatollahs of 
tobacco?

	As the hon. member and as his colleague fully know, there is no 
banning of sponsorship promotion. There is a restriction of 
sponsorship promotion.

	It would be nice in this House if members of the official

hundreds of millions of dollars in economic spinoffs jeopardized 
by a bad decision by this government.

	Outside of all the verbiage by the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Health, what does the Prime Minister have to say today 
to the thousands of people who will end up unemployed because of 
this bill, which goes beyond what its objectives ought to be, of 
reducing tobacco use, rather than doing away with Montreal's 
sports and cultural events, as this government is doing its darndest 
to do?

40,000 lives each and every year from tobacco consumption; over

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Saturday was the deadline for people to contribute to RRSPs, so 
retirement income has definitely been on the minds of Canadians.
<P>
	They want to know why, though, when it comes to the Canada 
pension plan they have to pay more for less, 73 per cent more. They 
want to know why 10 per cent of their salary is only going to get 
them $9,000 a year through CPP when the same amount invested in 
the safest RRSP would get them $26,000 a year. That is nearly 
three times more than with the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. How can he rip off young 
Canadians by asking them to pay more for less?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we want to ensure that young and middle aged Canadians 
will have some support when the time comes for them to retire. 
They have contributed for years to this plan and the Reform Party 
wants to get rid of it. All those who have paid into the plan for years 
will lose money if we do not intervene at this time.
<P>
	However, the Reform Party is always happy to ensure that the 
rich will be better off and the poor will pay.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
say somebody who opted out of the MP pension plan hardly has a 
guarantee of being rich down the road. Therefore I have a vested 
interest in making sure that the Canada pension plan or something 
like it is going to work for Canadians when they get old.
<P>
	He says that he wants to make sure that young Canadians will 
have some support. I agree with that but I think they should have 
more than some support. Let us get them into private RRSPs so 
they can get a lot more than just some support. Older Canadians 
will also feel the pinch.
<P>
	Under the Liberal plan a self-employed couple aged 60 will pay 
an additional $4,436 in CPP premiums and get $1,000 less for it 
when we factor in the Liberal clawback of the new seniors benefit.

<P>
	I again ask the Prime Minister how can he rip off older 
Canadians by asking them to pay more for less?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is a program that was organized by the federal 
government with all the provincial governments. This is an 
agreement that was signed with the provincial governments, the 
government of Mr. Klein in Alberta and the government of the 
premier of Ontario.
<P>
	All the governments are telling the Canadian people that the 
Canadian pension plan is needed for the future. There is unanimous 
consent in the land. There is only the Reform Party that has some 
very funny goals about preserving the future for the younger 
generation.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
the Prime Minister talks about unanimity in the land I have heard 
that phrase somewhere before in this Chamber and it just blew up 
in their face in the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords.
<P>
	This government has a real double standard when it comes to 
pensions. The Prime Minister is asking Canadians to pay more for 
less but he certainly is not making the same demand on his MPs. 
Canadians are being asked to pay 10 per cent of their pay cheques 
for a measly $9,000 in Canada pension plan pensions.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	The Liberal members opposite, and of course those others who 
have put into the MP pension plan, are paying 10 per cent of their 
pay cheques but they are going to get $40,000 plus in MP pensions.
<P>
	Let me ask the Prime Minister this. How can he rationalize 
asking Canadians to pay more for less when Liberals pay less for 
more and continue to enjoy their lavish gold plated pension plan?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if we were to believe what the Reform Party has proposed 
on that score it would cost workers 15 per cent of their income to 
meet the goals it has in mind.
<P>
	We are making sure, because we are acting now, that it will not 
be 12, 13 and 14 per cent but it will be 10 per cent, and that will 
guarantee to the Canadian people that by the year 2020 we will 
have a Canada pension plan. This is what the Canadian people 
want. It is what the provincial governments want. It is what the 
Canadian people will get.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Faced with Liberal militants who were worried about the 
survival of cultural and sports events, the Minister of  Labour, who 
is also responsible for the Liberals' election campaign in Quebec, 
said on the weekend that after tobacco, his government might 
consider alcohol, to the horror of the President of the Treasury 
Board who took his arm and motioned him to stop talking. It is 
unbelievable how far removed this government is from reality.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that by letting his Minister of 
Health, his Minister for Nova Scotia, a man who does not know 
anything about the economic situation in Quebec, go on like this, 
his government is turning on a sector that is in good shape in 
Quebec at the present time? Why is the minister attacking what 
works in Quebec? Is it because, in the final instance, the Prime 
Minister is upset when Quebec is doing well?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I would like to repeat that we are not taking 
away the possibility of advertising. We are making regulations to 
ensure it has the least possible impact on young people in Quebec, 
those who are most at risk.
<P>
	It is reported that the average age at which people start to smoke 
regularly in Quebec is 14. In Quebec, people start to smoke at an 
earlier age than anywhere else in the country. That is why we are 
taking steps to try to protect young people against the dangers of 
starting to smoke at too early an age.
<P>
	Events can still be held. Advertising will be regulated as it is in 
France. As the U.S. President said in his State of the Union 
message a few weeks ago, he intends to do the same. Above all, we 
must protect the health of our young people. In Canada some 
advertising will be allowed, although some countries are going to 
prohibit advertising altogether.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister is so keen on going ahead with this bill 
because he wants to save his party and the minister who urged 
people to vote against the Liberals if the legislation was not passed 
before the next election. That is the real problem.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister agree that his minister's stubbornness is 
not about health and very much about political concerns?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member for Argenteuil-Papineau said that by 
voting in favour of this bill at second reading, the official 
opposition agreed with its objectives, and more specifically with 
protecting the health of young people under 18.
<P>
	On December 5, 1996, the hon. member for Lévis said: ``Since 
we agree with most of the government's objectives regarding a 
reduction in health costs associated with tobacco use, we will 
support the bill''. And so on and so forth.

events as such were safe pursuits that might even encourage young 
people who wanted to smoke to engage in sports activities.
<P>
	It was the members opposite who told the Minister of Health in 
December to go ahead. Today, for purely electoral reasons, without 
any consideration for protecting the health of young Quebecers, 
they have changed their minds. Quebecers know that the health of 
young people is important.

	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister knows full well that the Reform plan 
for the Canada pension plan would protect current seniors and 
would also make it possible for future Canadians to have a pension 
at all.
<P>
	My question is to the President of the Treasury Board. Last 
Friday the President of the Treasury Board inferred that increasing 
annual Canada pension plan premiums $1,300 per employee will 
prevent the program from going broke.
<P>
	Will the minister now promise Canadians that there will be no 
further increase in Canada pension plan premiums and that there 
will be no further decreases in Canada pension plan benefits?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party's 
numbers are usually wrong and they are again in this question. 
Reformers have not stated how they are going to pay the millions of 
current seniors or the people over the age of 50 who are dependent 
on the Canada pension plan for future benefits. How are they going 
to pay them with their plan?
<P>
	Their plan will not provide disability or children's benefits. 
Their plan will not provide a drop-out provision. It will not provide 
indexation. They will put all the risks in the hands of the workers.
<P>
	Their pension plan is not the pension plan we have in the Liberal 
Party. We will support the Canada pension plan and the provinces 
will support the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadians are not fooled by this. When the Liberals are 
asked a reasonable question and stand up and respond with rubbish 
and prevarication we can see right through it.
<P>
	A tax by any other name is still a tax. The Minister of Industry 
referred to Canada pension plan premiums as a payroll tax. The 
Minister of Finance has said payroll taxes are a cancer on job 
creation.
<P>
	My question to the Prime Minister is how many jobs will be 
killed by the $10 billion job killing Liberal payroll tax grab?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer to that 
question is their plan will require people to put money into an 
RRSP.
<P>
	How many jobs will that kill? It will kill a lot more jobs than the 
15 per Canada pension plan. It is a pension plan, an investment 
plan. They do not understand the difference between a tax and an 
investment in a pension plan.

<P>
	Last Friday, the federal government revealed its argument in its

irresponsible and provocative. All it is capable of doing, in fact, is 
subscribing to the opinion of an expert, who holds that, and I quote: 
``The only way for an entity to secede unilaterally is by traditional 
means, which involves winning a war of independence, as did

	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.
<P>
	Presently representatives from 150 countries are meeting in 
Bonn to draft an accord aimed at reducing global emissions of 
carbon dioxide. Apparently Canada has said that it will not meet 
the target of stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000.
<P>
	Can the minister say what she plans to do to meet both the 
carbon dioxide reduction commitment made by Canada under the 
climate change convention and the further reductions promised in 
the red book in view of the fact that voluntary efforts are proving to 
be insufficient?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. It is timely, 
considering that starting tomorrow in Bonn, the world's nations 
will begin another series of negotiations in relation to the challenge 
of global warming.
<P>
	Let me assure the hon. member that my colleague, the Minister 
of the Environment, and I announced 45 new or enhanced measures 
when we met with our provincial colleagues in Toronto in 
December. Those measures include things like green power 
procurement in federal buildings, enhanced energy efficiency 
regulations for appliances and small engines.
<P>
	However, the hon. member is right that is will be very hard for us 
as a nation to achieve the stabilization goals. But by working with 
other stakeholders like the provinces, industry and environmental 
groups, ours is a record of which we can be proud. Ours is a record 
that reflects momentum and we will continue to work on this 
difficult global problem.

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hospital 
closures in the Ottawa area are a direct result of the Liberal 
government's cuts to medicare, in fact 40 per cent in cuts to 
medicare.
<P>
	Why does the Minister of Health not just put up a sign on every 
closed hospital that says: ``This closure courtesy of the Liberal 
Party of Canada?''
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the thesis promoted by members of the third party is totally 
inaccurate.
<P>
	If one were to read the comprehensive report of the national 
forum, a body which was appointed by the Prime Minister, it 
clearly said that Canada has the second most expensive health care 
system in the world, that our health care system is not underfunded, 
and that the problems with our health care system have more to do 
with management than anything else.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
missed one little fact from the health care forum. The Liberals are 
going down to $11.1 billion, but the forum said to keep the funding 
at $12.5 billion, which is quite a difference.
<P>
	The hospital closures are a direct result of the 40 per cent in cuts. 
The Liberals promised to save medicare. What did they deliver? 
Hospitals closing.
<P>
	Why does every hospital not put up a great big brass plaque 
which states: ``This closure courtesy of the Liberal Party of 
Canada?''
<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
again the hon. member from the Reform Party is somewhat 
negligent with the facts.
<P>
	As a result of the economic policies of the government, we have 
saved provincial treasuries in excess of $1.6 billion on interest 
rates alone. In addition, for this fiscal year we have provided the 
provinces $8.6 billion in revenues for equalization.
<P>
	Because of the Minister of Finance's budget of not this year, but 
last year, the government has provided not only a cash floor but a 
minimum of $25.1 billion to the provinces for the purposes of 
social programs.

question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	These last few weeks, the media have reported several cases of 
cloning using adult animal cells. Everyone has been able to see the 
results of a cloning experiment  carried out by Scottish researchers 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8510"> 8510 </A></B>
<P>
on a sheep called Dolly. Many experts have serious concerns about 
the possibility of human cloning.
<P>
	Does the minister recognize that this is a matter of great urgency, 
given the tremendous progress made in research, and that he must 
amend the Criminal Code as soon as possible to prohibit human 
cloning?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the hon. member for his question because it is a serious and 
a substantive one.
<P>
	Members will recall that we introduced legislation to deal with 
the very subject matter to which the hon. member referred. It is in 
committee at the present time. The legislation has two phases, 
phase one and phase two. If we could get the co-operation of the 
various political parties I am certain we could move in a very 
expeditious way to have that legislation pass through the House of 
Commons as well as the upper house.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, can the 
Minister of Justice undertake to act before the next election and 
amend the Criminal Code in order to prohibit human cloning, in 
which case he will have the full support of the official opposition to 
quickly pass such an amendment?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the substance and the purpose of the bill to which I referred is to 
address the kinds of concerns that he has raised.
<P>
	I only hope that members can focus on this subject matter in a 
non-partisan way and have it passed expeditiously in the House so 
that the kinds of fears that he has raised will not continue in this 
country at least.

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, unbelievably the 
French government is going to issue a stamp to glorify de Gaulle's 
vive le Quebec libre visit .This is utterly reprehensible and is a 
direct attack on Canadian sovereignty and unity.
<P>
	Is the government unwilling to defend the country's unity and 
sovereignty and demand that the French government stop 
supporting Quebec separatists?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are aware that some consideration is being given to a 
stamp of President de Gaulle but no decision has been taken. The 
hon. member should tone down his rhetoric and his inflammatory 
remarks until we get a full explanation.
<P>
	We have been in touch with officials of the French government 
to ask for information and an explanation. As soon as we receive 
that we would be very glad to inform the hon. member.
<P>
	Once again the Reform Party is jumping the gate too quickly. It 
should not draw conclusions until the proper information is 
received. I know the Reform Party does not like to be confused by 
the facts but in this case we prefer to know exactly what is going 
on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this sounds very 
much like what was said during the referendum: be happy, keep 
quiet, do not say anything.
<P>
	The Prime Minister just completed a visit to France and he said 
that relations have never been better. Is this stamp an example of 
the relationship getting better? Will the Prime Minister stand up for 
Canada? Will he stop catering to the separatists and will he call the 
French ambassador in and tell him to butt out or get out?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is the first time I have been accused of being on the 
side of the separatists.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> I can see the leader of the 
separatist party smiling. He has never been my biggest problem.

said is reasonable. There are rumours about it. There are a lot of 
rumours about the Reform Party too but we do not believe them all

	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am concerned because the province of British Columbia has 
announced that it will withdraw from the agreement concerning the 
free flow of goods and services between Canadian provinces. This 
is at a time when all of Canada, especially the economy of B.C., is 
benefiting from freer trade.
<P>
	Would the minister comment on how he thinks B.C. businesses 
will be affected by this decision when trying to enter into contracts 
in other provinces?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the issue to which the member refers is the announcement 
by the  province of British Columbia that it will not proceed with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8511"> 8511 </A></B>
<P>
negotiations to extend the application of the internal trade 
agreement to municipal governments as well as schools, hospitals 
and administrative agencies of its government.
<P>
	As was agreed in 1994 when the federal government and the 
provinces signed the internal trade agreement, it was foreseen that 
we would complete negotiations to extend that chapter within a 
year. The third anniversary is now approaching.
<P>
	This decision is regrettable from the point of view of the benefits 
that could be enjoyed by British Columbia taxpayers if 
procurement were opened to firms from other parts of Canada. It is 
also regrettable because other provinces may choose not to extend 
the benefits of the agreement to firms based in British Columbia.
<P>
	It is my hope that the Government of British Columbia, which 
entered into this agreement in good faith and negotiated by the 
current premier of the province, will reconsider its position.

<P>
	Can the minister tell the House if the government intends to 
continue supporting the research and prevention activities

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yes. we have embarked on a consultation process with various 
stakeholders, including the advisory group to the minister, on the 
issue of AIDS and the difficulties that it provides our citizens.
<P>
	We were hoping to raise the matter in a larger forum with 
provincial governments as well. As the hon. member knows, 
funding for the second phase is not due to terminate until March 
1998. We have some time in which to line things up in the proper 
way.

	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, 16-year-olds cannot buy cigarettes, 16-year-olds cannot 
vote but in 1988 the Conservative government reduced the age of 
consent from 16 to 14.
<P>
	Liberal proposals continue to do nothing to prevent children 
from being commandeered by adults for sex. It is no accident that 
the average age of recruitment for prostitution is 14. What will the 
justice minister do to protect our most vulnerable citizens? When 
will he raise the age of consent from 14 to 16?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have done a wide variety of 
things with respect to children being exploited through 
prostitution. One of the issues, but only one of them, is the issue of 
age.
<P>
	For example, we put before the House legislation which would 
impose mandatory minimum penitentiary terms on those who serve 
as pimps for children in prostitution. It is legislation that will make 
a difference.
<P>
	We have worked in concert with provincial attorneys general and 
authorities throughout the country in a co-ordinated effort to crack 
down on child prostitution.
<P>
<B>(1500)</B>
<P>
	On those occasions when I visited cities throughout Canada I 
have driven with the police in their cars. I have seen the tragic sight 
of children working the streets as prostitutes. I have conferred with 
those in the provinces who are working with the social services 
because this is more than just a matter of criminal law.
<P>
	I use this occasion to say to the hon. member that I fully share 
her objectives. We have taken concrete legislative and policy 
action against children in prostitution and I urge her to join us in

<P>
	During the government's move to deregulate the branchlines in 
our railway system it assured Canadians who lived on those 
branchlines that the loss of protection to the year 2000 would not 
matter because they could set up short lines to provide their own 
service.
<P>
	We are now finding out that the railways and the elevator 
companies seem to have an alliance whereby the lines will not be 
sold without the condition that no grain will move on them.

<P>

<B><A NAME="8512"> 8512 </A></B>
<P>
	What does the government plan to do to offset this, now that 
it has set this program in motion? How will these communities 
be able to use their short lines if no elevators can be situated on 
their rights of way?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the new Canada 
Transportation Act is at least in part to shift the emphasis away 
from what used to be a policy of branchline abandonment as the 
only game in town toward a new policy where at least there is the 
alternative of considering seriously a short line operation where it 
makes economic sense to do so.
<P>
	In my province, which is also the hon. gentleman's province, it 
would be a big help to the short line industry if the provincial NDP 
government would change the law with respect to successor rights 
so short lines could exist in Saskatchewan.

Defence as follows.
<P>
	ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE, RCMP
<P>
	a) Following is the list of incidents where firearms have been

RCMP in Canada for the period 1993 to 1997:

<P>
	15. ``K'' DIVISION-96 Aug 17: A member's service revolver

this time as an investigation is ongoing.
<P>
	17. ``O'' DIVISION-95 Jun 17: A member's revolver sank to 
the bottom of a lake while the member was on routine patrol on 
Lake Nippissing. The revolver has not been recovered. No charges

	20. ``DEPOT'' DIVISION-A recent incident involves an 
RCMP S&amp;W 5946 pistol which was lost/stolen while in transit with 
a courier company. An investigation is being conducted with 
respect to this incident.
<P>
	b) According to Section 3(1)d) of the Regulations pertaining to 
Part III of the Criminal Code, the RCMP is exempt from the 
storage regulations subject to subsection 3(3) of the same 
Regulations. Section 3(3) states that the exemption applies when 
firearms are stored in a dwelling house or permission is given by a 
supervisor.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8517"> 8517 </A></B>
<P>
	The RCMP published clear operational directives stating that 
its members are responsible for the use, safety and storage of their 
firearms at all times. Any neglect of these directives is considered 
a breach of the Regulations and is an offence under Section 86(3) 
of the Criminal Code. When the firearm of a member of the RCMP 
is lost or stolen, the assessment of the situation includes a decision 
as to whether or not Section 86(3) of the Criminal Code of Canada 
has been breached.
<P>
	With respect to these types of incidents as they pertain to 
provincial and municipal police forces or police officers, the 
RCMP's information is very limited. Since other police forces are 
not required to report to the RCMP incidents of loss or theft of their 
firearms, the RCMP's Operational Reporting System does not 
accurately provide information in this regard.

<P>
	3. Incident DS-0517-16 Apr 94: Two 22 calibre rifles were

calibre was recovered by Winnipeg City Police. The hand gun had 
been stolen from a Permanent Married Quarter at CFB Shilo 
without the owner's knowledge. Weapon was stored in accordance 
with Section 86(3) of the Criminal Code. An investigation was 
conducted and the firearm was recovered. No charges were laid.
<P>
	8. Incident DS-0525-11 Feb 95: A 410 shogun and a 
Winchester 30-30 rifle were stolen during a Break and Enter at a

during a Break and Enter. Weapons were stored in accordance with 
Section 86(3) of the Criminal Code. An investigation was 
conducted and the firearms were not recovered. No charges were 
laid.
<P>
	b) Since the Canadian Forces are exempt from Section 86(3) of 
the Criminal Code of Canada, the above incidents (1) through (6) 
cannot be considered violations of that legislation and therefore, 
charges were not laid. Incidents (7), (8) and (9) were thefts from 
private residences in which the weapons were stored in accordance 
with Section 86(3) of the Criminal Code.

	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-66, an act to amend 
the Canada Labour Code (Part I) and the Corporations and Labour 
Unions Returns Act and to make consequential amendments to 
other acts, as reported (with amendments) from the committee; and 
of Motions Nos. 11 and 12.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
member for Wetaskiwin had four minutes remaining.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, since 
I am not sure how many points I covered when I last spoke I will 
recap. I also want to raise a point made during question period by 
the minister of agriculture. In his reply to a question by a member 
of the NDP, the minister said that if the Saskatchewan government 
would amend its successor rights it would go a long way to solving 
the problem with the short line railways and their buyers.
<P>
	It is a rather strange stance for the minister of agriculture to take 
when his government is suggesting we should have successor rights 
in the airline industry. It is strange he suggested that it should not 
be the same in the railroad industry. We in the Reform Party 
suggest the section of Bill C-66 that deals with successor rights 
should be eliminated.
<P>
	Why should it be eliminated from the bill? We think it 
complicates things. It does not do what the minister has set out to 
do, that is to create a balance. It is making  legislation for 
legislation's sake. It is not accomplishing anything.
<P>
	We also notice the government's amendment to limit the 
succession rights to the airline securities department. Does it 
really? Further on we recognize that the governor in council, the 
cabinet in other words, has the authority to make regulations 
designating that any other service in any industry would have to 
comply with the same successor rights provisions. For those 
reasons we would very much like to see the successor rights portion 
of the bill removed.
<P>
	Further, the Sims report from which most of the bill is drafted 
did not report on the subject. It did not have any consultation with 
the airlines, the industries or the airports in terms of successor 
rights.
<P>
	This is rather ill thought out legislation. It is legislation that may 
have been brought in to appease certain groups. It is not part of the 
solution but could be exactly the opposite. It could be part of the 
problem.
<P>
	I urge all members of the House to reconsider the portion of the 
bill that deals with successor rights, specifically clause 47.3 of Bill 
C-66, and to support the Reform amendment to delete the clause.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
strongly object to the amendments put forward by the so-called 
Reform Party because the whole issue of successive contracts or 
previous employers is one of those that cause the most controversy, 
problems and confusion in labour relations. It is always an 
extremely sensitive issue.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Section 47.3 improves the situation without going as far as the 
unions would have wanted. This provision is a rather limited 
improvement. It is important to mention what it states, for the 
benefit of our listeners. This provision requires an employer who 
succeeds a previous contractor as the provider of certain services in 
the air transportation industry to pay his employees as much as the 
employees of the previous contractor were entitled to.
<P>
	We must understand that this issue of contracting out is a very 
sensitive one and that the intent of the legislation is to preserve a 
minimum that is unacceptable. It goes without saying that a union 
always wants to protect its members' jobs. In this case, again in an 
attempt to control damage, it is provided that the provider of 
services who succeeds a previous contractor must pay at least equal 
remuneration.
<P>
	This is a new provision which seeks to protect the remuneration 
of unionized workers who might have been adversely affected 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8519"> 8519 </A></B>
<P>
following the loss of a contract by their employer. The provision 
also seeks to ensure that the people working for the supplier who is 
awarded the  contract receive decent wages. It has no impact on the 
right of a supplier to contract out, provided that the contractors 
comply with the compensation plan.
<P>
	While we feel the act does not go far enough, it is nevertheless 
an improvement and we will strongly oppose the Reform 
amendment to clause 47.3.
<P>
	There is also clause 43 amending section 97(a) of the code. New 
obligations are imposed, including, in clause 47.3, the obligation, 
for an employer who succeeds a previous contractor, to pay equal 
remuneration to his employees. The employer must also uphold the 
conditions of employment while waiting for the board's decision 
regarding the services to be maintained, preserve the conditions of 
employment of those employees required to work during a work 
stoppage to maintain services, and reinstate employees instead of 
keeping replacement workers. This improvement seeks to make 
labour relations more civilized. Therefore, we will strongly oppose 
the amendment tabled by the Reform Party.
<P>
	The two other amendments also target succession rights. We 
want to emphasize the fact that this is a mistake. The hon. member 
must realize that this would not solve anything. It is not true that it 
would enable contractors to operate with total freedom. Rather, it 
would create conditions where workers and unions would have no 
choice but to fight and to use every means of pressure available to 
them.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	Let us not forget that the Reform Party's next to last amendment 
targets a provision already included in a 1996 act, which also 
maintained certain rights for workers.
<P>
	For all these reasons, we are asking the government not to 
support the amendments proposed by the Reform Party. I would 
like to support these amendments but, unfortunately, their content 
as well as the arguments raised by the Reform member give me no 
choice but to disagree with them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, clause 24 of Bill C-66 adds a 
provision to the Canada Labour Code which would require an 
employer succeeding another as the provider of certain services to 
the air transport industry to pay employees remuneration not less 
than that which the employees of the previous contract were 
entitled to receive under the terms of a collective agreement. On 
the recommendation of the Minister of Labour the governor in 
council can extend the application of this provision to other 
industries.
<P>
	The Reform Party has put forward Motion No. 11 to remove this 
requirement from Bill C-66. This provision has been included in 
the bill to address important labour  relations matters which not 
only affect workers in this sector but also impact on the safety of 
the flying public.
<P>
	Rather than remove the provision, we are proposing MotionNo. 12 to amend it to address some legitimate concerns which have 
been raised by representatives in the air transportation sector with 
respect to its current scope. The amendment we wish to make to 
clause 24 would limit the immediate application of this provision 
to employers providing airport security screening services.
<P>
	We ask members of the House to approve this amendment as it 
will promote competition based on efficiency gains and enable 
contractors with unionized employees to answer tender calls; 
reduce staff turnover and ensure that the personnel assigned to the 
protection of the flying public have the proper training experience; 
protect the remuneration of unionized workers who can be 
penalized when their employer loses a service contract.
<P>
	What this provision does not do is limit the right of employers in 
the air transportation sector or any other sector to contract for 
services. As is presently case the right to contract out services 
would remain subject to the terms of any collective agreement to 
which the employer is party. The requirement to maintain 
remuneration levels would only apply to successor contractors.
<P>
	At present when a business subject to the Canada Labour Code 
decides to change contractors at the expiration of a service contract 
there is nothing in the code that protects the employees of that 
contractor. Consequently, if those employees were unionized and it 
succeeded in entering into a collective agreement they often lose 
the monetary benefits they have negotiated and in some cases they 
lose their jobs. As well, the employees of the employer that wins 
the service contract often have poor wage conditions.
<P>
	We recognize that the air transport industry has a legitimate 
interest in containing costs and staying competitive. Still, the 
Canadian air transport industry has itself recognized that the 
turnover of employees assigned to security service contracts has a 
negative impact on its ability to maintain a skilled experienced 
work force. Because of problems caused by the practice of 
awarding successive contracts for services for security services in 
the air transport sector, the Department of Transport in its capacity 
as administrator of major airports reached an agreement with the 
Canadian airlines in 1988. Under the terms of the agreement the 
airlines were required to include in contracts for preboard security 
screening services a clause guaranteeing the employees wages and 
benefits would be maintained if the level provided for in the 
contract had existed before the call of tenders.
<P>
	This agreement which was revised in 1992 resulted in a reduced 
turnover rate for security personnel, improved working conditions 
and a better security screening system. It is this policy which the 
bill now seeks to codify.  The Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development heard the submissions made by the Air 
Transport Association of Canada which raised concerns about the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8520"> 8520 </A></B>
<P>
new obligations included in the bill. In the association's view since 
the agreement entered into with the Department of Transport in 
1988 solved the problems associated with tender calls for security 
services, it would be pointless and unwarranted to formalize the 
agreement as proposed in section 47(3).
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	Although we commend the airlines for their co-operation in 
honouring the agreement of the Department of Transport since 
1988, we must not lose sight of the fact that some airports have not 
been administered by the Department of Transport for a few years 
now. Their numbers are growing.
<P>
	As a result, Transport Canada has less direct influence to ensure 
that this policy is respected. With the proposed amendment to 
clause 24, the provision will apply in the immediate term only to 
security screening services.
<P>
	This will codify the contractual obligations that air transport 
employers have been honouring for eight years and have been 
recognized as a reasonable method of correcting the problems 
associated with contract free tendering for security services.
<P>
	The proposed amendment addresses the concerns raised by the 
TAC about the advisability of applying this provision to other 
services contracted out by its members such as fuelling and ground 
services.
<P>
	In the association's view, applying this provision to such 
services could cause more labour relations problems than it would 
solve. It is usually the airlines that provide these services with the 
help of unionized personnel.
<P>
	In view of the submissions made to the committee and the 
objectives of this provision we are proposing to limit its application 
to security screening services.
<P>
	However, the governor in council will retain authority to extend 
the application of this section to other services and other industries 
under federal jurisdiction on the recommendation of the Minister 
of Labour if problems similar to those which arose as a result of 
changes of contractors providing preboard security screening 
services in the airport sector occur.
<P>
	I urge members to support the government motion and retain the 
requirement in clause 24 of the bill but with a restricted 
application. This will ensure that workers in the security screening 
sector are treated with equity. With respect to the remuneration, it 
will also contribute to ensuring the safety of the flying public.
<P>
	In addition, there will be a mechanism available to address 
problems should they arise in other sectors.

	He said: Madam Speaker, Group No. 5 refers to three types of 
amendments. The first consideration relates to technological 
change, the second to a clause inspired by the situation in Quebec, 
which stipulates that a collective agreement will continue to apply 
until a new one has been signed. The third concerns non-targeted 
workers.
<P>
	I would like to begin by addressing technological change. As you 
know, one of the paradoxes of the process we have experienced is 
that the government claims to have modernized the Canada Labour 
Code without addressing the thorny and delicate question of 
technological change. We are well aware that technological change 
impacts very heavily on the way work is organized.
<P>
	I would like to give an example close to my heart, which relates 
to Hochelaga--Maisonneuve and, by that very fact, I would like to 
dedicate this example to the people in my community. Some years 
ago, when I was starting to get interested in politics, there were in 
my neighbourhood what were termed skilled labourers: machinists, 
a highly respected job. I am sure the hon. member for Mercier will 
recall that they were part of what was called the aristocracy of 
labourers.
<P>
	Thanks to a totally new production process, a very significant 
change took place; a punched tape made it possible to change the 
organization of the work totally, which had an effect on the workers 
that were required.
<P>
	What the Bloc Quebecois amendment proposes is to allow the 
unions the opportunity of having a say on how technological 
change will be implemented in the work place. The employer is 
required to give reasonable notice, after which it is stated that, if 
agreement is not reached on the manner in which technological 
change is to be implemented, this could go right up to the right to 
strike.
<P>
	Technological change is important, because it is estimated that 
the life cycle of equipment in certain industries on the leading edge 
of technology may not exceed five years. Associated with these life 
cycles are major changes in terms of manufacturing processes.
<P>
	It is hard to understand why the government remained silent on 
such a topical issue. Especially since the minister himself had put 
in place a round table, a discussion forum where he was told what 
lay ahead and what the basic trends were both in the retail trade and 
in the service sector. In spite of it all, the minister did not say a 
word on such a major issue.
<P>
	Before I get to our proposal, I would like to share with you, if I 
may, what a very important central labour body in Quebec told the 
committee. I am referring, of course, to the CSN. I want you to 
know what its representatives made us realize in committee.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	According to the CSN, only after a negotiated settlement 
providing for the right to strike in the event of a dispute has been 
reached should the provisions relating to technological change be 
implemented in the workplace. The CSN analysis is premised on 
the idea that the potential for a dispute exists and that this in itself 
is important enough to be considered an element in the bargaining 
process that could eventually lead to the exercise of the right to 
strike.
<P>
	The definition of ``technological change'' should be broad 
enough to encompass all modern technology. It should not be 
defined in minute detail, but it should be clear what is meant by 
technological change.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8522"> 8522 </A></B>
<P>
	After a reasonable time has elapsed-this is a legal provision 
found in many bills-the information provided to the union should 
deal with-that is why it is important  to be very clear about the 
type of information required-all economic, technical and 
organizational aspects of the employer's plans, including a detailed 
description of the project, a cost-benefit analysis, the positions 
affected, a manpower assessment, the impact on work organization, 
and an implementation schedule.
<P>
	I hope this brief excerpt from a much longer submission will 
convince you, Madam Speaker, and the parliamentary secretary, 
that this is an amendment worth considering and that the 
government should support it.
<P>
	I want to discuss another issue before giving the floor to a 
colleague. Madam Speaker-and I know you have a keen interest 
in this issue-there is a labour code in Quebec, as in other 
provinces, but our province has always been something of a 
pioneer. Quebec never does things by halves. Get ready because, in 
the future, a fundamental change will take place. But this is not the 
time to discuss it.
<P>
	I want to call the house's attention to section 59 of the Quebec 
labour code. If my information is accurate, section 59 provides 
what I would call, based on my old notions of law, an evergreen 
clause. I am not sure whether the hon. member for Mercier will let 
me say this, because she is much more familiar than I am with 
labour law, but it seems to me there is something tacit in what is 
being proposed, something akin to an evergreen clause.
<P>
	What does this mean? It means that when negotiations are 
undertaken-and later on we will elaborate on the process 
proposed by the minister-since currently there is no provision in 
the Canada Labour Code similar to the one in section 59 of the 
Quebec labour code, and since the government did not want to 
include such a provision, workers could be deprived of the 
protection afforded by the evergreen clause, which provides that a 
collective agreement is deemed to be in effect until a new one, 
hopefully a negotiated one, comes into effect.
<P>
	This is what our proposed amendments seek to provide. These 
provisions were suggested by a number of witnesses, including the 
CSN. I fail to see how the government could reject these 
amendments. One would have a hard time finding arguments 
against these very sound proposals.
<P>
	This concludes my explanation. I am very optimistic that the 
government will support our amendments.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, this 
group includes three important motions by the Bloc Quebecois. 
Even if the government is not in agreement with the wording as 
given, it should at least try to plug some rather sizable holes in the 
Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	The first is the absence of provisions regarding the opportunity 
and the right to negotiate technological change. My colleague, the 
member for  Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, has given us a striking 
example of what happened in a company whose workers possessed 
a highly sought after skill, but a skill that became almost worthless 
following a technological change. This has happened extremely 
often and will happen increasingly in the future, given the pace of 
technological change.
<P>
	Except that, in a business, there is nothing to prevent workers 
from being consulted about the introduction of new technologies, 
from being involved, and those who would otherwise be affected, 
possibly even laid off, from being protected.
<P>
	Companies that have decided to involve workers in the 
introduction of technological change have always come out ahead. 
How many times has extremely costly equipment been bought 
without consulting workers, only to turn out to be ill adapted, to 
lead to serious health and safety problems in the workplace, with 
the result that it was necessary to make adjustments and repairs that 
were never satisfactory in the end? This has happened time and 
time again.
<P>
	So responsible companies, those with experience, know that this 
is in their interest. I could name several in Montreal's east end who 
involved the union when introducing technological change, using a 
bargaining approach, without its being formal bargaining as 
provided under the code.
<P>
	What we would expect of the government, which claims to want 
to modernize the Canada Labour Code, is for it to focus attention 
on this extremely important matter, for it to help businesses to be 
proactive, for it to use its judgment and experience, in order to 
indicate to them that they ought to negotiate the introduction of 
technological change with the union, when there is one, and when 
such change could result in a strike. The least that ought to be done 
is to ensure that there is negotiation. This is not only in the 
workers' best interests, but in the employer's as well.
<P>
	We find the bill highly unsatisfactory in this area, as well as 
many others. In fact, I really wonder if this is a matter of 
modernizing the Canada Labour Code; to my mind, it is more of a 
process to make labour relations more rigid, at a time when they 
need to be made more flexible.
<P>
	The second motion by the Bloc Quebecois is to ensure that there 
is not what is called in the jargon ``a legal vacuum''. A legal 
vacuum is a situation that is quite alarming for unionized workers 
who have the right to strike or who go out on strike and no longer 
have any protection whatsoever under their former collective 
agreement. In a legal vacuum of this type, a company could, for 
instance, lay people off, and they would have no defence against it. 
There will, of course, be an attempt to negotiate their rehiring in 
the back to work protocol, but this simply further complicates 
negotiations, as well as the settlement and the end of the strike. 
Thus, there  are more opportunities for the law of the jungle to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8523"> 8523 </A></B>
<P>
govern the parties' actions. The purpose of the Canada Labour 
Code is to ensure that relations are clearly set out. A legal vacuum 
means reversion to the law of the jungle.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	Naturally, each party tries to make use of this law of the jungle, 
according to its strength. But how much better would it be if the 
code itself were to provide, in some way, for the old collective 
agreement to be carried over until a new one replaced it so as to 
avoid a legal vacuum. In Quebec, the option exists, and, in the 
public sector, there is no legislative gap whatsoever.
<P>
	Finally, the third motion of the Bloc is aimed at describing the 
new freedom. Some will say that the new code gives employers an 
opportunity to talk to their employees, as defined in the 
jurisprudence of the Canada board. We, however, are very 
concerned that this provision does not exclude the period in which 
an application is made for certification.
<P>
	This definition or attempt to determine the relationship between 
employer and employee in terms of information, must exclude the 
period of the application for certification. I hope the secretary of 
state will heed my arguments. It is essential that the application 
period be excluded. In this period, as we know, words do not have 
the same weight, and an employer's silences and gestures can be 
pregnant with meaning. Intimidation can take many forms.
<P>
	We really hope the parliamentary secretary will listen to our 
arguments and not introduce more problems in labour relations, 
where there are already enough problems.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in the 
House to support the motions of the Bloc Quebecois on Bill C-66, 
an act to amend the Canada Labour Code. The first motion 
concerns renewal of the previous collective agreement until the 
new agreement is signed.
<P>
	This provision did not exist before in Quebec, and this certainly 
caused a lot of problems. We were faced with a legal vacuum. Do 
the employer's management rights apply during this interval? Can 
the employer fire employees without observing the collective 
agreement? Finally, thanks to the labour movement's demands, the 
labour code was amended.
<P>
	In Quebec today, there is a provision for tacit renewal of a 
collective agreement until the new agreement is signed and comes 
into effect. After expiry of the previous collective agreement, it can 
sometimes take a long time, months and even years, before the new 
agreement is signed. There must be some degree of stability in 
labour relations during that time.
<P>
	The second motion of the Bloc Quebecois concerns 
technological change. This is a very important question. During the 
past 20 or 30 years, we have seen spectacular technological 
changes taking place in business and industry. Of course, 
employees want to have some control over the technological 
changes that in most cases affect them to a very considerable 
extent. On the other hand, employers want to be in full control of 
these changes.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	I agree with the request by the Bloc Quebecois that unions be 
given reasonable notice before such changes are introduced. 
Sometimes when technological change occurs, and this has been 
the case in the past 20 or 30 years, dozens and even hundreds of 
people have been laid off. People will lose their jobs because new 
equipment has been purchased and new production processes are 
being introduced.
<P>
	Usually when a collective agreement is signed, labour relations 
and terms and conditions of employment remain stable until the 
new agreement is negotiated. Most labour codes provide that 
technological changes can be negotiated even if the collective 
agreement has yet to expire.
<P>
	The United States has legal provisions that are sometimes very 
advanced, and the Canada Labour Code would do well to take a leaf 
from this legislation. The important thing is to associate workers 
with the introduction of these changes. Sometimes the changes do 
not work because they were introduced unilaterally by the 
employer without the consent of and without prior notice to the 
workers.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve said earlier, 
the CNTU submitted a brief which contains excellent 
recommendations in this respect. Prior notice should be given 
before proceeding with such changes. It is imperative to negotiate. 
If an agreement is reached, the changes may proceed, but if not, the 
parties may avail themselves of their right to strike or lock out. It is 
equally important to agree on the concept of technological change 
because definitions vary in some labour codes.
<P>
	We need a definition that is sufficiently broad to cover 
fundamental technological changes. A notice of technological 
change must state all the necessary information to be assessed by 
the unions and the workers, with detailed explanations. This 
information must include the costs, the impact, especially on the 
employees, as well as a schedule. This is why I totally agree with 
the motion introduced by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Since I still have a few minutes left, I would like to briefly 
mention a problem that we have in my riding. I am referring to 
Zellers, which announced last week that it will be closing its 
distribution centre in Montreal North and laying off 379 workers. 
This is a tragedy for Montreal North, where a third of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8524"> 8524 </A></B>
<P>
population is  already unemployed. Poverty in my riding is at a 
very high level.
<P>
	Zellers has made huge profits. Along with its parent company, 
the Bay, its sales exceeded $1 billion in 1995. Zellers now wants to 
close because the building is too old. In recent years, Zellers has 
introduced technological changes which have been accepted and 
implemented by the unions. It now claims that the building is too 
old. Most of these jobs will go to Ontario, to Scarborough in 
particular. This closing will generate incredible suffering.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	I think the federal government certainly bears some 
responsibility for this closing. The Liberal government was elected 
on a promise that it would create jobs, jobs, jobs. Now, jobs are 
eliminated everywhere, at Greenberg's, at Steinberg's last year, at 
Eaton's and now at Zellers.
<P>
	I call on the Minister of Industry to try to convince this company 
to change its decision and remain in activity in Montreal North. I 
also plead with the President of the Treasury Board, who pays 
regular visits to Quebec to tell people that this is the government 
that created the greatest number of jobs, even if this is not the case 
at all. There is more unemployment today than under the 
Conservative government.
<P>
	Above all, I call on the Minister of Labour, who introduced this 
Bill C-66 in the House. His riding is next to my riding of Bourassa. 
He represents the riding of Saint-Léonard and comes over in my 
riding to play politics, to support the Liberal candidate. He should 
also take care of problems like job creation and the closing of 
Zellers in Montreal North. This is a human tragedy. We should all 
make efforts to ensure that Zellers remains in activity in Montreal 
North and, most of all, to stop the transfer of jobs from Quebec to 
Ontario.
<P>
	I think that is what the federal government says, especially 
today, as the President of the Treasury Board accused us of creating 
instability. It is the federal government that is really creating 
instability, when it says that there is a separatist in Quebec and that 
it discourages entrepreneurs. This is not true. There is a lot of 
instability in Korea, but this country has never had as much foreign 
investment. The same thing is true for China. In China, there are 
human rights violations, but everybody wants to invest in China.
<P>
	This is an excuse. I urge the federal government to get involved 
in these matters to try to keep Zellers in Montreal North.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to get back to the topic, the official 
opposition put forward Motion No. 13, as we heard earlier, in order 
to amend the process provided in the code for dealing with 
technological  changes introduced while a collective agreement is 
in force.
<P>
	One of the amendments proposed would prohibit the employer 
from implementing the technological changes until an agreement is 
reached with the union. The process currently provided in the 
Canada Labour Code applies only when the parties have not 
included in their collective agreement their own process for dealing 
with the impact of technological changes on the job security of 
bargaining unit employees.
<P>
	Under the statutory process, if the employer and the trade union 
are unable to agree on the implementation of the proposed changes, 
the union may ask the board for authorization to serve notice to 
bargain for the purpose of revising relevant provisions of the 
collective agreement.
<P>
	Where such an application is made to the board, the employer 
may not implement the changes until the board either rejects the 
application, or an agreement is reached through the collective 
bargaining process, or the right to strike, or the right to lockout is 
acquired.
<P>
	The collective bargaining context has changed since the 
technological change provisions were first introduced in 1973. At 
the time, few if any collective agreements included mechanisms to 
address the impact of technological changes on job security. Today 
unions and employers routinely include their own mechanisms in 
their collective agreements designed to address significant changes 
in the workplace which impact on the job security of bargaining 
unit employees.
<P>
	This underlines the party's preference to deal with such changes 
through processes they design themselves. This also explains why 
the Sims task force, in reviewing the current technological change 
provisions in the code, concluded that no statutory changes were 
needed.
<P>
	Motion No. 14, the freeze on terms and conditions, put forward 
by the official opposition, would basically prohibit the employer 
from changing the terms and conditions of an expired collective 
agreement after the right to strike and lockout had been acquired so 
that the terms and conditions would continue to apply until a new 
agreement was entered into.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	Under the provisions of the code, the terms and conditions of an 
expired collective agreement must be maintained during the 
negotiation process until the right to strike or a lockout is acquired. 
After that point in the bargaining cycle, an employer, subject to the 
continuing duty to bargain in good faith, may change terms and 
conditions while the employees are entitled to initiate strike action.
<P>
	The Simms task force carefully examined the issue of what is 
commonly referred as the freeze period and concluded that an 
extension of the statutory freeze was  not needed. The task force 
noted that the parties are free to include a bridging provision in 
their collective agreement providing for a continuation of terms 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8525"> 8525 </A></B>
<P>
and conditions of employment beyond the date strike and lockout 
rights are acquired. However, such bridging clauses cannot be used 
by an employer to prevent a union from exercising legally acquired 
strike rights or by a union to prevent an employer from exercising 
legally acquired lockout rights.
<P>
	Other changes in the bill will maintain terms and conditions for 
those employees who will be required to continue working during a 
work stoppage in order to maintain those activities that are 
necessary to protect public health and safety or to provide services 
to grain vessels.
<P>
	Given the other provisions included in Bill C-66 that will protect 
the basic rights of employees on strike or locked out to continue 
group insurance coverage and give them access to arbitration for 
cases of dismissal or discipline, the extension of the freeze period 
up to the date of the conclusion of the new collective agreement 
would not represent a fair balance of the competing rights 
involved.
<P>
	The official opposition has submitted Motion No. 36 that would 
prohibit employers from expressing their views during the period 
when representation rights are being determined by the board. 
According to the new paragraph 94(2)(c) which implements the 
recommendation of the task force, an employer will be deemed not 
to commit an unfair labour practice by expressing its views so long 
as the employer does not use coercion, intimidation, threats, 
promises or undue influence.
<P>
	Several provincial labour laws already recognize explicitly the 
employers' right to express their views subject to similar 
limitations.
<P>
	Under the current section 94 of the code, it is an unfair labour 
practice for an employer to interfere with the formation or 
administration of a trade union or the representation of employees 
by a trade union. Section 94(2) describes certain permitted 
employer actions.
<P>
	Although section 94(2) provides no explicit exception for 
non-coercive employer speech, the law has never been that 
employers must remain absolutely silent. Accordingly, the Canada 
Labour Relations Board, in interpreting the general prohibition of 
employer interference, has implied the concept of free speech and 
placed similar restrictions as its provincial counterparts.
<P>
	Bill C-66 will therefore confirm the Canada Industrial Relations 
Board's responsibility to balance the employer's freedom of speech 
with the competing employee's freedom of association which are 
both guaranteed in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
We believe that the board is in the best position to define the 
parameters of employer free  speech and the appropriate standard, 
taking into account the context in which the speech issue arises and 
the nature of the collective bargaining relationship.
<P>
	We are confident that this new provision will in no way diminish 
the union's exclusive right to represent employees and we therefore 
ask the members of the House to support it.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am afraid the parliamentary 
secretary may have unwittingly misled the House. I would like to 
make sure there is no misunderstanding.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I am sorry, but this seems 
to be a point for debate, not a point of order. If the hon. member 
wants to take part in the debate, I believe he has already done so on 
this group, he will be able to join in the discussions when we debate 
the next group. If the hon. parliamentary secretary is willing to 
answer a question, he might do so with the House's permission, but 
this will require unanimous consent.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent for the hon. member to put a 
question to the parliamentary secretary?

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> I felt 
some disbelief on your part Mr. Speaker, but I do want you to know 
that I only have friends in this House.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary implied that Motion No. 14 moved 
by the official opposition, which derives from section 50 of the 
Quebec labour code, as I explained, is a clause providing for tacit 
reconduction of any collective agreement coming to an end so that 
it remains in force until a new agreement is signed. It is also known 
as an evergreen clause.
<P>
	If the interpreters did justice to what the parliamentary secretary 
meant, he told us that these provisions already exist in the labour 
code and that all collective agreements are deemed to remain in 
force until such time as a new agreement comes into effect.
<P>
	Is the parliamentary secretary still saying that the amendment we 
proposed is useless because the collective agreement remains in 
force and because there already is a tacit reconduction clause? 
Would he be willing to table, for the benefit of the official 
opposition, the legal opinion which supports this point of view, 
because it does not agree with testimony given by witnesses we 
heard in committee.

code, the terms and conditions of an expired collective agreement 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8526"> 8526 </A></B>
<P>
must be maintained during the negotiation process or until the right 
to strike or lockout is acquired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, after 
reviewing this group of amendments it seems to me that most of the 
information put forward by our colleagues from the Bloc concerns 
matters that should be negotiated in a collective agreement.
<P>
	I agree with the parliamentary secretary that the old agreement 
should stay in place until such time as negotiations break down and 
a strike vote or lockout has taken place. I would suggest that it is 
best for this to remain as it is. I am not willing to support Motion 
No. 14.
<P>
	Motion No. 13 is something that should be negotiated between 
the two interested parties.
<P>
	In my estimation, Motion No. 36 is very basic. It is about free 
speech. Some restrictions have been placed already on employers 
concerning what it takes to certify a union and what does not, what 
is coercion and what is undue pressure on employees. We must be 
very careful not to infringe on the rights of people to free speech 
and expression. In any campaign where for the certification or 
decertification of a union there will be some lobbying, some 
campaigning on behalf of both parties. I think that is natural. To not 
state the pros and cons and the possible outcome which could result 
is not much different from a political campaign. A scenario has to 
be laid out, a position and a plan put forward.
<P>
	I do not see it being much different in these cases. Most of the 
stuff we are talking about in the three amendments are things that 
should be negotiated between employer and employee.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, I do not know if you realize it, but we are 
coming to an extremely crucial and decisive point in today's 
debate. Until now, we were tempted to be indulgent and 
conciliatory, but I ask the government to take note that we are 
entering a period during which we will toughen our stand.
<P>
	There are limits to what the official opposition can put up with. 
We may live in a society of law, we may be civilized people, we 
may believe in the virtues of dialogue, but the fact remains that the 
government has gone too far. It has gone much farther than what 
the official opposition can ever put up with. Here I want to directly 
address, through you, Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	The first irritant, and I hope that the parliamentary secretary 
fully understands what we are talking about, is the 72 hour prior 
notice, an expression that means something important. Imagine, 
this takes the form of an obligation. We do not know where this 
came from, because it was not in the old labour code and, to our 
knowledge, and we were watchful, this was not asked for by the 
witnesses.
<P>
	Moreover, I saw in the ministerial notes that were communicated 
to us that it is claimed to be a consensus in the Sim report. I hope 
the government will be able to give us some sources, some 
evidence, because we will be in the unfortunate obligation to 
question the integrity, I would even say, the honesty of the 
government, with regard to its assessment of consensus.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8528"> 8528 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to make a demonstration that will have an premise, 
a development and a conclusion, as we were taught in the good 
old days of classical college. Starting from the beginning, I will 
try to describe the process to you.
<P>
	Fourth months before the expiry of a collective agreement, 
because this is always what we are talking about ultimately, it is 
possible to produce a notice, an intent to bargain, which we call a 
notice to bargain. In the previous code, it was three months, with 
Bill C-66, it is four. Therefore, the parties must bargain. Of course, 
we then understand that there either is an agreement or there is not.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	When there is no agreement on the items discussed in the 
bargaining process, the labour minister is first of all notified that 
there is no agreement, and then he has a number of courses of 
action. However, the major new element-and this was something 
the parties had been asking for-is that the conciliation process can 
be used only once. This new element means that it will no longer be 
possible to have two stages in the conciliation process.
<P>
	Do you follow, Mr. Speaker? I am trying to give a clear lecture, 
and I will to do so till the end.
<P>
	A notice to bargain is delivered four months before the expiry of 
the term of the collective agreement. Either there is an agreement 
or there is not. When no agreement can be reached, a notice of 
dispute is delivered. After this notice is delivered, sixty days must 
go by. This is a maximum, unless, by an exceptional procedure, the 
parties agree otherwise. During that period, the minister appoints 
an arbitrator, a conciliation commissioner, a conciliation board or 
an arbitration board.
<P>
	Also, a report has always to be tabled. Either there is an 
agreement or there is not. The parties are brought together. The 
process is well known. The thing that we must keep in mind, as 
members of Parliament, is that legislators provide for a sixty day 
period as a maximum. Again, this is unless, by an exceptional 
procedure, which is not the conventional procedure, the parties 
agree on a longer period.
<P>
	If there is no agreement, and it has happened in the past, in 
Parliament, and in the private sector, during negotiations, there is a 
14 day cooling off period, after which the union regains the right to 
strike. We cannot emphasize enough that strikes carry a price. It is 
the last resort, the most meaningful one, and workers do not make 
use of it before all the other options have been exhausted.
<P>
	Nobody will go on strike before all other alternatives have been 
exhausted. You are aware of that, Mr. Speaker, even if you tend to 
be rather conservative. Everybody in the labour relations 
community knows that. Witnesses have reminded us of that.
<P>
	Unions have the right to strike once the minister has ruled that 
the parties are free to exercise their right to strike or to lock out. 
During a strike, essential services have to be maintained according 
to the board's orders. But we have here a gap in the process, 
something that baffles the mind. It is hard to understand the 
minister's reasoning. Why is it necessary to have a 72 hour notice 
when it is the Minister of Labour himself, the very Sicilian member 
for Saint-Léonard, who releases the parties? Parties are free to act 
only by ministerial consent. How is this a useful addition to the 
process?
<P>
	The parties told us in committee that, during the period between 
the notice of a labour dispute and the time the right to strike is 
regained, they want to be able, but not forced, to conduct intensive 
negotiations.
<P>
	There is a number of tools and options the Minister of Labour 
can use. For instance, the minister can appoint a conciliation 
officer or a mediation officer, or opt for a conciliation board or a 
mediation board.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, a gentleman as vigilant as you are must have 
realized by now that the 72-hour subterfuge, since there are no 
other words to describe it, is in fact nothing more than a tactic used 
to weaken the relationship of power. We know full well that this 
compulsory advance notice gives the opposing party the 
opportunity to get organized.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Really, it is all in very poor taste. It is incomprehensible. I do not 
think I am wrong in saying that the NDP supports the position and 
amendment of the Bloc Quebecois. I must say that we are stunned 
and dismayed, because, until now, the process had been pretty well 
received. First, the negotiation process was shortened, because 
there was only one step left, and it made sense to have a little more 
time before the expiration notice. Once the notice to bargain was 
given, the two parties would start to talk to each other and, if no 
agreement was reached, the 60-day period kicked in and that period 
of time gave the minister a number of possibilities. In the end, if 
still no agreement could be reached, the ultimate option had to be 
considered. And that ultimate option was a strike. Previously, the 
cooling-off period lasted 7 days; it now is 14 days. But overall, the 
witnesses did not seem to be against this process. It was pretty well 
received, but everything is spoiled now.
<P>
	In fact, I am trying to contain myself, because this 14-day period 
will turn into a 21-day period according to another amendment 
included in another group of motions.
<P>
	I really do not know what the minister was thinking when he 
came up with these amendments that are not needed to ensure the 
balance we used to have and that was well received.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8529"> 8529 </A></B>
<P>
	We are concerned about the 72-hour period, because-and I will 
end on this note-72 hours are enough to weaken a relationship 
of power that took years to build.
<P>
	We cannot talk about labour relations without mentioning the 
balance of power that constantly shifts between the union and 
management.
<P>
	I will repeat it without any shame-you know that I am a straight 
talker-72 hours' advance notice is in very bad taste. The 
parliamentary secretary would gain in stature if he accepted to 
intercede with the Minister of Labour. Incidentally, we would like 
to have our greetings passed on to the minister, because we know 
that he is very interested in our work here. Everybody knows that.
<P>
	Through you, I would have only one word of advice for the 
parliamentary secretary and that would be to make aggressive 
representations and use all his well known speaking skills to ask 
the government to remove this clause because it completely upsets 
the balance the bill had almost reached. Without the 72 hours, the 
process would have been rather well accepted by the parties.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on this 
group of motions, I will try to remain calm, but it will not be easy.
<P>
	This bill, I repeat, is supposed to modernize the Canada Labour 
Code, to take into account different labour relations, to take into 
account that relations between unions and employers have changed 
considerably.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Instead of facilitating negotiations and, should they break down, 
the exercice of the right to strike or to lock out, which can rapidly 
lead to a negotiated settlement, this bill makes the rules more rigid 
and makes negotiating and reaching a settlement even more 
difficult.
<P>
	In this regard, it is a dismal failure. And one wonders what 
prompted the minister to completely overlook what could have 
improved the conditions under which the right of association and 
the right to strike can be exercised in Canada.
<P>
	My colleague from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve spoke about the 
obligation to give 72 hours' notice before the right to strike can be 
exercised. For my part, I would like to talk about what comes 
before. What comes before that is the requirement for unions to 
exercise their right to strike within 60 days of obtaining such right, 
otherwise they have to go back to their members for another strike 
vote. This is the provision of this bill that I find most difficult to 
understand. I was a negotiator at one time and, when I see this 
proposal, I wonder if those who thought of it have ever been 
involved in negotiations.
<P>
	If a union-and let us not forget that several of these unions are 
national-has just obtained the right to strike, it will start a 
negotiation process that could take a long time. If, after nearly 60 
days, it has not come to an agreement, what will it do? Will it do 
everything it can to come to an agreement at the risk of exceeding 
the 60 day limit and losing the right to strike? No. If it is 
responsible, it will stop negotiating instead of pursuing the 
negotiations and trying to find a solution. It will stop negotiating 
and submit a report that will allow it to win another strike vote.
<P>
	This 60 day rule will hinder the negotiation process instead of 
making it easier. It will impede the pursuit of a settlement and force 
unions to hold more strike votes. In the end, as I was saying, it will 
make the conditions that can lead to a settlement more rigid, less 
flexible.
<P>
	When you know that it is the basis of this bill, when you see that 
the right to strike or the right to lock out cannot be exercised-and 
I insist because some disputes end up in a lock-out or a strike and, 
at the beginning, nobody knows what will come first. When you 
add to that the 72 hour notice rule, it is even more difficult to 
understand.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	When things start to go wrong in a business and work starts to 
slow down, as a precautionary measure, the employer may be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8530"> 8530 </A></B>
<P>
tempted to lock his workers out to  avoid having to keep paying 
them to produce less. Let us be honest about that.
<P>
	No lockout action can be taken without giving notice at least 72 
hours in advance. Similarly, a union anxious to exercise its right to 
strike because bargaining is at a standstill will also be subject to a 
72-hour notice provision. Moreover, should no strike occur on the 
date indicated, a new 72-hour notice will have to be given.
<P>
	Again, this makes the use of these job actions available to either 
the employer or the workers rigid. Understandably, everyone wants 
to prevent strikes and lockouts, but sometimes, on matters of 
principle or money issues translating into matters of principle, one 
side or the other figures the only way to get what it wants is to use 
leverage.
<P>
	In those circumstances, the rules set out in the labour code must 
help and facilitate a settlement, and not make things drag on 
endlessly, get in the way of a settlement or even preclude a 
settlement that could have been reached had it not been for these 
rules. The fact of the matter is that we are going to end up with a 
worse Canada Labour Code than the one we had.
<P>
	That is quite embarrassing. I guess we could say the minister and 
the parliamentary secretary will have pie in the face, but in the end 
those who will be stuck with bad rules and a bad labour code are 
those in the field, those entitled to these services and the businesses 
that will have to contend with additional problems.
<P>
	At committee, we tried to get the point across that it made no 
common sense but, I will repeat it in this place, the way business 
was conducted in committee in no way does credit to this 
government.
<P>
	Legislation is passed a dozen at a time, but the legislation that is 
passed has no bearing on the code, is of no use to bargaining parties 
and is not the type that can be subject to arbitration or to a board 
decision. When it comes to drafting something that will make up a 
code, the committee should listen to those concerned and to the 
official opposition when it has something to say on the matter. We 
did not set out to embarrass the government because ultimately this 
is meant to serve the public. We have tried to help the government. 
But we were literally bulldozed out of the way; there is no other 
way to describe what happened at the human resources 
development committee.
<P>
	When all we have is ten minutes to discuss this important 
segment of the Canada Labour Code reform at report stage, we 
have no choice but to raise our voices.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the official opposition has put forward 
a series of motions that would remove the compulsory conciliation 
stage in the new requirements for the acquisition of the right to 
strike and  lockout, abolition of the conciliation process, Motion 
No. 34.
<P>
	However, before addressing this motion which would allow the 
parties to acquire the right to strike and lockout at the date of 
expiration of the collective agreement without having to file a 
notice of dispute with the minister or to complete the conciliation 
process, it is important to stress the role of conciliation in the 
collective bargaining cycle under the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	During the extensive consultation process leading up to the 
introduction of Bill C-66, representatives of labour and 
management organizations subject to Part I of the code, while 
critical of lengthy delays in the current conciliation process, found 
conciliation itself valuable and praised the services offered by the 
federal mediation and conciliation service.
<P>
	The labour-management working group did not recommend that 
compulsory conciliation be abolished as proposed by the official 
opposition. It requested that the two stage process be replaced by a 
shorter one stage process which could take various forms. The 
official opposition is asking us to ignore the labour management 
consensus which is reflected in the changes included in Bill C-66.
<P>
	Extending the cooling off period, government Motion No. 35. 
While the new conciliation process has received general support by 
labour and management, some parties have expressed concerns 
with respect to the duration of the cooling off period that the bill 
will extend from its current 7 days to 14 days. Finding some merit 
to these concerns, the government proposes to amend Bill C-66 to 
increase the duration of that period to 21 days. This is the purpose 
of Motion No. 35.
<P>
	The cooling off period is designed to give the parties time to 
evaluate their respective positions and weigh the consequences of a 
decision to resort to economic sanctions. During this period 
pressure on both sides is at its peak and there are high expectations 
of the mediation that may take place.
<P>
	Given the changes made to the conciliation process and given the 
fact that some federal businesses are active over a large geographic 
area and have nationwide bargaining units that can make the 
logistics of mediation meetings difficult, some have expressed 
doubts as to whether the 14 day cooling off period as provided for 
in the bill will be sufficient to give the parties a serious opportunity 
to settle their dispute and to have a positive impact on the work of 
the mediator. This amendment will provide a more realistic 
timeframe for the mediator to discharge his or her mandate.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 15, 16 and 17, strike and lockout notice. Under 
Bill C-66 the right to strike and lockout will be required 21 days 
after the conciliation is completed,  subject to the parties meeting 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8531"> 8531 </A></B>
<P>
new requirements regarding the holding of a secret ballot vote 
within the previous 60 days and giving a 72 hour advance notice.
<P>
	The official opposition has put forward Motions Nos. 15, 16 and 
17 which would delete the reference to the 72 hour notice 
requirement and the obligation to send a new notice if no strike or 
lockout occurs at the end of the notice period.
<P>
	The purpose of the new 72 hour notice provision which 
implements a recommendation of the tax force is twofold. First, it 
will allow for an orderly shut down or reduction of operations and 
alleviate the problems of perishables. Second, it will further focus 
the parties on serious negotiations and should encourage settlement 
of disputes.
<P>
	To those unions which have expressed concern that this new 
requirement will frustrate their right to strike, we want to point out 
that Bill C-66 will not require that a new notice be given once a 
strike or lockout action has commenced, even if it is temporarily 
suspended. Furthermore, when the other sides begins first with a 
strike or lockout action the requirement will not apply to the other 
party.
<P>
	Some other unions, mostly longshore unions, expressed the view 
that the 72 hour notice will allow an unfair advantage to the 
shipping companies and agents in the negotiation process, as it will 
remove the prospect of ships being held captive during a port work 
stoppage. This position is echoed by the official opposition.
<P>
	The major economic impact of a port work stoppage is that the 
port is closed and the fixed capital remains idle. Such a major 
impact on important investments is a significant pressure point and 
a reasonable offset for the loss of income employees must incur 
during a work stoppage.
<P>
	We believe that the 72 hours notice requirement will provide an 
appropriate balance between these two competing interests.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 18 and 23, strikes and lockout votes. The official 
opposition is proposing two sets of motions relating to the strike 
and lockout vote requirement. With Motion No. 18 the vote 
requirement would simply be removed from the bill, whereas with 
Motions Nos. 20 to 23 the statute would require a vote but include 
no conditions for its conduct and no means for voters to challenge 
its validity.
<P>
	It is important to stress that with the exception of the current 
Canada Labour Code secret ballot strike votes are mandatory in all 
Canadian jurisdictions as a prerequisite for legal strike action.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Although the vast majority of unions subject to the code already 
hold secret ballot votes before declaring a strike in the absence of a 
statutory requirement,  employees in the bargaining unit who are 
not union members may be excluded from participating in a major 
decision which directly affects them.
<P>
	Second, strike votes are not always held in a timely fashion. In 
some cases a strike mandate is acquired early in the bargaining 
process as a means of demonstrating solid employee support for 
union demands but which may not be a true reflection of support 
for a work stoppage.
<P>
	The conditions for a valid vote specified in Bill C-66 reflect the 
recommendations of the Sims task force. They are similar to 
provisions found in a number of provincial statutes and they are not 
onerous.
<P>
	The vote must be held by secret ballot among all employees in 
the bargaining unit or among all employers in the association 
within 60 days prior to strike or lockout action. Eligible voters 
must be given reasonable opportunity to participate in the vote.
<P>
	Finally, the union or employer's association must obtain 
majority support among the employees or employers who 
participate in the vote.
<P>
	It is hard to imagine that any democratically held vote would fail 
to meet these basic requirements. These conditions will simply 
ensure that such votes are timely, fairly conducted and are based on 
the entire workplace involved in this dispute.
<P>
	Government Motion No. 19, extension of the 60 day vote period. 
Concerns have been raised that the 60 day period for holding a 
strike vote may cause difficulties in some cases, particularly where 
employees in the bargaining unit are dispersed across the country 
or do not work at a specific location.
<P>
	To address these legitimate concerns, the government has 
introduced a motion to allow the 60 day validity period for a strike 
or lockout vote to be extended by written agreement of the parties.
<P>
	This amendment is consistent with the general approach in Bill 
C-66 supported by labour and management that legislation should 
be flexible enough to meet the specific needs of the parties.
<P>
	Government Motion No. 33, no strike or lockout during the term 
of the collective agreement. Another amendment that would further 
improve Bill C-66 is Motion No. 33 which will clarify the scope of 
the prohibition set out in the new section 88.1.
<P>
	The only exception to the prohibition on strikes and lockout 
during the term of the collective agreement under section 88.1 as 
currently drafted is where a notice to bargain has been served 
pursuant to a reopener provision in the party's collective 
agreement.
<P>
	However, there are other situations contemplated by the code 
that allow for notice to bargain and therefore full negotiations to 
take place before the expiry of a collective agreement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8532"> 8532 </A></B>
<P>
	There are also some instances in the current code and in what 
will be the amended code when the board has discretion to 
authorize a party to give notice to bargain other than during the 
last four months of a collective agreement.
<P>
	This motion adjusts the language of section 88.1 to ensure that 
where notice to bargain is authorized to be served during the term 
of an agreement, the parties may acquire the right to strike or 
lockout once they have completed a conciliation process and met 
the other statutory prerequisite.
<P>
	I would ask members to support this motion as well as Motions 
No. 19 and 35.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-66 
provides that the right to strike or lockout will be subject to the 
holding of a secret ballot vote during the previous 60 days and the 
giving of a notice of at least 72 hours.
<P>
	This is a very anti-union and unfair provision for workers and 
unions. The right to strike is being subjected to so many conditions 
and restrictions that the next step will be to eliminate this right.
<P>
	First, the right to strike and the right to lockout are put on the 
same level. However, the right to strike is exercised by a group of 
workers. There has to be a majority vote. But in the case of a 
lockout, there is no vote. A company official decides when to lock 
employees out, which is unfair.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Then, a secret ballot vote must be held. This means that the 
union must convince workers that the offer is not acceptable, that 
the ultimate recourse against the employer is to take a strike vote. 
This is not easy for unions. During my years with the FTQ, the 
Quebec federation of labour, we had to convince the majority of 
workers of the need, at some point, for a strike vote.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the employer who works every day with a group of 
employees may sometime exert undue and unwarranted pressure to 
convince them of the opposite, of the fact that they must not go on 
strike, that working conditions are acceptable, that the offer is an 
excellent one, etc.
<P>
	Worse still is the fact that, to have the right to strike, the vote 
must be held at most 60 days before the strike. This means that if 
negotiations last for months, and even years, several consecutive 
strike votes will have to be held. This is unfair for unions. Unions 
should have the right to assess the situation and to set a date for a 
strike vote. The union should also be the one deciding when the 
vote will apply and when the strike will begin.
<P>
	Not only must this secret ballot vote be held within 60 days of 
the strike, but an advance notice of at least 72 hours must be given 
to the employer. This is going too  far. One wonders what will 
happen to the right to strike in Canada, a right that is provided 
under the Canada Labour Code. For all intents and purposes, it will 
be almost impossible to go on strike with so many restrictions.
<P>
	There are conventions under the International Labour 
Organization that recognize the workers' right to strike. This 
provision, introduced by the government as an amendment to the 
Canada Labour Code, goes against the ILO principles that 
recognize the right to strike.
<P>
	I wanted to express my absolute opposition to these very unfair 
and anti-union provisions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member who just sat down tried to claim that these members are 
anti-union. When I read through their recommendations where they 
have objection to secret ballot votes, I have to wonder if maybe 
their amendments are not anti-democratic. What better way to 
express a view on anything than through a secret ballot.
<P>
	We talked earlier in other amendments about undue pressure 
being put on either one side or the other to come to a decision that 
was considered to be harassment, undue pressure or otherwise 
excessive convincing. I do not think we can have it both ways. We 
cannot say that this group is not allowed to express their rights but 
this group is allowed to express their rights and to put on whatever 
pressure is necessary so that they can come out with a favourable 
outcome of their vote.
<P>
	What are they suggesting, that they have a show of hands only or 
a mail in ballot? A secret vote is the only way to go.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	The government has made some amendments that are worthy of 
support. I have recommended to our caucus that we support them 
as they seem to make good sense and are not in any way 
confrontational. In this particular area we should be doing 
everything we can to seek a balance and to make sure that one side 
does not have all the ammunition and the other side just has a 
shield.
<P>
	Rather than going on and on in this regard, we would be willing 
to support Motions Nos. 19, 33 and 35. However I am unable to 
come up with the proper rationale to support any of the Bloc 
amendments.

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak in support of the amendments contained in group 
No. 7.
<P>
	I have received letters from several grain farmers over the past 
months with respect to Bill C-66. They have said that at the least 
this piece of legislation would require that grain moves through the 
port once it arrives there. They said that would help to some extent. 
There have been many work stoppages over the years. Grain has 
arrived at port and one thing or another has stopped it from moving. 
The farmers have said that legislation would help.
<P>
	Farmers did not know that part of the legislation would make 
things much worse, the measure to prevent the use of replacement 
workers. That could lead to a slower movement of grain and more 
damage to farmers as a result of having their commodity held up en 
route to port or as it is being loaded on a ship.
<P>
	Farmers are torn on this issue. I want to speak for them on it. 
There is a better solution than the one offered in the legislation. The 
farmers have told me so and I will speak on behalf of the ones who 
have contacted me.
<P>
	Grain farmers have suffered for too long. Some have seen their 
livelihood for an entire year being snatched away due to poor 
weather conditions. As well, often their grain has either been left 
on the farm or in local elevators due to some kind of movement 
disruption. That has happened too often.
<P>
	One of the first pieces of legislation I spoke on when I came to 
Ottawa in 1994 had to do with putting grain handlers at the port of 
Vancouver back to work. It was back to work legislation. We have 
seen back to work legislation again and again. When we have 
government interfering, forcing the system to work through back to 
work legislation, clearly there are problems in the system which 
have to be dealt with.
<P>
	I forget the number but there have been something like 20 
stoppages over the years I remember. I remember as a very young 
boy on the farm getting grain ready to go  to market and desperately 
needing the money from the grain to meet day to day expenses, to 
buy clothes and food for the family. Then I would hear about a 
stoppage in the grain handling system. There might have been 
some problem with the railway. More often than not the grain 
handlers were on strike at the port. Any one of the many links in the 
system might have broken down. Who paid the price? The captive 
shippers, in this case the grain farmers who have no other practical 
way of getting their commodity to the ships so they can get paid. 
This has happened again and again.
<P>
	As I said, one of the first pieces of legislation that I spoke on was 
to legislate the grain handlers back to work. The problem had not 
been solved.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	Will this piece of legislation help? To some extent it will. At 
least grain that makes it to the port will be moved through the 
system and loaded on to ships. That is not enough, not close to 
enough. It is not only grain farmers who are affected by a system 
that does not come through again, again and again. It is people with 
many other commodities who have no other way of getting them to 
port other than by railway. It is a system that breaks down on them 
again and again and costs them dearly. The legislation does not fix 
the system.
<P>
	What has Reform proposed over the three and a half years we 
have been here? We have proposed many different solutions to the 
problem. In my second speech in the House in February 1994 I 
proposed the use of final offer selection arbitration which my 
colleague has mentioned in the House as a permanent solution to 
the problem.
<P>
	Final offer selection arbitration allows for the bargaining process 
to take place but absolutely prevents a stoppage in grain movement 
right from the local elevator to the ship. That is the solution 
farmers need. That is the solution other captive shippers need. 
Nothing less than that is good enough, and this legislation provides 
a lot less. With the negatives it is questionable whether it will make 
things better or worse. On balance it could well make things worse.
<P>
	We need this change. The Reform member for Lethbridge put 
forward a private member's bill respecting a final offer selection 
arbitration some time back in 1994. That bill was debated in the 
House and I believe it was votable. Had it passed it would have 
become legislation. Did we get support from the same government 
that is now presenting this piece of legislation? Did we get support 
from the Bloc? Did we get support from anybody for that 
legislation?
<P>
	We never got support from anybody in the House but we got 
support right across western Canada from grain farmers who are 
fed up with having constant disruptions in grain movement that 
cost them so dearly when they can ill afford it. They are already at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8535"> 8535 </A></B>
<P>
the mercy of the  weather and world prices, world prices being low 
more often than not due to government interference in the market.
<P>
	It is not just the American government and the European 
governments that interfere in the market and do not allow the 
market to work properly. It is also the Canadian government. 
Canadian governments-Conservative and Liberal-have been 
interfering for some time. This has led to depressed prices. Farmers 
have had to deal with all this and with continual disruptions.
<P>
	It is time for some real change. It is time we put in place final 
offer arbitration as a way to ensure that captive shippers get their 
products loaded on to ships in a timely fashion. This legislation 
will not do that unless we include these amendments and clearly 
end disruptions in the handling system once and for all. Farmers 
deserve no less.
<P>
	In the red book the government included virtually nothing on 
agriculture. As an afterthought an addendum was added which 
included a lot of nice things to help make things better for farmers. 
It is time the government delivered on at least this one.
<P>
	It is time not to settle for quarter or half measures. It is time to 
solve the problem. The government has an opportunity to deal with 
the problem and to say that it will solve the problem completely. 
Maybe that is overstating the case but it would certainly help in a 
dramatic way. That is why I speak in support of Group No. 7 
amendments. I encourage the Liberal government to finally do 
something for grain farmers. They are being held hostage by the 
grain handling system. Right now, once again this year, grain is not 
moving.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	During the elimination of the Crow benefit, the changes to the 
Canada Transportation Act and the privatization of CN Rail I called 
again and again for measures, as did my colleagues, that would put 
competition into the system. It would have fixed the car allocation 
process. It would have made the system work.
<P>
	The government did not heed our call for action. Here is a chance 
for it to make up for that in some small way. It should support this 
group of amendments that will finally allow for movement of grain 
right from the local elevator to the ship without disruption. It is the 
least that farmers should expect from the government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I really want those who are following what we are doing 
to realize that, with the amendments proposed by the Reform 
Party-and I am not using any euphemisms, it is not a figure of 
style, I mean it literally-we are faced with amendments aimed at 
reducing the workers' right to strike. We would not have  believed 
it possible for clauses of this nature to be brought forward.
<P>
	For purely instructional reasons-I cannot be other than 
instructional since I am next to the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Temiscouata, who is a teacher-I would simply like to 
review for those who are following the debate just what is 
involved.
<P>
	Clause 87.7(1) of the bill concerns access and services to grain 
vessels. The entire question of western grain, as we are all aware, 
even without any connection to the west, is of absolutely vital 
importance. This is a key sector of the economy.
<P>
	What the legislator is giving here is a balanced point of view, one 
which, in committee-and I believe I am correct in saying 
this-even the ports people, the national stevedoring committee, 
indicated that they were somewhat in favour of the obligation, the 
maintaining of this obligation, to load vessels.
<P>
	To quote the clause in question more precisely: ``During a work 
stoppage, an employer in the long-shoring industry or other port 
industry, or its employees, shall continue to provide the services 
they normally provide to ensure the tie-up, let-go and loading of 
grain vessels and the movement of the grain vessels in and out of a 
port''. It is understood that this is where shipping for export is 
involved, where anticipated high and low demand is a sensitive 
issue, so it makes sense to maintain such an obligation. I repeat, 
this clause in Bill C-66 was favourably received by the workers 
concerned.
<P>
	A little further it says that unless the parties otherwise agree, 
rates of pay or any other terms or conditions of employment of the 
employees assigned to grain vessels during a strike are those 
provided in the previous collective agreement. I repeat, this is a 
wise provision.
<P>
	And finally, on application by one of the parties or on referral by 
the minister, the board may make any order it considers appropriate 
to ensure compliance with that subsection. We are told that this 
new provision implements the proposal by the task force to include 
such a requirement in the labour code to prevent successive 
interruptions of grain exports as a result of work stoppages by 
employers and employees in a port.
<P>
	Two years ago we, as parliamentarians, experienced the impact 
of a work stoppage involving the grain industry and the ports.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	To avoid repeated work stoppages that can have a serious 
economic impact without depriving people of their right to strike, 
we agree with the proposed procedure.
<P>
	We were surprised, however, to see that in the amendments 
proposed by the Reform Party, the reference was no longer to grain 
vessels but to all vessels. As though potash, uranium, steel, 
newsprint, recycled  materials, bulk commodities, spices, and so 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8536"> 8536 </A></B>
<P>
forth, should be treated exactly the same way. As though all export 
or shipping traffic should be treated the same way as the grain 
sector.
<P>
	This is frivolous, and it is an unjustified restriction of the right to 
strike. Several times witnesses, especially for the employer side, 
came to tell us that we, as parliamentarians, should agree to expand 
the provisions significantly beyond grain vessels, and every time 
the official opposition said that this was impossible, that we did not 
think it was desirable or reasonable.
<P>
	What reasons does the Reform Party have for wishing to restrict 
the right to strike or to expand the obligation to provide loading 
services? We agree with the provisions in the bill that say that in 
the case of grain vessels, nothing should be allowed to interrupt the 
loading, tie-up and let-go of grain vessels.
<P>
	We cannot agree with that, and we cannot agree to generalize the 
provision contained in Bill C-66.
<P>
	To do so would impose restrictions on and considerably 
undermine the rights of workers, and we do not want to be 
associated with such a process. I believe we will have a chance to 
see and comment on the scope of the Reform Party's amendments 
when we consider the next group of amendments, which deal with 
replacement workers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my friend 
from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve asked rather rhetorically what 
motivated the Reform Party to present these amendments. I am 
happy to tell him what our motivation was.
<P>
	We are in favour of any measure, within reason, that helps the 
farmers get grain to port, on to the ships and to market. However, 
why has only grain been given this priority? A lot of other 
commodities in Canada have to be shipped. Certainly grain is a 
very important commodity and it fits into another specific category 
which a lot of others do not. It is a food stuff, a staple which is 
perishable. That makes it fit into two categories.
<P>
	There are coal, potash, lumber, plenty of other commodities 
which may or may not reach port, which may sit in the mill yard or 
at the mine and be held up because of a rail strike or because of 
other unions which may be on strike or locked out. It is a work 
disruption that prevents those products from getting to port and 
ultimately to market.
<P>
	I do not have to tell the House that the Canadian economy is 
rather fragile and needs an infusion or transfusion. The Canadian 
economy has suffered hit after hit because of work stoppages which 
resulted in lost markets, of ships going to other ports to get similar 
commodities because they have been assured they will be loaded.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	I do not have to tell members that if a ship is turned away from a 
port once or twice its owner may say: ``We are tired of that sort of 
treatment. We are going to make permanent arrangements with 
another port''. The port of Vancouver has lost business in the past 
to the port of Seattle simply because Seattle seems to be a more 
reliable port over a long period of time.
<P>
	That is why we have introduced these amendments. We also feel 
that final offer selection arbitration is a good tool, although the 
Sims task force did not seem to agree with us. It stated that the use 
of final offer arbitration would create a situation where there would 
seem to be a winner and a loser. That is possible. However, final 
offer selection arbitration would also have the effect of having 
those parties bargain to the point where the winner would not win a 
lot and the loser would not lose a lot. If the parties knew it could 
come to that, they would probably reach an agreement before the 
arbitrator was ever named.
<P>
	Therefore, I cannot encourage the House strongly enough to 
consider the use of final offer selection arbitration.
<P>
	Let me read some comments from standing committee witnesses 
with regard to this amendment that separates grain as a commodity 
and does not allow the others.
<P>
	Donald Downing, president of the Coal Association of Canada, 
had this to say: ``This amendment cannot be allowed to stand as it 
discriminates between commodities and makes a special case for 
one. It suggests the Government of Canada places a priority and a 
special status on grain that would be impossible for us to explain to 
our valued coal customers in over 20 countries''. I think that speaks 
volumes. How would the coal association explain this? ``Yes, it is 
true that if grain arrives at port that the right to strike has been 
taken away from the people who load the grain, but if coal arrives 
at port it is just going to have to sit there and wait''.
<P>
	I have a couple of other quotes here that I may or may not read 
into the record but they are on the record of the House of Commons 
Standing Committee on Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Section 87.4 allows for the continuation of a service in a 
strike/lockout situation if there is a danger to public health and 
safety. That is a good amendment, but I would submit that it needs 
to have one more caveat attached to it which is that there should be 
some provision for the protection of the national economy. I 
suppose one could say that absolutely anything could affect the 
national economy, but we are talking about things that have a huge 
effect on the national economy and a huge effect on Canada's 
reputation as a reliable supplier of these commodities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8537"> 8537 </A></B>
<P>
	My colleague from Vegreville has talked about final offer 
selection arbitration. I have spoken on it several times today and 
numerous times in the past. We will probably continue to do so 
in the future because it is a tool that is not discriminatory to either 
management or labour. It is a tool that can be used equally by 
either one.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	It is a rather unique situation. It is a tool that, if used to its 
ultimate, is not used at all. Therefore it is exactly what the situation 
calls for. What we have now is a situation where the parties are 
discouraged from reaching an agreement. Maybe discouraged is a 
bit too strong. At least they are not encouraged to bargain 
something they can both live with because they know, and the 
employer is just as guilty as the employees, it is not really 
necessary to come to terms at this point. ``Let's hold out and we 
will only be out a few days. We will be legislated back to work''. 
We have plenty of precedents. They are only out for three or four 
days. Parliament legislates them all back to work.
<P>
	What has happened to their right to strike there? That is taking 
the right to strike or the right to lockout completely out of their tool 
box.
<P>
	I really think it is important to the Canadian economy and 
ultimately to jobs in this country. We all know how important jobs 
are. Every time we lose an international customer for whether it is 
coal, grain, potash or lumber we are losing jobs. We simply cannot 
afford that. I am sure members will agree.
<P>
	In committee the member for Humber-St. Barbe-Baie Verte 
secured passage of an amendment that would help prevent work 
stoppages on the Atlantic ferry operating between North Sydney 
and Port aux Basques, Newfoundland. In essence it was declared an 
essential service. It was a great amendment, one that was certainly 
important to the member who introduced it and to the people of 
Newfoundland. For one reason or another, perhaps known only to 
the government, that amendment does not show up.
<P>
	I would like to express my disappointment. It was a good 
amendment. It should have been here.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to speak to the amendments put forward by the members of the 
Reform Party, because it is important to make the distinction I do 
not think was made between what they want to do and the intent, 
even misguided, of the law, which was to recognize that there are 
essential services.
<P>
	As you know, regardless of where we look in this country, there 
are no real miracles. Either strikes and lockouts are recognized and 
certain essential services maintained for reasons of public health 
and safety or they are not. In fact, however, no country is able to  
prevent strikes and lockouts. So most countries have opted for 
provisions to regulate essential services.
<P>
	The Government of Canada, which had no such provision in past 
disputes, is trying to plug that loophole with clause 87(4), which 
states that if it:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-is of the opinion that a strike or lockout could pose an immediate and serious 
danger to the safety or health of the public-</BLOCKQUOTE>
the board may issue an order to decide what activities should be 
designated and how and to what extent the employer and 
employees should attempt to come to an understanding.
<P>
	So, in the event of serious public health and safety concerns, the 
board will ask the parties to negotiate. And if the parties fail to 
reach an understanding, the board may decide what must be done.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party wants to add ``severe economic hardship to 
the national economy'' to the provisions on public health and 
safety, to the imminent and serious danger to the safety or health of 
the public. They have two amendments to that effect.
<P>
	Let me tell you that the board would be at a loss to determine 
what ``severe economic hardship to the national economy'' means. 
It seems to me that it would be hard to determine, given that, with 
unemployment soaring to 15 per cent in Montreal, one can wonder 
what it takes to qualify as severe economic hardship.
<P>
	This provision does not seem relevant. They did provide an 
explanation. But the truth is that severe economic hardship cannot 
be used as a criterion in determining the services that should be 
considered essential.
<P>
	The other very important amendment they made does not limit 
the employees' right to strike or the employer's right to lock 
workers out by designating some services as essential but by 
eliminating these rights altogether. That is in section 87.7, and I 
should point out that an agreement was reached. We were under the 
impression that both the unions and the employers in the 
long-shoring industry agreed with the contents of section 87.7, 
which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>During a strike or lockout not prohibited by this Part, an employer in the 
long-shoring industry, or other industry included in paragraph (<I>a</I>) of the definition 
``federal work, undertaking or business'' in section 2, its employees and their 
bargaining agent shall continue to provide the services they normally provide to 
ensure the tie-up, let-go and loading of grain vessels and the movement of the grain 
vessels in and out of a port.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I know that the unions were in agreement because of their past 
experiences with lockouts and special legislation that was imposed 
on them when they were prepared to continue loading grain 
vessels. I know, I gave evidence to that effect and I can attest to it 
here because,  as it happens, I was the critic on this issue when the 
final offer mechanism was used to settle a dispute, and I know that 
employers took advantage of the fact no such provision existed. 
Sometimes the employers are right, sometimes the unions are right, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8538"> 8538 </A></B>
<P>
but in that particular case, the employers clearly played a dirty trick 
on the unions.
<P>
	The unions representing the longshoremen were prepared to 
continue loading the grain. Day after day, they repeatedly told us in 
the House that grain, and not potash, coal, or any other raw 
materials, was to be loaded into vessels or should we say unloaded, 
but this was not included in the amendment.
<P>
	So, to remove the fact that they meant grain vessels and to 
change this section, as they are doing, means that dockers could 
never strike no matter what type vessel was involved. Clearly, this 
provision is impracticable. As I said at the beginning, everybody 
knows in the end that options exist.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	Either we restrict the right to strike and to lock out by invoking 
essential services, or else we prohibit them. If we prohibit them, we 
know that we are opening the door to illegal strikes and lockouts 
which complicate the situation, and are against the rules.
<P>
	In this second section, Reform members remove this ``essential 
services'' aspect. This aspect is related to grain vessels and 
interested parties agreed that for grain vessels, the right to strike 
would not exist. Services for grain vessels are essential, but other 
port activities will be limited by the definition of essential services.
<P>
	I understand the pressure exerted on grain producers, but it 
seems to me that this issue, about which we heard a lot, is answered 
in clause 87.7. As for other producers, the government is trying to 
prohibit the right to strike or lockout, with the result that it will be 
done illegally and in conditions that we do not accept. The idea is 
to provide for some essential services in the labour code.
<P>
	I will end on an interrogative or humorous note. I am leaving it 
up to members opposite to choose the term that best applies. The 
committee proposed an amendment to clause 87.8. This 
amendment provided that the freight and passenger service 
between Port-aux-Basques, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia 
should be considered an essential service. I see that this small 
amendment proposed by the committee without the minister's 
approval was withdrawn by the minister at report stage. I imagine 
Liberal members will have something to say about this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to enter into the debate today to talk about the provisions that 
my colleagues in the Reform Party have mentioned. The 
amendments we are trying to  propose here today would ensure 
final offer binding arbitration for the situation in the grain and 
transportation industry, in the whole delivery system for what is a 
very important part of the Canadian economy, the export market.
<P>
	I would argue whether it is in the national interest or not but it is 
very important for continuing service in the domestic markets as 
well. With tongue in cheek I must chastize my colleagues from the 
Reform Party who talked so much about the grain producers, which 
is worthwhile. I know many grain producers.
<P>
	I would like to talk about the necessity to provide an assured 
transportation system for the feed industry. The feed industry in a 
province like my own relies extensively or maybe exclusively on 
the ability of the rail system to deliver feed in a timely fashion to 
the west coast for the use in our own feed industry.
<P>
	West of the Rockies in my area in the Fraser Valley we probably 
have the biggest concentration of the chicken and dairy industry. 
There are hundreds of chicken, dairy and hog farmers all relying on 
a grain system and delivery system that will give them what they 
need in a timely fashion.
<P>
	I mention this because this is not a theoretical discussion about 
the importance of assuring this system is not interrupted for any 
length of time.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	The feed industry in the lower mainland has been denied access 
to grain delivery from the prairies. It has had to resort to trucking 
grain from Alberta to the Fraser Valley to try to keep chicken 
farmers and the rest of the farm industries in my area from running 
out of feed for their livestock.
<P>
	They have heard every excuse under the sun. It has been blamed 
on the weather, a lack of locomotives, farmers, being unable to spot 
cars in the prairies and who knows what. I do not know if the 
minister knows. He certainly has not done a whole lot to help them 
out.
<P>
	It is an example of a system that both export and domestic 
markets rely on being interrupted for whatever reason. Not only 
does it hurt our reputation abroad. It also hurts our ability to look 
after our own industries. Whether it can be blamed on the weather 
or on the government, it points out the necessity of having an 
assured supply of grain delivered to the west coast.
<P>
	If the government is not prepared to entertain the idea of final 
offer binding arbitration it needs to do something to reassure the 
feed industry in my area will somehow be able to intervene to make 
sure it gets grain.
<P>
	There are not enough trucks available in British Columbia to 
haul grain in the amount required to look after the industry in the 
lower mainland. The grain has to be trucked all the way from 
Alberta, maybe 700, 800 or 900 kilometres one way, to the feed 
mills in the  Chilliwack area in order to sustain the industry on an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8539"> 8539 </A></B>
<P>
ongoing basis. They cannot hire enough trucks. Maybe the hon. 
member has enough trucks to help out, but farmers in my area 
cannot hire enough trucks to get that much feed delivered.
<P>
	As grain cars back up across the prairies and on sidings at Boston 
Bar, tantalizingly close but still not delivered to the feed mills, we 
see the crisis develop in a hurry in the lower mainland.
<P>
	I ask the government to consider what we are proposing today. 
We do not want to see our domestic market hung up because 
somebody threw their hands up in the air and walked away from a 
labour dispute. We have to be able to say that from production to 
delivery there is a system exporters can count on. Equally 
important and certainly even more important in my riding is the 
ability to know we can rely on the transportation system day in and 
day out, year in and year out, to get feed to the feed bins.
<P>
	If we cannot do that in British Columbia I can tell the House 
what will happen. The agricultural industry which relies on the 
grain from the prairies will die a slow, withering death in British 
Columbia. Over the last two or three weeks we have seen an 
industry begging for some kind of government intervention to 
provide enough grain to feed the chickens. They should be able to 
rely on that and if they cannot they will do what they have to do.
<P>
	They are telling me that if they cannot rely on the grain delivery 
system into the lower mainland, they will have to take their 
industry somewhere else. To tell farmers in the lower mainland that 
they are just not wanted is unacceptable. There should be some way 
to assure them that the export market important. We should 
encourage diversity and value added in the agricultural industry. 
We should encourage the feed industry and exports.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	If I can use an agricultural term, one thing feeds on another and 
together it creates a critical mass of agricultural industries from 
suppliers to machinery dealers, to machine shops, to people such as 
Ty-crop in my area that has sprung up around an agricultural 
industry because of a certain critical mass there. They have become 
internationally known. All those things are at risk if the 
government does not assure a supply of grain to farmers.
<P>
	Over the last few days some of the grain stuck on sidings in 
Boston Bar, sniffing distance away, have come to market. The 
inability to spot cars on the prairies and the inability to guarantee 
delivery have the whole feed industry in a turmoil. The industry 
needs that assurance.
<P>
	By not assuring farmers of the future and of that supply farmers 
will start voting with their feet and with their cheque books. They 
will leave an area of uncertainty for an area of assurance. They will 
either  move to the prairies, move to the states or move somewhere 
if they cannot count on our delivery system.
<P>
	I urge the government to consider these amendments which will 
assure timely delivery to the feed industry. It will help producers 
and consumers, in this case the feed industry, to do the job the 
Canadian government and the rest of us have asked them to do. I 
ask the government to consider these amendments in the light of 
what I have presented today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-66 introduces for the first time 
in the Canada Labour Code provisions which will require the 
maintenance of activities necessary to prevent immediate and 
serious danger to public health and safety during work stoppages.
<P>
	My colleagues in the Reform Party are proposing by Motions 
Nos. 24 and 25 to extend the application of these provisions to a 
much broader range of activities by making economic hardship to 
the national economy a criterion for requiring parties to maintain 
services during a work stoppage. Bill C-66 also introduces a 
requirement for employers and employees in the ports to continue 
to provide services to grain vessels in the event of a work stoppage.
<P>
	The aim of this proposal is twofold: to ensure the continued 
movement of grain exports and to reduce reliance on legislative 
interventions to terminate and resolve port-labour management 
disputes. The Reform Party is seeking to extend the application of 
this provision to all commodities exported through the ports. These 
changes to Bill C-66 would effectively remove strike and lockout 
rights from large numbers of employers and employees subject to 
the code.
<P>
	Let us recognize this approach for what it really is: a denial of 
free collective bargaining rights for large numbers of workers and 
employers in the federal labour jurisdiction, an approach more 
commonly associated with less democratic societies. We all know 
how successful such states have been in solving their economic and 
social problems.
<P>
	Representatives of both labour and business told the Sims task 
force that they want to be able to frame their own agreements rather 
than have third party solutions imposed upon them. In their view 
third party solutions have had a history of failure, particularly when 
the issues in dispute involve significant changes to traditional 
practices.
<P>
	The Sims task force examined the issue of maintenance of 
activities and concluded that the right to strike or lockout should 
not be removed from any group of workers or any employer subject 
to the code. The task force recommended that the code include 
specific provisions for the protection of public health and safety 
during work stoppages. With respect to the appropriate criteria for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8540"> 8540 </A></B>
<P>
determining which activity should be  maintained, both labour and 
management support protection of public health and safety as a 
criterion.
<P>
	The maintenance of activities provisions in Bill C-66 balance the 
collective bargaining rights of employees and employers subject to 
the code with the public's right to protection of health and safety. 
They represent a fair and equitable approach which has the support 
of both the labour and management parties.
<P>
	I will now turn to the grain provision. Grain has been declared 
for the general advantage of Canada. It is a multi-billion dollar 
industry which exports to over 70 countries worldwide. The 
livelihood of 130,000 farmers and their families depends on 
Canada maintaining its reputation as a reliable exporter. These 
interests must however be balanced with the rights of labour and 
management to determine fair terms and conditions of employment 
through collective bargaining.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Since 1972 there have been 12 work stoppages in west coast 
ports which have disrupted grain exports. Nine of these work 
stoppages have involved longshoremen and their employers. Only 
three have involved grain handlers. One of these was limited to 
Prince Rupert and as such did not affect major terminal elevators in 
Vancouver.
<P>
	Requiring the continuation of port services to grain vessels will 
therefore eliminate the major source of disruptions to our grain 
exports due to work stoppages in ports. However, as it is limited to 
services to grain vessels in the ports, it will not remove the right to 
strike or lockout from any group of employees or employers.
<P>
	When grain exports are interrupted due to work stoppages 
pressures are immediately brought to bear on Parliament to adopt 
emergency legislation. In the past Parliament has intervened 
quickly to end and resolve disputes in the ports which have affected 
grain exports. This does not contribute to sound 
labour-management relations in the ports. The parties have come to 
expect Parliament to intervene. They have developed negotiation 
strategies around this assumption. This removes responsibility 
from the parties engaged in a collective bargaining dispute to 
resolve their own problems. It enables the parties to blame the 
government and ultimately Parliament for any consequences of an 
imposed settlement they perceive as adverse to their interests.
<P>
	The proposal in Bill C-66 preserves the right of workers and 
employers in all sectors to engage in collective bargaining while 
providing protections to Canada's grain industry. It is the equitable 
approach suggested by the Sims task force and widely supported by 
the grain producers.
<P>
	As the Minister of Labour indicated when he introduced the bill 
and repeated before the standing committee, the provision with 
respect to services to grain vessels will be subject to review in 
1999, at which time  stronger measures could be considered if 
necessary. The parties should therefore take the opportunity to 
make these provisions work.
<P>
	The amendment adopted by members of the standing committee 
would require the continuation of ferry services between Port aux 
Basques, Newfoundland and North Sydney, Nova Scotia, in the 
event of a collective bargaining dispute. The government has 
introduced a motion to remove this requirement. I would like to 
explain why the provision is inadvisable from an industrial 
relations point of view.
<P>
	While committee members heard from a number of groups with 
interests in tourism and economic development in Newfoundland, 
they did not have an opportunity to hear from labour and 
management on this issue or to examine the industrial relations 
implications of the provision.
<P>
	First, it is important to note there has not been a legal strike or 
lockout involving employees providing ferry service between Port 
aux Basques, Newfoundland and North Sydney, Nova Scotia and 
their employer, Marine Atlantic, since the corporation began 
operating the service over 23 years ago. Marine Atlantic and the 
union representing the employees have always been able to reach 
an agreement on terms and conditions of employment without 
resorting to work stoppages.
<P>
	Second, this issue did not surface during the lengthy process of 
the review of part I of the Canada Labour Code which included 
cross-country consultations by an independent task force and 
subsequently by the Minister of Labour. This is unfortunate since 
there would have been an opportunity for a more careful 
examination of a serious issue, that is the removal of strike and 
lockout rights for a group of employees and their employer. At first 
glance one might think the impact of this provision would be the 
same as the requirement in Bill C-66 for port services to grain 
vessels to be continued in the event of work stoppages. However 
that is not the case.
<P>
	The requirement with respect to port services to grain vessels 
does not remove the strike and lockout rights of any bargaining unit 
of employees or any employer. Only port work related to grain 
vessels would have to be continued in the event of a work stoppage. 
This would affect a small portion of workers in any bargaining unit 
in the ports. The employer and the union would still be able to exert 
economic pressures throughout the strike or lockout action.
<P>
	However, in the case of ferry services by May of this year when 
ferry service between Prince Edward Island and the mainland will 
cease the only year-round ferry service run by the current 
employer, Marine Atlantic, will be that between Port aux Basques 
and North Sydney. If the requirement to maintain this service is not 
revoked, employers and employees will not be able to exert 
economic pressure to resolve a collective bargaining dispute.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8541"> 8541 </A></B>
<P>
	There are other changes in Bill C-66 which adequately address 
concerns raised before the standing committee without removing 
the rights of parties. The parties operating ferry services would 
be required to maintain services necessary to prevent immediate 
and serious danger to public health and safety. The new time 
limited one stage conciliation process will reduce the length of 
bargaining and encourage earlier settlements. In addition, the new 
requirement for a 72-hour advance notice of a strike or lockout 
action will prevent unexpected disruptions to service.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	It seems to me to be somewhat heavy-handed to remove 
legitimate rights from a group of workers and their employer in 
anticipation of the possibility that a situation which has not 
occurred in over 23 years could happen. The removal of strike and 
lockout rights may have the undesirable effect of undermining the 
positive labour-management relations which have enabled the 
union and the employer to resolve collective bargaining disputes 
without resorting to work stoppages. Poor labour-management 
relations can negatively impact on the quality and reliability of the 
services.
<P>
	I urge members to support the government motion to delete the 
provision with respect to the maintenance of ferry services. I am 
confident that the other changes to the bargaining process in Bill 
C-66 are sufficient to address any perceived problems with respect 
to ferry services between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia without 
removing the collective bargaining rights of the parties.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I had not intended to speak on this issue today but I have 
heard a number of comments and I thought I would just add a few 
thoughts on this issue.
<P>
	When I heard the hon. member from Fraser Valley talk about 
how his farmers were short of grain, it really astounded me. I look 
at statistics and see that the turnaround of a grain car in 1908 to the 
port at Vancouver was 21 days and today it is 19.5 days. That is one 
and a half days less.
<P>
	I know the trains are going about four or five times faster than 
they used to. I know that elevators load cars about three or four 
times faster as they used to. Why do we have only a one and a half 
day shorter turnaround?
<P>
	I am astounded when I hear that the farmers in British Columbia 
are suffering just like the grain farmers in Manitoba because they 
cannot move their product. The farmers in the Fraser Valley cannot 
feed their animals to produce money or to increase the economy. It 
astounds me when nobody talks about $1 million a day demurrage 
charges for ships sitting in port which is due to somebody's 
ignorance, mismanagement or inefficiency.
<P>
	How can a country continue to prosper when we have this type of 
economy? What the government reminds me of is that if it had a 
spoke come out of a buggy wheel, it  would shoot the horse. That is 
the way this government solves problems.
<P>
	The government passed laws doing away with transportation 
subsidies, saying that everything would go smoothly from here on. 
Do you know something, Mr. Speaker? I had nine miles of hopper 
cars sitting empty in my constituency all summer and fall. No grain 
was being moved. Tell me why. We have a record carryover of feed 
grain on hand right now. Why did those chickens in B.C. not get 
that grain when they needed it? I wish somebody could explain that 
to me. The CPR agent came to see me. He said: ``Jake, we had 50 
miles of empty hopper cars sitting around all summer up till the 
harvest time''.
<P>
	We had a record carryover of grain and the chickens are starving 
in B.C. Is this something that we in the opposition are creating or is 
this something the government is not looking after? I would like to 
know. If we run our country in this direction we will not even have 
a dead horse to shoot. It will die before we get the gun out.
<P>
	It is important that we finally realize that trucks move six or 
seven times faster than they did in the early 1900s. Grain cars can 
be loaded faster. Trains can move faster. There is a problem 
somewhere. Somebody is not doing his job using these implements 
or these tools. Who is it? It is not thin air. It has to be either 
management or labour.
<P>
	The people who produce the products to be moved have 
increased their production 10, 15 and 20 times. They are not getting 
rewarded for it, nor are the farmers who are producing in the value 
added industries like chicken, dairy and hogs.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	I wish the government would start realizing that farmers vote. If 
we do not have farmers, the other people who vote will not be 
eating very long and might not be voting either. It may not just be a 
matter of debating this issue in the House, it is a matter of doing 
something. The grain is there, the vehicles are there and the special 
value industries are there but something is not working. We had 
better find the problem.
<P>
	I know in my farm operation if the tractor or the combine is 
sitting it is because the guy who is supposed to drive it is not 
around. That is what is happening to all our industries that are 
supposed to move the grain. Somebody is not around.
<P>
	When I hear in my constituency that the railway workers have to 
be brought by limousine half way down toward Winnipeg and then 
the train sits for six or seven hours waiting for another limousine to 
come from Winnipeg to bring out another crew, I can see why we 
do not get anything moved. This is the reason we are having 
problems.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8542"> 8542 </A></B>
<P>
	It is high time that we started realizing that if these value added 
industries are not going to be successful, like my hon. friend from 
Fraser Valley says, they are going to move. They are not going 
to stay around. When they move there will be no more taxes for 
the government to collect and no more industries providing jobs. 
Let us get on the ball and do something.
<P>
	Why are we not succeeding? I would say it is because we have a 
Liberal government on that side and Reform on this side. However, 
that will change in the next election. Then things will start running 
smoothly. We will move grain and feed the chickens and we will 
not have to shoot the horse any more to solve the problem.

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Group No. 8 amendments. This group calls for 
the use of final offer selection arbitration to settle disputes so there 
will not be strikes or lockouts in the system in the future.
<P>
	I would like to start by reminding members on the government 
side of some things that have taken place over the past three and a 
half years leading to this legislation, how they were dealt with, the 
impact they had on the farming industry in particular, but also on 
other industries where there are captive shippers. Then I will talk 
about what the amendments in this group would do to help alleviate 
some of the problems caused by the lack of action on the part of 
this government over the past three and a half years.
<P>
	Three major pieces of legislation have come before the House 
which have had a huge impact on grain movement over the past 
three and a half years. The first was the elimination of the Crow 
benefit, thus requiring farmers to pay the full cost of freight when 
they had been paying less than half the cost. When this legislation 
was passed, we agreed to support it if some changes were made that 
would make things better.
<P>
	Later, the new Canadian Transportation Act was passed. Again, 
my colleagues and I called for some changes that would improve 
the act so the system would work better. Then came the legislation 
that led to the privatization of CN. My colleagues and I called for a 
series of amendments that would have made things work better.
<P>
	What do we have? We have the Crow benefit eliminated, farmers 
paying the full cost of transportation. Is the system working better? 
Ask some of our colleagues from Saskatchewan and Manitoba. 
They know that farmers once again are stuck with grain in their 
bins and in piles on the ground because they cannot move it. The 
system is not working. It is failing from one end to the other.
<P>
	I have many farmers in my constituency who will not be able to 
seed a crop this spring because they have not been able to sell last 
year's crop. The system is broken. Grain is not moving. It is sitting 
in bins. It is sitting in piles on the ground and these farmers are 
desperate for money.
<P>
	What have members opposite done to head off this problem, 
which was most predictable? I predicted it in committee and in the 
House when we debated every one of the pieces of legislation that 
should have made things better for farmers when they are moving 
grain. They did not.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8544"> 8544 </A></B>
<P>
	When the government called for eliminating the Crow benefit, 
we called for changes that would put competition into the system 
before the act was passed, before the subsidy was removed. We 
called for a system of incentives and penalties to be put in place 
so that we would know grain would be moving as it should be 
moving. Reform called for changes that would ensure that the 
system would work before the money was taken away. This 
government ignored our calls for change. As a result it was very 
predictable, once again in western Canada, we would end up with 
a situation where grain is not moving and farmers are wondering 
where they are going to get the money to seed their crops this 
spring. There will be many who just will not have the money.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	The banks are not going to lend them the money this spring 
because it has been too many years where grain has not moved and 
they do not have the money to make their debt payments on time. 
This year is going to be the end of the line for more farmers in my 
constituency. I have had some of them come to talk to me about this 
issue. It is a frustrating feeling when they ask what can be done and 
I say I do not know.
<P>
	When the Crow benefit was being eliminated we called for these 
changes that would have put competition in the system. It would 
have made the system work better. It would have made it so that if 
the railways did not deliver we could deal with the problem in a 
meaningful way.
<P>
	When the new Canadian transportation act was being put in 
place Reform called for changes that would allow captive shippers 
to put pressure on CN to make it deliver. The government ignored 
those pleas. We called for final offer selection arbitration to be put 
into that legislation and it was ignored.
<P>
	When this government put forth legislation to privatize CN we 
called for changes that would have put competition into the system 
so that the changes would have been made to make the system work 
better before the legislation was passed. Those changes were not 
made so here we are today with Group No. 8 amendments once 
again calling for changes that would at least help in some small 
way to alleviate the problems that have arisen. This government 
has acted completely irresponsibly in the past legislation.
<P>
	If another example is needed of how the government has acted 
irresponsibly, at the transport committee the chair, the Liberal 
member for Winnipeg South, when the change was proposed that 
would have made it so that farmers would not be held hostage to 
these huge pilot fees, thousands of dollars a day going to a pilot to 
help guide the ships through the St. Lawrence Seaway system, and 
the Bloc MPs said they did not want this to change because it is 
good for people in Montreal, the chair of the committee and the 
Bloc left-this was just before the Christmas break-and the 
member for Winnipeg South made a deal. As a result farmers are 
still left paying this  absolutely atrocious pilot fee for every ship 
moving through the St. Lawrence system and that is just 
unforgivable. We have had these things that have been done wrong 
over the last three and a half years.
<P>
	I believe that the Reform has put forth constructive 
recommendations to make things work better. We are doing that 
once again with these Group No. 8 amendments. At least we can 
help make up for some of the lack of action over the past three and 
a half years and make it so that we will not have strikes or lockouts 
in the system so that farmers' grain and the commodities from 
other captive shippers will move right through to port and indeed 
until they are loaded on ships and out of port.
<P>
	We cannot afford to keep building this reputation of being an 
unreliable suppler of goods. Things are so bad in the grain industry, 
because of stoppages, because Canada has not been able to supply 
time after time grain that the customers have ships waiting for, that 
customers are giving up on us. They are going south to Seattle to 
other ports where they know the commodity will be delivered when 
it should be delivered. Canada is no longer a reliable shipper. Japan 
and other countries that pay top dollar for our commodities are 
giving up on us.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	So who are the losers? The Canadian business people, farmers 
and people in other industries who depend on the system to work to 
get their commodity from the producer to the ships loaded for 
market.
<P>
	Western Canadian grain farmers are tired of this happening again 
and again. It was so predictable and we did predict it. We said 
changes had to be made to fix up the car allocation system and put 
in place a system of incentives and penalties as in the case of the 
privatization of CN and the Canadian transportation act, using final 
offer selection arbitration to make sure that stoppages are not 
allowed to happen. That is just about the fairest method we can use.
<P>
	We are not talking about ending the collective bargaining 
process. We are talking about making the collective bargaining 
process work better. That is what final offer selection arbitration 
does. It gives workers and management a chance to work things 
through. Hopefully things will never get to a point where there will 
be a need for final offer selection arbitration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
certainly getting an opportunity to speak to final offer arbitration 
today and it is a good thing.
<P>
	I would like to begin by saying that I do not want the government 
to see us as being too soft an opposition. It has always been my 
point that we should not oppose simply to oppose. We agreed to 
extend the hours on a gentlemen's agreement. Members are here in 
the Chamber to deal with legislation. Our intention is to improve 
the legislation, not simply to oppose for the sake of opposition.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8545"> 8545 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to point out something the member for 
Hillsborough said in his remarks. He said he felt this was doing 
away with the collective bargaining process. I could not disagree 
with him more. As a matter of fact, every time back to work 
legislation is used in the House the bargaining process is usurped. 
It is not served well by back to work legislation and I think exactly 
the opposite is true of final offer selection arbitration.
<P>
	Just in case there is still some misunderstanding between the 
member for Hillsborough and me on this point, I would not mind 
going over it one more time. We have advocated a final offer 
selection arbitration not as a tool to strengthen one bargainer's 
hand over another but one that can be used equally. As I pointed out 
the last time I spoke to this, when used to its ultimate, it is not used 
at all.
<P>
	Both labour and management know there is no such thing as a 
long strike duration under these circumstances because Parliament 
will have pressure applied to deal with back to work legislation, 
which none of us cares to do. I do not think there is a member in the 
House who enjoys having to deal with back to work legislation. So 
why do we do it over and over again? Why not adopt a measure that 
will actually enhance the bargaining process, present the tools so 
that disputes can be settled by the parties rather than by others, 
which is always the best resolution.
<P>
	I could go on and on about the good points of final offer selection 
arbitration. Suffice it to say we see this as something that will 
enhance the process. I cannot emphasize that enough.
<P>
	I know the hon. member for Hillsborough has his political points 
to score, but he must admit at some point that this is a reasonable 
solution to a problem facing Canadian shippers and has a 
tremendous impact on the Canadian economy.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	As I mentioned the last time I spoke to final offer arbitration, 
healthy economies and particularly primary economies create 
healthy job situations. With primary economies there are endless 
opportunities for value added. If we have problems shipping our 
commodities then we have problems, as my colleague from 
Vegreville pointed out, with production of commodities. In the case 
of a farmer, if he cannot sell his crop-he has to have input costs 
for the next year-if he cannot get the cash flow for the input costs 
he is really in a catch-22 situation. Not only is that farmer in a bad 
situation but the people who are employed as a spin-off from the 
agriculture are in a bad situation as well.
<P>
	When that happens then ultimately the Government of Canada, 
which is in a rather precarious situation as far as finances are 
concerned and needs every penny of revenue that it can get, is also 
in a precarious situation  because those people who are not working 
are certainly not paying taxes.
<P>
	That is kind of a roundabout way, but it all fits together as far as 
resolving the work stoppages whether they are lockouts or whether
<P>
they are strikes. A work stoppage is a work stoppage and it 
ultimately interferes with getting the product to market. And 
getting the product to market is what drives our economy. It is what 
keeps our economy rolling, and the spin-off benefits from all these 
primary sectors, certainly in the value added area, are very 
significant.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this group 
contains an essential motion by the Bloc, one which ought to have 
come from the government itself. I refer to the proposal to prohibit 
replacement workers, or ``scabs'', the anti-scab or anti-replacement 
worker clause.
<P>
	This clause is sorely lacking in a bill which has pretensions of 
being modern, which is supposed to establish new working 
conditions for businesses which require worker participation if 
they are to be productive. If one reads current management 
manuals, that is what they all say, but the revamped labour code 
will not have that effect, but indeed the opposite.
<P>
	The fact that there is no clause, no section to prevent the use of 
replacement workers-their use is legalized to some extent 
instead-accentuates the temptation to resort to violence to solve 
problems. This is found throughout the code, which is decidedly far 
from modern.
<P>
	As I have said several times already, and I repeat, in 1977 the 
Parti Quebecois of the time, and its Minister of Labour, 
Pierre-Marc Johnson, adopted anti-strikebreaker legislation despite 
the loud objections of a number of employers. These clauses 
brought about the social peace for which everyone today takes the 
credit.
<P>
	When Premier Bourassa was re-elected in 1985, he was 
pressured by employers to drop the clause, which had been adopted 
by the Parti Quebecois, but he took care not to do so.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	He told employers in no uncertain terms that labour peace was 
now a fact, that it was worth a lot and that government was not 
about to backtrack and reinstate conditions that had led to violent 
strikes that went on forever.
<P>
	I used the word violent, and we should realize that when workers 
have a union, often after a hard time getting certification, and the 
bargaining process is unsuccessful, they must go on strike. For 
instance, when there is a strike and workers see that other workers 
are  being hired-I have nothing against people who take that kind 
of job because we know jobs are scarce-to replace those who are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8547"> 8547 </A></B>
<P>
on strike because they want to improve their circumstances and get 
the respect and the recognition their union deserves.
<P>
	When other workers are hired to replace these strikers, to 
remove any leverage they have, to ensure that goods produced 
before the strike are shipped or whatever else has to be done, 
inevitably some workers are going to get very angry. When these 
strikes go on for any length of time, circumstances may cause them 
to do things they should not.
<P>
	For society as a whole, using replacement workers is bad, it sets 
a poor example and adversely effects labour relations. If there is a 
settlement, there may be deep wounds that leave lasting scars. This 
has nothing to do with what we call new labour relations. This is 
more like the law of the jungle.
<P>
	So a labour code does what? It tries to make the bargaining 
process as civilized as possible. At this point I can inform hon. 
members who think they can solve everything with their final offer 
that they have not the remotest idea what labour relations are all 
about. We must recognize the fact that in a company, especially in 
big companies and increasingly in small businesses, workers want 
to bargain collectively with their employer, and for this purpose 
they want to be recognized as a unit. The unit can then negotiate in 
good faith with the employer and, if need be, avail itself of the right 
to strike.
<P>
	However, they want to negotiate on the basis of their own needs, 
and not play heads or tails with the employer's proposals and some 
union plan. It would take too long to explain that this can never be a 
solution and can never replace the bargaining process.
<P>
	To get back to replacement workers, there is a huge gap in this 
bill, and in committee we again begged the government to do 
something and we made our own proposals to ensure that at the 
very least, when essential services are at stake, the use of 
replacement workers is prohibited.
<P>
	Here, however, the bill is so twisted that an employer, and I have 
read the text over and over, could both force strikers to work in 
order to provide essential services and use replacement workers.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	This would be one of those moments of conflict I mentioned that 
nobody should have to face.
<P>
	Unfortunately, this bill recognizes replacement workers and does 
not prohibit their use, even in this totally untenable situation where 
strikers in essential services would have to work together with 
replacement workers. The only provision we can view positively to 
any extent, and I hesitate to say so, because the other omissions are 
so serious that the fact of saying that the  workers in the bargaining 
unit before the replacement workers must be rehired will not soothe 
many wounds.
<P>
	It is sad, more than sad, it is shocking to see that, when the 
minister promised-and it is a promise that affected the promise to 
modernize the Canada Labour Code-rather than modernize the 
Canada Labour Code, instead of adapting it to new labour relations, 
to permit new labour relations, instead of considering unions for 
what they are-ever more reasonable partners in the management 
of businesses-the Canadian code establishes rules that will 
quickly bring back the law of the jungle, repeatedly throughout the 
bill.
<P>
	It is sad and shocking, but worse than that, it will produce effects 
the government will regret. However, it is not the government that 
will regret it, but rather the people who will have to deal with it. 
That is the really annoying part.
<P>
	In closing, I would simply like to say that, as far as employment 
insurance is concerned, we predicted there would be a mountain of 
problems. Now we have them, and the minister, in a panic, is 
forced to announce improvements here and there, because, quite 
simply, it did not make sense. The government does not listen. It is 
arrogant; it thinks it knows everything and produces bill after bill 
that even it knows will not achieve the aims set for them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
talking about replacement workers and how the CIRB will be the 
sole determiner of whether or not replacement workers can be 
utilized.
<P>
	This is one of those situations that I would say is neither fish nor 
fowl. It is not a replacement worker ban and it is not a wide open 
market either. It is rather putting the responsibility on to the CIRB 
which I am sure will be very heavily lobbied by union 
representatives to see any sort of action taken by the employer as 
being detrimental to the union.
<P>
	This is a serious infringement of employers' rights. It is sort of 
de facto anti-replacement worker legislation and yet it is not.
<P>
	On November 5, 1996 the <I>Globe and Mail</I> quoted Nancy Riche 
as saying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I would go so far as to suggest that anybody who does work for a member union 
understands the representative capacity of a union.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1840 )</B>
<P>
	She went on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>None of the bureaucrats are going to agree with me but we will have to wait and 
see. The new board will rule.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8548"> 8548 </A></B>
<P>
	They will do everything they can to say that the employer has 
taken action that will somehow undermine the union. They will 
pressure the board to find in their favour.
<P>
	I understand the Bloc has put a lot of pressure on the government 
to come up with this idea. While the Bloc would have us believe 
that nothing but a total replacement worker ban would be 
sufficient, in true level fashion it has found some way to do it in a 
half-hearted manner and turn it over to the CIRB which very likely 
does not particularly want this aspect of the bill. I should not 
speculate but it is very tempting to do so.
<P>
	There are ultimate tools, the strike being one and the lockout 
being another. Then there are lesser tools that both management 
and labour have. One of the tools that management has is the right 
to continue to operate when labour services have been withdrawn.
<P>
	We will hear people trying to rationalize that anti-replacement 
worker legislation leads to far more harmonious labour 
negotiations than no anti-replacement worker legislation. That 
does not always bear out. As a matter of fact they would be hard 
pressed to prove that point to me.
<P>
	I refer back to the Sims task force entitled ``Seeking a Balance''. 
This is not part of the balance. This is a lopsided balance. 
Replacement worker legislation does not level the playing field. 
Anti-replacement worker legislation tips the scale on the side of 
labour.
<P>
	If Bloc members use the model they are used to at home in the 
province of Quebec, they would say there must be a total, outright 
ban on replacement workers. That is the difference between a 
totally labour oriented party and one that is not totally labour 
oriented. Certainly labour should have rights, the right to strike, the 
right to withdraw services, the right to organize peacefully and so 
forth. The Reform Party admits that and agrees.
<P>
	We must never get into a situation where labour can hold 
management hostage or where management can hold labour 
hostage. If we are truly seeking a balance we would accept the 
amendment the Reform has put forth today requesting that the 
provisions for anti-replacement worker legislation be withdrawn 
from the bill.
<P>
	As I mentioned before, the CIRB will be charged with making a 
decision and will be pretty busy. It will receive a lot of 
representation from the labour unions that any use of management 
or anybody who tries to run the shop because labour has been 
withdrawn undermines the representational capacity of the union.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	Here again, I do not want to prejudge what the board is likely to 
do. We saw an example in Ontario not very long ago where a 
similar board decided in favour of  labour. A union was certified. 
The latest vote was 151 against certification and 43 in favour.
<P>
	If that is any indication of how the CIRB would operate, it is 
incumbent on us to accept Reform's amendment and withdraw that 
section of the code.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am in agreement with my Reform colleague's speech on 
one point, the fact that our amendment concerning replacement 
workers says a lot about the kind of party we are.
<P>
	We must admit that there is a lack of courage on the government 
side, since this does take courage. When government members 
were in the opposition, they were vociferous, they spared no 
energy, no word was strong enough to demand provisions 
prohibiting replacement workers.
<P>
	Of the Reform Party we must say that it is not courage it lacks, 
but sensitivity. If it had not been for the Bloc Quebecois, this issue 
would not have been raised during today's debate.
<P>
	The issue of replacement workers is not a recent concern for the 
Bloc Quebecois. The member for Richelieu introduced a private 
member's bill dealing with this very thing. The member for 
Bourassa and the member for Saint-Laurent followed suit.
<P>
	It is incredible that we still have to justify, to explain why 
antiscab legislation, which prohibits the use of replacement 
workers, is an element of paramount importance to the balance we 
must always strive for in labour relations.
<P>
	Why is a piece of legislation banning the use of replacement 
workers so important? Because it has to do with the violence and 
the length of labour disputes. Recently I looked at some statistics 
compiled by a professor of industrial relations regarding the bill 
passed in 1977 in Quebec. I had to laugh when the minister told us 
in committee that since there was no consensus we could not 
proceed. Do you think for one moment that there was a consensus 
in Quebec in 1977 when the government of René Lévesque, a most 
courageous man, decided to go ahead? Of course not.
<P>
	Contrary to some of my colleagues, I was not very old in those 
days. If you recall, in 1977, when the Lévesque government went 
ahead with this, the Conseil du patronat threatened to go to court, 
the Liberal Party believed that it would be the first shot in a civil 
war. There was an atmosphere of fear that was nurtured by some 
very specific, clear-cut groups, whose immediate interest it served.
<P>
	But once the Liberals were in office, do you think they 
challenged the antiscab legislation? Of course not. They realized it 
could not only make disputes more civilized, but also allow some 
kind of balance to be struck.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8549"> 8549 </A></B>
<P>
	It takes some doing to come and tell us today that they could 
not go ahead because there was no consensus, because the 
necessary conditions were not met.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	If this government had had the courage of its convictions and had 
stood by the positions taken when it sat on this side of the House, it 
would have endorsed the amendment proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois. But it is not going to happen now because, on this issue 
as on many others, the members opposite lack the political courage 
required to take a position of their own.
<P>
	A study conducted by a number of industrial relations experts 
shows that, Quebec in particular, but three other provinces as well, 
still have, for the most part, antiscab provisions. There was 
Quebec, British Columbia, Ontario. This meant that 50 per cent of 
Canada's labour force was protected by antiscab legislation.
<P>
	When there are laws such as the ones I am describing, conflicts 
are resolved more quickly. This goes without saying, because the 
legislation forces the parties to negotiate. It also results in less 
violence. In those provinces where there are antiscab laws, the 
duration of conflicts was, on average, 35 per cent shorter than 
elsewhere. This means something after all. Yet, this Parliament still 
refuses to accept Quebec's position, which could have been 
beneficial to all workers.
<P>
	What is worse is the hybrid, half-baked formula being proposed 
by the government, which thinks that the Canada Labour Relations 
Board will have to develop regulations and guidelines that woul 
allow it, when the union's representation duty will be undermined, 
to issue an order providing that replacement workers cannot be 
used.
<P>
	We cannot imagine a more weird and crazy scenario than the one 
proposed by the government. At what point will it be determined 
that a union's ability to represent its members has been 
undermined? Is the objective to prohibit the use of replacement 
workers? This is absolutely crazy. It does not make any sense. No 
witness said anything of the sort. Could the minister tell us who, 
among university professors, unions, militants and workers, 
supported such a solution? Of course not, because it is a hybrid 
solution where one tries to play both ends against the middle, as is 
too often the case with the legislation put forward by the 
government.
<P>
	It is rather disappointing and we would have liked for the 
government to take into consideration what is being done in the 
Province of Quebec, where section 109 of the Quebec Labour Code 
recognizes as an unfair practice the use of replacement workers by 
an employer. The Canada Labour Code clearly defines what is an 
unfair practice. An unfair practice, as defined, is an allegation that 
an employer, a trade union or an individual has taken part in an 
activity that is prohibited pursuant to the Canada Labour Code. 
And then a number of examples  are given. At least six of them are 
traditionally linked to unfair practices.
<P>
	Section 24 stipulates that no employer shall, after notification 
that the application for certification has been made, alter the 
conditions of employment, since this is considered an unfair 
practice. To negotiate in bad faith is clearly an unfair practice. We 
saw, closer to home, that such a recourse can be used. In the dispute 
opposing them to Air Canada and national airlines, regional 
carriers Air BC, Air Nova, Air Ontario and Air Alliance invoked 
section 50 in referring to the last negotiations.
<P>
	A third example is employer interference in union business. It is 
also prohibited as an unfair practice.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	For the union, failure to provide fair representation can be cause 
for legal action, as can failure to provide members with financial 
statements, although a bit unusual, and a certain number of 
prohibitions set out in section 95.
<P>
	Since our historic entry into the House of Commons-and you 
will not often see an official opposition as dynamic as the one 
before you-we have made representations to successive labour 
ministers in order to ensure that our message is heard. One day, we 
will leave this Parliament and we will speak as equals within a true 
partnership. We would have liked, as a team of parliamentarians, to 
be able to say with pride that one of the contributions we made to 
this debate, a milestone in our time as the Bloc Quebecois team in 
the House of Commons, has been to convince English Canada and 
the government of the need to make labour relations more civilized 
and to adopt anti-scab legislation.
<P>
	We are not admitting defeat. There are still a few weeks left 
before we are, perhaps, able to ask Quebecers once again for their 
vote. There will be another referendum, that is certain. I see the 
member from British Columbia, who has very definite ideas on a 
number of topics I would prefer not to get into. I can and I wish to 
tell her personally not to force me to go door to door in her riding. 
She knows very well that I am particularly fond of Vancouver.
<P>
	I do not know if this is a human being in front of me. I heard loud 
shouts coming awfully close-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Chairman:</B> Unfortunately, the member's time is 
up.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will speak 
to the Group No. 9 amendments. Many people over the last four 
years since I became involved in politics, and even before, have 
told me that unions are a bad thing and if they had their way they 
would outlaw unions completely. I have had many people tell me 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8550"> 8550 </A></B>
<P>
that unions are so powerful they do extreme harm to the  economy. 
I respond to them by saying that I do not agree at all.
<P>
	I believe that unions play a very useful role. I believe that 
collective bargaining must be allowed to take place wherever it 
possibly can. I believe that under certain circumstances we have to 
find a more efficient and more useful mechanism for solving a 
problem. Those are cases when innocent victims are involved who 
are neither labour or management. Of course several different 
groups fall into this category, grain farmers among them.
<P>
	When members of the Bloc say that in all cases labour and 
management have to work it out no matter how long the strike 
might last, are they really thinking about the other people who are 
involved in certain situations? In particular, people who in many 
cases in the past have lost their businesses, their farms, have 
suffered severe economic hardship as a result of both sides, labour 
and management, causing stoppages.
<P>
<B>(1900 )</B>
<P>
	This is the case with grain farmers and any other captive 
shippers. We have to take a look at solutions to the problem of one 
disruption after another which are usually settled by back to work 
legislation. Such legislation without a doubt does not involve 
labour-management negotiations.
<P>
	In the grain handling industry 19 times in the last 20 years the 
House has brought in back to work legislation to end a dispute. 
Labour and management have given up on the process. We have 
proposed the use of final offer selection arbitration so that there 
will be no work stoppage and so that labour and management do 
negotiate to the final agreement, hopefully never using the final 
offer selection arbitration. However, knowing it is there is 
important.
<P>
	This group of amendments deals with replacement workers. Of 
course members of the Block feel, and I think I am being fair, that 
there should be no case where replacement workers can be used. I 
believe in Quebec it is the law that replacement workers cannot be 
used.
<P>
	The legislation does not say that replacement workers will not be 
used. Instead in a roundabout way it states that the Canada 
Industrial Relations Board will decide whether replacement 
workers will be allowed or not. It is very unclear to labour and 
management what situations would warrant the Canada Industrial 
Relations Board's deciding whether replacement workers would be 
used. This kind of uncertainty cannot possibly be good for labour 
or management. Therefore we cannot support any of these 
amendments that would outlaw the use of replacement workers 
entirely.
<P>
	While we do want the collective bargaining process to take 
place, I have defended it to many people who say that it should be 
outlawed, that the unions are just too powerful and harm the 
economy. I have defended the absolute necessity for collective 
bargaining to be available  to labour and management and I will 
continue to defend it. However, there are situations where we must 
be able to get round it.
<P>
	Certainly this solution of using the Canada Industrial Relations 
Board to determine when replacement workers should be allowed 
is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	It should be obvious to members of the government and of the 
Bloc that the way to solve the problem is to never have these work 
stoppages in the first place, especially in industries where innocent 
victims are the ones who pay the dearest price. Of course, grain 
farmers are one group that has paid the price 19 times in the last 20 
years. It has cost many of them their businesses and their livelihood 
of choice as a result of these continual work stoppages in which 
they have no say. They are left out. They truly are innocent victims.
<P>
	In cases where there is a captive shipper or a group of victims the 
obvious solution is to never let the stoppage take place. We have 
suggested using final offer selection arbitration as a way of 
providing that outcome.
<P>
	This group of amendments is one that would not be supported by 
farmers. I do not think we would find one farmer in western Canada 
who would support this amendment that would outlaw replacement 
workers.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	I have some letters from constituents who said things like this. 
One is from Myron Zajic from Edgerton, Alberta in my 
constituency: ``I am writing to you in support of the amendments to 
the labour code which prohibit the longshoremen from striking in 
Vancouver and Prince Rupert. I am an Alberta grain farmer and I 
have been appalled by the number of times we have been held 
hostage over grain handling disputes at the west coast. To maintain 
our foreign markets and to keep the flow of grain moving and keep 
our agriculture economy going we must stop these interruptions. 
Please support this amendment''.
<P>
	The next one is from Dale Hallett from my constituency who 
made this comment about labour disputes on the west coast: 
``Labour disputes on the west coast, one, disrupt the flow of grain; 
two, increase direct cost to grain producers; three, damage 
Canada's reputation in world markets;'' a very important point that 
he has brought up, ``and four, impair the economy of Canada and 
western Canada in particular''. He said support that amendment.
<P>
	I have a stack of letters of people who have said to support that 
amendment. They certainly would not be telling us to support Bill 
C-66 if they knew that part of this bill gave that kind of power, the 
kind of power to outlaw the use of replacement workers, put into 
the hands of the Canada Industrial Relations Board. They would 
not support any piece of legislation that would do that. They will 
not support this piece of legislation for that reason and others.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8551"> 8551 </A></B>
<P>
	If we can get our amendment supported which would put in 
place final offer selection arbitration, it changes the game. That 
would prevent many of these stoppages and would help to solve 
the problem for the long term, not just tinkering. This legislation 
does provide a bit of useful tinkering in that it would at least 
ensure that grain which reached the coast would be loaded but it 
has no impact whatsoever on getting that grain from the local 
elevator to the coast in the first place.
<P>
	It does not solve the problem and on balance when we look at 
this group of amendments and the other group of amendments it is 
going to take that final offer selection amendment to be supported 
for this legislation to really provide any positive change at all.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the subject 
under discussion is one very close to my heart. The replacement 
worker question is one that has been long debated in our society 
and one that has been solved in Quebec and in British Columbia. 
Unfortunately, in Ontario the legislation was repealed.
<P>
	My major criticism of Bill C-66 is its lack of real 
anti-strikebreaker clauses. The minister tells us that the Sims 
commission was unable to reach a consensus, but there has never 
been a consensus anywhere on anti-scab legislation. The 
government must have the courage to table a bill on replacement 
workers. I shall come back to this later. Professor Rodrigue Blouin 
tabled a minority report in which he comes out clearly against 
replacement workers and in favour of anti-scab legislation.
<P>
	The minister tells us that there was no consensus, and that is 
true-there never will be. He must get moving and have the 
courage to table a true anti-scab bill. I believe that a consensus is 
developing in this House. Last year, we voted on an anti-scab bill 
and it was very narrowly defeated. Some Liberal members even 
voted in favour of this bill, which had been introduced by a 
member of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
<B>(1910)</B>
<P>
	The absence of anti-scab provisions proves that the Liberal Party 
of Canada, that this government has moved to the right. This 
government listens more and more to employers and less and less 
to the labour movement, the unions and the workers.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is the only party that truly defends the 
interests of the workers. It is the only party that voted against back- 
to-work legislation for railway workers. Of course the Reform 
Party is against anti-scab provisions. This party represents the 
right, the extreme right of Canada.
<P>
	The bill prohibits the employer from introducing practices aimed 
at undermining the ability of a union that is on strike or locked out 
to represent its members. In what cases will these provisions 
apply? We do not know.  We can give an example. If an employer 
refuses to bargain while using scabs, the Canada Industrial 
Relations Board may prohibit the use of scabs.
<P>
	Proving a case is very difficult. It must be done before the 
Canada Industrial Relations Board. It must be proven that it is an 
unfair practice. The notion of unfair practices will vary depending 
on the case and the circumstances. Furthermore, this practice must 
aim to undermine the ability of the union to represent its members. 
In what cases, in what circumstances? We do not know this either.
<P>
	Anti-scab provisions, and this has been proven in Quebec and 
British Columbia, and in Ontario when it still had such provisions, 
contribute to labour peace and make for better labour relations. 
Their absence contributes to violence on the picket line. We have 
seen that wherever there are strikes and employers use strike 
breakers there is violence on the picket lines.
<P>
	I saw it at the Ogilvie flour mills in Montreal, a few months ago, 
at Pratt and Whitney in Longueuil, at Westinghouse. There was 
confrontation between the company's permanent employees and 
the strike breakers from outside replacing them, confrontation that 
was brutal at times.
<P>
	I am sensitive to this. I felt it important to introduce a bill, Bill 
C-338, to prevent the use of strike breakers. It is also meant to 
protect the employer in certain circumstances, and provides for 
maintaining essential services in a company.
<P>
	A balance must be maintained between the parties, when 
negotiations are going on. Generally, the employer is in the better 
position, with its management rights, and workers and unions are 
not so well off. Anti strike breaking legislation restores the power 
relationships between the parties in negotiation.
<P>
	In 1976, the Government of Quebec had the courage to introduce 
a bill, which came into force in 1977. As the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve has just pointed out, management 
opposition was fierce. Everywhere, everyone was expecting the 
worst. Nothing happened.
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	Quite the contrary, antiscab provisions in Quebec have 
contributed to shorten work disputes. There is less violence on 
picket lines and we have unprecedented labour peace. I believe it is 
also the case in British Columbia.
<P>
	There were also such antiscab provisions in Ontario, but the new 
Conservative government, which represents the interests of 
employers and the right wing, has unfortunately repealed those 
provisions. I think this decision will be proven wrong in the future 
and there will be more conflict, more violence. Disputes will be 
harsher in the absence of antiscab provisions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8552"> 8552 </A></B>
<P>
	I said earlier that members of the Sims task force could not 
agree on antiscab provisions. Naturally, two members, Sims first, 
decided that it was not a good idea to introduce antiscab 
provisions. There was also Professor Rodrigue Blouin, from Laval 
University, who incidentally is one of the key experts in industrial 
relations in Quebec, in Canada and in North America.
<P>
	He is one of the most well-known arbitrators in Quebec and says 
in his minority report: ``I submit that the general principles 
underlying our system of collective labour relations are such that 
the presence of replacement workers during a legal strike or 
lockout is illegitimate''. This is taken from page 138 of the report 
``Seeking a Balance'', the review of part I of the Canada Labour 
Code.
<P>
	He continues on page 154, saying: ``The possibility of a strike or 
a lockout still remains the cornerstone of the collective bargaining 
system today. However, this economic confrontation is only 
possible between two clearly identified parties that are under the 
obligation to bargain in good faith. Therefore, as soon as a 
bargaining agent is certified, the employer of the workers that are 
being represented can no longer refuse to negotiate a collective 
agreement, but this does not necessarily mean that he has to reach 
one. After a certain period of formal negotiations, there may be, in 
the absence of a settlement, a break up in the collective dialogue 
and a setting off of an economic conflict. At no time during this 
process a third party may intervene, except in the cases specifically 
provided for by the legislation''.
<P>
	I submit to you that Professor Blouin is very well acquainted 
with the situation in Quebec, which has been a very positive 
experience. The results have been exceptional and no one in 
Quebec is thinking about repealing the legislation, not even the 
employers who had campaigned against it. We have some statistics 
showing that the industrial relations situation has greatly improved 
in Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to be able to say a few words on group No. 9 
of the report stage amendments to the Canada Labour Code.
<P>
	I very much support the comments made by the hon. member for 
Mercier, the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and the 
hon. member for Bourassa regarding replacement workers. I 
support their Motions Nos. 27 and 40 in this group. I hope they will 
support my Motion No. 38 which is also in this group.
<P>
	The issue of replacement workers, that is anti-scab legislation, is 
important in the context of Canada Labour Code amendments. The 
minister has received a great deal of information regarding the 
prohibition of replacement workers. To me and my colleagues in 
the New  Democratic Party, the minister should have taken steps to 
outright prohibit the use of replacement workers.
<P>
<B>(1920)</B>
<P>
	Like our friends in the labour movement, New Democrats are 
deeply disappointed that Bill C-66 does not contain a general 
prohibition on the use of replacement workers.
<P>
	The object for us must be to end a practice that subjects trade 
union members to insult and unfairness and stacks the labour 
relations deck in favour of management.
<P>
	During testimony before the standing committee which studied 
Bill C-66 the CLC said it held strongly the view that strikes and 
lockouts accompanied by the employer's use of replacement 
workers give rise to several negative and unnecessary strains on the 
labour-management relationship.
<P>
	These include prolonged and more bitter conflicts, more strikes 
and lockouts, increased picket line confrontations and violence, 
less free and meaningful collective bargaining, problems that 
render resolution of the dispute more difficult.
<P>
	In addition to a specific amendment such as the one I have put 
before the House today, New Democratic Party MPs and the CLC 
have long advocated a prohibition on the use of replacement 
workers during a strike or lockout that would contain a very few 
specific elements.
<P>
	These elements include the prohibition of the use of both 
bargaining unit and non-bargaining unit employees or any person 
including those persons who exercise managerial functions; the 
prohibition of the use of persons engaged, transferred or hired after 
the earlier of the date on which the notice of desire to bargain is 
given and the date on which bargaining begins; the prohibition of 
contracting work in or out of the establishment; the providing of 
protection from discipline for any person who honours the picket 
line; and the development of an enforcement mechanism that 
would include permission for the union to enter and inspect the 
employer's premises in the company of a government labour 
relations officer and representative of the employer.
<P>
	Opponents of a replacement worker prohibition frequently raise 
the spectre of increased unemployment, incidents of strikes and 
imbalance of bargaining power.
<P>
	The province with the longest experience with an anti-scab 
provision is the province of Quebec where the evidence does not 
support bargaining power imbalance as reflected in wage 
settlement.
<P>
	In the 17 years, that is 1978 to 1994 inclusive following the 
introduction of anti-scab provisions, increases in basic wage rates 
and collective agreements in Quebec were higher than the 
Canadian average in only six years.
<P>
	It is perhaps not surprising the task force member from Quebec, 
Mr. Rodrigue Blouin, having witnessed  first hand the province's 
experience with anti-scab legislation, was the one who issued an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8553"> 8553 </A></B>
<P>
eloquent minority report advocating a prohibition. His opening 
comments in that minority report are quite strong.
<P>
	As quoted earlier, Mr. Rodrigue Blouin indicated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I submit that the general principles underlying our system of collective labour 
relations dictate that the presence of replacement workers during a legal strike or 
lockout is illegitimate. Their use must hence be declared illegal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Let me continue that quote for just a moment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The use of replacement workers undermines the structural elements that ensure 
the internal cohesion of the collective bargaining system by introducing a foreign 
body into a dispute between two clearly identified parties. It upsets the economic 
balance of power, compromises the freedom of expression of workers engaging in a 
strike or lockout, shifts the original neutral ground of the dispute and leads 
eventually to a perception of exploitation of the individual.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I continue the quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The conclusion to be drawn from my analysis is that there is on the whole a 
situation of illegitimacy that Parliament must condemn in no uncertain terms.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have read very carefully the minority report of Mr. Blouin. I am 
quite taken by his analysis and his conclusion which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Parliament has a duty to restore the delicate balance necessary to ensure that the 
collective bargaining system achieves its purpose. The presence of replacement 
workers is an intrusion into an economic dispute that takes place in the workplace in 
accordance with a public policy designed to promote industrial democracy. This 
policy is negated by replacement workers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1925)</B>
<P>
	I am reminded of the minister's own testimony before the 
standing committee in this regard. In responding to questions from 
committee members, the minister said that an important priority of 
the government was to let the collective bargaining process 
function. I argued, just as did Mr. Blouin, that the one element of 
the legislation which prevented collective bargaining from 
functioning well was the provision about replacement workers.
<P>
	That is why I support an outright prohibition on the use of 
replacement workers. That is why I have proposed and am 
supporting the amendments in front of us today in this grouping 
which, if passed, would for all intents and purposes prohibit the use 
of the services of a person who was not an employee in the 
bargaining unit on the date on which notice to bargain collectively 
was given.
<P>
	The Sims report highlights several high profile disputes in the 
federal sector, including the dispute at Giant Mines in Yellowknife 
with its tragic circumstances and Canada Post's use of replacement 
workers in 1991 which resulted in several confrontations.
<P>
	Sims, however, does not recommend the prohibition of 
replacement workers because he believes measures to mitigate the 
threat to job loss that replacement workers  pose will be sufficient 
to prevent potential violence on the picket line. There is very little 
evidence to support that contention despite the compromise Sims 
proposes is acceptable in the absence of an outright prohibition.
<P>
	In conclusion, I was greatly disappointed the government in the 
initial drafting of Bill C-66 or in the amendment process of the 
standing committee did not provide for a general ban on scabs in 
the amendments to the federal labour code. The government had 
the opportunity to end the confrontations in strikes and lockouts but 
failed to grasp this opportunity.
<P>
	Obviously 20 years of history of such legislation in the province 
of Quebec provides the necessary information we need to assess its 
worthiness. It is time the federal government took the necessary 
steps to ban replacement workers from disputes within its own 
jurisdiction. The amendments before us provide the opportunity to 
do just that. I urge their support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, you listened over the last while to the 
speeches of members from all sides. You will understand that one 
of the most sensitive issues we had to look at as we drafted 
amendments to the code was without a doubt the issue of 
replacement workers. As has been said by almost everyone, not 
only did it divide labour and management but the members of the 
task force were unable to reach a consensus on it.
<P>
	Bill C-66 will not impose a general ban on the use of 
replacement workers as requested by the Bloc in its Motion No. 40 
and by the NDP in its Motion No. 38. Nevertheless, the code will 
not be silent on this matter as the Reform Party proposes in its 
MotionNo. 37.
<P>
	It is important to mention that the unions and employers subject 
to the Canada Labour Code, although deeply divided on the 
regulation of the use of replacement workers, recognized in their 
submissions to the task force that the use of replacement workers 
was not a legitimate practice if its purpose was to get rid of union 
representation or undermine the role of the union rather than to 
achieve an acceptable collective agreement.
<P>
	When asked to comment on the task force's recommendations, 
management and labour while maintaining their opposing positions 
on the issue of replacement workers recognized nonetheless that 
the majority recommendation of the task force was an acceptable 
compromise.
<P>
	Therefore, under the proposed subsection 94(2.1) of the Canada 
Labour Code, if it is demonstrated that the employer is using 
replacement workers to undermine the union's representational 
capacity, the employer's conduct will constitute an unfair labour 
practice. The Canada Industrial Relations Board will be given a 
discretionary power to require the employer to stop using 
replacement workers for the duration of the dispute.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8554"> 8554 </A></B>
<P>
	Some claim that the use of replacement workers could in itself 
constitute proof of the employer's intention to undermine the 
union's representational capacity. If this was the result the 
government had sought, the bill would have been worded to 
prohibit the use of replacement workers without making reference 
to the employer's purpose in doing so.
<P>
<B>(1930)</B>
<P>
	A number of parties that appeared before the standing committee 
claimed that the terminology used to describe this new, unfair 
labour practice did not reflect the spirit of the task force majority 
recommendation. Specifically, some employers claimed that the 
phrase ``undermining a trade union's representational capacity'' 
was too broad and could be interpreted as prohibiting the use of 
replacement workers under any circumstances, regardless of the 
employer's purpose in doing so.
<P>
	They therefore asked that the wording of the bill reflect the task 
force majority recommendation and stipulate that employers can 
legitimately use replacement workers in pursuit of legitimate 
bargaining objectives. The committee did not act on these requests 
for good reason. This new prohibition is worded in the same way as 
the other prohibitions in the code referring to improper motivation. 
However, the union will have the burden of proving that the 
employer's intention in using replacement workers is to undermine 
the union's representational capacity and it will not benefit from 
the reversal of the burden of proof.
<P>
	We are confident that the new Canada Industrial Relations 
Board, which will draw its membership from management and 
labour, will have the necessary expertise to develop criteria for 
providing and applying this new provision.
<P>
	Finally, Motion No. 27 which was put forward by the Bloc 
prohibiting the use of replacement workers with bargaining unit 
employees has to maintain services necessary to protect the safety 
and health of the public. We believe that such prohibition would 
only generate unnecessary litigation.
<P>
	What the proposed amendment envisages is a somewhat bizarre 
situation in which an employer not only seeks to have services 
maintained by bargaining unit employees, but also to recruit 
replacements to work alongside them. Add to this unusual 
circumstance a trade union ready to negotiate the maintenance of 
services by its members and to accept that they will be working 
with replacements doing bargaining unit work. In all an eventuality 
which is to say the least unlikely.
<P>
	If the parties do not agree on the maintenance of services issue, it 
will be up to the board to resolve the matters and to decide on a 
case by case basis just what services should be maintained, who 
should perform them and finally to devise and an order which 
makes industrial relation sense.
<P>
	We therefore ask the members of the House as a fourth 
replacement workers provision of Bill C-66 as drafted-as it 
represents a fair balance between the parties opposing but 
legitimate interests-
<P>
the employees right to be represented by a union and negotiate their 
working conditions collectively and the employer's right to keep 
their business viable during a work stoppage.

	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Group 
No. 10 deals with section 107 and in some ways with section 108 of 
the act. Section 107 is the area of the labour code that deals with 
ministerial intervention.
<P>
	I agree with my colleague who introduced this motion that 
probably this is not the way to handle this. At the time the problem 
arose with the restructuring offer put forward by Canadian Airlines, 
we suggested that changes be made to section 108 of the act rather 
than have this piecemeal approach where the minister can intervene 
and order a vote.
<P>
<B>(1935 )</B>
<P>
	When a restructuring proposal is put forward, we are certainly 
not advocating that the collective bargaining process be usurped in 
any way. We are saying that it was not obvious to us which way 
Canadian employees would vote, but it was entirely obvious to us 
that they should have the opportunity to do so. It was obvious that 
they wanted that opportunity. The rest of their colleagues had the 
opportunity to vote on the restructuring proposal and we felt it was 
at the very foundation of democracy to allow them to have the vote.
<P>
	I would agree with my colleague from the Bloc that section 107 
could be done away with provided that section 108 is strengthened 
to allow union members to vote on a restructuring proposal put 
forward by their employer.
<P>
	I have a private member's motion on the Order Paper that would 
strengthen section 108 and would allow employees of any union 
the opportunity to vote on a restructuring offer-and I stress the 
word restructuring-by their employer.
<P>
	We have spent quite a lot of time today discussing the grain 
shipping aspect of the amendments to this bill. As my colleague 
from Vegreville pointed out, I suppose that a lot of people have 
encouraged him to vote in favour of the amendment put forward by 
the government. At first blush one might say that it is an 
improvement, that it appears to guarantee getting our grain to 
market. It does not. We know it does not guarantee anything except 
that the grain in the terminals would be loaded on to the ships. That 
is a point that bears repeating. We want to ensure that it is perfectly 
clear.
<P>
	As far as sections 107 and 108 are concerned, it is down to a 
basic democracy. No road blocks should be put in anyone's way. If 
employers want to put a restructuring offer to their employees, then 
the employees should have a right to vote on it. There should be no 
pressure on them from the government to vote any particular way, 
but at least they should have the opportunity to express their views. 
If they would like to turn down the restructuring offer, that is well 
within their right. They would have to think about the 
consequences either way, whether they vote in favour or not in 
favour of the restructuring offer.
<P>
	I know my colleagues would like to speak to this and I believe I 
have my remarks on the record.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect 
to motions in Group No. 10 amending Bill C-66, I will vote in 
favour of the motion eliminating the minister's power to order a 
vote on the employer's final offers. I fully agree with this motion. 
To act otherwise would be undue political interference in labour 
relations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8556"> 8556 </A></B>
<P>
	Allowing the Minister of Labour to order a vote is contrary to 
free bargaining. Normally, the minister, in particular the minister 
of this government, will use his powers on the employer's side. 
This is why it is unacceptable to give such power to the Minister 
of Labour.
<P>
<B>(1940)</B>
<P>
	We must give both parties enough freedom to establish their 
power relationship as they see fit. The political authority must not 
exercice undue pressure on the unions. Only the unions, in 
particular the negotiating teams, must determine the right moment 
to submit offers to their membership.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to talk briefly about the preventive 
withdrawal from work for pregnant women and nursing mothers. 
Unfortunately, there is no provision to amend the Canada Labour 
Code to protect pregnant women within the federal public service 
or in other jobs under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	There is an increasing number of women in the labour market. In 
1993, they accounted for 40 per cent of workers, as opposed to only 
35 per cent in 1971. Of course, the number of work accidents 
involving women has increased since there are more women in the 
work force.
<P>
	The Public Service Alliance of Canada has launched a campaign, 
which I support, for the introduction of provisions in the Canada 
Labour Code to ensure healthy working conditions for a pregnant 
woman or a nursing mother by reassigning her, within the 
reasonable limits of her abilities, to jobs that pose no threat to her, 
the foetus or the child she is nursing. We must reduce the risks that 
can affect both the parents and their children.
<P>
	The whole issue of working conditions that can have a 
detrimental effect on the reproductive system has been neglected 
for too long. The effects of work on pregnancy, including on the 
health of the mother who experiences important physiological 
changes and on the health of the foetus, have not been given serious 
consideration. Not much more attention has been paid to the 
relationship between work and sterility, miscarriages and birth 
defects.
<P>
	If we improve working conditions so that pregnant or nursing 
women can work without risk, all workers will be better for it. 
When risks associated with a pregnant or nursing woman's job 
cannot be remedied, measures will have to be taken to make 
reassignment possible for the whole pregnancy or nursing period. 
Otherwise, the pregnant or nursing woman must be entitled to paid 
leave until the end of her pregnancy or nursing period.
<P>
	Precautionary cessation of work is a very important issue and I 
call upon the government to introduce a legislation on it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am rising to speak again on the final group of report 
stage amendments to Bill C-66. I am presenting a couple of 
amendments which delete sections 107 and 108.1 and a similar 
section in the companion act, the Public Service Staff Relations 
Act.
<P>
	One of the amendments before us tonight relates to section 107 
of the Canada Labour Code which I am proposing to delete from 
the code. Section 107 reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Minister, where he deems it expedient, may do such things as to him seem 
likely to maintain or secure industrial peace and to promote conditions favourable to 
the settlement of industrial disputes or differences and to those ends the Minister may 
refer any question to the Board, or direct the Board to do such things as the Minister 
deems necessary.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1945 )</B>
<P>
	For some members of the House this section will be immediately 
recognizable because it is the section of the code that the Minister 
of Labour used to justify his interference in the Canadian Airlines 
negotiations with its employees who were or are members of the 
Canadian auto workers.
<P>
	I am proposing the deletion of this section of the code today 
because there has always been concern that this section could be 
wrongly used and the case in point simply proves the point.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the hon. member proposing an 
amendment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> No, Mr. Speaker, I am simply following the 
amendment before us. I am proposing the deletion of this section of 
the code because there was concern with the section. It is just as it 
was outlined in the text.
<P>
	The minister's action over this dispute with the Canadian auto 
workers and Canadian Airlines substantiates the argument that 
labour's rights can be abused if this section of the code is used and 
therefore it should be removed from the code to prevent any further 
abuse of workers or their rights.
<P>
	Some have even argued that the use of section 107 in the case of 
Canadian Airlines and the CAW was illegal because the parties to 
the contract were not in the process of regular collective bargaining 
with regard to their contract. However, the fact that this section 
could be trotted out and used so quickly to remove any semblance 
of real bargaining only proves how dangerous it is if it is to be used 
improperly.
<P>
	I do not want to debate the issue at stake in that dispute to any 
length tonight but I do want to remind members of the House, and 
those who are listening or watching or who are reading this that the 
federal Minister of Labour in the middle of the company's 
reorganization negotiations with the union, in this case the CAW, 
ordered 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8557"> 8557 </A></B>
<P>
the Canadian Labour Relations Board to conduct  a vote of CAW 
members on a company offer that was still being discussed by the 
elected leadership of the union.
<P>
	The minister used section 107 ``to seek industrial peace'' and in 
so doing interfered directly in the negotiations between the 
company and its employees. It was an unprecedented move which 
throws into doubt the entire collective bargaining process in areas 
of federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	The only way left to guarantee, secure or maintain confidence in 
the process is to delete this section of the code so that it can never 
be used in this fashion again. It was not only an unprecedented 
move but it was also almost impossible to carry out.
<P>
	The Canadian Labour Relations Board ordered to carry out this 
directive, this vote of CAW members, had to scramble like ants 
under foot to try to figure out how to do it. Of course, it did not 
have to conduct the vote in any case because negotiations 
continued and in the end a supportable agreement between 
Canadian Airlines, the CAW membership and the Government of 
Canada was reached using collective bargaining, using the table for 
the discussions.
<P>
	At the time in the House of Commons I said we were offended by 
the decision of the Minister of Labour to force a vote of CAW 
members at Canadian Airlines, which we called an unprecedented 
and shocking attack on workers' rights. At the same time, we said 
we recognized the minister's attempts to use the Canada Labour 
Code to protect the bungling of the Minister of Transport who 
seemed not to understand the real crisis facing Canadian Airlines or 
who chose to ignore it.
<P>
	I said New Democrats recognized that the real issue at stake at 
the time was and still is the stability of an industry which has 
demonstrated that it cannot regulate itself. In taking that position I 
acknowledged that we care about the jobs at Canadian Airlines. We 
cared about the future of the industry but we were concerned that 
by focusing only on the concessions being demanded of the 
working people that the job and industrial security we all desired 
would be lost in the long term.
<P>
	For those who remember my statement, I concluded by saying 
that if the federal government wanted to be involved in Canadian 
Airlines restructuring, it should leave the collective bargaining to 
the affected parties and go to the table with a real package that 
addresses the real problems in the industry. Obviously given the 
situation today that is exactly what they should have done then.
<P>
	The Minister of Labour has said in relation to the amendments to 
the Canada Labour Code proposed by the government that the 
legislation is here to support the collective bargaining process 
within the federal jurisdiction. Obviously section 107 stands in the 
way of effective collective bargaining and therefore, by the 
minister's own standards, I say it should be removed.
<P>
<B>(1950)</B>
<P>
	Also, in the amendments before us today I am proposing the 
removal of section 108.1 for similar reasons. This section was 
introduced in December 1992 by the former Conservative 
government without warning or consultation with the labour 
organizations in Canada. Ironically, the rest of the legislation, Bill 
C-101 at the time, into which this section was incorporated, dealt 
with matters under Part III of the code, not Part I which we are now 
dealing with, which had been subject to extensive consultations 
with both labour and management.
<P>
	Labour took the position then and continues to say today that this 
section represents an unwarranted intrusion into the collective 
bargaining process by a third party. New Democrats agree. Today, 
through our amendment to Bill C-66 on the floor of the House of 
Commons, we ask that section 108.1 be deleted. I urge support for 
this resolution.
<P>
	The clause, as I said, was introduced without any consultation. 
Implicit in the clause is the belief on the part of the government 
that the union or bargaining team does not represent the interests or 
the will of the membership. By interfering in the process the 
minister is saying that he knows better than the elected and 
accountable union executive or bargaining team what is in the best 
interests of the union membership at the bargaining table. Such an 
anti-democratic interference should have no place in legislation 
enacted by the House of Commons.
<P>
	To suppose an arbitrary decision by the Minister of Labour is a 
superior process to the democratic structures of trade unions is 
offensive and calls into question the sincerity of the government's 
commitment to the collective bargaining process. It calls into 
question the commitment of the government to upholding the 
rights of the democratic workplace, institutions and trade unions 
themselves. It must be repealed.
<P>
	I should also mention that the existence of this provision in the 
code poses a severe threat to the fundamental right of workers to 
withdraw their labour. By giving the minister the right to intervene 
at any time, including after notice to collective bargaining has been 
given, it effectively allows the minister to circumvent the free 
collective bargaining process as well as the right to strike.
<P>
	In conclusion, I submit that under these circumstances I can only 
hope that the members of the House who believe in the concept of 
free collective bargaining will join me in supporting these 
amendments so that these particularly objectionable clauses in the 
legislation can be removed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the series of 
motions put forward with a view to repealing a number of current 
provisions of the Canada  Labour Code. These include, as has been 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8558"> 8558 </A></B>
<P>
mentioned, sections 107, 108 and 108.1 of the code, as well as 
section 90.1 of the Public Service Staff Relations Act.
<P>
	Section 107 of the Canada Labour Code authorizes the Minister 
of Labour to do things which seem likely to maintain or secure 
industrial peace and to promote conditions favourable to the 
settlement of industrial disputes. For those purposes, the minister 
may refer questions to the Canada Labour Relations Board or direct 
the board to take necessary actions.
<P>
	During the task force review of Part I of the code, which 
included extensive consultations, there were no representations 
from either labour or management with respect to section 107 of 
the Canada Labour Code. When the Minister of Labour held 
consultations, meetings across the country, this section was not 
raised.
<P>
	In November of 1996 the Minister of Labour directed the Canada 
Labour Relations Board to conduct a vote among the employees of 
Canadian Airlines International, who were represented by the 
Canadian auto workers, to determine whether or not they would 
accept the restructuring proposals of their employer. The minister's 
ability to act last November assisted in the resolution of a serious 
situation which threatened the jobs of thousands of workers and the 
future of Canadian air carriers.
<P>
	I believe members would agree that section 107 is a potentially 
powerful tool and should be used sparingly when there is no other 
apparent avenue to follow. It would, however, be folly to remove 
such an option which may offer a solution to those tricky labour 
relations problems that occur when the parties find themselves in a 
hole and do not know how to stop digging.
<P>
	The Bloc has also put forward an amendment to repeal section 
108 of the Canada Labour Code. This section authorizes the 
Minister of Labour to establish an industrial inquiry commission 
with the appropriate powers to investigate industrial relations 
matters.
<P>
	I am a little puzzled as to the Bloc's motivation for seeking a 
repeal of this provision, as the issue was not raised during the 
extensive consultations leading up to the introduction of this bill.
<P>
	Industrial inquiry commissions have been appointed by 
ministers of labour over the years to examine important labour 
relations issues and make recommendations. In some cases, 
commissions have been instrumental in assisting parties to resolve 
difficult issues and conclude collective agreements.
<P>
	In other cases, commission recommendations have formed the 
basis for new industrial relations policy. I fail to see any legitimate 
reasons for removing from the code the provision that allows the 
Minister of Labour to appoint a commission to inquire into 
significant industrial relation issues within federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	Finally, amendments have been put forward for the repeal of 
current provisions in the Canada Labour Code and the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act with respect to final offer votes.
<P>
	Section 108.1 of the Canada Labour Code allows the Minister of 
Labour to direct that an employer's last offer be put to the 
employees of the bargaining unit for a vote if the minister believes 
it is in the public interest to do so.
<P>
	There is an equivalent provision in section 90.1 of the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act, the legislation regulating collective 
bargaining in the federal public service.
<P>
	As these provisions have never been used federally, there is no 
reasonable basis for seeking their appeal due to misuse. The key 
reason invoked by unions in support of repealing this provision was 
that they were adopted in 1993 without prior consultations with the 
parties.
<P>
	This is no longer the case. The question of last offer votes was 
raised during the extensive consultations with labour, management 
and other interested parties prior to the introduction of Bill C-66.
<P>
	The Sims task force thoroughly examined whether the last offer 
vote provision in the code should be modified or repealed. Unions 
unanimously sought its repeal while employers asked that the 
provision be modified to require a last offer vote in any dispute at 
the employer's request, as is the case in a number of jurisdictions.
<P>
	While the task force reported that it found no convincing 
evidence supporting expanding the provision to allow unfettered 
employer requests for last offer votes, it also recommended against 
repeal of the current provision.
<P>
	In its view the power of the minister to direct last offer votes 
should be retained to be used when there are genuine grounds to 
exercise the option in the public interest.
<P>
	The overall package of recommendations of the Sims task force 
was endorsed by both labour and management as balanced. Bill 
C-66 respects that balance. The repeal of section 108.1 of the code 
was not included in that package and should not be added to this 
bill now.
<P>
	With respect to the equivalent provisions of the Public Service 
Staff Relations Act, the task force mandate did not include a review 
of the Public Service Staff Relations Act. Bill C-66 does not 
include any substantive amendments to that act.
<P>
	To close now, I would like to add my thanks to the people who 
took part in the debate today, report stage of Bill C-66.
