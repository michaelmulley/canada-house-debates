</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
already had an opportunity to tell the House that I support 
the bill now before us.  I did, however, mention three 
reservations and I will repeat them today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I was critical of the fact that RCMP officers were 
excluded from compensation during their career for 
service related injuries.  This anomaly, this injustice, has 
fortunately been corrected by an amendment introduced by the 
government itself, in response to representations from the 
opposition, including my own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I expressed my concern with respect to the three clauses 
in the bill which allow the minister the dangerous power of 
exchanging with various departments and agencies information of 
a personal nature obtained under the terms of the legislation. 
We must watch out for slip-ups.  Big Brother is never far away. 
We remember the megafile HRDC secretly compiled on every person 
in this country using information provided by various federal 
departments and agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, and most important, I have already said how fortunate it 
is that the contribution of civilian personnel who served 
overseas during the wars has finally been recognized.  And I 
also pointed out how sad it is that it has taken 55 years to 
achieve this.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-41 does not take this huge delay into account.  This bill 
would be perfect if it had come to the House 50 years ago.  That 
was not the case, however, and there is nothing in Bill C-41 to 
compensate for that half century that has passed.  These people 
are being penalized for our delay in looking after them.  I 
tried to bring that up yesterday with the minister in committee, 
but to no avail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister indicates that the average age of those eligible 
would be around 79.  This means that a number have already died, 
and will have nothing but our esteem and recognition of their 
merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, we approve of this bill despite its 
imperfections. 
We would not like to hold up benefits to this group through 
delaying tactics.  Most of them have been waiting now for 55 
years.  That is long enough.  I would feel badly to make them 
wait a day longer.

<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there has been much 
commentary and some criticism of late about the speed with which 
legislation is moving through the House.  However, I doubt that 
anyone could find fault with moving forward quickly a piece of 
legislation that has been crafted to help Canada's veterans in 
their remaining years.  I will keep my comments brief today so 
that we can proceed rapidly to approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-41 extends veterans' benefits to a number of worthy 
civilian groups with wartime service overseas.  It also helps to 
meet the government's commitment to the Standing Committee on 
National Defence and Veterans Affairs by helping improve the 
quality of life of serving members of the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the current members of the committee for 
allowing the bill to proceed so efficiently through committee 
stage so that we could debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I referred to earlier, this bill extends benefits to groups 
that served in wartime virtually alongside our armed forces and 
essentially under military type conditions of service.  These 
groups are the Newfoundland foresters, the Canadian firefighters, 
the Red Cross and other nursing aides and staff as well as the 
Ferry Command. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the course of the second world war, 3,680 Newfoundlanders 
served in the Newfoundland Overseas Forestry Unit, although many 
later transferred to the British armed forces or served with the 
British home guard.  There are approximately 1,000 surviving 
members today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian firefighters were recruited to help in the blitz in 
Britain.  Of the original 400, perhaps 150 survive today. 
The Red Cross and other nursing aides and staff performed a vital 
service, essentially as unpaid volunteers, as ancillary health 
care workers alongside medical units of the forces.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally there is the Ferry Command, a special organization 
formed to collect, test fly and deliver war planes primarily to 
the European theatre.  This group suffered truly terrible 
casualties.  Sadly, of the 200 Canadians perhaps only 50 survive 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation gives these individuals greater access to the 
income support programs and disability pensions administered by 
Veterans Affairs Canada.  It also opens up opportunities for 
additional health care benefits including the veterans 
independence program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill helps veterans, a worthy objective by itself, but it 
has also been designed to help current members of the forces.  At 
the present time Canadian forces members can only receive a 
disability pension for a service related disability that occurred 
in or resulted from service in a special duty area such as a 
peacekeeping mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those members who suffer a disability from fighting a flood 
in Canada, for example, their disability can be assessed and 
entitlement to a pension can be granted while they are still 
serving.  However no Veterans Affairs Canada pension can begin to 
be paid until after they have left the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments in Bill C-41 remove this inequity and allow all 
Canadian forces personnel with service related disabilities to 
receive Veterans Affairs Canada pensions upon application 
regardless of where the injury occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also amendments in the bill which include a number of 
minor improvements in wording and other legislative housekeeping. 
A few examples are clarifying regulation making authorities, 
correcting cross references, correcting the French name of the 
department, repealing obsolete legislation, and benefit 
improvements for couples who are both veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House have an opportunity today to pass 
legislation which improves the lives of brave men and women who 
have served our country well in the past and those who continue 
to serve our country well today.  I urge that we do the right 
thing and give unanimous consent to third reading of Bill C-41. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I imagine that the majority of 
Canadians watching this morning have been looking for the 
benefits of the bill from a period of time when many members of 
the House were not even born.  On average they have been waiting 
up to 55 years, which I doubt is the average age of members of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The audience out there who will be recipients of the benefits in 
the bill is very few in number, compared to the brave people who 
served on the frontlines during the war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Younger Canadians and those looking at the bill in the House for 
the first time ask what the Newfoundland Overseas Forestry Unit 
has to do with the war.  As a matter of fact those people had 
some tremendous skills not just in cutting trees, but skills in 
building beams so that coal, a badly needed war commodity, could 
be shipped.  They were able to speed up the shipment of coal, 
which was very valuable to munitions plants and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague mentioned the number 3,680.  As one who is a 
bit older than the average member of the House I remember what 
little attention they received.  I also remember a movie about 
those in the Ferry Command, but little attention was ever given 
to those brave people.  Because Newfoundland was not part of 
Canada at the time, most of them joined the British army rather 
than joining the Canadian army.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have a comment about the Canadian firefighters.  Somebody 
picking up the bill, or even students in school, would ask what 
firefighters have to do with veteran related bills.  These were 
brave people who went overseas.  Many lost their lives in the 
terrible blitzkrieg, particularly of the city of London.  They 
have had basic access to income tested veterans programs but 
limited or no access to pensions for service related disabilities 
and no access to veterans independence program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some current problems with the VI program, but this is 
not the bill or the time to be discussing them.  I certainly will 
be discussing the problems with the veterans independence program 
in committee.  Hopefully we can resolve some of the current 
problems, particularly as they relate to veterans widows trying 
to live alone in their own homes.  If any of them are listening, 
or members of the press, let me assure them that I would bet 
money the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans 
Affairs will deal with those issues and look after them pronto. 
At least that is the feeling I have from the committee. Certainly 
that is my aim as an official opposition member of that 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a word about another group my hon. colleague 
mentioned, the Ferry Command personnel.  These people got some 
recognition during this time, but they flew unarmed planes.  They 
flew sometimes in the worst of conditions, delivering the planes 
across the Atlantic Ocean to Africa and Britain.  Many times the 
equipment and fuel supply were very limited and as a result many 
lost their lives.  There are not many of these honourable and 
heroic people left in Canada.  As a matter of fact, later on this 
month there is a commemoration service to honour a few more than 
50 of these great people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame that Canada has taken 55 years to honour people 
whose fatality record equalled that of the air force.  It is not 
a very bright chapter in Canadian history.  Although many of them 
may be listening this morning, they are probably feeling more 
gratitude about the fact they are being recognized in the few 
short years they have left to live rather than any remuneration 
they may receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been 55 years.  Many of these people are up to 90th 
birthdays.  It has been many years and some of them have missed 
many opportunities.  In spite of the benefits coming to these 
deserving groups so late in their lives, at least the official 
opposition, and I understand all opposition parties in the House, 
will be supporting Bill C-41. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a perfect bill.  Whenever we deal with the recognition 
of people, pension funding or liabilities, we almost have to make 
a bill to fit every individual person.  It is like providing some 
aid to farms in western Canada, which I might point out is 
virtually nil.  It is very difficult to get a bill that will suit 
everyone's needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw attention to the statement allegedly made by the Minister 
of Veterans Affairs to the Atlantic media, which I found to be 
very misleading.  It bothers me somewhat, simply because he 
suggested the opposition delayed the passage of the bill.  I hope 
it was a media error.  I am proud to stand in the House today and 
say no one, particularly in the official opposition, delayed the 
passage of the bill. He claimed that we did not let the bill go 
through all stages after second reading.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the bill had gone through at that time the significant 
amendment the minister announced today regarding the RCMP would 
probably not have been picked up.  That is what all parties on 
this side of the House wanted.  This was accomplished, but I do 
not think it was the result of the opposition in any way delaying 
passage of the bill.  I hope in due course the minister will make 
the necessary corrections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am on this point I would like to clear up another matter 
which may mislead people.  The bill, when passed, would give 
pension benefits to certain civilian groups for overseas service 
during the war.  We all have to agree today that this is very 
laudable.  It is really not what these groups have asked for year 
in, year out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure every member of the opposition and the minister know 
full well these civilian groups were asking for the same benefits 
the merchant navy vets were receiving, as was announced recently. 
I am not opposed in any way to the merchant navy vets getting 
benefits, but it is very difficult to draw a line between the 
merchant navy and the Ferry Command, to draw a line between the 
brave nurses who served at the front, or to draw a line between 
those who went into the pits of the coal mines in Newfoundland. 
It is a pretty small line to draw, and they did not get anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister singled out merchant navy vets for ex gratia 
payments for this injustice but completely ignored these groups 
in the process.  I do not know why.  I have some ideas why they 
were ignored, but I suggest this should be the subject of another 
bill which I recommend the minister introduce into the House as 
soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received piles of submissions and letters.  As soon as I 
was appointed by the official opposition as the member in charge 
of veterans affairs, the letters came in from all over Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the concerns on both sides of the issue.  A person 
who has lived for many years with a disability, which we might 
say was a frontline disability, is only now receiving 
compensation.  Those few hundred out there are asking the same 
question.  The precedent has been set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was rushed quickly through the House.  We will not 
block the bill, as we have said from the very beginning, but 
there are some individuals out there who I hope are considered on 
an individual basis.  There are so few of them left there is no 
reason why they should not be included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example.  A retired sergeant named Michael 
Schlueter contacted my office hoping to have some input in the 
bill.  The retired sergeant thought it would be possible for him 
to appear as a witness before the standing committee, but I told 
him that would not take place simply because we were not hearing 
any witnesses.  Let me speak about this chap.  While on duty in 
Canada he had part of his right arm blown off. 
It was not in a war zone but it was related to a war effort. 
Because he was injured in Canada and not in what we would call a 
special duty area, he was not eligible for a disability pension 
until he was discharged from the forces.  Thank God we have 
corrected that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we have to look at this because those people are 
wondering, if the navy vets are eligible for retroactive 
payments, what about the other people?  Therein lies a very 
significant problem.  If we were confronted with the sergeant, 
how would anyone in the House answer that?  I do not need to 
single him out.  There are probably hundreds of them.  Any other 
Canadian can receive a disability pension while they are 
employed.  The bill corrects that injustice so that from now on 
anyone in the Canadian forces or the RCMP can collect a 
disability pension if they are injured on the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sergeant, who has only one arm now, told me that the bill 
creates two classes of disabled ex-armed forces personnel: first, 
those who will collect a disability pension if they are injured 
after the bill is passed; and second, the others who are 
ineligible for a disability pension because they were injured 
before the bill was passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a pretty sobering thought, is it not?  I hope the 
committee will work on that and really think about it.  We just 
cannot leave out those individual Canadians because of some magic 
deadline.  There are only a few hundred of them left and we need 
to recognize them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the minister and the committee have to consider 
ex gratia payments for those deserving individuals I have just 
mentioned.  I do not think we can run away or hide from that.  I 
really do not think Canadians would want the House to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the minister for working with the opposition and 
taking seriously our concerns about the RCMP.  I fully endorse 
the amendment.  I could not care less whether the amendment came 
from this side of the House or even from another party.  The fact 
is that it is there and it needs to be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give my consent to the bill because of the humanitarian 
treatment accorded to the widows of vets receiving compassionate 
awards.  There are some issues still to mention but we will deal 
with them later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give credit to the department for recognizing its 
accountability when mistakes are made in calculating payments but 
not burdening vets or their widows with having to repay 
overpayments.  I have been through some of that and it is 
generally wee sums of money.  People at that age, some of them 
now living alone, get flustered when they see a bill coming in 
that they do not understand.  I commend the government for making 
that movement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that the provisions governing the amount of income 
support is calculated in such a way that it benefits the veterans 
more than it does the department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to support the bill but I want to caution members 
and those listening in who may benefit in some small way.  I hope 
this is not the end of our responsibility on the committee.  I 
think we have a lot of study to do yet.  There are people out 
there from Prince Rupert to St. John's who are striving to live 
alone in their own homes.  We have to go back and make sure we 
find a way to recognize them more completely.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, better 
late than never. 
Our government has just realized, a half-century 
after the fact, that various categories of Canadian civilians, 
including firefighters and members of the Red Cross, shared the 
same merits and the same hazards during the second world war and 
the Korean war as uniformed personnel.  Yet they not been 
entitled before now to the pensions and other benefits that are 
a concrete indication of the national gratitude enjoyed by war 
veterans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-41, which we are considering at the moment, is intended, 
and I congratulate myself on this, to correct this injustice, 
but it achieves this end only partially, as I will soon show. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another category of deserving civilian fighters has waited 55 
years for recognition.  I am speaking of the sailors of the 
merchant marine.  The injustice they suffered has now been 
corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today concerns other categories of civilians 
serving abroad.  They are primarily the members of the Corps of 
Canadian Fire Fighters for Service in the United Kingdom.  These 
men helped fight the fires ignited nightly by the German 
bombardment of London, in particular, during the first two years 
of the war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others benefiting from the bill are the Canadian members of the 
voluntary aid detachment of the British Red Cross during the 
first world war. It took 82 years to remember them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Welfare workers and voluntary aid workers in the second world 
war and the Korean war are also finally being recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not forgotten either are the civilian pilots in the Ferry 
Command, who often at the risk of their lives convoyed aircraft 
built here and destined for the European front between Canada 
and Great Britain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of these various categories of civilians deserving 
of recognition by their country are, under this bill, being 
accorded the same treatment as military veterans and therefore 
are entitled to a pension. As many of them are dead, their 
widows will benefit.  And if the widow is dead, no one will 
benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that this good legislation will not be 
retroactive. It does not provide any compensation for the 55 
years during which all these brave people were forgotten by 
their government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an injustice. From the moment we recognize that these 
people are entitled to national recognition just like military 
personnel, who have been getting pensions since the end of the 
war, it is totally unfair to make them pay for the fact that the 
government waited for over half a century before acknowledging 
their contribution and thus their rights to national 
recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not find it acceptable for the government to permit itself 
what would be considered a reprehensible abuse of power, had it 
been an individual's treatment of his employees. Can anyone 
imagine the head of a firm admitting that some of his staff had 
been unfairly treated for years and agreeing to remedy the 
situation only if the remedy were not retroactive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this principle of obvious equity does not seem popular with 
the government, if we are to judge by its reaction to the 
Canadian Human Rights Commission ruling ordering it to 
compensate those of its employees who, because they were women, 
had for years been paid less than their male counterparts. It 
will be recalled that Ottawa held out against making these 
retroactive payments for a long time. It only did so because it 
was forced to by the tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-41 is to correct another anomaly and this 
is a good thing. This one involves members of the Canadian Armed 
Forces who are still serving but are suffering from 
service related disabilities. These men and women are not 
currently entitled to disability pension before their release. 
This situation is going to be corrected. We need hardly say that 
we are in favour of this provision of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we could not understand why clause 46 excluded the RCMP 
from this measure. I called on the government to withdraw this 
provision from the bill. We are pleased to hear that it just 
amended the act accordingly.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another anomaly was also corrected. As the result of an error 
for which the recipient is in no way responsible, a veteran 
might receive a higher amount of pension than his entitlement 
for a certain period of time. Until now, when the error was 
detected, the person concerned was required to pay back the 
overpayment under conditions and a deadline that might be 
prejudicial to his quality of life. From now on, the victims of 
these administrative errors will be treated more humanely. We 
approve of this provision, while once again regretting that it 
has been so long in coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize and to conclude, we support this piece of 
legislation, but we regret that it comes some 50 years too late 
and that it does not provide for the payment of an indemnity to 
recipients for this delay. However, as I said at the start, 
better late than never, and we will support this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my hon. colleague from the NDP for switching with me.  I will be 
short so that she will have time.  I hope everyone has a chance 
to say a few words with regard to Bill C-41. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am so pleased that I have been part and parcel of the 
committee that unanimously agreed to Bill C-41.  When I was five 
years old, two of my brothers served overseas during the 
conflict, so I know there is a need for this bill.  During that 
time the Red Cross, the Ferry Command, the Newfoundland Overseas 
Forestry Unit and all the civilian forces made sure that the 
needs of my brothers and all the others in the military were met. 
They did their job in order to bring peace around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also pleased to see that the bill deals with disability. We 
must never forget that most of our veterans are now seniors who 
are aging every day.  I hope and pray that the bill will be 
expanded a bit to include veterans' hospital care because these 
people need to be taken care of as well.  Many of our veterans' 
hospitals have been closed down and replaced with tiny units. We 
need to look at that because it is not enough for these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to make sure that the rest of the compensation 
package is in place for the merchant navy men and their widows. I 
have been assured by the minister that he will work tooth and 
nail to make sure that happens.  The government is still 
processing some of the applications that have been put forward 
for the compensation packages.  We need to expedite that as 
quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many more applications were received than had been anticipated. 
We thought there would be around 4,500, but my understanding is 
that about 14,000 have been filed and it has not been easy.  It 
has been a lot of work.  However, when it comes to the merchant 
navy men and their widows I will never stop speaking out for 
them.  They are very dear to my heart.  Even this morning I had 
calls from merchant navy men asking me about their compensation 
packages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the civilian war-related benefits act we must 
always remember that it was brought in by the PC government and 
Gerry Merrithew, who was the minister of veterans affairs at that 
time.  He is from Saint John, New Brunswick.  That act is now 
being amended to include more.  I congratulate the minister for 
expanding upon the act, but he should remember that it was 
brought in by the PC government.  We saw that there were people 
who had been terribly neglected and that there was a need for 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want everyone to remember that everyone on the committee, our 
friends from the Bloc, our friends from the NDP, our friends from 
the Canadian Alliance and the PC Party, agreed with the minister 
on the bill and unanimously agreed to bring the amendments to the 
civilian war related benefits act before the House of Commons. 
All of us know there are those who are suffering today and those 
who are in need.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with my hon. friend from the Bloc that indeed the RCMP 
must be included.  We cannot just eliminate those RCMP officers. 
They put their lives on the line for all of us who sit in the 
House of Commons.  They put their lives on the line so that we 
could have the peace which we we have around the country.  The 
Red Cross, the Ferry Command, the firefighters and all of them 
put their lives on the line as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust that there will be no opposition whatsoever to Bill 
C-41.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I thank my colleague from 
the NDP for allowing me to speak now because I have another 
commitment later in the day. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to speak today to Bill C-41, an act to improve the veterans' 
benefits for our veterans.  I would like to say that the NDP will 
be supporting this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to say that over the last three and a half 
years I have been very honoured to work with the legions in my 
riding.  Those are the Somme legion, the centennial branch and 
also the army, navy, air force club.  They have been able to 
deepen my understanding of the issues facing veterans in our 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank the wonderful people at the family 
resources centre at both Shannon Park and Shearwater.  They also 
have helped me to understand the problems facing people who are 
in the armed forces and their families.  It is because of these 
people that I am able to work at the level I do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addressing the context of Bill C-41, first I should express 
some scepticism about the government's intent on following 
through with its commitments to Canada's vets.  I must say that 
over half of the claims received from the merchant mariners are 
still waiting to be processed and we are all very concerned about 
that.  These Canadians have risked life and limb.  During the war 
they worked to deliver food, fuel, goods and people who were 
under attack from German submarines, facing casualties and, all 
too often, death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every month more of these brave members of our community succumb 
to illness and old age.  It has been estimated that merchant 
mariners are dying at the rate of 12 per month.  Veterans affairs 
reportedly has 45 people working on these claims but that is 
clearly not enough.  Staffing levels should be increased to meet 
the demand created by the merchant mariners' claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wishes Bill C-41 to be taken seriously by the 
people who would be affected by it, it should state here and now 
that it is committed to ensuring that all merchant mariners who 
are entitled to compensation receive their full benefits and that 
it will not to turn its back on them after the first payments 
have been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation sets out to extend veterans' benefits to a 
number of civilian groups with overseas service and would allow 
serving members of the Canadian armed forces to receive 
disability pensions while still serving.  I am pleased to see 
this.  I believe that the government is responding to issues 
raised by SCONDVA.  Allowing serving members of the Canadian 
armed forces to receive disability pensions while still serving 
is indeed a step forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats feel that the government should be doing much more 
to address broader issues relating to working and living 
conditions for our troops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the military personnel who live on bases in various 
parts of the country are contending with old and deteriorating 
accommodations which are among some of the worst found in the 
country.  From leaky roofs to cramped, old and deteriorating 
spaces, Canadian forces personnel deserve much better from the 
country which they have admirably served, and in particular from 
the Liberal government responsible for these decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very interested to see that the Liberal government has 
cash on hand to spend $15 million on a brand spanking new armoury 
in Shawinigan which, by great coincidence, is in the riding of 
the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-41 sets out to ensure serving forces personnel may 
receive disability pensions while still serving.  New Democrats 
agree that troops serving Canadians by assisting with crises, 
such as the great ice storm of 1998, or fighting the floods on 
the Red River or working as peacekeepers in Bosnia, would be able 
to collect a veterans affairs disability pension while continuing 
to serve their country. 
Bill C-41 would ensure equality with members whose disabilities 
arose in special duty areas and reserves.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the legislation as it would extend veterans benefits

of the war effort.  This includes such groups as the Canadian Red 
Cross, St. John Ambulance, Newfoundland overseas foresters, 
Canadian firefighters and pilots who ferried over the Atlantic, 
and other groups who assisted the military overseas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will provide these individuals with greater

the war effort.

</I></B></P><P align=left>During the second world war the corps of civilian Canadian 
firefighters for service in the United Kingdom assisted the war 
effort by fighting fires in Britain that were created by the 
dreaded blitz.  Also during the war overseas welfare workers, 
which included members of the Canadian Red Cross and St. John 
Ambulance, served as welfare workers overseas in support of the 
injured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important aspects of the bill is working to 
ensure equity of access to services and benefits to all Canadian 
forces members regardless of whether the injuries occurred in 
Canada or on a foreign deployment.  At the present time Canadian 
forces members can only receive a Veterans Affairs Canada 
disability pension for a service related disability if it 
occurred in or resulted from service in a special duty area such 
as a peacekeeping mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canadian forces members hurt while fighting a flood in 
Canada, their disability can be assessed and they can be entitled 
to a disability pension only if they are still serving.  However, 
no Veterans Affairs Canada disability pension can begin to be 
paid until after they have left the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments would remove this inequity and allow all 
Canadian forces members with a service related disability to 
receive a Veterans Affairs Canada disability pension upon 
application regardless of where the injury occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of concerns that I would like to raise about 
Bill C-41.  One of them was raised yesterday in the House by my 
colleague from Regina—Qu'Appelle.  That is the issue of the 
treatment of first nations veterans who were discriminated 
against during the first world war, the second world war and the 
Korean War in comparison to non-first nations veterans.  My 
colleague has also put forward a private member's bill in order 
to try to receive appropriate compensation and recognition of 
these very important veterans.  This is one area that is not 
dealt with in Bill C-41 and we would like to see much more 
attention given to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-41, the veterans benefits legislation, takes some 
important steps to support the veterans in this country.  It 
takes some steps in recognizing the contributions and the great 
sacrifices that our fighting forces have given to this country.

work in harmony with the provinces and territories to address

a valued member of the Patten commission that recommended 
important reforms to the policing service in Northern Ireland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Shearing recently expressed his grave concerns about the 
current failure of the British government to focus on the main 
points of the Patten report.  The central theme of the report is 
the need to establish a holistic approach to policing in Northern 
Ireland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He further warned that the report cannot be cherry-picked but 
must be implemented in full if it is to win the confidence and 
support of both communities in Northern Ireland.  An impartial 
police force acceptable to both communities is a sine qua non for 
success in the peace process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I join with Dr. Shearing in calling upon the Government of 
Britain to implement in full both the letter and the spirit of 
the Patten report on policing in Northern Ireland.

ACOA funding if it moved to the minister's riding.

the new program announced by the government under the community 
development program the funding is restricted to non-urban areas 
as defined by Statistics Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for that is that urban areas like the city of St.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that while the unemployment rate 
inside the overpass in the city of St. John's is approximately 
equal to the national average, outside the overpass the

in September the government of Quebec inaugurated an 
international free trade zone at Mirabel, thus following up on 
the recommendations of the Tardif commission through a series of 
actions to assist investors.  We are still waiting to hear from 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What stage is the federal government at with respect to the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
believe that the project proposed is still under study by the 
Minister of National Revenue.  We can consider the proposals 
which are on the table.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the issues they are fighting against is poverty and how 
it affects their families.  Meanwhile the government talks about 
the great strides it has taken for the rights of women in Canada. 
All of us in this Chamber know that poor children are a result of 
poor parents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

of the importance of our youngest citizens, our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most recently we agreed with the provinces to a $2.2 billion 
investment in the early years.  In addition, we have increased 
our investments to the national child benefit which goes directly 
to low income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to employment insurance, I would tell the hon. 
member that for women the unemployment rates have come down to 
the lowest point in the last 25 years.  From our point of view 
the best support for a family is a job.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Species at risk, like the burrowing owl and the loggerhead

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order today 
relating to the use of nomenclature in the House.  Today members 
of cabinet continuously referred to members of the Canadian 
Alliance as the reform alliance.  I point to Standing Order 10 
which clearly— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  Of course, we should refer 
to ourselves by not only our proper ridings but with the proper

22, the fire alarm rang and we had to leave the House in a 
hurry, just as I was about to ask a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that point, Mr. 
Speaker, you promised that the following Friday you would take 
into account the time that was left during that oral question 
period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Friday, another unforeseen event took place, as everyone 
knows, and the following Friday, which is today, I noticed 
that for some reason you did not take into account that period of 
time, since oral question period ended at noon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would still like to ask my question and I would like the Chair 
to tell me when I will be allowed to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Is the hon. member's question for a minister who is 
now sitting in the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> No, Mr. Speaker. My question is for the 
Minister of National Defence, but he was not there either when 
we came back that Friday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday the 22nd, when we came back into the House and gave 
our unanimous consent to allow an NDP member to put his 
question, the Minister of National Defence had already left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> When we come back next Monday, you will be allowed 
to put your question. I will be here and I will make sure that 
you have the opportunity to put your question. If you so wish, 
you can even be the first Bloc Quebecois member to ask a 
question.

I have two points of order.  The first one has also to do with 
the name of the party.  Mr. Speaker, you made the ruling very 
clearly.  I would like to know whether you simply urge members to 
use that name or require them to use that name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We urge that more than anything.  I always 
refrain as much as possible from giving orders in the House. 
Members of parliament are urged to act with respect toward one 
another. 
I know that it is not necessary in the overwhelming majority of 
cases to order anyone to do anything.  I am sure you will find an 
improvement in the weeks and months ahead.

called on it once. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  There are no words which of themselves are 
unparliamentary.  It is the tone in which they are used and at 
the time they are used.  I see the hon. member has left so I need

<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (for the Minister of Transport)</B> 
moved that Bill S-17, an act respecting marine liability, and to 
validate certain bylaws and regulations, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak at 
second reading of Bill S-17.  The introduction of the marine 
liability act represents a monumental step in the modernization 
of Canadian legislation regarding liabilities arising from 
shipping activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its new format and structure are setting a new standard in the 
way legislation should be implemented to better facilitate the 
adoption of future improvements and developments in this field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The modernization of Canadian legislation does not end with the 
introduction of this bill.  It is one of our ongoing policy 
objectives to ensure that the provisions of the new bill keep 
pace with a rapidly developing shipping industry and to ensure 
that the compensation provided by the various liability regimes 
keeps pace with growing economies.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to bring to the attention of the House 
Canada's efforts on the international scene with regard to the 
modernization of two important liability regimes to better 
reflect the nature of modern shipping.  I refer to the liability 
regimes for compensation for oil pollution, cleanup and damages, 
and to the liability for the carriage of goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On oil pollution liability, Canada is a party to the 1992 
protocol to the international convention on civil liability for 
oil pollution damage, 1969, and the international convention on 
the establishment of an international fund for compensation for 
oil pollution damage, 1971.  The purpose of these conventions is 
to provide adequate compensation to victims of oil pollution 
catastrophes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 12, 1999 such a catastrophe occurred off the coast 
of France.  The Malta registered tanker <I>Erika</I> broke in two 
in the Bay of Biscay, some 60 miles off the coast of Brittany. 
The bow section floated for several hours before finally sinking. 
Efforts to tow the stern section out to sea failed and the stern 
eventually sank approximately 10 miles from the location of the 
sunken bow section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Erika</I> was carrying 30,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil of 
which some 14,000 tonnes were spilled at the time of the 
incident.  The balance of the cargo remained in the sunken wreck. 
Approximately 400 kilometres of coastline were devastated and the 
damage to the wildlife, fishing and aquatic industry is still 
being assessed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a very early stage in the cleanup operations it was 
recognized that the extent of damages was likely to reach the 
maximum amount of compensation that the international oil 
pollution fund was able to offer under its existing arrangement, 
an astonishing $270 million Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The realization that the fund could prove to be inadequate to 
compensate all victims of the incident prompted calls from many 
of the countries that are party to the fund for a review of the 
limits of available compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A meeting of the contracting states was held in July of this 
year.  It was agreed that there was sufficient support, including 
support from industry itself, for an increase in the limits of 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the outset Canada has been active in the discussions that 
led to a proposal to increase the limit to the maximum level 
permitted by the provisions of the international conventions. 
This proposal, to be submitted next month to the International 
Maritime Organization, is co-sponsored by Canada and will see the 
limit of the fund increased to approximately $405 million 
Canadian.  As a result of these efforts Canadians will have an 
improved compensation scheme available to assist them in the 
event of such a tragedy occurring in our waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the title of cargo liability I would like now to turn to 
our initiative relating to the liability of shipowners for the 
carriage of goods.  The existence of rules that clearly establish 
the rights of shippers and shipowners is critically important, 
especially in an era where trade is liberalized around the globe 
and where trading partners are pursuing initiatives to increase 
access to international markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internationally Canada has always participated in transport 
related initiatives to harmonize shipping standards, rules and 
regulations with other countries.  The current legislation 
governing the liability of the shipowner for damage to cargo 
during maritime carriage is governed by the 1993 Carriage of 
Goods By Water Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This act was first adopted in 1936 on the basis of a 1924 
international convention known as the Hague rules, which were 
amended in 1968 by the Visby protocol.  This amendment 
essentially increased the limit of liability per package and 
provided for claims on the basis of gross weight of the goods as 
an alternative to a per package limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1978 the United Nations adopted a new international 
convention on the carriage of goods by sea, commonly known as the 
Hamburg rules.  These rules introduced substantial changes on the 
basis of liability, burden of proof and procedures for claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to the so-called COGWA, 1993, that is the Carriage of 
Goods by Water Act, Transport Canada published a discussion paper 
recommending the adoption of the Hamburg rules by Canada. 
Shippers clearly preferred the adoption of the Hamburg rules and 
felt that these rules were more responsive to their interests 
than the Hague-Visby rules, especially in terms of the new 
approach to carriers' defences and increased limits of liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many ship owners, their insurers, cargo insurers and legal 
experts strongly favoured the adoption of the Hague-Visby rules 
because they believed the Hamburg rules would have a major impact 
on shipping costs and litigation costs as the new regime would 
need to be tested in the courts since previous case law would no 
longer hold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Extensive consultations with the various industry groups on 
these two options have not resulted in a consensus on the 
adoption of either of these two international regimes. 
Eventually a compromise solution was reached with the adoption of 
a staged approach to both regimes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT29"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT29"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1225

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach involved the immediate implementation of the 
Hague-Visby rules with provisions to bring the Hamburg rules into 
effect at a later date when a sufficient number of Canada's 
trading partners had ratified them.  The staged approach would 
therefore ensure that Canadian law is always in step with that of 
our trading partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also resulted in the adoption of a provision in the 1993 
COGWA, which requires the Minister of Transport to conduct a 
periodic review of the act to determine whether the Hague-Visby 
rules should be replaced by the Hamburg rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach reflected Canada's intention to accept the Hamburg 
rules when it was proven that they would provide a viable basis 
for new liability conditions for international trade.  In the 
intervening period the government committed itself to promote the 
Hamburg rules and to pursue with Canada's trading partners the 
possibility of a co-ordinated action that would lead to wider 
acceptance of the Hamburg rules at the international level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned previously, to fulfil the legal requirement 
contained in the Carriage of Goods by Water Act, 1993, and as 
part of the first review period, the Minister of Transport 
submitted a report to parliament in December of last year in 
which he concluded: first, the Hague-Visby rules should be 
retained in the current Carriage of Goods by Water Act until the 
next review period ending January 1, 2005 and, second, Transport 
Canada should continue to make efforts in consultation with 
industry and in co-operation with like-minded countries with a 
view to developing practical options for a new international 
regime of liability for the carriage of goods by sea, which would 
achieve a greater uniformity than the Hague-Visby rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The outcome of this review was driven by the developments in 
international law on cargo liability, the stagnant position of 
the Hamburg rules internationally and their minimal impact on 
Canadian seaborne trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Progress to achieve uniformity of international law suffered 
considerable setback in recent years resulting from the 
proliferation of regional or unilateral approaches to the 
modernization of domestic laws which have attempted to address 
real or perceived difficulties in the international conventions. 
Divergent rules on cargo liability now apply in many countries. 
There is a danger that other countries might pursue a similar 
path of unilateral solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A concrete example of such independent action is the proposed 
amendments to the U.S. carriage of goods by sea act, 2000.  The 
U.S. act, if adopted in its current form, would add to the 
proliferation of divergent regimes thus impeding international 
uniformity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada and a number of countries and industry organizations have 
raised concerns about the significant departure of the proposed 
U.S. legislation from prevailing international law.  The 
uniformity of international law remains a key objective of 
Canadian policy.  The outlook for achieving this objective is 
improving with the ongoing interest of several international 
organizations on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of these organizations agreed to undertake important work 
in a consistent manner by avoiding duplication of efforts and by 
consulting with other international bodies interested in cargo 
liability such as the International Maritime Organization, the 
United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, United Nations 
Commission on International Trade Law, and Comité Maritime 
International. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the subject of cargo liability is on the agenda of the 
OECD maritime transport committee.  The committee recognized that 
there was sufficient interest internationally to consider 
measures that would improve the current situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>UNCITRAL and CMI have undertaken to review current practices and 
laws on the international carriage of goods by sea to determine 
why countries cannot reach consensus in this area.  As part of 
this commitment UNCITRAL and CMI have established a working group 
to gather information, ideas and opinions as to the problems that 
arose in practice and possible solutions to those problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada will continue to pursue, in co-operation with trading 
partners, the objective of a uniform international law on 
carriage of goods by water and will assist UNCITRAL and CMI in 
their current efforts.  Canada will support any new initiative at 
the international level that would have a realistic chance at 
success in achieving this objective.  These are just two of the 
things that Canada wishes to do when it comes to the matter of 
proving the international liability regimes for the carriage of 
goods around the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, today we are addressing Bill S-17, the marine liability 
act.  The title of Bill S-17 means that the bill originated in 
the other place, namely the Senate.  My party has been advocating 
for quite some time the idea of an equal, effective and elected 
Senate.  I would like to touch on some of the ideas with regard 
to whether an unelected place should be putting forward 
legislation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT30"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT30"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1230
<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in 1990 in my home town of Calgary, the Prime Minister in 
his leadership race was advocating that the Senate be elected. He 
also went on to make promises to that effect in 1993.  If he had 
upheld his original promise to have an elected Senate when he 
became Prime Minister in 1993, most of the people in that place 
at this time would probably be elected.  However, he did not live 
up to his promise to the Liberal delegates in 1990 and he did not 
live up to his promise to the Canadian public in 1993 that the 
other place would be elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result we have a circumstance whereby today legislation has 
been put forward from that place, from an unelected body that is 
unaccountable to the taxpayers in this land.  I know because we 
have tried to draw before us in committee people who should by 
all rights be accountable to the Canadian taxpayers, who should 
be accountable even to the Prime Minister after he has appointed 
them, and that would be at least something, or at least 
accountable to this body, the House of Commons, that is duly 
elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, by refusing to appear, either at the request of the 
Prime Minister, this place or the Canadian taxpayers on the 
matter of their own budget, the whole idea of money and of 
spending taxpayers' dollars, it has proven that there is no 
accountability by an unelected body, namely the Senate, to the 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on for a very long time about the problems I have 
with an unelected Senate and therefore I think a less effective 
Senate.  If it was elected, it would take up the battle cries 
like it did during the GST, whereby the GST dropped from 11% down 
to 9% and finally to 7% because of what those in the Senate did. 
Once again that is one other of the broken promises.  I remember 
in 1993 when the Liberals went about this country talking about 
killing, abolishing and scrapping the GST and they did not do 
that.  They broke their faith with the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The person who used to be the deputy prime minister, the member 
for Hamilton East, knows all too well that they broke their faith 
with the Canadian people on the matter of the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somebody who was booted out of the party and sits now over on 
this side, the member for York South—Weston, knows all too well 
that the Liberals broke its faith with the people on its promise 
to kill, scrap and abolish the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now go on to talk about some of the other things in the 
marine liability act that will have an impact on people.  The 
marine liability act will consolidate various pieces of 
legislation and concerns into a single piece of legislation. Of 
course, that fits generally with the tone of the government to go 
ahead and centralize a lot of different things and to hone its 
power.  That is a typical theme in this place for this Liberal 
administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also touches on this whole idea of the other 
liabilities, the problems associated with it and the lack of 
priorities coming out of the government.  The government is 
dealing with this liability act, which will have an impact on our 
transportation system, when Canada's competitiveness in 
transportation is slipping.  This is a travesty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now we have a serious problem with taxes in this country, 
and especially in realm of transportation.  We collect about $4.7 
billion in fuel taxes.  That is a lot of money in terms of fuel 
taxes.  If we collect $4.7 billion in taxes, where does that 
money go?  Does it all go back into transportation? That would 
make perfectly good sense, would it not?  That money could used 
to improve a lot of highways and port facilities. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT31"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT31"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1235

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although that money could do untold good for all sorts of 
transportation, and although we have the highest prices for 
gasoline we have ever seen, what is happening?   Of the $4.7 
billion that came in by way of gas taxes for the fiscal year 
1998-99, which will probably be higher this year, only a paltry 
4.1%, or $194 million, went back to provincial transfers for road 
and highway development.  That means that for every dollar the 
average person pays in gasoline taxes, 96 cents goes toward 
things other than transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The obvious question that comes up when we are talking about 
liabilities, which the government is, and priorities in 
transportation is, what other types of things does that 96% go 
into?  It goes into the general revenue fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the other priorities.  Let us look at the 
serious liabilities that the government lies out for the 
taxpayer.  That 96% of money that people pay goes into dumb 
blonde joke books.  Frankly I do not know what that has to do 
with transportation but the fact is that transportation tax 
dollars and fuel taxes are going into those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I am not sure how accurate the member's comments are, but 
I wish he would speak about the bill.  It is a question of the 
relevance of his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member has a 
good point of order.  I am sure the hon. member is just about to 
come back on subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Madam Speaker, there is no subject more 
pressing than this whole idea of the liability act, which 
originated in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go on to talk about some of the things that the 
government is once again doing.  It is allowing the supreme court 
to call the shots.  It is reacting to supreme court decisions 
rather than allowing the supremacy of parliament to rule the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could also talk about the violation of provincial 
jurisdiction. I could go through chapter and verse if the hon. 
member across the way wants me to, but I want to address the 
ideas that are involved in this.  One of the ideas is that 96% of 
the money that is raised through fuel taxes for transportation, 
which this bill deals with, is going to other things. What is it 
going to?  I alluded to dumb blonde joke books.  If that is not a 
liability in terms of the use of taxpayer dollars and fuel taxes, 
I do not know what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the general revenues raised through transportation 
taxes go toward funding pornography?  What sense does it make to 
take transportation tax dollars and fund pornography films like 
<I>Bubbles Galore</I> and various other films?  That is exactly 
what is happening.  How is pornography a higher priority than 
transportation, building good roads and building better ports? 
This does not make any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it gets worse.  That 96% of dollars, that $4.5 billion, 
a sum larger than almost any individual can possibly fathom—the 
biggest purchase most people make in a lifetime is a home—is 
also going to fund bleach and syringes so that convicts can shoot 
up their drugs while in jail.  That is an abuse of taxpayer 
dollars.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise again on a 
point of order.  We would really like to hear what the Alliance 
Party has to say on Bill S-17.  If the hon. member does not have 
any comments, maybe one of the other members here might be 
willing to do so, instead of putting us through his 
pre-election— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I remind the hon. 
member again to try as much as possible to keep his comments 
pertinent to the bill now before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  No doubt about it, Madam Speaker, that 
when I look at Bill S-17 it refers to fatal accidents, liability, 
compensation and damages.  It refers to all those things.  That 
member across the way may not like our reference to liability, 
compensation, fatal accidents and damage, but I will tell him a 
bit about compensation, damage, liability and fatal accidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the House what is a fatal accident.  A fatal 
accident is that we have $4.5 billion of transportation tax money 
that is going to fund court challenges.  Can we believe it?   We 
have groups out there that are using taxpayer dollars to sue our 
government to get more taxpayer dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what happens when money is taken from taxpayers on fuel 
and it is put into general revenue.  It is a whole lack of 
priorities on transportation.  The government takes that money 
and does not put it into roads, into ports, and into things that 
obviously have tangible benefits.  Instead it sticks it into 
other things.  I do not know how it can possibly argue its 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We get prison golf courses.  The government is using $4.5 
billion taken in fuel taxes under the auspices of transportation 
on prison golf courses so that prisoners can play on the green. 
How does it justify that?  How is that a priority? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gets worse.  The $4.5 billion are also used to pay for early 
parole, appeals.  Prisoners use those taxpayer dollars to appeal 
for early parole.  It is not bad enough that they get out when 
they do with light sentences and slaps on the wrist, but that 
$4.5 billion pay for early parole appeals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I have no idea what the member is talking about.  This 
has nothing to do with the bill.  I would ask the member either 
to speak to the subject or to leave the House.  It is insulting 
to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member must 
realize that there is a bill before the House that is important 
to his party and to other parties.  I ask him to please try to 
keep to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am speaking directly to 
that bill.  I will talk about how it violates provincial 
jurisdiction and some of the other things the government does to 
violate the jurisdiction of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My goodness, on transportation Alberta can speak only too well 
with regard to the national energy program which the government 
brought forward and the millions and billions of dollars it 
stripped out of the province of Alberta to cripple an industry 
that was crucial to transportation.  I could go on.  There is no 
problem if they want me to talk about transportation fallacies 
and what the government has done to help cripple transportation. 
I will do that gladly because I think the people need to hear it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money raised through transportation taxes funds things like 
ACOA vote buying.  We heard questions in the House of Commons 
today on the very issue of a minister threatening and even taking 
money and pushing businesses into his riding.  That is clear 
political manipulation.  That is exactly what the bill is all 
about and that is exactly what we should not allow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise once again on 
a point of order on the remarks of the member opposite who 
refuses to deal with Bill S-17.  I thought the Alliance Party had 
come to parliament with the view that it would bring, in its 
mind, some civility and decorum. 
We have an example here of the exact opposite.  The House is here 
to do a particular bit of business.  I wish he would relinquish 
his time to other members who might wish to speak to Bill S-17.

House.  Obviously members of other parties all seem to agree that 
perhaps we are going a bit too far from the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Madam Speaker, let us address the 
subject.  This bill is attempting to update things since the 
1950s and in the government's own kind of Liberal way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the things that have changed indeed since 
the 1950s in its own kind of Liberal way.  Indeed pork barrelling 
existed before the 1950s and pork barrelling exists after the 
1950s.  It is still part and parcel, is it not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking today about changing the marine law.  While we 
are at it, let us look at some of the other changes that are 
required in law and some of the other laws that the government is 
attempting to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gun registry was originally supposed to cost only $2.2 
million.  Instead it is going to be costing over $500 million, 
nearly half a billion dollars.  Where is the government getting 
that money from?  It is getting it from transportation fuel 
taxes.  It is taking it from the people who fill up at the pumps 
every single day in this country.  The government is taking the 
people for $4.5 billion and using it to spend on things that will 
not keep criminals away from firearms but instead it will punish 
law abiding citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shame on the government.  That is what transportation fuel 
taxes— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I stayed here this afternoon to debate Bill S-17.  I 
implore you to rule the member out of order.  He is now talking 
about gun registration which has nothing whatsoever to do with 
this bill.  The member is abusing the rules of the House. He 
should be called for that and should be told to shut up, leave 
the House or stick to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I do believe that the 
whole question of relevancy is a very important one in the House. 
I therefore urge the member to please debate Bill S-17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Indeed, Madam Speaker, and now I am going 
to start talking about some of the other bills which have been 
passed with regard to transportation in other countries as they 
relate to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 the United States passed the Transportation Equity Act. 
It wanted to modernize its act to bring it to the 21st century, 
which is something that the government says it is trying to do 
with this bill.  That bill was investing $217.9 billion over six 
years into infrastructure, a large portion of which will go into 
roads connecting its borders to Canada and Mexico.  The bill 
would legislatively guarantee that a minimum of 90.5% of federal 
fuel tax receipts from each state are returned to each state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we only had that type of vision and commitment on that side 
of the House with regard to transportation taxes, where the 
government would be willing commit even 50% of the money it 
raises in transportation taxes and put it toward transportation. 
In the United States 90% of the money raised in transportation 
taxes goes toward those states to help out in transportation. 
Shame on this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about another issue with regard to transportation. 
That is the revenue collected by the federal government for 
aviation fuel which goes into general revenues.  It is bad enough 
that the government is taking $4.5 billion in transportation fuel 
taxes from taxpayers, which is more than what it puts into 
transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We not only have people who drive cars, we also have planes. 
The revenue collected by the federal government for aviation fuel 
also goes into general revenues.  It does not go toward improving 
our airports.  It is only a pittance that is returned to the 
airports through the capital assistance programs.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is just another example of the billions of dollars the 
government collects from various industries that are our base 
economy.  Instead the money goes toward other things that the 
government thinks are more important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are talking about transportation and fuel taxes, I want 
to talk about a tax on a tax, where the government collects GST 
on top of fuel excise taxes.  That is supposed to be out of the 
ballpark.  It is absolutely wrong to place a tax upon a tax but 
that is exactly what the government has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It promised in 1993 that it would overhaul it and get rid of the 
tax on tax.  It is not bad enough that it has taken billions of 
dollars out of transportation and fuel taxes and has not spent 
those dollars on transportation.  It then goes ahead and takes 
another tax, the GST, and heaps it on top of that.  As a result, 
it becomes even worse.  It piles money hand over fist into the 
general revenue fund to use on things other than transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government use it on?  It uses it to buy goodies. 
Where does it buy those goodies?  It buys some of those goodies 
in the Prime Minister's riding.  Some of the transportation fuel 
taxes are going into the Prime Minister's riding,  They are not 
going into roads, ports, airports, improving the integrity of our 
roads, enhance traveller safety or economic viability but instead 
to buy votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we address issues of transportation, like Bill S-17 which 
originated in the the Senate, it is because we want to improve 
transportation.  It might be argued that the government might be 
doing something with regard to transportation in the prairies 
because the farmers are having problems transporting their grain. 
However, rather than allow the farmers some leeway, what does it 
do, it puts them in shackles.  We are paying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the average folks back home who are watching, when they buy 
gas at the pumps, they pay tax on that gas which goes to the 
federal government.  Some of that tax money is being used to put 
farmers in shackles because they want to sell their grain outside 
the wheat board.  Shame on the government.  That money could have 
gone to transportation.  It could have been a dedicated fuel tax 
but it is not.  Shame on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on with all sorts of other things that the government 
has been wasting and squandering committed fuels taxes on but it 
basically boils down to this.  We have a government that is 
elitist, out of touch and that is tax and spend.  That is exactly 
what is going on.  When the government takes in over $4.7 billion 
in dedicated fuel taxes and spends over $4.5 billion or 96% of 
that on things other than transportation, we know that is out of 
touch.  We know it is top-down.  We do not doubt for a second 
that it is taxing 100% and spending 96% on other things.  If that 
is not tax and spend I do not know what is.  Shame on it for 
doing that type of thing, especially considering it made all 
those election promises about taxes in 1993 and it has indeed 
raised them.  It is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the things that other countries are doing 
to improve their situations in transportation, things that Canada 
should be looking at.  Canada should be looking to improve its 
situation on trade barriers but instead we have trade barriers 
that exist between provinces.  One of the trade barriers that we 
have to deal with is between us and our major trading, the United 
States.  Our tax levels are so much higher than our American 
counterparts that we are driving businesses south. Even today in 
question period we had a minister who was asked about trying to 
drive a business around his riding so that he could benefit from 
jobs there.  It is a pretty clear case of pork barrelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, the government could be focusing its attention on some 
of the blatant tax problems and the lack of fairness that exists. 
It could focus on keeping businesses, which hire employees, 
provide jobs and tax revenue, in Canada rather than have them 
leave and go elsewhere.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have countries like Iceland, Australia, the United States, 
and the list goes on, that have taxes far lower than ours. 
Instead of addressing the tax levels, trying to lower taxes and 
dedicating fuel taxes, we have a whole liability act coming 
forward that will hamper our competitiveness because there is a 
total lack of priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government was focused on the idea of taxes, on the idea 
of cutting taxes and on dedicating fuel taxes, then we would have 
a spitting chance of being able to do better in terms of 
competitiveness.  Instead it helps to drive jobs out of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know we have a brain drain going on.  Members do not want to 
admit it over there but their lack of priorities have helped to 
exacerbate that problem and make it worse.  Friends of mine are 
going to the United States and other countries around the world 
to find work because they cannot it here or because the tax 
levels are too high.  It drives them and their families out of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on with regard to Bill S-17 but I will wrap it up 
with this.  Bill S-17, the marine liability act, centralizes a 
lot of pieces of legislation.  It fits with the whole idea of a 
centralized, authoritarian, top-down structure that the 
government seems to like so much.  On top of that, it is falling 
in line with what the supreme court wants.  Once again the 
government is stepping on the toes of provincial jurisdictions. 
Once again it is failing to address the real issue of 
competitiveness, which is the true liability, and which is its 
record on taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that 96% of the money raised from fuel taxes should 
be going to transportation and it is not.  It is going to a lot 
of other things.  It is going for vote buying for the upcoming 
election. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I must tell you how flabbergasted I am by your 
exceedingly broad understanding and very considerable tolerance 
in connection with the rule on the relevance of speeches in 
force here in the House.  With all due respect, I would hope 
that it is tolerance and not a matter of looking the other way. 
I am weighing my words.  I do not know whether the ability to 
discuss matters of questionable relevance to the main subject 
should be seen as a precedent in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be tempted to start off with a long diatribe to the 
effect that I could blame the government, but I will come 
quickly to the content of this bill on the implementation of 
this international treaty.  I simply want to say that I too 
deplore the government's decision to introduce this bill in the 
other House.  It is called Bill S-17 because it was introduced in 
the Senate, the other House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the 301 members of this House would have done a 
worthy job, and the government House leader could have easily 
introduced this bill in the House of Commons, especially since 
the legislative calendar is rather empty in this pre-election 
period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, clause 107 of part 7 of Bill S-17 confirms the 
application of a tariff for those governed by the Laurentian 
pilotage authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take this opportunity to tell the House that the Bloc 
Quebecois remains aware and concerned and wants to pay tribute 
to the work done by the marine pilots, especially those in the 
Lower St. Lawrence and central Quebec.  The St. Lawrence River 
is a complex waterway.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These pilots have been battling for more than 30 years now for 
the survival of their profession.  We know that the shipowners' 
lobby in Canada is a very powerful one.  Why does this lobby 
have so much power over the government? One need only to look 
at the campaign contributions by the major shipping companies to 
understand very clearly why this lobby is so influential and why 
it has the government's ear so readily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A preliminary remark on this bill is that it implements in 
clause 107 application of a Laurentian pilotage charge.   I must 
also, because their annual meeting ended this week, greet the 
members of the Canadian Marine Pilots' Association, whose 
president is also the head of the International Maritime 
Pilots' Association.  This is the first time that a Canadian, 
and a francophone Quebecer to boot, has been the president of 
the international association.  He is Michel Pouliot, a resident 
of Saint-Jean, Île-d'Orléans.  As I said, the Canadian Marine 
Pilots' Association held its annual meeting this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that implementation of an international treaty is an 
important matter.  It is one that involves us all because 
treaties are becoming increasingly important instruments in 
international life.  Their numbers are multiplying. 
Hundreds of treaties are concluded every year, and are ratified 
by Canada and other countries.  First and foremost, an 
international treaty is a legal instrument that has been 
negotiated.  Negotiations may involve public servants or 
ambassadors, heads of state, or ministers representing heads of 
state.  There can also be negotiations with international 
organizations.  Often these international organizations are the 
forum in which such negotiations take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the framework of the United Nations organization 
often serves as a forum or organizes the holding of conferences 
at which treaties are debated and agreed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Depending on the constitutional law of the country, treaties 
sometimes require action by parliament to permit their 
acceptance by the country, so that the country can agree to be 
bound by the treaty. Practices may differ significantly from one 
country to the next. Here in Canada, a government can conclude a 
treaty and sign it after it has been adopted. It can even ratify 
it without parliament's prior approval or agreement that the 
country will be bound under the international treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are countries, however, that involve their parliament and 
can neither sign nor ratify—in most cases it is ratification—a 
treaty without the prior approval of parliament and the holding 
of a debate to give parliamentarians an opportunity to consider 
the text of the treaty and its provisions before the government 
commits internationally. 
In France, for example, parliament must adopt an act approving 
any treaty before the French authorities can ratify it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In parliamentary systems such as ours, but also that of other 
countries, there is a real lack of democracy in that 
parliamentarians are asked to adopt laws whose content is 
largely determined by the content of treaties negotiated by the 
governments, even though their parliaments were not involved in 
the discussions on that content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make this clear. Our role as an assembly of 
parliamentarians is to adopt laws. Canada signs treaties in 
other places and we, duly and democratically elected 
parliamentarians, are not called upon to review or examine the 
content of the treaty before its ratification. 
However, we are called upon to pass enacting legislation.  This 
is why I was saying earlier that Canada is suffering from a real 
democratic deficit.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry, who is 
listening to me carefully at the moment, introduced Bill C-214. 
Unfortunately, this bill was defeated in the House in the spring 
of this year by the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-214, introduced by my colleague from Beauharnois—Salaberry, 
provided for the House of Commons to be involved in the process 
for concluding treaties by giving a treaty prior approval and 
thereby authorizing the government to ratify a treaty after the 
House had examined the content of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision is interesting because, in a democracy, in our 
British parliamentary system, the party electing the most 
members forms the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is recognized as a prerogative of the government.  It is 
also recognized that, even if these treaties are submitted to 
the House for its consideration before their passage, approval 
of them rests ultimately with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about valid and often non-partisan suggestions  The 
government could recognize this.  My colleague, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport, recognizes 
that we in the Bloc Quebecois and probably other opposition MPs 
have made valid contributions to the debate in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past we have succeeded in convincing members of the 
Liberal majority of the merits of what we were saying and 
bringing about amendments.  Will the government admit that it 
does not have a monopoly on intelligence? Will the government 
admit that its way is not the only way? Will the government 
admit that democratically elected members from both sides of the 
House can make an interesting contribution to the debate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will just give one example, from my riding.  I had introduced 
Bill C-205—I hope that no one is going to raise the issue of 
relevance, because I do not want this to backfire on me and the 
tables to be turned—I just want to remind the House that I had 
introduced a bill to allow mechanics to deduct the cost of their 
tools.  There are mechanics, automobile technicians and garages 
in all 301 of Canada's ridings. 
They are everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I set out on a pilgrimage to convince members of all parties, 
and was so successful that, despite the reluctance of the 
Minister of Finance, who was opposed to my bill, the result of 
the vote at second reading was 218 in favour, i.e. the vast 
majority, and 11 Liberal members against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When someone comes up with something that makes sense, something 
that transcends party lines, I assume that we are all operating 
on good faith here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we all have our convictions.  I ask the hon. member 
to respect me, with my strengths and weaknesses, but also with 
my convictions.  I am not about to change allegiance, the Holy 
Spirit is not about to descend upon me and turn me into a 
federalist overnight, because my convictions are too strong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some colleagues here—the hon. member for Compton—Stanstead is 
one—are convinced, for reasons of political opportunism, that 
their chances of being re-elected are better with the Liberals. 
Anyway, democracy will have its say and the voters of 
Compton—Stanstead will realize that.  I am sure that when the 
next election comes, they will re-elect a member of parliament 
like Gaston Leroux of the Bloc Quebecois to represent them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that federal could very readily accommodate 
expansion of the provinces' ability to enter into treaties. 
This could involve Quebec, Alberta or British Columbia. 
Inspiration could even be taken from what is done in Belgium in 
connection with formulas for the ratification of treaties by 
parliaments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a partial explanation of why my colleagues in the Bloc 
Quebecois, and many Quebecers, want sovereignty, which will give 
them jurisdiction over their own treaties and will involve their 
parliament, that is the national assembly, in their 
implementation.  The national assembly will be the one to 
approve treaties before they become law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I wanted, through my very brief comments, to say 
that the Bloc Quebecois will support this bill at second 
reading. We will not systematically oppose it. However, we would 
like the government to take into account what I mentioned 
earlier regarding the implementation of international treaties, 
to take into account the situation that I illustrated to correct 
operational problems that have been going on for too many years. 
We will therefore support Bill S-17.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am very pleased to rise in the House today on behalf of the New 
Democratic Party to speak to Bill S-17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been listening to the debate and I must say I was very 
taken aback by the very outrageous comments of the member for 
Calgary West.  His comments on the bill were as bizarre and 
outrageous as his assault on bilingualism and the comments he 
made about whether or not new Canadians have a right to vote in 
nomination meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to question what the member is debating. I wonder if the 
member for Calgary West has talked to the Alliance member from 
Surrey Central who has lived in Canada for maybe three years and 
is now an MP.  Today's debate is about Bill S-17.  The comments 
of the member for Calgary West were out of order and had nothing 
to do with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
do not believe the member for Calgary West has opened his mouth 
today in the House.  I think the member has the wrong riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid that is 
not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, I believe the member for 
Calgary West was in the House earlier.  I may have the wrong 
riding, but I believe it was the member for Calgary West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-17 is probably not the most high profile piece of 
legislation before the House.  It certainly is not the most 
glamorous.  Probably very little attention is being paid to it. 
Nevertheless the marine liability act is an important piece of 
legislation.  Members of the New Democratic Party have some 
concerns at this point in the debate but will be supporting the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marine legislation is very fragmented.  It now falls within a 
number of different acts over many years.  Many of the acts are 
outdated.  They are certainly not in line with current processes 
and international law or the kind of legislation enjoyed by other 
countries.  It is very important that we are debating marine 
legislation today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Vancouver East contains a very large chunk of the 
port of Vancouver.  As someone coming from the west coast, marine 
legislation is something that I recognize is of great importance. 
Members in my caucus, including the member for Halifax West, the 
member for Dartmouth and all other members from Nova Scotia, have 
placed a great amount of emphasis on the need for marine 
legislation, particularly in terms of creating a shipbuilding 
capacity in Canada. 
We have had a long and very rich tradition in Canada of a marine 
industry, of building ships, of creating jobs.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say for myself from the west coast and my colleagues 
from the east coast that this is something we think is very key 
to who we are as Canadians, that is, to improve upon our capacity 
to produce economic wealth, prosperity and benefits from our 
shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before us today, although it does not deal 
specifically with a need for shipbuilding, does cover some 
important areas that need to be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-17 seeks to unify under this piece of legislation the 
various bits and pieces that have been fragmented over the years. 
It attempts to modernize these laws and to keep Canada in line 
with international conventions.  This is something we certainly 
support.  It is not only generating new legislation.  It is 
making sure that the legislation already in place is relevant and 
up to date and that it deals with the concerns we have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-17, as I have said, covers many areas that are already 
enshrined in law.  These include, for example, the limitation of 
liability for maritime claims, the liability and compensation for 
pollution and the liability for carriage of goods by water. These 
laws are generally now re-enacted in this bill with some minor 
changes to incorporate international conventions and supreme 
court decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other aspects of the bill that will also be clarified 
and these are certainly things that have been outstanding and 
needed attention.  We are very glad to see that they have been 
addressed in this bill.  They have to deal with personal injuries 
and fatalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the experience and the evidence has 
shown that at the present time under the existing legislation, 
which is now very updated, there is a lot of confusion that can 
arise because there is a very ambiguous and blurred line between 
federal and provincial legislation and responsibilities.  This 
has obviously caused a lot of problems.  The area of 
federal-provincial jurisdiction is something that we struggle 
with in this country.  It is something that we need to address 
through legislation.  It is positive to note that this bill will 
end what has been a confusing circumstance in terms of federal 
and provincial responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the bill is passed, clear outlines will be set regarding the 
relatives of those who die as a result of marine accidents in 
terms of the claims they can make and to whom.  For everyone in 
the House, just on the basis of common decency and respecting 
what happens to people when they have lost someone close to them, 
a member of their family, in some sort of marine accident, to 
have a procedure that is efficient, humane, respectful and 
understandable is something that is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very pleased to see that this now has been included in 
the legislation and that it will help people who are faced with 
these kinds of tragedies and accidents.  God knows we have all 
had experiences of having to deal with a bureaucracy after 
someone has had a serious accident or has died.  We know what it 
is like to have to go through the paperwork and make the claims. 
It can be a very difficult thing to do when you are in a grieving 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that this legislation will bring some clarity to the 
matter is an improvement.  It hopefully will help those family 
members who are dealing with a very difficult circumstance as a 
result of someone who has died or who may have been in an 
accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important aspect of the bill and, in fact, probably one 
of the more critical things, which may not have gotten a lot of 
attention, is that Bill S-17 will also prohibit shipowners from 
contracting out liability for loss of life or personal injury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current practice, one used for many years, is that within 
Canada it is very common for shipowners to insert a clause into 
contracts of carriage that removes the shipowner's liability. 
What does that mean? What has been the impact of that?

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me very much of the situation we faced with the 
Westray mine disaster, an example of corporate responsibility 
that was completely without consequences because there was not 
any clear legislation to say that individual corporate executives 
and the corporation itself are liable for their negligence and 
for the people they put at risk.  As members of the House know, 
members of the New Democratic Party have been a very powerful 
force, along with members from other parties, in bringing forward 
legislation to say that corporate executives and corporations 
must be held criminally responsible for any negligence or any 
criminal act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular feature in Bill S-17 addresses this same kind of 
principle.  It clearly talks about the kind of contracting out 
that took place in the past.  Let us imagine trying to contract 
out one's liability, saying “It is not really mine as a 
shipowner.  I will pass the buck to someone else.  I will pass on 
the responsibility to someone else”.  Again, the fact that the 
bill will remove that kind of situation is an improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this day and age we are in an environment that is 
increasingly dominated by multinational corporations, by huge 
organizations that are in some instances nameless and faceless. 
The sense of corporate responsibility and the sense of 
accountability for people who are trying to deal with the system 
are sometimes very far removed.  In this respect this one 
particular clause in the bill is a move in the right direction in 
saying that there must be corporate social responsibility, that 
the idea of hiding oneself behind a third party will not fly any 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These exemptions, for example, are already null and void in the 
United States, France and Great Britain.  There is no question 
that we should not be left behind on this issue.  Canada must act 
on this matter now because we do not know when a disaster may 
occur. We have to be prepared.  We have to make sure that 
legislation is in place that clearly protects victims and 
families of marine accidents and clearly shows the lines of 
responsibility in terms of where wrongdoing has taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken on aspects of the bill that we support.  We think 
there are improvements, but it is only fair to say that we also 
have concerns.  It is appropriate to lay those on the table and 
to be clear that we also have some questions about the bill. As 
the bill proceeds through the House, we would like to see some 
answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one clause that certainly does concern us.  After some 
research and some questioning of Transport Canada bureaucrats by 
our caucus, we have not really found any of the answers we are 
looking for.  We are very concerned with the fact that the bill 
would prevail over the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act if 
there were any inconsistencies or conflicts between the two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whilst we are willing to support the bill at second reading, I 
want to say that members of the New Democratic Party and our 
critic in this area, the member for Churchill, want further 
answers in committee.  We want to know how the bill might affect 
important environmental legislation and we want to know what the 
various scenarios and possibilities are.  We want to be assured 
that the bill will not override very important environmental 
protection in other legislation that exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, members of the New Democratic Party feel 
generally positive about the bill.  We think it is an improvement 
over what we have now.  It will be a piece of legislation that 
captures together the bits and pieces and the patchwork of 
existing provisions.  It will modernize the provisions for 
protection around liability.  It will clearly outline better 
corporate responsibility, which we think is important, and it 
will give better protection to those who travel by marine vessels 
or who are involved with them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore support the bill in principle but with the caveat 
that if the government is concealing some answers in terms of the 
concerns we have about other environmental and protection 
legislation, then of course we will look at the bill again and 
not be so accepting.  However, at this point we support it in 
principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rose on a point of order 
before before to correct the member on the name of the riding.  I 
was wrong and I apologize.  She was in fact correct.  I am sorry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is certainly a pleasure to rise in debate on the 
marine liability act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my case, I come from a province which is virtually surrounded 
by water, the province of Nova Scotia.  We often think that as a 
country that is itself almost surrounded by water and certainly 
has a lot of inland waterways as well as the oceans, we are past 
due on legislation with respect to marine transportation, marine 
liability and all marine issues, including environmental issues, 
shipbuilding policies, and even the question about fuel taxes for 
shipping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the legislation we have is past due and is behind 
that of many other countries that are as involved with marine 
issues as Canada.  In fact, the bill is just responding to our 
commitment under the Athens convention of 1974 to meet 
international standards on liability for marine accidents and 
also to the updated 1990 protocol.  It is certainly long past 
due, especially for a country such as ours that is so involved 
with marine aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own case it is really obvious that this is becoming more 
and more important because of the increasing economic activity on 
our waters, even the increase in the use of ferries from our 
different provinces and islands, not only in regard to the volume 
and numbers of ferries but also now that we are getting into high 
speed ferries and that sort of new technology, which creates 
problems in itself.  It also creates a concern about liability 
for marine issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourism is becoming a big issue on the waters as well.  Some of 
our smaller fishing villages along our coastlines have seen their 
fish stocks decline and the fishing industry decline along with 
that.  They have now turned to tourism, which includes tour 
boats, whale watching ventures and things like that.  All these 
ventures currently are not well protected for marine liability as 
far as our legislation goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who use these types of boats for both the carriage of 
people and the carriage of goods and services are not well 
protected.  The liability is very confusing.  Shipowners and boat 
owners can include exemptions to their liability on tickets. 
Whether they are effectual or not and whether they are actual or 
not is open to question.  There is no clarification.  The bill 
clarifies that and we support that part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A part of our economy that is exploding on both the east and 
west coasts is certainly cruise ships.  Up until now there has 
been confusion on liability in the event that there is a serious 
accident involving death or injury.  The bill will address that 
issue and that is long past due. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even ecotourism in my own area is becoming more and more viable 
as the demand increases and tourists from all over the world come 
to eastern Canada to see different aspects of our ocean life: 
whales, porpoises, seals, bird life, and recently even a small 
island in the Bay of Fundy near my riding called Ile Haute that 
we are hoping the Minister of the Environment will designate as a 
wilderness preserve.  He has indicated a strong interest in doing 
that.  If he does, it will create a whole new tourism industry in 
my riding.  It will involve boats carrying passengers to see this 
incredible island in the Bay of Fundy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important that the issue is dealt with.  There 
are many aspects of the bill that we support but we do not 
understand why there has been a delay in getting the bill to this 
point.  We go back to several aspects of other bills in the last 
parliament, such as Bill C-59, the carriage of passengers by 
water act, which was allowed to die on the order paper in April 
1997. 
The same terms of reference in that bill are in the new bill. 
This is three years later and ironically we are perhaps at the 
same stage now where this bill may die on the order paper if an 
election is called, as is speculated in the next few weeks.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament another bill, Bill C-73, an act to amend 
the Canada Shipping Act, died on the order paper.  It had the 
same terms and conditions as we have in this one.  It died 
because of an early election in 1997.  Here we are three and a 
half years later dealing with exactly the same words, exactly the 
same bill, and maybe facing another election so that it may die 
on the order paper again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we form the government next time we will bring it in and we 
will put it through.  We will not allow any more delays, any more 
inappropriate stalls for this bill, because it is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are aspects of the bill we do not support but we do 
support most of them.  We support the bill in principle.  It is 
long overdue.  As I said before, it basically lines us up with 
the international convention adopted in 1974 in Athens and the 
protocol.  We need a Canada marine law and this helps us in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the aspects we like is that it confirms that claims for 
wrongful death and injury in the maritime domain may be made 
against persons as well as ships under the bill, thus enabling 
relatives of deceased and injured persons to claim for loss of 
care, guidance and companionship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also modernizes the language of the legislation to make it 
clearer and allows people to proceed through courts a lot quicker 
in the case of litigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another part we support is the fact that it incorporates word 
for word into the new marine liability act the Hague rules 
statute under the Carriage of Goods by Water Act, which again 
should have been included a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It establishes the basis for amounts of liability.  There are 
different acts that deal with this issue and the present 
legislation is very confusing.  In some cases shipowners can 
limit their own liability by a simple statement of exemption, and 
this would eliminate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect is that the bill excludes the contracting out of 
liability by shipowners and operators, especially in marine 
passenger contracts.  Recently I followed up on a ticket I bought 
which had an exemption on it.  It turned out that the shipowner 
had contracted out the tour I was on.  They tried to confuse the 
situation by stating that if there were in effect an accident 
they would be hidden and protected from liability.  In any case, 
this prevents shipowners from escaping that liability by any 
exclusionary clause they want to dream up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-17 incorporates liability aspects of the 1974 Athens 
convention and the protocol, as I said earlier.  We do have 
questions about liability still remaining, especially with 
respect to the environment and some aspects of those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We expect it to come to the transport committee and be 
thoroughly examined.  We expect to have representation from 
Department of Transport officials and representatives from the 
industry to help us understand the pros and cons of the bill.  At 
that time we will make our final decision, but at the moment we 
support the bill in principle.  We think it is long past due.  We 
hope that the government will make sure the bill is not dropped 
from the order paper again this time as it was in 1997 and that 
the bill goes through. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I want to make two points if I may 
about the legislation.  First, this is legislation that is 
introduced from the Senate.  I think Canadians who are watching 
the debate here need an explanation of why a bill should be 
appearing before the House at second reading that has emanated 
from the Senate rather than following the normal procedure of 
first reading in the Commons and second reading as we are now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is reason for concern because the Senate, the other place, 
comprises an unelected chamber.  The senators are not answerable 
to the people. 
We must pause as parliamentarians and as all Canadians when we 
see a bill coming from the Senate.  If legislation is coming from 
people who are not elected then we need to be very concerned that 
this is the proper procedure.  I am absolutely opposed to bills 
coming from the Senate that are private members' bills. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT43"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT43"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1335

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in this instance this is not a private member's bill 
coming from the Senate.  This is a government bill that has been 
introduced in the Senate.  As the member for 
Cumberland—Colchester just remarked, the bill is essentially a 
piece of legislation that was before the last parliament and died 
on the order paper with the calling of the general election in 
1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have here an instance where the Senate can fulfil an 
important role.  That role is to expedite non-controversial 
legislation that is very much in the public interest which might 
otherwise experience considerable delay as it falls behind, shall 
we say, more politically pressing government legislation if it 
were to be introduced at first reading and follow the normal 
procedure in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say politically pressing, I am not in any way suggesting 
that this is not very important legislation.  Bill S-17, or Bill 
C-53 as it was known before, actually addresses an area of 
concern that is really crucial to Canadians.  Indeed, as I was 
looking through the actual text of the legislation I was amazed 
to think the type of protection we are talking about here does 
not exist in law already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are dealing with is the idea that when people buy 
tickets and board ships in this country with Canadian ownership 
they basically have no protection if disaster overtakes the ship 
and they lose their lives or are otherwise injured.  The regime 
that exists now is that people who find themselves in this 
situation are forced to go to the courts and use common law 
procedures in order to recover damages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation sets up a regime where the shipowners are 
required to have insurance and where there is a personal 
liability regime put in place for people who wish to travel by 
sea or, I should say, by our freshwater lakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to my point about the Senate, this is important 
legislation.  One of the difficulties is that the government and 
politicians in general do tend to be responsive to the political 
pressures of the day that might be forthcoming.  I will give a 
classic example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are expecting legislation in the House very soon pertaining 
to the implementation of the national health accord that was just 
struck between the Prime Minister and the premiers of the various 
provinces.  This has to do with our national health and the 
ability of our hospitals to provide decent services.  This has to 
do with the amount of money that comes from the federal 
government and is transferred to the provinces.  This is a 
politically urgent bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sad thing about the way this parliament operates, and this 
is not a criticism of the way this parliament operates but is a 
reality, is that politically urgent bills sometimes take priority 
over bills that are less politically urgent but are nevertheless 
just as important.  This is the case with the marine liability 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the legislation has gone before the Senate I think the 
Senate has had an opportunity to examine it in detail.  I do not 
expect, certainly not in the debate we have before us now, that 
any members are going to be raising really controversial issues 
with respect to this legislation.  Not in this debate.  This is 
one of the advantages of having it begin in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Cumberland—Colchester said, it will go to the 
transportation committee where it will get a thorough examination 
as would any other bill coming through the normal process in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that and having lauded the procedure that I am told 
goes back to Confederation, this is not unusual for the government 
to introduce legislation in the Senate in this way.  It gives me 
an opportunity to stress how much I am absolutely opposed to 
bills coming from the Senate that are introduced by senators 
themselves. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a specific bill in mind, and that is the current bill 
coming from the Senate called Bill S-20, that reflects a 
senator's initiative with respect to trying to impose an extra 
tax on cigarettes in order to raise money to finance advertising 
campaigns to lower the incidence of youth smoking.  I am sure 
that is laudable but it is very wrong for senators to introduce 
controversial bills when they do not have to answer to an 
electorate as any one of the members of this place have to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make sure that the Canadian public out there realizes 
that what is happening here with Bill S-17 is something that is 
fully in conformity with the rights and privileges of elected 
representatives in this place.  It does not reflect what may be 
happening with respect to this bill coming from the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to the marine liability legislation very briefly, as 
the member for Cumberland—Colchester spoke very well on the 
issue, many Canadians have taken car ferries within Canadian 
waters.  Many Canadians have taken ships to England or even 
cruises on the western shores of this wonderful land of ours. 
Many of them would be appalled to realize that they have not been 
covered properly, as they would see it, by insurance.  This is 
legislation that is not only timely but overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make one other very important point that was alluded to 
by the member for Cumberland—Colchester.  That is the business 
of shipowners providing an exemption of liability on the ticket. 
Basically they purport to contract out their liability if an 
accident overtakes the passenger who bought the ticket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with that is that it lets the shipowner off the 
hook. For all the person buying the ticket knows, the insurance 
company that has taken the liability contract may be a 
fly-by-nighter and disappear overnight.  It is really no kind of 
protection at all. This legislation, in addressing that and in 
requiring shipowners to have liability insurance in the first 
place, is very progressive legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I second the sentiments of the member for 
Cumberland—Colchester.  We should expedite this legislation as 
quickly as possible, certainly at this stage of debate, get it 
into committee and get it passed.  I can assure him the he has 
nothing to worry about.  I am fully confident this bill will pass 
this time well in advance of the next general election call. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I applaud the hon. member for suggesting that the other 
place should not be the originator of government bills.  That is 
a commendable point.  I also recognize that member is more 
amenable than most to the idea that the other place should have 
serious measures of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member expound more on his idea that the other 
place, namely the Senate, should not be the originator of 
government bills, and maybe how he feels about the whole idea of 
Senate elections and accountability in that place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
the question but he misunderstood me just slightly.  I find no 
fault with the fact that the government has introduced this bill 
in the Senate first where it has been examined and has come back 
because the Senate has had a chance to examine the bill in 
detail.  It is still a government bill.  The government is 
elected by the people and the government is initiating the bill. 
Whether it is initiated in this place or that place does not 
matter; it is still accountable to the people because it is the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am very strongly opposed to is senators introducing their 
own private members' bills in the Senate and those bills coming 
to this place as private members' legislation.  Senators are not 
answerable to the public.  The difficulty is that they can 
introduce controversial bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember one senator once proposing something about making it 
against the law to spank a child.  All kinds of controversy was 
endured by Liberal members of parliament because it was a Liberal 
senator that introduced this idea.  This is not a proper 
reflection of either the Senate's role or the way this place 
should be working in my view.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill S-17, I think probably the best way to have expedited 
this very important legislation was to have done exactly what the 
government did and that was to introduce it in the Senate first. 
We have a full chance to examine it here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his clarification on his position with regard to the 
introduction of private members' bills in the Senate.  He 
mentioned that there is some measure of accountability lacking in 
the Senate, I agree with him on that.  I wonder if he might be 
able to offer suggestions from his side of the benches with 
regard to ways to improve the accountability in the Senate 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, I take this question very 
seriously because I know the member is very interested in the 
future of the Senate.  The Senate has an enormously important 
role in parliament but it has to be a role that does not collide 
with the role being fulfilled by the elected portion of 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the Senate is very valuable is it has more time, 
particularly on private members' legislation, to examine indepth 
the implications of legislation.  The particular legislation that 
we have before us, Bill S-17, previously Bill C-53, is very 
complicated.  The average member in this House does not have the 
time to give it the examination it deserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the transportation committee is going to have difficulty 
giving it the full examination it deserves.  That is what we can 
use the Senate for and that is the role the Senate should have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Senate must not, this government must not and this 
House of Commons must not allow the Senate to intrude into those 
areas of responsibility that should be exclusively the role of 
the elected representatives.  We are accountable to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I introduced just recently a very controversial private members' 
bill that would make Christmas into a national holiday.  I got 
400 hostile e-mails.  Well, that is correct because I take the 
brunt of the fact that I introduced legislation that certainly 
some members of the public oppose and they can get at me. 
However, they cannot get at a senator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wishes to introduce a bill through the Senate, 
it does not matter to the Senate but the government is still 
accountable.  If a senator introduces his own legislation and 
does not have to answer for it but we do, I think that is wrong.
