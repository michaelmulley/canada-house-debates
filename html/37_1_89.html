	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, I will talk about something that
					 is near and dear to my heart this morning, which is making sure that parliament
					 actually performs the work that it is supposed to do. I refer to the report on
					 “The Business of Supply: Completing the Circle of Control”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report was prepared during the 35th parliament and
					 has had a rather slow gestation period since then. The report was co-authored
					 by myself and the chief government whip, the hon. member for Ottawa
					 West--Nepean. Another major contributor to the report was the Secretary of
					 State for Asia-Pacific, the hon. member for Winnipeg North--St. Paul. The Bloc
					 Quebecois and the NDP also made representations. The Tories were not a party in
					 that 35th parliament so they were not actually at the table. The report enjoyed
					 all party support. It was later tabled at a procedure and house affairs
					 committee and subsequently tabled in the House after receiving the unanimous
					 support of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to comment on a couple of points from the
					 report itself. In the introduction it talks about the need for the
					 report:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The established procedures for
						  handling supply in the House of Commons are based on two fundamental
						  principles. If it is to continue with its activities, Government must have some
						  assurance that its requests for funds be answered by certain fixed dates.
						  </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody is debating that, and the government ensures
					 that it has its money when it wants it and that it has it in bulk.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that parliament, on the other hand,
					 must be assured reasonable opportunity to examine the requests before they are
					 granted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report also talks about the need for parliament to
					 hold government accountable. This ranks among the principal roles that
					 parliament is expected to perform in our democratic system. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leads to the motion to adopt the report. Some 51
					 different recommendations contained in the report would ensure that parliament
					 does exercise its effective control and supervision over the estimates before
					 they are approved and the government gets the money it wants.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, over the last many years, we have
					 allowed parliament's authority to be eroded. We have allowed our authority over
					 the public purse to be transferred to the government, and this Chamber
					 unfortunately becomes little more than a debating Chamber and a rubber stamp on
					 the $170 billion that the government now spends each and every year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote from the auditor general just last week
					 before the public accounts committee. She said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small> I am concerned that Parliament has
						  only limited means of holding the government to account.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current auditor general is very concerned. Her
					 predecessor is also on the record as having said, in his December 2000
					 report:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>It is discouraging to see new
						  incidents of waste and mismanagement crop up hydra-like after older ones have
						  been discovered and dispatched.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>All government spending should have
						  Parliament's sanction. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously it does not at this point in time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The principle that Parliament is the
						  custodian of the public purse has been part of Canada's constitutional
						  landscape since the country's inception.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these issues are being eroded.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1977 the auditor general of that time, Mr. J.J.
					 MacDonell, warned “Parliament is losing control of the public
					 purse”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament should never lose control of the public
					 purse. That is why we are here. The institution of parliament is to ensure that
					 we as parliamentarians, the elected representatives of the people, hold the
					 government to account on how it spends $170 billion each and every
					 year.</p>


	<A NAME="T1110"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1110)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is an awful lot of money and an awful lot of
					 taxes. Canadians deserve to know that someone is watching them and watching
					 them closely to ensure value for money. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyday we hear of situations where money is wasted
					 and spent needlessly. Money is spent even without parliamentary approval. The
					 $1.3 billion heating rebate to Canadians was spent by the government
					 immediately prior to an election. It spent the money without parliament's
					 approval. It came to parliament after the fact and sought our approval once the
					 cheques had been issued. That cannot occur.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members know, I published a waste report that
					 highlighted some stupid and incompetent ways in which the government spends
					 money through grants and contributions. I remember $15,000 being given to
					 someone who was hanging dead animals in trees in Manitoba. How can we tolerate
					 that type of thing? Yet it goes on. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this institution has a responsibility to
					 ensure that if these things are not eliminated that they are at least kept to a
					 minimum.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will provide a short history lesson. Prior to the
					 days of the Magna Carta, the monarch was completely and totally an autocratic
					 dictator. If he wanted to lop someone's head off, the person's head was lopped
					 off. People said that could not be done unless they were consulted first, and
					 from the Magna Carta, which consisted of the aristocracy in Britain and
					 England, said that the people had to be consulted first, developed the House of
					 Commons, which is where we are today, and the Magna Carta stated that
					 government cannot act without the authority of this place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monarch had the privy council, which consisted of
					 his advisors. The monarch got smart one day and decided that if he picked an
					 advisor from within the House of Commons, someone with stature, then perhaps
					 the advice would be listened to by the commoners in the House of Commons. Lo
					 and behold, that evolved and now we have the Prime Minister and the cabinet
					 sitting in the front row. Therefore, the monarch by proxy has crept right back
					 into this place and is controlling the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately the backbenchers on that side of the
					 House think of themselves as being part of government and the members on this
					 side think of themselves as wanting to become government one day. We forget
					 that the role of this institution on both sides is to hold the government
					 accountable. That has been failing for years and is now, in my opinion, in a
					 pretty sad state of affairs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are we talking about in the business of supply?
					 First , as I said, there was $170 billion of spending but, unbeknownst to the
					 vast majority of Canadians, the House of Commons only votes on about $50
					 billion worth of expenditures. The rest, $120 billion, is spent without any
					 reference to this place. People may ask how that can be. It is because of the
					 way we pass legislation. It is usually included in a clause that grants a new
					 program money forever and ever. It never comes back to this place for a vote,
					 for approval, for debate or for discussion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am saying that the statutory spending, where the
					 authority is included in legislation, shall be subject to a program review.
					 Once every five to ten years it should be subject to appropriate evaluation
					 asking four simple questions. First, do we still want this program to continue
					 and, if so, what is the public policy that this program is designed to address
					 in society? If it is not addressing any problem in society one may ask why we
					 even have the program. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let us articulate the public policy the program
					 is designed to address. Once we know that, we can ask the second question. How
					 well is it addressing the problem it is designed to address? If it has
					 shortcomings or failures we fix them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We then ask the third question. Is it doing this
					 efficiently? In this complex and changing world,we also ask the question: Can
					 the same results be achieved in a different or better way? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If those four simple questions were applied to all
					 programs it would save enormous amounts of money because it would ensure
					 accountability, drive up efficiency and drive up focus in ensuring that the
					 programs delivered to Canadians were what Canadians actually wanted. There are
					 $120 billion worth of expenditures and we could literally save
					 billions.</p>


	<A NAME="T1115"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1115)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also talking about tax expenditures. In 1992,
					 for example, the auditor general cited as an estimate that in 1985 tax
					 expenditures amounted to $28 billion annually. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a tax expenditure? A tax expenditure is a
					 deduction on our income tax returns, for example, for those who contribute to
					 an RRSP. It never shows up as revenue to the Government of Canada. It does not
					 show up as an expense on behalf of the Government of Canada. It is just a
					 deduction on the income tax return. Therefore, we feel that we should evaluate
					 the value of these tax expenditures to ensure that they are worthwhile. Are
					 they just freebies given by the government to get more votes? There can be some
					 confusion there. I am concerned only with ensuring that a tax expenditure
					 provides value for money, and through a registered retirement deduction we of
					 course want people to save for their retirement. We want to give people an
					 incentive to save for their retirement. Therefore we give them a tax deduction,
					 but let us analyze it to see that the benefits equal the returns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also talk about loan guarantees. Loan guarantees
					 show up in the public estimates as one single solitary dollar behind which may
					 be a contingent liability for hundreds of millions of dollars. We will never
					 know until the loan or guarantee goes sour and the government comes back to
					 parliament and asks for hundreds of millions of dollars. By then it is too
					 late. The ship has sunk and the money is gone. We need to evaluate these loan
					 guarantees at the time they are being given to see if they are prudent and wise
					 and are part of enhancing this country's prosperity. If so, no problem, but we
					 need to have the right in the House to examine loan guarantees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also talk about net versus gross expenditure. Now
					 that the government is into a significant amount of cost recovery and it only
					 shows the net, parliament needs to have the whole story presented to it where
					 we can see the gross expenditures, net recovery and how much the government is
					 paying. Again, the auditor general stated in his October 2000 report, at page
					 17-15, that the result of net versus gross expenditure is misleading financial
					 disclosure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have crown corporations, again something that
					 is never subject to scrutiny by this place. In 1999-2000 crown corporations
					 cost us almost $4 billion, yet that is never debated in this place. Many of
					 these crown corporations are not even required to report to this place. I think
					 it is time that crown corporations are subject to the scrutiny of parliament
					 like everything else.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to non-statutory spending, which we in the
					 House somewhat review although that could certainly be improved, we are talking
					 about statutory spending, crown corporations, tax expenditures and loan
					 guarantees. Those are five areas that the House needs to be involved with and
					 to scrutinize and check before granting approval and before the granting of
					 supply for the government. We are not saying to cut it off. We are just saying
					 to let us ask the appropriate questions of accountability, and if we are
					 satisfied that the spending is legitimate and will benefit Canadians, then I am
					 quite sure the House would not deny it. However, at this point in time the
					 review is either perfunctory or non-existent. That has to change. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the motion calls for the adoption of a new
					 committee called the estimates committee, which would mirror the public
					 accounts committee. The public accounts committee is a retrospective
					 examination of problems, mismanagement and so on. We want an estimates
					 committee that would look forward in analyzing and helping other committees do
					 their job, to build the expertise and the knowledge, to hold the government
					 accountable by asking the appropriate questions, by bringing in the appropriate
					 deputy ministers and ministers and asking where they will be spending the money
					 and whether it is appropriate.</p>


	<A NAME="T1120"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1120"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1120)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This could be done by developing the issue of program
					 evaluation. The president of the treasury board took a small step down that
					 road when she introduced a new audit and evaluation policy last year. I would
					 encourage her to think about moving that agenda even further and faster because
					 it would ensure that Canadians get value for their money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could speak at length, but the notion we have to
					 bring back to parliament is that the authority it has allowed to slip away must
					 be recognized and it must be returned. How else will we ensure that Canadians
					 right across the land get value for their money? The notion of accountability
					 is fundamental to efficiency, honesty, integrity and everything else that is
					 good in the world. When people are not accountable they run off the rails.
					 Anything can happen. We see dictators around the world who have no
					 accountability. They have slaughter, bankruptcy, fraud and corruption; they
					 have everything.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What prevents these things from happening is having a
					 government that is accountable, that has to live by the rule of law and not by
					 whim. It is then that we get good government, and I want good government for
					 Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started by saying that the co-authors of the report
					 were the chief government whip, the secretary of state and other members of the
					 House and myself. I was not chairman of the public accounts committee at that
					 time but I have been for the last few years. The report then came through the
					 procedure and House affairs committee where it enjoyed all party support. There
					 was unanimous support, Mr. Speaker. Therefore I would ask, because I am sure
					 you will find it, that you seek unanimous consent to approve the
					 motion.</p>

					 (Lotbinière-L'Érable, BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to speak to the motion
					 by my colleague for St. Albert, the present chair of the Standing Committee on
					 Public Accounts, of which I have been a member for the past year, within the
					 second mandate entrusted to me by the people of Lotbinière-L'Érable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had numerous opportunities to comment on auditor
					 general reports, in particular those by Mr. Denis Desautels, who left that
					 position last spring.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On many occasions, Mr. Desautels criticized the
					 behaviour of the present government, and in particular the accounting system
					 used by the Minister of Finance, who has often been faulted for his lack of
					 accuracy in his budget statements to this very House of Commons since his
					 appointment in the fall of 1993. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last March, in his document “Reflections on a Decade of
					 Serving Parliament”, Mr. Desautels described his experiences as auditor
					 general, concluding that the power of elected representatives over budget
					 choices and budget monitoring had decreased considerably. He voiced serious
					 reservations concerning the creation of various crown corporations or agencies
					 to replace existing departments. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indirectly, the creation of these new government
					 organizations prevented him from doing his job properly, given the
					 administrative restrictions included in the statutes and regulations of those
					 organizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw to your attention the following
					 comments by Mr. Desautels, first of all on the accountability of crown
					 corporations:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>I encourage Parliament to be more
						  active in calling Crown corporations to account for their performance, their
						  effectiveness in fulfilling their mandates, and the ongoing relevance of their
						  mandates</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the matter of control and
					 accountability, he continues by saying:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>As government moves more and more to
						  delivery of services by arm's-length entities, it is essential that it do so
						  with provisions for sound control and accountability. I urge it to draw on the
						  successful accountability and control framework for Crown corporations and
						  similarly establish new alternative service delivery and governance
						  arrangements—many of which are now operating without an adequate regime of
						  accountability and control. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Desautels' concern about the creation of crown
					 corporations or agencies in place of departments is clearly reflected in the
					 following comment:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Further, when the federal government
						  reorganizes, it can create other problems. In 1997 the government established

						  over 4,500 employees to the new Agency and expenditures of about $330 million a

						  corporate plan that included objectives, performance expectations and an annual
						  report on its actual achievements. After three years, the Agency still is not
						  providing a clear and complete picture of its performance to allow Parliament
						  and others to judge how well it has carried out its role. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the new Canada Customs and Revenue Agency,
					 Mr. Desautels expected more concrete results, this time:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">

						  audits to be expeditious. While the structure set up to manage the new Agency
						  appears sound, its first performance report is not due until later this year.
						  </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This report has yet to be published.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former auditor general also commented that the
					 government must ensure good management of its operations and support its
					 ministers in this regard. Once again, I quote Mr. Desautels:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The federal government does not have
						  a head office like those of corporations; our system of government makes
						  Cabinet ministers individually accountable for many of the government's
						  activities and collectively responsible for many important decisions.
						  Nevertheless, to be efficient the government must co-ordinate the management of
						  its operations and help departments improve their management
						  practices.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Desautels spoke as well of his concern about the
					 transparency of crown corporations and their finances. I conclude with the
					 final remarks of the auditor general. On the need for transparency, he
					 said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Special examinations, agency
						  performance reports, and the annual financial report by the Minister of Finance
						  could all be used better to open up the operations of government to Canadians.

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took the time to cite the main themes of the report
					 marking the departure of Mr. Desautels, because the motion being debated today
					 relates to the comments made by the former auditor general. In the context of
					 this motion, we are also addressing the report entitled “Completing the Circle
					 of Control”, a report tabled by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House
					 Affairs, which proposes a solution for consolidating follow-up of the estimates
					 by each of the standing committees of the House of Commons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its introduction, the report alleges that, according
					 to a number of witnesses, departments and officials often consider appearances
					 before the a committee to discuss spending to be a real trial. Sometimes
					 members seem unaware of the efforts made by the departments to provide their
					 services, despite cuts, or of the difficulty of the decisions to be made when
					 plans and priorities are being set.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oftentimes, in committees, witnesses and experts debate
					 broad policy thrusts, passing quickly over the whole matter of estimates
					 follow-up. The report is clear in this regard in pointing out that, since 1968,
					 the standing committees of the House have examined the estimates. This is the
					 most efficient way to put government requests for funds under the detailed
					 scrutiny required. However, it has been clearly established that, in recent
					 years, the standing committees have devoted little effort to this aspect of
					 their work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us come back now to the recommendations in the
					 report by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. The committee
					 given the task of analyzing this situation undertook the task with three
					 objectives, namely to increase individual member participation in the working
					 involved in budget forecasts and supply, to increase the House's ability to
					 demand an accounting from the government and to better examine the government's
					 estimates.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, with the way things are organized at the moment,
					 the estimates of each department and agency are sent automatically to the
					 standing committee involved. Although it is very logical, this approach, as
					 indicated in the document under debate today, has had very disappointing
					 results. Therefore, a new committee must be set up with very specific
					 objectives and terms of reference, as indicated in the document we are
					 considering today, to be called the standing committee on the
					 estimates.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new committee would have the mandate to examine
					 the estimates and supply review process and to report to the House on at least
					 an annual basis on the operation and improvement of the process; to provide,
					 upon request, advice and support to standing committees engaged in the review
					 of the estimates; to review certain estimates and proposed expenditures on a
					 program basis when more than one department or agency in responsible for
					 delivery, with the agreement and support of the appropriate standing
					 committees; to review the mechanisms used by crown corporations to report to
					 parliament and to its committees on their annual projected expenditures; to
					 coordinate its activities with those of the Standing Committee on Finance and
					 the Standing Committee on Public Accounts to avoid overlap and duplication; and
					 to sit jointly with these committees to discuss common issues. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will elaborate on several of these recommendations.
					 Since time is limited, I will give another example of the importance of this
					 committee. This standing committee on the estimates would make recommendations
					 so that a maximum of 5% of the amount of the credits for each of the estimates
					 could be reallocated. If the government rejects these recommendations, it
					 should justify its attitude right here in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this report and its conclusion to establish
					 a standing committee on the estimates would be a step forward to improve
					 democracy in this parliament. This is why my party supports this
					 motion.</p>

					 (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to add
					 to this debate, I hope in all humility, on the motion brought forward by the
					 hon. member for St. Albert. I commend him for bringing the motion forward. I
					 have the utmost support for what he is attempting to do. He has been a long
					 advocate for greater fiscal responsibility in the House and in the country. The
					 fiscal thistle that he is, as Chair of the Standing Committee on Public
					 Accounts, reflects his natural proclivity in this area. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have an initial problem with debating the motion to
					 concur in a report that was first presented to the House of Commons in the 35th
					 parliament. We are now in the 37th parliament. The original motion that was
					 brought forward was transported back to the agenda of the 36th parliament which
					 refused to deal with it. That is hardly what the new Minister of Justice so
					 often refers to as “in timely fashion”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few members now in the House were members of that
					 original committee that wrote the report. Fewer still had an opportunity to
					 hear evidence and, dare I say, even fewer have taken the trouble to seek out
					 the report and read the evidence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These objections could have been overcome if this
					 motion would cause the government and the House to exert greater control over
					 the scrutiny of spending. Sadly, this is not the case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The search for better ways to examine the estimates and
					 the scrutiny of public spending, as well as the performance of the bureaucracy,
					 is hardly new. Regrettably, over the past four decades the House has not
					 properly discharged its fundamental constitutional duty to properly examine
					 government spending plans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is worse, we have willingly surrendered the
					 procedural and constitutional tools needed by the House to examine the rightful
					 influence over ministers and departments and government. In return for the
					 supine attitude of members of parliament gaining predictable summer
					 adjournments and the government getting unfettered access to the dollars and
					 borrowed dollars of Canadians, the blunt reality is that members of the House
					 of Commons are not willing to do the hard and complex work of leading
					 estimates, becoming familiar with the overall activities of departments and
					 then taking the time to demand answers to their questions or solutions to their
					 grievances. The government caucus as well is only too willing to shut down any
					 examination that makes it uncomfortable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the sad record of the government and the House,
					 for we are all responsible for this shame. Departmental estimates of the
					 multi-billion dollar annual expenditures routinely get less than 90 minutes of
					 soft speeches in committees before the Liberals close the proceedings. Some
					 departments do not even get that. Members of the House all know that the rules
					 and the calendar will automatically approve the estimates.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government thinks it is being accountable by making
					 the minister available for a single meeting for an hour. We all accept this,
					 tugging at our forelocks, pleased as punch to be in such august company for an
					 hour. Yet we have the power to demand their attendance and to demand that they
					 answer questions in full. We have the power to do the tough work that needs to
					 be done. However, we act like mendicants, waiting for a crumb to fall from the
					 cabinet table.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more tragic is the Liberal backbenchers
					 have been so pummelled and cowed into submission by the cabinet and the whip,
					 they fail to realize that the estimates process is the only time when they can
					 get ministers on the public record to sort out the problems of their
					 constituents and to demonstrate to the Prime Minister that they know as much or
					 more in the department as does the minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some members who are the exception to that
					 and I commend them. They are few and their efforts are far between. I will be
					 the first to admit that there are some members on the backbench that know a
					 heck of a lot more about how the public should have its money spent responsibly
					 than some of the ministers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that year in and year out the annual
					 expenditures of the Government of Canada, this year in excess of $165 billion,
					 receive less attention than that afforded to the smallest town council in any
					 of our constituencies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were reminded earlier this year by the Speaker's
					 ruling that this government passed this year's main estimates in a way that is
					 inconsistent with the standing orders of the House. The government trampled on
					 the rights of all members of the House, and the majority of the members on the
					 government side think that this is just fine. They wanted their vacations, they
					 voted themselves a pay increase and moved on. That is not good
					 enough.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not acting as prudent stewards of the public
					 purse. This has been the case throughout the explosive inflationary spending
					 history that has been created and the obscene debt load that is now borne by
					 the country.</p>


	<A NAME="T1135"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1135"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1140"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1135)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance
					 during the Trudeau era liked to denigrate the Mulroney administration's
					 financial record, but let us be intellectually honest.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Conservatives came to power in 1984, they
					 inherited a $38 billion deficit and skyrocketing debt. Moreover, the
					 Conservatives then went about putting in place a fiscal plan during extremely
					 difficult economic times that resulted, in the very least, in efforts to
					 control and bring down the deficit and that happened. The much hated GST tax
					 was to be cancelled when this government came into office but the government
					 has continued to pour money into the public purse which has allowed us to
					 create these surpluses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arguably, we do not hear the Minister of Finance and
					 Prime Minister crowing about the surplus with great aplomb now that they
					 realize there is a deficit in things like our military, in our internal
					 security and in many of our social programs. The surplus does not seem quite as
					 rosy as it did a short six months ago. Yet, this all came at a huge cost to the
					 Conservatives of the day who were willing to spend political capital as a way
					 to accomplish greater fiscal responsibility in government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finance minister of the day, whose political
					 biological clock is ticking quite loudly, has again been very silent when it
					 comes to how that surplus should be handled today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a deeper and even more dangerous consequence
					 to surrendering the purse strings. The House of Commons has castrated its
					 ability to demand answers from the government of the day. We cannot hold up
					 spending, so we cannot demand and get answers to tough questions. Since we no
					 longer hold ministers to public account, it is easier for the Prime Minister
					 and those in his immediate circle, the PMO and the PCO dictatorship, to seize
					 the reins of government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benevolent dictators are still dictators. We need a new
					 Magna Carta. Until the House takes back the power of the purse, there will be
					 no checks and balances on the new King Johns of the 21st century or peut-être
					 roi Jean. All of us should be alarmed by the accretion of power in the office
					 of the presidential prime minister. Congress counterbalances American
					 presidents. There is no counterweight to the presidential prime minister when
					 the House has predetermined that he shall have unlimited access to the
					 treasury. Our principal instrument of parliamentary power, the right to deny
					 supply and thereby to set into train the dismissal of the administration, is
					 now in ruins so long as the House neglects the business of supply. It is for
					 this reason that I am unable to support this motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 1994 the committee looked at the business of
					 supply. In typical Liberal fashion, it concluded that something needed to be
					 done and it wrapped itself in the language of fiscal responsibility and then
					 did what this government has done so many times. It did a U-turn. It did an
					 Olympian-style back flip.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of looking for ways to save dollars or restrain
					 spending, the government invented a new way to spend money. In recommendation
					 14 it states that committees of the House should be able to reallocate
					 approximately 5% of monies within an estimate. That sounds innocuous does it
					 not? In principle, it violates the doctrine of the ministerial responsibility
					 and the spending initiative of the crown. Parliament does not govern. We have
					 the right to probe and discomfort those who do, but when we attempt to run the
					 government, we undermine the foundations of our authority and force the removal
					 of a minister or a government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot hold a government responsible for decisions
					 when we attempt to join them in making basic governmental decisions. Ministers
					 and governments are responsible to the House. If they are not acting in accord
					 with the wishes of the majority of the House, the House can force their
					 removal. They ought not to be able to take the 5% buy-off route proposed by
					 this report.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers should not be kept in office under a system
					 of putting in the fix in the House of Commons. Under this system, a
					 recalcitrant minister could remain in office and the House would re-jig an
					 estimate to meet the wishes of the House. The dynamic tension at the root of
					 the power of the purse is compromised by this proposal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would be the real effect? Members of parliament
					 are by nature spenders. This recommendation would claim for private members a
					 new privilege, what the American politician, John Randolf called “That most
					 delicious of all privileges; spending other people's money”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calvin Coolidge is reported as having observed “Nothing
					 is easier than spending the public money. It does not appear to belong to
					 anyone and the temptation is overwhelming to bestow it on somebody”.
					 </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I urge the House to put parliament first
					 and to get serious about real scrutiny of estimates. That means taking away
					 artificial deadlines and making ministers appear in committees of the House. It
					 means unpleasant confrontations and it means we will need to be
					 parliamentarians rather than social workers.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to the private
					 member's business put forth by my colleague from St. Albert with regard to
					 adopting the report on the business of supply. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reminded of people who get up nowadays to watch
					 the 10 o'clock news. If we watch the news at fixed times, events unfold. We
					 have a thing called real time and everyone knows that if we want real time news
					 we go to CNN. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world today events unfold and there is
					 technology and knowledge, yet the House and a lot of politicians fudge things.
					 They make the way we address spending and the way we do business very
					 political. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will make a small point with regard to the ability of
					 all citizens to monitor the government quickly and reliably. The government
					 should have a transparent way of talking to people. To get the people's
					 approval it should show them charts and explain the realities of what it is
					 trying to do. That is done, as the member for St. Albert should know, by
					 putting everything on the Internet where everyone can see it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous speaker had some good ideas. He said the
					 minister should appear before committee. There is nothing wrong with doing that
					 at any time. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for St. Albert and his committee did some
					 great work. The government was not sitting on its hands. It responded a number
					 of times. In 1994 it tabled plans and priorities in the House. In 1996 the
					 treasury board came up with performance objectives, which helped a bit. In 1997
					 House leaders got together and formed the modernization committee. Its work is
					 ongoing and its recommendations are being worked on. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for St. Albert mentioned that the president
					 of the treasury board in the year 2000 had a policies and evaluation report and
					 a better method of accounting to parliament. Part of the recommendation is that
					 we have some fundamental principles in the House. Through the act of 1867 the
					 member is asking that the confidence convention on supply be reduced.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the implications of this request? It is
					 probably a matter of debate. I do not have a lot of time today to discuss the
					 pros and cons. However the current system functions well once we apply the
					 initial reason the gentlemen quite rightfully put that in the act of 1867. It
					 probably would have required a constitutional amendment and constitutional
					 amendments are problematic, to say the least.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are asking that they be empowered to increase or
					 reallocate funds. We were elected as a government to do exactly that. We were
					 elected to make sure we table the estimates, and we have done so. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people elected our government based on a platform.
					 In the platform are clearly stated priorities and objectives we want to
					 accomplish. We were elected on that and we are accountable to that. We are not
					 only accountable to the electorate but at the grassroots we have fireside chats
					 with Canadians on a regular basis. The policies are fed back to the ministers
					 who must account to the grassroots for how the policies are
					 followed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of the modernization committee have
					 overtaken the recommendation. The member for Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough
					 alluded to it. He said this was in the parliament of 1993, and we are now into
					 2001. We have a whole lot of new players in the House and we understand how
					 these things are done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was parliamentary secretary to the president of the
					 treasury board. I was there when the program was reviewed. I know all those
					 lines and am one of the few who knows exactly where the money should be spent.
					 I have gone to the Senate for the estimates so I understand something about the
					 dynamics of spending. </p>

					 initiative because it would take us backward in time. There are recommendations
					 in it that are quite well documented. As the member for St. Albert said, many
					 members have contributed to it. In one way or another we have tried to adapt
					 and modernize it. Things done at the Treasury Board in the spring are tabled
					 here in the fall so that parliament can be shown a results based analysis of
					 what is happening on the files. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are opportunities in the House for members to ask
					 questions. However in a lot of ways these things are complex and require the
					 auditor general to probe into them. I wonder if hon. members recall when the
					 auditor general talked about military overspending. It was a boondoggle,
					 according to my friend opposite. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A missile that cost quite a lot of money may be fired
					 and not quite deploy itself. Should the military keep such a piece of equipment
					 in its arsenal, attribute a number to it and never fire it, then get into a
					 confrontation where it is fired and does not work? Is that a better scenario,
					 where a lot of military people would probably be killed because a weapon does
					 not fire?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the opposition calls things boondoggles which
					 are not boondoggles. Certain issues catch the eye of the electorate and the
					 opposition talks a lot about them. However people make mistakes. We are not
					 perfect. We always need oversight in what we do. We need to make sure we are
					 accountable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I am concerned accountability rests with all
					 of us. We must make sure we work with our colleagues on committees, that
					 bureaucrats and ministers of the crown come to committees to talk about their
					 plans, and that these things are posted on the Internet. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need total transparency. Our methods of obtaining
					 contracts, who we hire and all these things should be totally transparent. We
					 should use all our scrutiny, oversight, accountability and efficiency to make
					 the country better. We must stop getting into political games over how the
					 government operates and spends money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot support the motion. As I have said before, it
					 is not in keeping with the current situation. Current events have overcome the
					 initial intent of the motion and it has lost its way somewhere in the
					 system.</p>

					 and Highland Valleys, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that I am new to the House
					 and have had a lot of learning to do. Perhaps it is a benefit in this case
					 because I do not consider anything the House has done to date as sacred and not
					 able to be changed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initiative makes perfect sense to me. We are asking
					 for transparency and accountability. I believe that is what the people of
					 Canada want. Four billion dollars which is not accounted for goes to crown
					 corporations in Canada. That makes absolutely no sense to me or to any other
					 Canadian. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My background is in business. I have always had to be
					 accountable. I have tried my best during the years to make sure I was fair.
					 That is what Canada needs as well. It needs us to be fair to the Canadian
					 people. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government does not generate income. That is no secret.
					 The income the government spends comes out of taxpayer dollars. It comes out of
					 my pocket, the pockets of members and the pockets of every Canadian. Things
					 must change, and this initiative would be a good way to start. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the good sense to marry an accountant, so I have
					 not needed to do a lot of the book work that goes along with day to day things.
					 However when it came to the office of MP that all had to change. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the most interesting experience for me so far
					 was attending an estimates meeting. I did not realize there was such a limited
					 amount of time and so few opportunities to ask questions. I found it difficult
					 to comprehend all the intricacies of the budget because I was not able to ask
					 questions. The initiative would go a long way toward clearing up these
					 things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone in my caucus will tell the House I do not follow
					 the party line on issues I feel strongly about, so this is not about party
					 politics or being partisan. It is about common sense. It makes perfect sense to
					 me and to every Canadian that we should think about the way we spend Canadian
					 tax dollars. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not doing that. We are spending $120 billion
					 without any voice in the House. As members we represent people from across
					 Canada. We have all been elected whether we sit on the opposition side of the
					 House or the government side. We all have an obligation to make certain that
					 money is spent properly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found it encouraging that both the House whip for the
					 government and the Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific supported the initiative
					 at the committee level. That is encouraging because it tells me this is not
					 about partisan politics. It is about common sense and a better way to do
					 things. We need to see the big picture in terms of where we are going, but we
					 also need to be careful about how we proceed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard references today to the Internet. The
					 Internet is a wonderful new tool that is available to some Canadians, though
					 not all. The difficulty with the Internet is that while we are able to read
					 information presented on it we do not have an explanation of it or an
					 opportunity to ask questions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about money here. We have come into a
					 time when the world has turned itself upside down. We have many difficult
					 problems to face. There are security risks we must take care of. There is a
					 potential for a decline in revenue due to what is happening. I cannot think of
					 a better time to take a strong and sober look at the way we do business in the
					 House. This is important to us and we must do it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We review every five years. There will be people in the
					 House who will say the five year review is covered by elections. That is not
					 quite the case. The Canadian people who fund the House can choose the person
					 who comes here to represent them, but they do not have an opportunity or a
					 voice to say how the money is spent. I do not see anything wrong with being
					 accountable and transparent in our actions, especially when we are using money
					 that comes from the pockets of Canadian taxpayers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, nothing that goes on in the House is
					 sacrosanct. We need to look at any way we can that might improve the way the
					 House does business.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most disappointing part for me as a new member of
					 parliament is that if a good idea comes in front of the House, party politics
					 quash it. When I summed it up to my children when I was talking to them about
					 my new role, I said that when I hear a good idea I do not care where it comes
					 from. If it makes sense I will support it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the attitude in the House can be summed up
					 very easily: my dad is bigger than your dad. That is not what this is about.
					 This is about looking after every person in Canada. It is not partisan party
					 politics. It has to be common sense. Any time we have an opportunity as
					 politicians to endorse accountability or transparency why would we not do
					 so?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reputation of politics in Canada has been
					 tarnished. People have very little faith in their political representatives
					 whether at the municipal, provincial or federal level. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? It is because we spend people's money without
					 consulting them. We need to have an opportunity to take a good hard look at
					 every dime we spend, stop thinking of it as found money and think of it as hard
					 earned dollars. People are going without something in order to pay for that. If
					 they are going to go without something in their own families where they work to
					 earn their money and we have control over how it is spent, we had better spend
					 it very carefully.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will support the motion, not because it comes from my
					 colleague the hon. member for St. Albert, but because it makes sense. I hope
					 the House takes a different view of what is in front of it today and realizes
					 that there was unanimous consent for it to go forward. It gives us an
					 opportunity to ask those necessary questions and to make informed
					 decisions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope members of the House will join me today in
					 supporting the motion. It may not be perfect, as my other colleague mentioned,
					 but it is a pretty good first step and it is better than where we are
					 today.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-53348"></A><a HREF="#Int-53349"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-53346"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Alan Tonks (York South—Weston,
					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chance to speak to the
					 motion which calls upon the government to accept the recommendations contained
					 in the House procedures committee report dealing with a review of the
					 estimates. It is particularly gratifying since the review of the estimates is a
					 key function of parliament. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as members know, finding an effective way of
					 doing this often has proven to be a thorny issue for parliamentarians. It
					 involves two vital principles that are difficult to reconcile, namely the need
					 for government to have its request for funds dealt with by specific dates, thus
					 allowing for the efficient administrative operation of the state, and the need
					 for members to examine these requests in sufficient detail to ensure that
					 taxpayer money is being spent wisely. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As parliamentarians our goal must be to balance these
					 interests and to provide for adequate efficiency and oversight. The
					 recommendations contained in the report are but one example of proposals tabled
					 in the House aimed at resolving this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I acknowledge the work of members of the House who have
					 examined the issue. However simply rubber stamping all the recommendations as
					 the motion suggests does not recognize the complexity and importance of the
					 review process. It requires that we take a thoughtful approach to the
					 issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to approach with some caution the report
					 recommendation which calls for the establishment of an estimates committee
					 charged with reviewing all estimates, particularly since existing committees
					 have already been doing this work. According to the report such a system would
					 allow for better review. Members would be able to devote themselves more fully
					 to important functions and they would acquire a greater understanding of the
					 supply process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is a very appealing prospect, we know the
					 devil is often in the details. It is not clear how this would be achieved. One
					 way might be to ask some members to serve on more than one committee. However
					 such an approach clearly has its problems. It would mean asking members who
					 already are stretched to the limit participating in debates, attending caucus
					 meetings, serving on committees and taking care of constituent needs to take on
					 yet another responsibility.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another idea might be to assign fewer members to
					 existing standing committees in order to find the members needed. This also has
					 its problems. It would mean depriving existing committees of the people needed
					 to properly conduct their work. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many times have we heard that we should be
					 strengthening our committee structure? Having one committee consider estimates
					 instead of letting all members review them could result in our losing the input
					 and insights of parliamentarians who have indepth knowledge of individual
					 departments. Such a situation would damage our ability to fulfill our
					 responsibilities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to assess a department's spending
					 estimates without first having a good idea of its performance, goals,
					 priorities and knowledge which a number of members have acquired as a result of
					 many years of experience. We need to recognize that a number of other benefits
					 flow from the current system under which estimates are reviewed by the House
					 and by committees charged with specific policy areas. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, it would encourage members to see the
					 bigger picture. The current situation allows members to be able to connect the
					 individual questions of budget with the overall policy issues
					 involved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there is much good in our current estimate
					 approach all of us agree there is room for improvement. That is why the House
					 modernization committee made a number of recommendations aimed at increasing
					 the role of the House and reviewing government spending plans. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among them was a proposal that the House consider two
					 sets of estimates each year. This would allow all members to continue to review
					 estimates, provide a high profile televised reminder of the role that members
					 have in granting funds to the government, and we all know how much we like
					 that, and permit the House to benefit from the input of members with indepth
					 knowledge of specific policy areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adoption of this recommendation in the House would
					 go a long way to improving how parliamentarians deal with the business of
					 supply. Rather than pushing willy-nilly into improving these proposals we
					 should allow ourselves to benefit from the new estimates review process which
					 we have adopted. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only then would we be able to do the best possible job
					 of evaluating if further changes were warranted. If providing efficient
					 government while at the same time ensuring proper accountability and saving
					 taxpayer money is our goal, we have already gone a long way toward improving
					 that process.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not be supporting the motion. Nevertheless I

					 issues, especially at the committee level. It is only by working together that
					 we can find the right balance between promoting efficient government with
					 efficient government procedures and holding departments accountable for the

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed from September 28 consideration of the
			 motion that Bill C-32, an act to implement the
			 Free Trade Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the
			 Republic of Costa Rica, be read the second time and referred to a
			 committee.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-53354"></A><a HREF="#Int-53358"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-53349"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. James Lunney (Nanaimo—Alberni,
					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the bill that we are to discuss at this
					 time is Bill C-32, free trade between Canada and Costa Rica, a bill that
					 involves a large number of areas of interest. It would provide improvements in
					 market access for over 90% of Canada's dutiable agrifood exports to Costa Rica
					 and would provide overall for immediate elimination of tariffs on 194 of Costa
					 Rica's 653 dutiable agrifood product categories.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An extensive list of products would be involved. Export
					 interests in Canada involve agricultural interests such as chickpeas, canary
					 seed, barley flour, canola seed, maple syrup, wine and whiskey in the immediate
					 tariff elimination category. There is interest in the frozen french fry market
					 and certain dried beans and dried peas in the seven year phase out category.
					 Third, it would involve flour, canola oil, margarine, honey, breakfast cereals
					 and certain dried beans and so on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill certainly would offer some opportunities for
					 Canada but one of our concerns is that there is a very significant trade
					 imbalance between Canada and Costa Rica. Currently Canada imports about $186
					 million worth of products from Costa Rica compared to only about $86 million
					 worth that Costa Rica receives from Canada. That is about a $100 million trade
					 imbalance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognize that free trade will be a give and take
					 scenario. It always is. However the concerns from our standpoint have to do
					 with the sugar industry in particular and the effect this would have on sugar
					 in Canada. Canada currently has one of the most accessible sugar markets in the
					 world. On refined sugar, we have about 8% duty. The Canadian Alliance promotes
					 free trade and joint elimination of tariffs with our trading partners, but in
					 this respect the bill would impact unfairly on Canada's sugar industry,
					 particularly if it becomes a benchmark for other free trade of the Americas
					 negotiations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have one of the most open sugar markets in the
					 world, with an open tariff on raw sugar at zero and a refined sugar tariff at
					 only about 8%. Canada produces almost enough refined sugar for its domestic
					 needs and does so efficiently, as witnessed by our low tariff on refined sugar.
					 U.S. and Latin American tariffs on sugar range from 50% to 160%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian domestic sugar industry employs about
					 2,000 Canadians. It is directly responsible for full time employment for about
					 1,500 Canadians in refining operations as well as 500 beet growers and numerous
					 seasonal workers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have already been extensive changes in the sugar
					 industry. In the last number of years in Canada, the total sugar beet acreage,
					 for instance, dropped from 56,000 acres in 1996 to about 33,000 acres in 1997
					 and tonnage dropped from about one million tonnes to about 650,000 tonnes.
					 These raw beets are harvested and stored in fields. They are trucked to the
					 factory where they are stockpiled outdoors. They are evaluated for their
					 content, cleaned, sliced and pulped. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industry has undergone extensive downsizing and
					 reorganizing. The Canadian cane sugar refining and sugar beet processing
					 industries experienced significant corporation consolidation and plant
					 rationalization in the last 20 years. For instance, in 1981 there were five
					 companies operating seven plants across Canada, including two beet processors.
					 Today the industry has evolved into two corporate entities that operate five
					 plants. Of these, only one processes beets. Cane plants are located in
					 Vancouver, Toronto, Saint John and Montreal, port cities largely, for
					 convenience of receiving the raw materials.</p>


	<A NAME="T1210"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1210"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1205"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1210)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one single beet plant, located in Taber,
					 Alberta. Rationalization included the closure of the Winnipeg sugar beet
					 processing plant in 1996 and it appears that the Saint John cane refinery may
					 be shutting down.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when I was growing up in Manitoba that
					 Manitoba sugar beet growing and sugar processing was one of the industries we
					 were aware of in our own community, but the industry has already seen quite a
					 significant downturn. Our concern with this bill is that we are seeing a
					 dropping of Canadian tariffs much more quickly than our neighbouring countries
					 are. There have to be some lessons for us in what has happened in our
					 agricultural sector where Canadian farms saw subsidies withdrawn much more
					 quickly than American farms did. Other competing countries such as those in the
					 EU have left our farm communities high and dry and in many cases struggling for
					 existence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our concern is that if this bill as it stands were to
					 become a template for other countries, particularly the other sugar producing
					 countries in Central America, it could become a problem. We understand that
					 currently Costa Rica does not refine sugar and that raw sugar imports are not a
					 problem, but if it should get into sugar refining or if this should become a
					 template for other countries it could become a real problem in sugar
					 imports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to winners and losers we are concerned for
					 jobs in the agricultural communities. If these tariffs are eliminated as
					 quickly as it appears they would be, the jobs of 2,000 workers and spinoff jobs
					 for thousands of others in the agricultural community could be affected. Of
					 course there is an asset there and there would be a plus for sugar users,
					 largely our big consumers in the cookie, bakery and jam industries, and those
					 who use large quantities such as the soft drink and beverage
					 producers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However we are concerned about win-win solutions. If we
					 pull down these subsidies or our own tariffs more quickly than other countries
					 do, then we will sabotage our own producers. We have seen a lot of problems
					 coming in where the winners are on one side of the country and the losers are
					 on the other. Frankly what has come to be known as western alienation is a
					 concern to us in this party because we believe in a unified Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is big country with a lot of interests
					 represented. I suppose it is like a big family with 13 children, the 10
					 provinces and 3 territories. However so often we see favoritism in regard to
					 just some of the members of this family. I remember when I was growing up in
					 Winnipeg that we saw it occur with the Air Canada overhaul base. It was hauled
					 out of Winnipeg and went to Montreal, along with hundreds of high tech jobs. I
					 remember the impact that had on the city when I was only a teenager.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were others. I remember the instance of Bristol
					 Aerospace Ltd. when Canada's aerospace industry was getting going. Bristol put
					 in a very competitive bid, but it all went to the east, to Montreal. Later,
					 when the Canadarm bid came up, Bristol Aerospace had a very good opportunity
					 but again was turned down in favour of concentrating the aerospace industry in
					 one centre in the east. A little later, just a few years ago, the CF-18
					 maintenance contract was slated for Winnipeg but got pulled out and sent to the
					 east.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one side of the family gets favoured repeatedly I do
					 not know how we can expect to keep harmony in the family or keep it functional.
					 Right now in my riding in the softwood lumber industry we have hundreds of
					 workers out and idle because of the current crisis. When people in my riding
					 see what is going on with Bombardier, such as the Canadian government providing
					 big subsidies to Bombardier to produce regional aircraft and giving low
					 interest loans even to American firms to allow Bombardier to supply them with
					 aircraft, they wonder why it is the federal government cannot come up with
					 funds to help out with the bonding issue to keep our mill workers employed, who
					 are idle at present. We see the same thing occurring with farm prices because
					 of drought. Farmers are in need right now and looking for help. They look to
					 the government for some leadership in this area. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our party is in favour of free trade, we are
					 concerned about tariffs coming down in a manner that exposes our own industry
					 to harm because they are brought down in an unreasonable, quick manner. We are

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to
					 take part in this debate on Bill-32, an act to implement the free trade
					 agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic
					 of Costa Rica.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's debate will be an opportunity to continue the
					 debate first begun this spring and last winter concerning the kind of free
					 trade agreement we want to have, bearing in mind that we are engaged in
					 negotiations for a free trade area of the Americas scheduled to end in 2005.
					 This agreement must be viewed in the light of this negotiation
					 process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, we cannot disagree in principle with a free
					 trade agreement with Costa Rica. In this case, opening up markets gives all the
					 countries, Canada, Quebec and Costa Rica, an opportunity to improve trade and
					 increase wealth. Since Costa Rica is a developing country, a southern country,
					 and has a right to the development of trade with a rich nation such as Canada,
					 it can only benefit. We think that it is in the interest of all trade partners
					 for the ground rules from a trade point of view to be known and
					 respected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interesting thing about the case of Costa Rica is
					 that this very small country managed to use the rules of the World Trade
					 Organization to make the American giant see reason when it did not want to let
					 Costa Rican textiles in. Costa Rica filed a complaint. A WTO panel ruled in its
					 favour. The United States agreed to open its market to Costa Rican textiles,
					 not because it was Costa Rica that was asking but because it was the
					 WTO.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trading nations throughout the world therefore have an
					 interest in principle in seeing that the rules are as clear as possible. It is
					 because we agree in principle that we are going to vote in favour of Bill C-32
					 at second reading.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That having been said, our final position is far from
					 certain, because we have very serious reservations, particularly with respect
					 to the issue of investment and the anticipated effects of this agreement on the
					 refined sugar industry in Quebec and in Canada. The preceding speaker mentioned
					 this, and I will be coming back to the topic of the very significant risks of
					 this free trade agreement with Costa Rica for such sectors as the Lantic Sugar
					 refinery in Montreal, which was mentioned by the member for
					 Hochelaga--Maisonneuve last week. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no changes are made to those two aspects of the
					 agreement we will, as I said, be forced to reassess our position at third
					 reading.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we will be told that it is going to be very
					 difficult to backtrack on an agreement the Canadian government has already
					 signed with Costa Rica. That is the government's fault, because if the process
					 had been more transparent, if parliamentarians have been involved, if civil
					 society had been consulted as the Minister for International Trade had made a
					 commitment to do, we would not be in this situation. We are, therefore,
					 refusing to be held prisoner by a done deal and we are not going to hand over a
					 blank cheque to the Minister of International Trade, or to the Liberal
					 government, because this precedent with Costa Rica, as in the other cases, will
					 enable this government to continue negotiation process with regard to the free
					 trade area of the Americas with the same lack of transparency, not involving
					 parliamentarians and not consulting civil society. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time the government understood that democracy and
					 transparency are now essential conditions for the successful signing of any
					 free trade agreement, whether with Costa Rica or the with regard to the free
					 trade area of the Americas. Enough is enough. The Liberal government is
					 responsible for getting us into this situation, and now it is being forced to
					 face up to its responsibilities and to get back to our Costa Rican partners on
					 two aspects, namely investment protection and the predictable effects of the
					 agreement on the refined sugar industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that message had been understood at the
					 Quebec City summit. With the experience of the failed multilateral agreement on
					 investment at Seattle and the difficulties at the Quebec City summit, I thought
					 that it had become clear for democratic governments, particularly the
					 Government of Canada, which brags about being a model in this respect, that the
					 era of negotiations behind closed doors was over.</p>


	<A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costa Rica is not a good example because we never heard
					 about it and there were no consultations, even though, as I said earlier, the
					 Minister for International Trade told us back in January that he would consult
					 industry officials and civil society. But he did not do it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also remind the House that in the winter and spring
					 the Bloc Quebecois moved two motions to democratize the negotiation process on
					 the free trade area of the Americas, but both of these motions were rejected by
					 the Liberal majority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one instance, we unanimously adopted a proposal to
					 implement a continuous process to consult parliamentarians and civil society,
					 but nothing was done by this government; nothing was done by the Minister for
					 International Trade. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the debate on the free trade agreement with
					 Costa Rica, the government will have to finally open its eyes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill should also be put in the context of not only
					 the negotiations on the free trade area of the Americas, but also in the
					 context of the negotiations at the World Trade Organization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we miss this opportunity to have a substantive
					 debate on the transparency and democratization of the negotiation process,
					 chances are that, following some agreement at the World Trade Organization, the
					 Liberal government will once again put us before a fait accompli.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same goes for the ongoing negotiations with four
					 Central American countries, namely Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras and El
					 Salvador, in that we have absolutely no idea of what is going on with these
					 negotiations. It is the same thing with the free trade area of the Americas.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as we are concerned, it is imperative that, in
					 this agreement, we take into account the two themes or issues that I mentioned
					 earlier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one is the investment issue. The Minister for
					 International Trade is playing with words. In the background papers that were
					 distributed to us, we are told that there is no new commitment on investments
					 and services, which is true. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this may suggest to some opponents that there
					 is nothing in this agreement that resembles chapter XI of NAFTA on the
					 protection of investments, which is false. There are no new commitments on
					 investments, because these commitments were made in 1998, when the investment
					 protection incentive agreement was signed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This agreement, which the Costa Rica—Canada free trade
					 agreement refers to specifically, contains provisions similar to those found in
					 chapter 11 of NAFTA. These provisions, according to a number of people, present
					 considerable potential problems. This was evidenced recently by the proceedings
					 UPS launched against Canada Post and the Government of Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the free trade agreement with Costa Rica refers to
					 this agreement for the promotion and protection of investments, and I will read
					 article XII of March 18, 1998, which provides that:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Any dispute between one Contracting
						  Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, relating to a claim by
						  the investor that a measure taken or not taken by the former Contracting Party
						  is in breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has incurred loss or
						  damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach, shall...be settled
						  amicably between them.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following article provides:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>If a dispute has not been settled
						  amicably within a period of six months from the date on which it was initiated,
						  it may be submitted by the investor to arbitration in accordance with paragraph
						  (4).</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arbitration between a private party and a government is
					 the prerogative of chapter 11, a chapter that was promised us. However, the
					 Minister for International Trade had said that he did not want it in the final
					 agreement of the free trade agreement of the Americas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the following appears on the federal
					 government's website:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Canada is not advocating the
						  replication of NAFTA investor-state rules in the FTAA and has not supported the
						  proposals made so far by other FTAA countries to include such a type of dispute
						  settlement mechanism.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we can see, there is a blatant contradiction, since,
					 once again, we see in the free trade agreement with Costa Rica provisions
					 referring to another agreement—it is true—but they are the ones from chapter
					 11, which the government says it does not want to include in the final free
					 trade area of the Americas agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We might have expected that the federal government, the
					 Minister for International Trade, would go back to the 1998 agreement to strike
					 out the provisions and have disputes between countries, which are provided for
					 in all the agreements, including that of the WTO, even those involving private
					 business, settled by governments, by countries and not by private
					 interests.</p>


	<A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore essential to review this if the
					 agreement is to be acceptable. Even though, as I mentioned, we support free
					 trade in theory, we must ensure that it benefits the people of the Americas, in
					 this case, the people of Costa Rica, Canada, and Quebec, rather than private
					 corporations that would take precedence over the right of sovereign states to
					 make decisions based on the interests of their citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been told, and I think this is scandalous, that
					 this agreement poses no threat, since there is very little, if any, Costa Rican
					 investment in Canada. That is not the point. The point is whether we, as
					 Canadians and Quebecers, believe that trade agreements must take into
					 consideration the development of all populations, rather than defending the
					 interests of our own capitalists. I believe, as a matter of principle, that
					 this parliament must ensure that this situation is rectified.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of sugar, which is the second aspect, and I
					 believe that my colleague from Hochelaga--Maisonneuve outlined the difficulty,
					 we gave Costa Rica better access to the Canadian market than what we would
					 receive under this agreement, with respect to the Costa Rican sugar market.
					 Obviously, we will be told that Costa Rica does not produce refined sugar, only
					 a small amount of raw sugar. They export very little to Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is not the point. Once again, we are setting a
					 precedent, whereby in negotiations with the other four countries of Central
					 America, including Guatemala, which is a very large producer--combined, these
					 four countries export one and a half times the total industry production in
					 Canada and Quebec--we will open up our markets to this raw sugar, and possibly
					 refined sugar, since it will cost relatively little for Guatemalans to develop
					 a sugar refining industry. We will be opening up our markets without them
					 reciprocating.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not kid ourselves. The market for refined sugar
					 from Canada or Quebec will not be Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador or Costa
					 Rica, but the United States. The problem is that the Americans have a
					 protectionist attitude and policy when it comes to refined sugar. As long as
					 they refuse to open their markets, any opening in Canada's market for refined
					 sugar from other countries will be a concession without an equivalent
					 advantage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We think it very important that this part of the
					 agreement be dropped, not because we are protectionists like the Americans, but
					 because we really believe in free trade. And because we do, we want this part
					 of the free trade agreement between Canada and Costa Rica to be dropped and the
					 Canadian government to propose multilateral liberalization of the refined sugar
					 market, including, of course, the American market, as part of free trade area
					 of the Americas negotiations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, our industry will have an opportunity
					 to develop, to be competitive, and to hang on to existing jobs, as well as
					 create more. As the House is probably aware, our sugar industry, especially the
					 Lantic Sugar refinery in Montreal, has worked hard to become an international
					 player. In this industry, we operate according to the rules of free trade,
					 because the raw sugar refined in Canada is bought at market prices and not
					 subsidized in any way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we truly believe in free trade, if we truly believe
					 that free trade should serve the public and not just the private sector, it
					 seems to me that we have a golden opportunity during the coming weeks to do
					 something about it, to use free trade with Costa Rica as proof in the free
					 trade negotiations that Canada wants to play a leadership role. The opportunity
					 is there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that government members were somewhat deluded
					 about the real impact of the issues surrounding this free trade agreement. We
					 are not at all sure that we are going to support this bill at third reading.
					 Work will be done in committee. My colleagues and I will have an opportunity to
					 present a number of amendments to correct the situation, in the hope that
					 parliamentarians will match actions to words and that the free trade agreement
					 with Costa Rica will truly serve Canadians, Quebecers and Costa
					 Ricans.</p>

					 (Kamouraska--Rivière-du-Loup--Témiscouata--Les Basques, BQ):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I find it interesting that we are debating
					 a bill concerning Costa Rica. It reminds me of an example given us by Mr.
					 Parizeau, an excellent teacher, on the positive aspect of free trade. He said
					 the fact that small countries such as Costa Rica could win issues against very
					 large countries, as they had in the past, had to be played up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Joliette has shown us fairly clearly
					 that there is another side to the whole issue of globalization. If things are
					 not done sufficiently openly, we could easily end up with agreements such as
					 the MAI, the multilateral agreement on investment. Had this agreement been
					 approved, governments would have been made dependent on multinationals,
					 dependent in terms of capital. The remarks we heard this morning are
					 relevant.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like this to be a lesson to us. Other
					 agreements are currently being negotiated. The free trade area of the Americas
					 is under negotiation. When I was taking part in the demonstrations in Quebec
					 City in support of those who want to give globalization a human face, the
					 question heard everywhere was “Will you as parliamentarians have the tools to
					 ensure that what gets signed in the end is acceptable?”</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question for the member for Joliette. Should
					 we not draw on the lesson of the negotiations with Costa Rica to see what will
					 be done differently and which of our allies in society can help us attain
					 satisfactory results in future negotiations, positive results and free trade
					 agreements that promote equality among peoples and a better distribution of
					 wealth, and not the reverse.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the hon. member for 
					 Kamouraska--Rivière-du-Loup--Témiscouata--Les Basques
						for his question. I feel it is totally appropriate, even central,
					 to this debate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, we are told that this agreement is
					 not, in the end, all that serious because it repeats the terms of the agreement
					 with Chile, more or less, which is inspired by NAFTA. It gets passed just like
					 that, while they are fully aware that this is just one more agreement that is
					 not seen as satisfactory by increasing numbers of people in the Americas, or in
					 any of the democratic world. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec and in Canada, more and more people no longer
					 accept the way governments negotiate these trade agreements with impact on all
					 aspects of our lives, economic—and on that we are all in agreement, I
					 think—social, cultural , or environmental.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either we act as if there were no problem, and pass
					 this implementing legislation because we have nothing against Costa Rica, which
					 is true—in fact our feelings toward it are far from negative—or we take
					 advantage of this opportunity, as my colleague has said, to hold an indepth
					 debate, not just on this agreement but on the entire process leading up to free
					 trade agreements, be they the one with Costa Rica or future agreements with
					 Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador or within the framework of the free trade area
					 of the Americas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, there is an extremely important principle at
					 stake, one that has moreover been referred to by the French Prime Minister,
					 Lionel Jospin. Mr. Parizeau has used it as well, often, but I believe it merits
					 some thought. Within the framework of trade agreements, whether continental or
					 international, countries may delegate part of their sovereignty in order to
					 ensure proper administration, to ensure that an agreement is properly
					 implemented and respected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in no case must the sovereignty of states,
					 democratic states in particular, be handed over to private interests.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Chapter XI of NAFTA is concerned, that is
					 what is happening; the same goes for the agreement between the Government of
					 Canada and the Government of Costa Rica for the promotion and protection of
					 investments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we have an opportunity here to regroup, to
					 ensure not only that this agreement is beneficial and gets signed, but also
					 that the coming agreements with the four other Central American countries and
					 with all the other countries of the Americas, meet our wishes that they serve
					 the interests of the general population, not monied interests. </p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member for
					 Joliette for his very eloquent speech. However, there is one thing that I would
					 like the public to hear again. My colleague has often explained to us chapter
					 11 of NAFTA and its impact on the negotiations on the FTAA. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process is even more advanced in the case of this
					 treaty with Costa Rica. I wonder if, for the benefit of our fellow citizens who
					 are listening to us at home, the hon. member could clearly explain again the
					 impact of this chapter 11 in the treaty, since it seems that they are trying to
					 include it in every free trade agreement, whether it is the FTAA or with Costa
					 Rica.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-53367"></A><a HREF="#Int-53369"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-53365"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pierre Paquette:
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Châteauguay
					 for his question. There can never be too many opportunities to explain the
					 shift that be triggered by some aspects of NAFTA's chapter 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all agree in this House that foreign investments are
					 entitled to some form of protection. However, there must not be an imbalance,
					 as was the case with chapter 11, between the rights of businesses and the
					 ability of the states to create the collective tools that the public wants them
					 to have. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under NAFTA, this was not fully duplicated in the Costa
					 Rica--Canada investment protection and incentive agreement, two things present
					 a problem. The first one, which is found in the agreement with Costa Rica, is
					 that a private company can go directly to a court created under the agreement
					 to take legal action against a government because of measures that it deems
					 harmful to its profitability. This is the first problem and, in my opinion, a
					 fundamental one. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second problem with chapter 11 of NAFTA is the
					 definition of expropriation, which is much too broad, as exemplified by the
					 legal proceedings undertaken by UPS against the Canada Post Corporation, where
					 UPS claims that Canada Post is guilty of unfair competition because it uses its
					 infrastructures to provide courier services. We will get back to this later
					 on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will wrap up my remarks by commenting on the matter
					 of disputes. For a private company to sue a government directly, as part of an
					 agreement which creates a tribunal, is most unusual. Apart from NAFTA, to my
					 knowledge there is, no other agreement with such provisions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the World Trade Organization, we have a
					 perfect example involving Bombardier and Embraer in Brazil. Bombardier feels
					 that it is suffering because of policies that allow the Brazilian government to
					 subsidize Embraer's exports, especially those to the United States. Under no
					 WTO agreement is Bombardier going to sue the Brazilian government directly. The
					 company is represented by the Canadian government, which has filed a complaint
					 with the World Trade Organization. The Brazilian government, on behalf of
					 Embraer, is responding to this complaint. Governments speak for private
					 companies. These are the sorts of mechanisms that we should have in NAFTA and
					 in any free trade agreements we sign.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of this chapter was underestimated. In an
					 article that appeared in <i>Le Devoir</i> last May, Mr. Parizeau, who was in
					 fact a supporter of the agreement, and no one would question his support for
					 the North American Free Trade Agreement, admitted that he had underestimated
					 the impact of chapter 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I know to his credit this summer,
					 ministers for international trade from the three countries, Canada, the United
					 States and Mexico, presented documents clarifying interpretation of this
					 chapter. I examined these documents. In my opinion, they do not go far enough
					 and the problem still remains.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate on the free trade agreement between Canada
					 and Costa Rica is an opportunity to further consider this issue and to come up
					 with solutions which serve the interests of Canadians and of
					 Quebecers.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin by reiterating my party's friendship with

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take the impact of the bill and ultimately the
					 FTAA, we see in the sugar industry, for example, the differences between free
					 trade and fair trade. The bill does nothing to promote better wages for Costa
					 Rican sugar workers so that they can get access to our markets, and believe me,
					 Canadians love sugar.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement does nothing to ensure that sugar
					 producers in Costa Rica meet the same environmental standards as Canadian sugar
					 companies. To suggest that this is somehow a level playing field, speaks to the
					 narrow vision of the drafters of the agreement. Their vision only sees money
					 and balance sheets. Their vision cannot see the economies that the moneys flow
					 into, the workers producing the goods or services, the internationally
					 recognized beautiful cloud forests of Costa Rica that need protection or the
					 families displaced by the implementation of the agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we oppose and what the hundreds of thousands of
					 protesters who have been demonstrating in Vancouver, Seattle and Quebec City
					 oppose are special rules embedded in trade agreements that give special rights
					 to corporations trying to run over the rights of people and their elected
					 governments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said before in the House that I support trade. I
					 support the jobs that come with trade. What I do not support is the set of
					 global rules that say that people and their governments do not matter, only
					 corporations matter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the premise of NAFTA and its chapter 11. That
					 was the premise of the MAI and that is the spirit of the bill when we remember
					 that Canada has already signed special investment agreements with Costa Rica
					 that effectively supplement Bill C-32.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be clear about the government's trade agenda:
					 support chapter 11 and expand NAFTA throughout the hemisphere, ultimately
					 through NAFTA but, in the meantime, through little agreements such as this one
					 and the one with Chile.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would love to suggest that this is a government plan
					 but I really think it is a corporate plan. I say that partly based on the
					 erratic behaviour that the government has shown in the matter. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw the Prime Minister running in 1993 guaranteeing
					 that NAFTA would not be adopted unless he got changes to protect Canada. He
					 then adopted NAFTA with only a few cosmetic changes. The protests started,
					 first at APEC, then Seattle, then Quebec City and then Genoa.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a glimmer of reprieve when the minister was
					 before the committee a while back and said that investor rights would not move
					 into the WTO, into GATS or into FTAA. However once again we saw corporate
					 Canada send the message and the Prime Minister crack the whip to drive the
					 minister back in line.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hard to know which party in parliament is being
					 less democratic, the government or the official opposition. Both seem to want
					 to hide public discussion and dissent behind closed doors and tall
					 fences.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last spring I was in Quebec City where 50,000 people
					 marched into the streets to protest the undemocratic process being used to make
					 decisions that would affect human beings around the world. The most common
					 complaint of the hundreds with whom I spoke was the inclusion and existence of
					 investor rights outlined in chapter 11, which, according to a leak on the eve
					 of the summit, were to be included and strengthened in the FTAA. The bill would
					 extend the regime to our relations with Costa Rica.</p>


	<A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1245)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was there as a member of parliament. It was clear
					 that the place to be to find out what was going on in the hearts and minds of
					 perhaps millions of Canadians was in Quebec City. The obvious place for the
					 text of the free trade area of the Americas agreement to be discussed would
					 have been in the House, as brought forward by our government, and in public
					 forums across the country. Instead the text of the agreement was not made
					 public until far too late for real comment. We as the elected representatives
					 were outside the fence along with everyone else while corporate Canada lobbied
					 for their interests behind the comfort of the police line.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 11 of NAFTA is about denying democratic
					 culture. It is about destroying the democratic spirit of those outside the
					 fence as resolutely as the police were committed to protecting the mass of
					 concrete steel and barbed wire.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critics of mine and the critics of other protesters
					 have tried to say that New Democrats are anti-trade but that simply is not
					 true. We are pro-trade. We are pro-community. We want our voices to count
					 through our democratically elected governments. We do not want past mistakes of
					 trade, specifically the recognition of investor's rights as being equal to the
					 rights of government, to be preserved and expanded. We believe that business,
					 money and the wealthy should not have special legal rights. Special legal
					 rights in this context means that corporations get something that citizens do
					 not, but NAFTA's chapter 11 says that the investors' rights are more important
					 than citizens' rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not consider these rights special rights if a
					 citizen could not go to a NAFTA tribunal and say “I need protection for my
					 children, my way of life, my natural environment, my ability to have more than
					 one point of view on the TV or in my newspaper, my income, my community or my
					 democracy”. However there is no way an individual can do this either as an
					 individual or through a class action. Only corporations can.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a right in NAFTA under chapter 11 and it is a
					 proposed right in the FTAA under section 15. Under chapter 11 a foreign company
					 can sue a democratically elected government because the government chooses to
					 operate state enterprises or allow for monopolies that it deems desirable for
					 the public good. Under chapter 11, the company can sue a democratically elected
					 government because through its actions on behalf of its citizens it has denied
					 that company the opportunity to profit in a specific sector of the
					 economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can imagine how our history would have evolved if
					 this had been true in the past: no railways, no Canadian broadcasters, no
					 Petro-Canada, no national airlines, no post office. This is not to mention the
					 real threat which is to our public hospitals, our schools, our environmental
					 controls and eventually our democracies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-32 and the Canada-Costa Rica free trade
					 agreement follow the NAFTA and the FTAA models of free trade that the NDP has
					 consistently opposed because they put corporate rights ahead of human rights,
					 the environment and democracy. To point this out, I will use an example
					 currently before a NAFTA tribunal. UPS is suing Canada because it opposes
					 Canada Post couriering mail. UPS is saying that because Canada Post is a crown
					 corporation, which it is, and that it accepts parcels for delivery by the
					 equivalent of a courier service, which it does, then UPS is losing potential
					 profit and our taxpayers should cough up a chunk of tax money and give it to
					 UPS, which we may have to do. It could win this one.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under NAFTA, we no longer have the right to have crown
					 corporations that are efficient, that use new technologies and that update
					 their business plans to deliver a service which we as parliamentarians say
					 Canadians want and need.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think we have ever debated this in the House
					 but it is not rocket science to realize that we are a big country with a small
					 population that is very spread out. Having efficient, reliable and affordable
					 services to send each other mail, parcels and goods makes a lot of sense to me,
					 but apparently we can only do this if we first compensate UPS.</p>


	<A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1250)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This case shows how we are stuck with agreements with
					 ineffective exemptions that never allow public enterprises to change or
					 modernize or to survive. If we lose our courier services at the post office,
					 how long will it be until we lose the whole thing? How long will we wait before
					 we are before a tribunal defending our hospitals, our schools, our public
					 broadcasters or our military procurement?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These agreements and the right of investors to sue for
					 perceived loss of profits because of changes in public services mean that the
					 public sector will eventually be extinct. I disagree with this. Investors
					 should have no special rights. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our democracy is our most special public right. Under
					 our charter, four of the five sections deal with guaranteeing these rights.
					 However I am frightened that unless we change our tune on chapter 11 and these
					 types of agreements such as the one we are debating today, these rights will be
					 traded away for the sake of guaranteed profits for transnational
					 corporations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that my constituents and all Canadians
					 deserve better so I will be opposing this bill at second reading.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-32, an act
					 to implement the free trade agreement between the Government of Canada and the
					 Government of the Republic of Costa Rica. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard some interesting discussions this
					 morning, most recently by one of the members of the New Democratic Party. I
					 would like to put a few facts on the table as we hear a lot of the doom and
					 gloom about the recent free trade agreements. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last decade or so, Canada has participated in a
					 number of significant trade deals including the Free Trade Agreement in 1989,
					 the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, the Canada-Chile Free Trade
					 Agreement in 1997. More recently negotiations are well under way on the FTAA,
					 the free trade area of the Americas, the goal being to bring 34 nations under a
					 single trading area by the year 2005.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look back at what the successes have been.
					 Today, Canada and the U.S. enjoy $1.4 billion daily in trade between our two
					 nations. There are over 200 million crossings a year between Canada and the
					 United States. This is a huge benefit to Canadians as a result of the Free
					 Trade Agreement. I acknowledge it is not perfect and I will get into a few of
					 those areas, but today Canada enjoys an $18 billion trade surplus with the
					 United States. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade agreements have been good for the Canadian
					 economy, highlighting our competitiveness as a trading nation and strengthening
					 Canada's national identity. Canada depends on free trade to promote economic
					 growth, create jobs and sustain our standard of living. Trade generates over
					 40% of Canada's GDP. One in every four jobs in Canada is a direct result of
					 these free trade agreements. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard some concerns with respect to this latest
					 free trade agreement with Costa Rica. I acknowledge that there are concerns on
					 both sides, but by and large the benefits far outweigh the concerns. When NAFTA
					 was being negotiated, similar concerns were being raised. People had concerns
					 about various sectors, but by and large the Canadian economy has grown
					 substantially. Again, Canada and the United States enjoy $1.4 billion of trade
					 daily between our two countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now trade between Canada and Costa Rica is $269
					 million annually. By moving ahead with this free trade agreement I believe
					 trade will grow and it will benefit Costa Ricans and Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada imports a number of goods from Costa Rica: fresh
					 fruit, coffee, raw sugar, flowers, woven apparel, electrical machinery and
					 preserved food. At the same time Canada exports paper, paperboard, fish, auto
					 parts, plastics, wood, potatoes and wheat, among other things to Costa Rica.
					 Our agricultural sector is looking for enhanced markets. There are
					 opportunities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the concerns on the Canadian side is that of
					 sugar. The sugar refineries in Canada have raised concerns and I hear what they
					 are saying. There are no sugar refineries in Costa Rica and only raw sugar is
					 exported which our sugar refineries need. However, at the same time the Costa
					 Ricans are worried about frozen potatoes, french fries. There are great
					 opportunities for us there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am trying to make the point that there are always
					 going to be concerns, as there were with NAFTA and other free trade agreements.
					 However, at the end of the day Canadians have risen to the challenge. It has
					 been great for our economy and great for producing jobs.</p>


	<A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1255)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This free trade agreement would mean the elimination of
					 Costa Rican tariffs on almost 94% of Canada's current agricultural and agrifood
					 exports to Costa Rica. This means that our agricultural producers will get
					 better access to these markets. The amount of $269 million annually is
					 obviously not large but it is a base amount which can grow. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that our trading barriers, the economic
					 borders between our nations, have been evaporating for years. We can look at
					 what has been happening in Europe. It is becoming one of the most powerful
					 trading blocs globally. It seems to have eliminated all of the economic borders
					 and has come down to one trading bloc. That is what we are moving toward in the
					 year 2005 with the free trade area of the Americas. This agreement is just one
					 small part in the move in that direction. I think it is going to be good for
					 Canada and Cost Rica.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members have raised issues about environmental and
					 labour standards. It is important that we put all the facts on the table. Side
					 agreements were negotiated which included two parallel accords, one on
					 environmental co-operation and another on labour co-operation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spring I was with the minister on a trip to
					 Costa Rica for the final negotiations of the trade agreement. I had an
					 opportunity to meet with some of the government members and the minister in
					 Costa Rica on this issue. They were as concerned as we are about the
					 environment and labour standards. I think this is a win-win situation for both
					 sides. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An environmental side agreement will promote a strong,
					 ongoing environmental partnership based on environmental commitments. The
					 labour accord will provide a framework for dealing with labour issues in the
					 context of trade agreements and demonstrates Canada's commitment to promote
					 workers rights in the context of trade liberalization in the
					 Americas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no secret that there are issues regarding labour
					 standards in Costa Rica. It is a developing nation. We should not be looking at
					 this negatively. Canada has an opportunity to help improve Costa Rica's labour
					 standards as it moves through this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our commitment to try and increase labour standards can
					 help pave the way. We can be a model for two smaller nations population-wise
					 because each has approximately 30 million people. We can demonstrate our impact
					 on helping to bring up Costa Rica's labour standards.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I acknowledge the concerns of the sugar refineries in
					 Canada. However, looking back to NAFTA and other free trade agreements we have
					 signed, if every concern raised was enough to scuttle the deal or was enough to
					 say stop, then we would get left behind. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that the Americas, Canada and North
					 America are moving to a trading bloc. We have to lead the way. We want to be
					 out in front. We want to ensure that we provide every Canadian with new
					 opportunities. We want to ensure the opportunity for real permanent job growth.
					 This is the way it is going to happen. Sitting back and taking a cautious
					 approach is not going to help Canada. We need to be bold, to take risks and to
					 move forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industry will rise to the occasion. It will create
					 real, meaningful, lasting jobs. We cannot sit back and wait for the government
					 to create jobs. Those jobs are not permanent. That does not work. It gives
					 people a false sense of security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large although there are concerns on both sides,
					 the positives far outweigh the concerns. The pros are there. It is going to set
					 a model as we move forward in the negotiation of the free trade area of the
					 Americas. That is happening between 34 nations, and both Costa Rica and Canada
					 are a part of that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us get out in front. Let us demonstrate that we can
					 make this work. Let us increase that trade. Let us open up new markets for some
					 of our agricultural producers who are looking for new markets. At the same
					 time, as with our sugar refineries, let us try to deal with the challenges as
					 they come forward.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, right now Costa Rica does not refine sugar
					 as it has no capacity to do so. It only exports raw sugar. There may be
					 opportunities there for our sugar refineries to increase.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, we should be bold and move forward. The members
					 of the Progressive Conservative Democratic Representative coalition will be
					 supporting the bill.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to
					 point out some of the remarks that the very learned member for Saanich--Gulf
					 Islands made with respect to free trade. He pointed out that the enormous
					 amount of growth in our economy that principally has evolved from free trade
					 and that we trade over $360 billion each year with the Americans. We have
					 proven that trade actually can be very much a driver. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to compliment the approach that the hon.
					 member took in that there are always concerns about trade agreements. He
					 commented that we could ratcheted some of the labour code issues up with
					 emerging nations by dealing with a more developed nation like Canada. I also
					 point out that we have had three provisions in those trade agreements on which
					 we must maintain our sovereignty, those being environment, culture and our
					 labour code. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does the hon. member have to say about those other
					 two additions that help us maintain our sovereignty with respect to the
					 environment and culture, in addition to our labour codes?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-53375"></A><a HREF="#Int-53377"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-53373"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Gary Lunn:
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, that is correct. There have been side
					 agreements with respect to labour and the environment. It will not only allow
					 us to maintain our identity, our culture and protect our standards in these
					 areas and expand on them, but it also gives us an opportunity to help Costa
					 Rica if it has areas of concern. It can see what we are doing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my discussions with the minister in Costa Rica, I
					 discovered the people were quite interested in learning about our standards. It
					 is an evolving nation which is growing rapidly. It is not only for the
					 betterment of our nation to maintain our standards, but it also helps to
					 improve theirs, which I think is great for society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the member's earlier point about
					 challenges. There is no illusion. Look at NAFTA and the softwood lumber mess.
					 There is no place in the country where it hurts more than in my province. We
					 have to work through that. I think we will. I am very confident that we will
					 get through this, and hopefully very soon. However, we can work through
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we had scrapped the North American Free Trade
					 Agreement back in 1994, we would not be sitting at $1 billion plus trade per
					 day between our nations. There are 200 million crossings a year. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there are challenges as we go down this road and
					 we need to rise to the occasion to deal with those. However, Canadians will be
					 better off and so will the country.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Surrey Central,
					 I am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-32 regarding the proposed
					 free trade agreement between Canada and Costa Rica. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The act tries to lay out the terms of a free trade
					 agreement between two countries by gradually reducing trade barriers in goods
					 and services. As we all know, free trade usually helps to raise the standard of
					 living for both partners through increased competitiveness and lower prices. It
					 can also do this if the agreement is balanced in its approach. If it is not, it
					 will favour one partner more than the other. This is not the intention of free
					 trade.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken alone, the bill may seem harmless, but if we look
					 closer, the bill states that it would promote regional integration through an
					 instrument that contributes to the establishment of the free trade area of the
					 Americas (FTAA). Therefore, the bill is not just about Canada-Costa Rica free
					 trade, but could be used as a model for a hemispheric free trade
					 agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to look at it very carefully. Canada already
					 has a $100 million trade deficit with Costa Rica, so the relationship is
					 already an unequal one. The bill would only make the situation
					 worse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example of a sector where it favours Costa Rica
					 over Canada is in the sugar industry. Sugar is currently refined from sugar
					 cane and sugar beets. Sugar cane is grown in tropical areas, whereas sugar
					 beets are grown in temperate regions, such as Canada and the United
					 States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada currently has three sugar refineries to process
					 raw sugar. This is down from seven 20 years ago. While Canada has some of the
					 world's most liberal rules regarding importing sugar, our tariffs on imported
					 refined sugar are 8%, while we currently have no tariffs on raw sugar for
					 processing in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of exports, our only really viable market is
					 to the United States which imposes strict quotas of 12,000 tonnes of sugar a
					 year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other countries like Costa Rice hit us with very hefty
					 tariffs when we export sugar to their countries. For example, Guatemala has a
					 160% tariff on sugar imports, whereas in Canada it is 8%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a company in British Columbia called Rogers
					 Sugar which stands to lose a great deal from this agreement. I invited its
					 management to my office to tell me their side of the story. This 111 year old
					 company supports the livelihood of 650 people, including 450 farmers, and
					 produces 140,000 tonnes of sugar each year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House already heard the desperate shape that our
					 farmers were in during the emergency debate on the agriculture industry last
					 week.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it this government's intention to add insult to
					 injury by taking away the livelihood of those farms and their families? What
					 about the effects on communities such as Taber, Alberta where Rogers has its
					 beet sugar refineries? What will happen to these communities?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This company currently injects close to $100 million
					 into the Canadian economy through its operations in Vancouver and Taber,
					 providing high quality employment to their employees, including 17 from my
					 constituency of Surrey Central.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For companies such as Rogers, this agreement stifles
					 the operation of market forces by giving Costa Rica more access to Canada than
					 Canada gets to Costa Rica. So reciprocity is not fair.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costa Rica does not currently use refined sugar, so

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade agreements have to be negotiated fairly. The
					 negotiations should be properly done effectively and efficiently for the
					 benefit of Canada and Canadians. It should be a win-win situation over a period
					 of time. An imbalanced approach cannot be used in negotiations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that this is not the only sector where this
					 is true. One sector which is of great concern in British Columbia is the
					 softwood lumber sector. We all know the fate of this industry. In this case,
					 Canada is restricting trade to protect the domestic industry, not very
					 effectively either I might add.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of sugar, though, the government is signing
					 an agreement which clearly benefits the other country more than us, and that is
					 not fair. I thought CIDA was responsible for handing out foreign aid. I did not
					 think that the international trade had similar intentions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By not paying attention to the spirit of free trade
					 agreements, our government is not providing our industries with a level playing
					 field in bilateral trading relationships with Costa Rica.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned before, this agreement does more than
					 open the door for the exchange of goods and services with Costa Rica. It is a
					 model for the whole FTAA framework and the rest of the world through the World
					 Trade Organization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, we must see that regional trade agreements, such
					 as the FTAA, cannot conflict with our WTO agreements. That means we must
					 provide the same benefits that we are providing Costa Rica to our trading
					 partners. So then the agreement could be used as a lever for other countries to
					 extract concessions from us in other sectors and other industries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free trade, when done right, leads to lower prices for
					 consumers. However, free trade must also be fair trade. It must benefit both
					 partners equally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, at a time of economic uncertainty, we
					 cannot afford to do anything which threatens jobs in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of British Columbia have already been hurt
					 through the government's bungling of softwood lumber, tomato dumping in British
					 Columbia, the mining industry, fisheries, tourism, the film industry and many
					 others. We cannot let it do it to our sugar industry as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We owe it to the farmers and workers affected by these
					 industries to oppose the bill and others like it. This will not be the last
					 free trade bill that comes through the House. Markets work best where
					 government intervenes the least. That is what a free market is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the government does intervene, it must try to
					 promote fairness and look at the whole web of Canada's trade relations with
					 other countries. We cannot afford to be too shortsighted about the issue. We
					 must look at the bigger picture and its future implications. The bill sets a
					 dangerous precedent so I must oppose it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would say that the elimination of the
					 tariff on refined sugar imports from CA-4 countries would greatly enhance these
					 countries' competitiveness in the Canadian market.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of this to domestic producers could exceed $30
					 million Canadian in the short and medium term. The benefit to Canadian
					 consumers would total between $9 million to $13 million Canadian.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact on the industrial end users and consumers
					 and CA-4 producers and importers would depend ultimately on whether local
					 producers concede market share or compete on price in the industrial market
					 segment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, given that the CA-4 producers would be able to
					 supply the domestic market at a lower cost than the Canadian producers, the
					 immediate removal of the tariff would result in an increase in competition in
					 the local market.</p>


	<A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1315)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we estimate that certain Canadian producers
					 could compete with imported sugar on a cash cost basis, no industry is able to
					 operate on this basis in the long term. However if the tariff were eliminated
					 gradually, this would enable domestic producers to decide if and how they would
					 respond to the new challenge and to implement their response
					 accordingly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the longer term the FTAA will pose new and more
					 complex challenges. In addition to opening up the Canadian market to imports of
					 sugar from major sugar producing countries such as the United States and
					 Mexico, both of whom have considerable logistical advantages in supplying
					 Canada compared with the CA-4 countries and Brazil, which is an enormous and
					 very low cost sugar producer, the FTAA would also increase the opportunities
					 for industrial end users to relocate their production bases to other countries
					 in the Americans.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This agreement does not have a balanced approach
					 between Canada and Costa Rica. It is setting a precedent which would be
					 dangerous for Canada and Canadians. Therefore I must oppose the bill.

					 to the Minister for International Trade, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to lead off second reading
					 debate on this important piece of legislation. This legislation results from an
					 extensive review of the existing Export Development Act and of the activities
					 of the corporation it governs, that is the Export Development Corporation or
					 what we commonly call EDC.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill contains specific amendments that flow from a
					 comprehensive review process which began in 1998 and brings a balanced approach
					 to change at EDC. This legislation also complements other policy direction from
					 government, as well as changes that have been initiated by EDC since the review
					 process got under way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fair to say that the period leading up to this
					 legislation has seen the most thorough review of Canada's export financing
					 activities that has ever been undertaken. The broad based review included
					 public consultations, parliamentary committee recommendations, and advice and
					 recommendations from many other experts, stakeholders and independent
					 observers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill now before the House is a product of a focused
					 discussion on what is best for Canada in the intensely competitive world of
					 international trade as well as a thorough examination of how best to reflect
					 Canadian values in our dealings with other countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key feature of the bill is a new statutory
					 requirement for the environmental review of projects being considered for EDC
					 support. This is a significant change that positions Canada in the forefront of
					 the international community in efforts to more closely link export credit
					 activities and environmental impacts. The bill also includes other statutory
					 changes that provide the necessary legal basis for a number of operational
					 changes at EDC. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-31 fulfills a commitment made by the Minister
					 for International Trade last June. At that time the minister announced
					 important policy changes for Canada's export credit agency. He said he would
					 introduce enabling legislation this fall. Bill C-31 completes the package by
					 providing the necessary legal basis for change.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister's June announcement was based on
					 conclusions that came out of the review process I mentioned a moment ago. To
					 understand how the amendments we are debating today flow from the review, it is
					 useful to understand something of the process itself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members may know the Minister for International
					 Trade, in consultation with the Minister of Finance, is legally required to
					 periodically review the act under the terms of the act itself. This requirement
					 stems from changes that were made to the act in 1993 by the parliament of the
					 day. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those changes include a significant expansion of the
					 commercial mandate of the Export Development Corporation so that it could fill
					 perceived gaps in the private sector financial services market or more actively
					 support the international financing needs of Canadian exporters.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes proved to be very effective. The
					 corporation's financial support to Canadian exporters grew from about $12
					 billion in 1993 to more than $45 billion last year. In that time Canadian
					 businesses have expanded their market reach all over the world. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today exports account for over 40% of our GDP.
					 Approximately one-third of our jobs are directly dependent on our success in
					 export markets.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that the Export Development Corporation is
					 a key part of our country's success in export markets. The EDC has demonstrated
					 its value to Canada by filling gaps in the private sector's financial services,
					 by reaching out to bring more small and medium size businesses into the export
					 marketplace, by providing needed financial support to Canada's customers in
					 developing countries, and overall by ensuring that Canadian exporters have
					 access to the kind of financing that will keep them competitive with exporters
					 from other countries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the fact that the EDC plays such a key role in
					 our country's trade development strategy, we must ensure that it will continue
					 to meet the competitive financing needs of Canadian exporters, and especially
					 the small and medium size businesses that are the backbone of our economy and
					 the main creators of jobs throughout Canada.</p>


	<A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1320)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This need has become even more important as economic
					 conditions around the world have tightened and market conditions for Canadian
					 exporters have become even more competitive. At the same time EDC's operating
					 policies and financing activities must reflect Canadian values in areas of
					 corporate social responsibility, the environment, human rights, public
					 accountability and transparency.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As legislators our public policy challenge is to find a
					 balance between the twin priorities of international business competitiveness
					 and corporate social responsibility. Bill C-31 helps to do just that. It also
					 complements other initiatives to bring about a balanced approach to change at
					 EDC. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, taken together with earlier policy
					 guidance provided by the Minister for International Trade, the bill builds on a
					 process of change at EDC that has benefited from the extensive public review
					 process which took place over the past three years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step in the process was the commissioning of
					 a consultant study in 1998 undertaken by the well known law firm Gowlings. The
					 Gowlings team undertook a comprehensive study of the Export Development Act as
					 well as the corporation that the EDC governs. Gowlings also assessed Canada's
					 export plans and needs within the international policy environment including
					 extensive stakeholder consultations as well as detailed surveys and independent
					 research.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gowlings found that EDC enjoyed a very positive
					 reputation in the Canadian export community. EDC is highly regarded as a
					 Canadian success story by both its customers and its competitors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDC has gone out of its way in recent times to widely
					 survey its clients. There is a tremendous level of satisfaction with the
					 service that it delivers. I frequently hear from constituents and major
					 companies in my riding about how important is the help and work of EDC.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cite General Motors Defence of London, Ontario, as a
					 good example. It is very appreciative of the efforts of EDC in the export work
					 that it does. Some 80% of General Motors sales are in the export market.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gowlings report also raised concerns. It said that
					 EDC's project financing decisions might not give proper regard to the potential
					 environment in human rights impacts in other countries. Among Gowlings'
					 recommendations were proposals to improve accountability on environmental and
					 human rights matters.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gowlings report was tabled in parliament in July
					 1999 and referred to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and
					 International Trade, or SCFAIT, as well as to the Senate banking committee.
					 Both committees held hearings, heard from witnesses and produced reports for
					 the government's consideration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senate banking committee focused on the
					 relationship between EDC and other Canadian financial institutions. The
					 committee's report recommended a form of private export credit guarantee that
					 is now being studied. SCFAIT's review was more wide ranging. Through a series
					 of hearings and round tables a broad range of advocates from both business and
					 public interest groups as well as many other experts were heard from. Many
					 written submissions were also received by the committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his report to parliament SCFAIT's chair noted the
					 challenge of addressing and balancing two sets of public policy objectives
					 through EDC. On the one hand he said EDC must be open and accountable so that
					 Canadians can ensure that it reflects their values in its dealings with other
					 countries. On the other hand Canadian exporters must have continued access to
					 the kind of financial services that are vital to their competitive position
					 internationally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SCFAIT report offered recommendations to achieve
					 this balance. An overarching recommendation was a proposal to amend the Export
					 Development Act so that EDC supported activities would deliver both economic
					 benefits to Canadians as well as meet Canada's international commitments and
					 obligations, particularly those related to environmentally sustainable
					 development and human rights.</p>


	<A NAME="T1325"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1325"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1325)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-31 follows up on the spirit of that key
					 recommendation. The Auditor General for Canada has also provided advice on EDC
					 that the government has found helpful and that is relevant to the bill before
					 us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, in response to a request from the
					 government, the auditor general studied the environmental review framework that
					 EDC had introduced earlier. EDC brought in its own environmental review process
					 in 1999 but public concerns had been raised about its rigor and clarity. The
					 government wanted the auditor general to examine the suitability of EDC's
					 environmental review framework and to assess its performance in implementing
					 it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditor general delivered her report in May of this
					 year. She concluded that EDC's environmental framework contained “most elements
					 of a suitably designed environmental review process”. This was a useful
					 finding. It indicated that EDC was on the right track with its approach to
					 environmental review. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the auditor general also identified a
					 shortcoming when she cited a significant difference between the design of EDC's
					 environmental framework and its operation. Although she concluded EDC was on
					 the right track with its approach to environmental review, she also signalled
					 that its operating policies and procedures needed to be improved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following on this report, the Minister for
					 International Trade provided a clear set of guidelines to the corporation for
					 the management of its environmental review practices. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDC has taken to heart the advice it has received and
					 is currently engaged in wide public consultations aimed at strengthening its
					 environmental review framework. In a related move, the corporation is also
					 bringing in a new disclosure policy as a follow up to stakeholder
					 consultations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that the debate on whether or
					 not an environmental review of EDC projects is needed is over. Everyone feels
					 that it is needed. Representatives of both the business sector and public
					 interest groups agree on the need for environmental review. With this bill, the
					 government is using the Export Development Act to provide a statutory basis for
					 an environmental review process at EDC. The next step is for the corporation's
					 board of directors to develop a directive to make the objectives and the
					 expectations of the review process clear and workable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDC is now at work to develop a more rigorous
					 environmental review process, one that will meet both economic and social
					 responsibility objectives and one that will have the force of law as proposed
					 by the bill. This move to a statutory requirement for the environmental review
					 of EDC projects is a significant step forward by Canada on the world
					 stage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of other countries, notably OECD member
					 countries, are now looking at measures that would require their national export
					 credit agencies to carry out environmental reviews of projects being considered
					 for support. With this bill, Canada will be among the first to make
					 environmental review of such projects a matter of law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the statutory approach presented in
					 Bill C-31 does not put Canada out of step with emerging trends and developments
					 in other countries. For example, some Canadian public interest groups have
					 argued in favour of bringing EDC's environmental review activities under the
					 authority of Canada's Environmental Assessment Act. However this approach would
					 be inconsistent with developments that are underway elsewhere within the
					 international community, including in the OECD, where most of our export market
					 competitors are found.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the bill positions Canada as a leader
					 in the international move to higher standards for the environmental review of
					 export agency finance projects. However, it does it in a way that will not put
					 Canadian businesses at a competitive disadvantage to exporters from other
					 countries. This is a key point. It is a further illustration of the need to
					 find a realistic and practical approach to balanced change at EDC.</p>


	<A NAME="T1330"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1330)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also proposes some administrative amendments
					 to the existing act. For example, the bill proposes a change in the
					 corporation's legal name to Export Development Canada in English and
					 Exportation et Développement Canada in French. This means the acronym EDC will
					 be the same in both of our official languages.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change simply reflects the reality of everyday
					 business usage by EDC's clients. It will also allow the corporation to build on
					 its very positive EDC brand name in Canada and abroad. I might add that by
					 having the name of our nation, Canada, in its title, it obviously would play
					 very successfully on the tremendous goodwill throughout the international
					 community that we as Canadians experience every time we travel anywhere in the
					 world. I know Canadians from all walks of life share that
					 experience.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other changes include: an amendment to enable the board
					 to delegate powers and duties to committees that it may establish. This
					 reflects modern business management practice and is consistent with practices
					 followed elsewhere in both the public and private sectors. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amendment to exempt EDC's activities from the
					 provisions of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. This amendment is
					 included to avoid the potential for duplicate environmental reviews in cases
					 when EDC may be involved in partnership with another organization that is
					 subject to CEAA. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amendment to enable the EDC board to establish a
					 pension plan for officers and employees of the corporation. This amendment
					 speaks for itself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I want to comment on the amendment that would
					 require the auditor general to audit the design and implementation of EDC's
					 environmental review process at least once every five years. This too is a key
					 measure. It ensures that EDC will remain publicly accountable for its
					 environmental review performance. I also note that the Minister for
					 International Trade has asked the auditor general if her first audit could take
					 place after only two years. This is not required but the minister has been very
					 proactive in putting forward this proposal, and should be applauded for it. It
					 shows how seriously the minister and the government view this entire initiative
					 in showing environmental accountability.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to require EDC's board to establish a
					 directive to determine whether a proposed project is likely to have adverse
					 environmental effects should be welcome news for those who want legal force for
					 environmental review at EDC.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to require the auditor general to audit
					 the design and implementation of that review process should be good news too.
					 It means that EDC's environmental review performance will remain subject to the
					 scrutiny of the auditor general, an officer of parliament who is independent of
					 the board, or for that matter of the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, EDC is a vital part of Canada's export
					 development efforts. Businesses, large and small, all across Canada depend upon
					 the corporation to provide the financial services they need to be successful in
					 the intensely competitive international marketplace. I have cited already the
					 example brought to me repeatedly by my friends at General Motors Defense in
					 London, Ontario. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, as a crown corporation, EDC must
					 reflect Canadian values in its policies and operations. Environmental review is
					 an essential aspect of that. The bill would provide statutory force to this key
					 area of corporate social responsibility.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, there are three basic reasons why the House
					 should support the bill. It facilitates the continuing process of change toward
					 a stronger and more effective EDC. It brings the force of law to the
					 environmental review of EDC projects. It ensures that the auditor general, on
					 behalf of the Canadian public, will continue to monitor and report on EDC and
					 its environmental review performance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge all my colleagues in the House to support
					 the legislation.</p>

					 other acts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary explained the government's
					 side of the story. Now I have the opportunity to explain the story from the
					 opposition's point of view. However, before I do that, for the folks who are
					 watching and listening to the debate I would like to give a brief
					 background.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation governing EDC, Export Development
					 Corporation, requires ministerial review of the act. A review commenced in 1998
					 concluded with a report by a law firm. The report was reviewed and reported by
					 the Standing Committee of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. The result
					 of that report is the amendment to Bill C-31 which is what we are debating
					 today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the bill is of a housekeeping nature and
					 simply updates the act. If passed it will enable the board to delegate its
					 powers. It will require the EDC to establish a pension plan for its employees.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The treasury board policy encourages crown corporations
					 to arrange comprehensive, independent pension plans for their employees.
					 However CPP, one of the key pension plans managed by the federal government, is
					 the worst managed pension plan. It has been earning even less than the interest
					 on a savings account. Its surplus funds were grabbed by the Liberal government
					 and the chief actuary of the CPP was fired for being forthright and not
					 yielding to the Liberals' pressure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to these amendments, there were no legislative
					 environmental review requirements of the EDC. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the bill is passed, it will require the EDC to
					 determine if a project is likely to have adverse environmental effects and
					 whether it would be justified for the EDC to enter into a
					 transaction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous speaker talked about the environment. The
					 Canadian Environmental Assessment Act will not apply to the EDC's reviews, so
					 that Canadian environment standards and laws are not imposed on other sovereign
					 nations. How can we do that? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of the substantive environmental
					 amendment is to strike a balance between trade competitiveness and concern for
					 the potential environmental impacts of projects supported by the
					 EDC.</p>

	The auditor general recommended that most international
					 financial institutions, including export credit agencies, have environmental
					 policies and procedures. A consensus emerged on the elements of good practice
					 that an international financial institution should adopt, to ensure that the
					 projects it supports are environmentally and socially responsible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrialized G-8 and OECD countries developed common
					 environmental guidelines for export credit agencies. Some of the guidelines
					 include: To strengthen EDC's environmental review process, EDC needs to make
					 changes in both the design and operation of the framework; to close the gaps in
					 the framework's design, the EDC should focus on enhancing transparency through
					 public consultation and disclosure; and, to strengthen the framework's
					 implementation, the EDC should concentrate on the tools that identify
					 environmental risks in the screening process and on monitoring to ensure that
					 the framework is operating efficiently and effectively.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me point out that my constituents and I, and
					 members on this side of the House, are for the protection of the environment.
					 Canadian Alliance policy supports sustainable development
					 initiatives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would venture to say that on all sides of the House,
					 members want to protect the environment and work on projects related to
					 greenhouse gas reductions and improved air and water quality so that we can
					 hand over the plant to future generations in a better condition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as a government, the Liberals have mismanaged
					 our environment and have failed to provide sustainable development.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have signed international treaties, including
					 Kyoto, Beijing and Rio, for example, with no intentions whatsoever of carrying
					 out their commitments. They made those commitments without consulting
					 Canadians, parliament and the provinces. They have failed to provide these
					 commitments with the scientific support they required to be attained. They made
					 political decisions about matters that required scientific decisions. They made
					 decisions not based on scientific facts or on what Canadians can do and want
					 but just for political intervention or motives. They have allowed the
					 endangered species legislation to die on the order paper of the House
					 twice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem with the bill is that EDC is being used
					 more by the Liberal government for political favours than other crown
					 corporations and agencies,such as CIDA, HRDC, Western Economic Diversification,
					 ACOA and many others. These agencies should not be used for political purposes.
					 They should cater to the needs of Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are rampant patronage appointments in crown
					 corporations. Most recently, Mr. Bernard Boudreau, a short term senator and
					 cabinet member, who ran unsuccessfully to become a Liberal MP, was appointed to
					 the board of the EDC. The bill does not address the issue of patronage
					 appointments at all. The practice should end. Those appointments should be
					 based on merit, not on who is a friend of the Liberals. They have been giving
					 those positions to friends and failed election candidates who were rejected by
					 Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance recognizes the essential part
					 financial institutions play in the everyday lives of Canadians. We will protect
					 the best interests of consumers by fostering competition and ensuring that the
					 financial services sector is adequately regulated, without impairing stability
					 or opportunity for success and growth in these institutions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the services provided by the EDC, such as short
					 and medium term export insurance and financing, should be privatized. The rest
					 of the EDC would have to become a division of DFAIT, the Department of Foreign
					 Affairs and International Trade, and be directly accountable to parliament.
					 This division could provide occasional loan guarantees and other services which
					 are beyond the scope of private sector, such as long term insurance, political
					 risk reassurance and projects that are not commercially viable but may be
					 deemed to be in the interest of the nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that the organization can get involved in
					 those areas but not to provide political favours for the weak, arrogant,
					 Liberal government's friends.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1991 the United Kingdom privatized its equivalent
					 export agency, called export credits guarantee department, to ensure that there
					 were no implied trade subsidies in the EU from one country to another. The
					 United Kingdom government provided the political risk reassurance to the
					 private company which took over the ECGD.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To serve the exporters better, there should be true
					 competition in the export and financing business. They should have free market
					 and competition. That is what the government should encourage. They should have
					 the opportunity to directly deal with their own banks or insurance brokers to
					 have their exports financed and insured. That is what businesses need. If the
					 banks got into the business, exporters may receive 100% financing in addition
					 to speedier and personalized efficient services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the bill does not address the concerns
					 that I have just highlighted. I ask the government to address these issues and
					 make appropriate amendments to the act. Otherwise, I will be left with no
					 choice but to vote against the bill. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members on this side of the House recognize that while
					 the EDC enjoys a high level of support in certain segments of the business
					 community, it is being used by the Liberal government for political purposes,
					 including recent television advertising.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should and we must oppose the bill due to the lack
					 of action on the patronage aspect alone, among the other things I mentioned.
					 Therefore, I will oppose the bill.</p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, such a bill would have made it possible to
					 support and implement several recommendations from the Standing Committee on
					 Foreign Affairs and International Trade but my speech will show how this bill
					 has sidestepped the question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Export Development Corporation is a crown
					 corporation, with special status. It is not subject to the Access to
					 Information Act nor to the Environmental Assessment Act. This could have
					 afforded an opportunity to apply it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not regulated by the Office of the Superintendent
					 of Financial Institutions. It pays no income tax. It is not required to pay
					 dividends and may borrow at preferential rates because of the credit enjoyed by
					 the Government of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this bill all about? What can be seen first,
					 and is immediately obvious, is that there is an environmental problem. This
					 bill is trying to establish an environmental frame of reference that is created
					 by the EDC itself, by its managers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had the option of including the Environmental
					 Assessment Act. The government sidestepped an opportunity to do something very
					 simple and to establish criteria and not so-called international standards set
					 by leaders based on things that do or do not exist. We could have had really
					 well established criteria.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditor general was given the mandate to assess the
					 environmental frames of reference of the EDC. During this assessment, 25
					 projects were considered. Of these, 23 were badly done or had not anticipated
					 their impact on the environmental process. Later, I will give examples relating
					 to these projects.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the first report criticized, which we
					 looked at in committee in 1999. At that time, following meetings between the
					 various parties in committee, we said this corporation was not transparent,
					 open or accountable to the people of Canada and Quebec. In addition, there had
					 been sustainable environmental development, which we will see more precisely
					 during the course of my speech on this bill later and this
					 afternoon.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there was reference to human rights. We
					 see no sign of them in the bill. What should we think of a corporation that has
					 as its objective to fund exports and to help companies without regard for human
					 rights? There are a number of places on earth where there are problems with
					 this issue. There may be very specific places where there are human rights
					 problems. Why did the government not comply with our international commitments
					 on this? </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill does not even make any mention of this issue.
					 Yet, that was one of the committee's recommendations in its conclusions. The
					 auditor general, who tabled her report in May 2001, also referred to this
					 issue. Here are some of the elements included in the conclusions and
					 recommendations of that report:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>There are important gaps in public
						  consultation and disclosure. There are significant differences between the
						  framework's design and its operation. The framework's objectives are not clear.
						  The framework's environmental standards are not specified.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>There are gaps at each stage of the
						  environmental review process. Screening tools are not applied adequately to
						  identify potential environmental risk. There is no methodology to determine if
						  adverse environmental risks can be justified.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report of the auditor general tabled in May 2001
					 highlights some very important elements, particularly as regards transparency,
					 disclosure, the environment and, of course, human rights. If we look at the
					 environment, what is the framework? The objective would be to have specific
					 criteria or standards to apply.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the framework, the auditor general says that
					 there is none, which creates a grey area. Why? Because instead of having a
					 framework based on an act such as the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act,
					 instead of having criteria to conduct impact studies and develop processes from
					 the beginning before approving a financial project, so far we have relied on a
					 review by the host country. As we know, there are a number of host countries
					 whose environmental standards or criteria are really lower than those in Quebec
					 and in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have no methodology, no implementation criteria,
					 what are our chances of getting something reliable? Let us not forget that the
					 lack of disclosure and transparency raises the following question: Is the EDC
					 truly credible? Is it doing its homework properly? If we cannot have access to
					 this information under the Access to Information Act, as we know—</p>

					 the house is completely restored the volunteers will have raised over $350,000
					 privately. They will have spent many thousands of hours working to preserve the

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding of Tobique--Mactaquac which borders the

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks the
					 open character of our border has been called into question. Maintaining a
					 balance between our security and our economy is vital. Effective border
					 management cannot be achieved in isolation. We need joint initiatives to
					 encourage the flow of people and goods across the border while at the same time
					 protecting public health and safety. Simply put, we need to build bridges, not
					 walls, between our two countries.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the United Nations declared the first
					 Monday in October World Habitat Day, an opportunity to reflect on our
					 communities and their importance in our lives. This year's theme “Cities
					 without Slums” offers people everywhere the opportunity to examine the current
					 state of their cities and to think of ways to make them safer, healthier and
					 more sustainable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are lucky to be among the best housed people
					 in the world. This enviable situation is due in large part to the efforts of
					 organizations such as the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation and its
					 different partners.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working closely with industry, government and
					 non-governmental organizations, as well as local community groups, CMHC strives
					 to foster the development of affordable housing within safe, healthy and
					 sustainable communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage all members and all Canadians to join the
					 United Nations in celebrating World Habitat Day, October 1, 2001.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of the calibre of your work that
					 Quebecers continue to watch their own channels, the ones which draw them in,
					 the ones which reflect their image and their vision of the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its seven million inhabitants, Quebec has reason

					 the community on a foundation of co-operation; determination to rise above the
					 petty differences that divide and focus on the values that unite; and, above
					 all else, determination to join with the world to defeat terrorism and to
					 ensure that no other community must endure such pain. We are with them.

	Mr. Speaker, the objective of the breast cancer

					 around them concerning the disease of breast cancer. The Canadian Cancer
					 Society and the Quebec Cancer Foundation are using the month of October to
					 remind women of the importance of screening.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the type of cancer that affects the largest

					 China. According to the latest statistics, 19,300 women are at risk of
					 developing the disease in the next year, and 5,300 of them will die of it.
					 Since 1991, the death rate for breast cancer has dropped by 6.3% in Quebec,
					 thanks to the effectiveness of treatments and the distribution of information
					 on early breast cancer detection techniques.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this eighth edition of Breast Cancer Month, I
					 encourage everyone to wear the pink ribbon or the lapel pin that symbolizes
					 hope, and ultimately victory, over this disease. </p>

					 particular Ken Dryden, president of the Toronto Maple Leafs, whose high profile
					 support will raise awareness of the tragic child abuse incidents at Maple Leaf

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout October the monument will be on display at

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed consideration of the motion that
				Bill C-31, an act to amend the Export Development Act and to make
				consequential amendments to other acts, be now read the second time
				and referred to a committee.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-53662"></A><a HREF="#Int-53680"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-53656"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Robert Lanctôt (Châteauguay,
					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, before statements by members and oral
					 question period, we were talking about EDC's environmental terms of reference.
					 As I mentioned earlier, the auditor general said that environmental standards
					 were missing from the terms of reference and that the terms themselves were not
					 clear. I also said that this framework was vague and timid. Of course, EDC sets
					 no objective for this environmental assessment, which is to ensure that the
					 projects approved are respectful of the environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999 the committee passed on to EDC the concerns
					 that had been raised and told it that it was vital that the environmental terms
					 of reference contain well established criteria and standards. The auditor
					 general also said that there must be standards and criteria. All the government
					 has done is to make it clear that it will not enforce the Canadian
					 Environmental Assessment Act. Once again, it is being left up to the crown
					 corporation, in other words, to its directors, to determine what those
					 standards and criteria will be. When the government says it amended this bill,
					 that is so much nonsense. EDC still has responsibility. As I mentioned earlier,
					 there is a lack of transparency. The same old people will still be doing the
					 same old things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the bill states, quite simply, is that we need to
					 look at the environmental aspects. This is the only statement made, with no
					 specification on what is important, namely to establish criteria and standards
					 solidly based on existing legislation. It would have been so easy just to apply
					 the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditor general has also referred to the sloppiness
					 in projects. Out of 25 analyzed and examined by her, 23 had their environmental
					 impact poorly assessed, if at all. On examination, we realize that it is not
					 because a project is being carried out in a short period that its object is
					 viable from the environmental point of view. Why? Because right from the start
					 the agency eliminated two-thirds of projects when providing insurance or loans,
					 saying that there was no risk, fewer problems because they were financing the
					 credit and wanted to be sure they would be repaid. There is, therefore, no
					 impact study. There is no study to see what environmental standards and
					 criteria there can be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDC always comes back to this test of influence. The
					 purpose of this is to determine whether it can exercise any influence to reduce
					 the risks posed by a project. It carries out a detailed environmental
					 examination of a project only when it determines that risk and influence are
					 factors. One can imagine that it is not because a project is located outside
					 our country that it will have no impact on the environment or that we will be
					 reimbursed. It is not because the deadline is short that there will be no
					 impact on the environment, on the contrary. Each case should be evaluated not
					 according to its duration but according to whether it has an environmental
					 impact.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the 23 out of 25 projects poorly assessed or
					 unassessed, I believe it is clear that the EDC's internal methods are greatly
					 lacking. There was no method for determining whether the harmful environmental
					 impacts could be justified.</p>


	<A NAME="T1510"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1510"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1515"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1505"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1510)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government missed a fine opportunity to make a more
					 transparent bill with real environmental standards. We know very well nothing
					 has changed. They included this reference in the bill, however the focus must
					 be on standards and criteria to be sure they are specified. This will enable
					 the directors to set a course of conduct that takes the environment into
					 account.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the release of information, there is another
					 important matter and that is the lack of transparency. This is so important
					 that I will provide a few examples of projects.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the Antamina mine in Peru, which will level
					 for ever more eight peaks of the highest mountain range. The inhabitants
					 complained to the World Bank about the environmental risks posed by the mine,
					 insufficient compensatory measures and the displacement of people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Profertil fertilizer complex in Argentine has been
					 closed twice because of ammonia leaks. Residents are concerned about the
					 dangers created by the transportation and storage of chemicals and by dumping
					 into the ocean.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another example. The Bulyanhulu mine in
					 Tanzania has evicted thousands of small operation miners, who had their own
					 piece of land. Environmentalists are concerned about potential heavy metal and
					 cyanide contamination. Amnesty International has reported that miners were
					 killed in the implementation of the eviction measures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government talks of transparency and of the
					 environment. We must be totally informed in the case of a project such as this
					 before funds are granted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EDC works with the information at hand. It takes
					 the information provided by the promoter and what it has itself. This is not
					 enough. They must go much further. Environmental criteria and transparency are
					 essential.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for transparency, how is a funding project prepared?
					 Before funding is granted, the projects absolutely must be examined. Studies
					 have to be done. Each project must be studied, not according to its length, but
					 over all, with the accent on environmental effects.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this lack of transparency and the fact that
					 the Access to Information Act cannot be used leave us rather perplexed about
					 the decisions that can be made.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not told in Quebec and Canada which projects
					 were involved and how much money was provided.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that this crown corporation is self-financed.
					 However, we do an enormous amount of work at the international level. For this
					 reason, words alone are not enough when it comes to the criteria raised by the
					 committee and the auditor general, which include transparency, disclosure and
					 protection of the environment. They must translate into action. We need to be
					 seen as a country and as a people for whom the environment is important. We
					 must promote environmental protection.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same can be said for human rights, an issue raised
					 before the committee in 1999. We said how terrible it would be if we ignored
					 them, and yet, that is what we are doing.</p>


	<A NAME="T1515"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1510"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1515)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to have this assurance around the world, and
					 state what is important before the EDC invests in expansion. We cannot, when
					 outside of the country, close our eyes and lower our standards because we are
					 only required to obey the host country's laws and regulations. We have our own
					 law. We have the opportunity to raise standards, and we are not doing
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I firmly believe that the reason the Bloc Quebecois
					 expressed serious reservations regarding the EDC and human rights is that there
					 is something missing. There is something missing from the bill, but there was
					 something missing before, and it is still missing now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though in its assessment of the political risks
					 the EDC does not take into account the human rights situation, the issue should
					 not be dealt with merely through discussions. We did that in committee and we
					 stressed this aspect, but it is not provided in the legislation. How can we be
					 taken seriously if we show that we do not even comply with the international
					 agreements signed by Canada? This is not provided at a time when we have the
					 opportunity to do so in a bill as important as this one. We help our exporters,
					 but we forget really important things like this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois feels that this bill is too weak
					 from an environmental point of view. It provides no guarantee of an effective
					 environmental assessment and it leaves too much leeway to the EDC in the
					 determination of the criteria to be complied with. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is silent on disclosure. It would have been very
					 easy to provide for the disclosure of information, but clause 12 of the bill
					 excludes the possibility of using that provision of the Access to Information
					 Act. I should point out that a crown corporation is not subject to the Access
					 to Information Act. This should be noted because it has not been
					 mentioned.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now want to get back to clause 12. It refers to the
					 Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. Again, that act was excluded. While it
					 is true that a crown corporation is not subject to this legislation, this was
					 reinforced by saying that we do not want to use it. Yet, this would have been
					 the legislation to use. We want to implement it in Canada. Why, when we provide
					 funding, when we give money or assurances, should we not apply our own
					 criteria? However we are not doing it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the bill does not include punitive provisions
					 should the EDC not respect its environmental framework. In this regard, Quebec
					 imposes fines and even jail terms on officials who are found guilty of
					 negligence in environmental matters. This is an important step by Quebec. Why
					 not do the same, particularly when we are trying to do something at the
					 international level, to show that Quebec and Canada care about the environment?
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, we are watering down environmental
					 standards by not making sure that projects comply with more than just the
					 standards of host countries. Again, this was a perfect opportunity to show that
					 when we want a bill like this one, we should not give priority only to trade
					 and international issues, but also to the environment. We must stop watering
					 down our requirements. We must use our own standards and criteria, instead of
					 those of host countries, and we must stop yielding to the will of EDC
					 officials. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned, this bill also excludes any possibility
					 of making the EDC subject to section 12 of the Canadian Environmental
					 Assessment Act. All this undermines the EDC's credibility.</p>


	<A NAME="T1520"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1520"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1515"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1520)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill could have been used to make the EDC much more
					 credible, not just for Quebecers and Canadians, but for all those who are going
					 to do business with a Canadian crown corporation with criteria and standards
					 and an openmindedness, not just a blind openmindedness, not just trade or the
					 economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, I heard the parliamentary secretary say here
					 in the House that the exporters who do business with us are happy. I am happy
					 that exporters are happy, but this is not just about exporters.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason this amendment to the Canadian Environmental
					 Assessment Act was proposed is that some people were a little less happy. I am
					 talking about the environmental groups who brought pressure to bear, who took
					 action and who obtained figures, information and statistics. They brought to
					 light such important factors that finally there was an opportunity to make all
					 this applicable, with criteria, specific standards, and also, I believe, the
					 possibility of transparency at last. The government passed it up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government would rather not talk about cases such
					 as those I mentioned earlier, in Tunisia and in Argentina. There is an
					 international impact when eight mountains, one of the great chains in the
					 world, are being levelled through the auspices of the EDC. We are taking part
					 in this. I find it somewhat embarrassing. There was an excellent opportunity to
					 do something about situations such as this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an excellent opportunity to use the Canadian
					 Environmental Assessment Act. One of the features of this act is that only
					 federal authorities are subject to environmental assessment. The federal
					 government is therefore the promoter of whole projects or parts of projects and
					 must therefore do an environmental assessment. Help for a project may take the
					 form of funding, a loan guarantee, or financial aid. This is basically what the
					 EDC does, but it does it outside the country for exporters. This bill could
					 therefore have been amended or regulations included to specify environmental
					 criteria or standards to be used.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are told that, with international standards,
					 the EDC can say “We will have this or that standard in this or that country”, I
					 believe this was the opportunity to do the exact opposite and say “We are not
					 going to lower our standards”. For us, that is important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we, the countries of North America, do not specify
					 what our standards are throughout the world, and what significance we wish to
					 attach to them, it is easy to imagine what sort of image of us this projects.
					 We are said to have a Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, that we carry out
					 impact studies, as soon as a project comes under federal jurisdiction, yet
					 outside the country we do not apply the same standards.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People elsewhere, who are not familiar with Canada's
					 laws and regulations, say to themselves “They keep on talking about the
					 importance of the environment, they go to the UN, they go everywhere. That is
					 what they say, but they do not do it”. That is the image we are giving to the
					 public, including the people of Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet with the Canadian legislation and Quebec's
					 environmental assessment legislation and office for public hearings, we are
					 ahead of the others. Our legislation is far stricter because we can even send
					 heads of companies to jail for harming the environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know about it therefore, we Quebecers with our
					 legislation, and Canadians with theirs. Yet imagine what image we project
					 outside the country.</p>


	<A NAME="T1525"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1525)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say anything, because they do not think the laws
					 here are as stringent and because we do not apply them
					 internationally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that without such standards, given that we
					 cannot strive to achieve the final results attainable with these projects,
					 because the Access to Information Act cannot be used, after this amendment to
					 the act, be sure what they do outside? How much are they giving all these
					 exporters? This is a large corporation, which must show people outside the
					 country who Quebecers and Canadians are.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exporters must use the corporation to show who we are.
					 Something more than mere financing must to be involved. Even the World Bank
					 does impact studies when it grants a loan. Why would the EDC not follow its
					 example? These are the questions we have. This does not drop out of the sky or
					 from today's debate. It comes from committee and the auditor general. Requests
					 are made.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cannot say they did not know. What is the point of
					 leaving it up to the directors of the EDC? I ask the question because it
					 intrigues me.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a good opportunity to get things right with a
					 crown corporation that grants loans. This crown corporation has a certain
					 reputation, thanks to advertising, however, it should reveal exactly everything
					 that it does. I am sure that some who are listening to us wonder what the EDC
					 does. What is it, what does it do? Not all of our fellow citizens know exactly
					 what the EDC does.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not know what it can do, because it only provides
					 us with the information it wants us to have. Here was an opportunity to include
					 the Access to Information Act in order to verify what is being done with this
					 money. Here was a chance to see how we were perceived abroad, how many projects
					 were finished, how many succeed and which ones did not succeed. Do we get back
					 more than we put in? Surely, because in the end, there is a profit. I think the
					 assets have reached some two billion dollars.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a lot of money. It would enable Quebec
					 exporters to promote their projects. How many projects have there been from
					 Quebec? This request was made of the EDC. They refused to provide the
					 information. They refused to say how many projects the EDC had given. They have
					 refused this and we cannot invoke the Access to Information Act. If we had this
					 information, we could show people that we could find out exactly what the EDC
					 does. We would have known what kind of projects it gets involved in and if it
					 really respects the environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was referring to the influence test. Nor is there is
					 any guarantee that it has been abandoned.</p>


	<A NAME="T1530"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1530)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something that is done by EDC officials. The
					 impact may be minimal, average or significant. The possibility of influencing a
					 project is assessed. They can say “Make it a little more acceptable”, but these
					 people are not experts. They base their decisions on standards that are, again,
					 set in other countries which often have standards and criteria less strict than
					 ours. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintaining such a test of influence makes the whole
					 process arbitrary. It is indeed very arbitrary. We could have a specific
					 framework, but it is not the case. We have no specific criteria and standards.
					 Because we cannot know since we do not have access to them I wonder whether the
					 criteria are the same from one country to the next or from one project to the
					 next. Could we even use them beyond what is allowed, by awarding contracts to
					 people whom we know, for example, or by subjecting an exporter to criteria not
					 as strict as others so as to favour him? We do not know. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transparency that was supposed to be introduced
					 just is not there. Yet, the government gave the following response to the
					 committee's report, in June 2001: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>As Canada's public export funding
						  organization, the EDC has an obligation to conduct its activities in a manner
						  that benefits Canada and it must fulfill Canada's international commitments.
						  </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we are talking about human rights and environmental
					 rights. </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The government recognizes that the
						  information currently being disclosed by the EDC is in a very compact form, but
						  it admits that the corporation has made a lot of progress in the communication
						  of information.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the government see this? We cannot use the
					 Access to Information Act. When we make direct requests, we are denied the
					 information.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its response given on June 26, 2001, the government
					 said the following: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The government also endorses the view
						  that the EDC should consider setting up a position of ombudsman. The ombudsman
						  would deal with issues of accountability, fulfillment of obligations and access
						  to information. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read the bill. There is no mention of this. This
					 comes from a response to the committee's report. The response was dated June
					 26, 2001, but this is nowhere to be found in the bill. The Export Development
					 Corporation was chosen because it was a crown corporation and reflects Canadian
					 environmental values in its overseas projects. I will not repeat everything I
					 just said, but the government wants to see Canadian values reflected abroad,
					 and is not even using the standards and criteria in the legislation we already
					 have. It is left entirely up to the directors, and the approach taken for each
					 project is probably different.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government responded as follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>It undertakes, within twelve months,
						  to give the environmental assessment process legislative force. The options are
						  to include a provision concerning the terms of reference in the Canadian
						  Environmental Assessment Act, or to include regulations concerning the EDC in
						  the act.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it truly had a choice, all it had to do was use the
					 Canadian Environmental Assessment Act and then, through regulatory amendments,
					 do what had to be done. It failed to do so. There is nothing in the
					 bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we were told:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The government agrees that
						  environmental assessments should be made public early in the project funding
						  approval process.</small></td>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate

					 member for the Bloc Quebecois has, opposition to this bill for certain
					 reasons.</p>


	<A NAME="T1540"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1540"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1540)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a good opportunity for us to talk about the broad
					 issues of international trade and human rights in the context of the bill. I
					 want to put on record the concerns of the New Democratic Party with respect to
					 Bill C-31 and to explain why we are opposed to it. We also have some
					 recommendations on how to improve the legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague from the Bloc who just spoke indicated,
					 Bill C-31 has missed the mark. We have an opportunity before us today to
					 address some very significant issues with respect to the environment and human
					 rights from an international perspective, and an opportunity to convey and
					 carry forward our sentiments and values to the international scene. We have
					 failed to do that in the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government failed to heed the recommendations of a
					 number of organizations and members of parliament who have pressed hard for a
					 strong piece of legislation in this regard. It is by all accounts a weak bill
					 and a missed opportunity in terms of international trade. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time and time again in the House and outside the House
					 it has been said that we have an opportunity now before us with the bill to
					 develop and pursue Canadian trade in a manner consistent with Canada's
					 obligations to protect the environment and human rights. That seems to be the
					 essence of the task at hand and the very purpose of the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is legislation that has been reviewed for three
					 years. It was intended to address major concerns with respect to Canada's role
					 in trade on the international scene. It was to ensure consistency with trade
					 and our need to deal on an economic basis with other nations vis-à-vis our
					 longstanding traditions and commitments with respect to human rights and the
					 environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is also partly in response to recommendations
					 made by the auditor general in May 2001 and should be seen from the perspective
					 of whether or not it meets the test of answering the criticisms of the auditor
					 general made at that time. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard from many speakers today about the
					 weaknesses of the bill. I will reiterate some of those from the perspective of
					 the New Democratic Party. Our criticisms are best summed up by a statement
					 issued a week or so ago by a coalition of organizations that has been
					 monitoring the legislation over a period of time and has developed considerable
					 expertise in the area. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am referring to the coalition of 17 non-governmental
					 organizations that proposed some very significant suggestions around the Export
					 Development Act and that today are expressing grave concerns about the failure
					 of the bill to take into account those concerns and those
					 suggestions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 21 the coalition of NGOs reacted with very
					 grave concern and disappointment that the concerns it had put forward regarding
					 Bill C-31 were not taken into account. The coalition co-ordinator of the NGO
					 working group, Émilie Revil, said: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small> We need to amend the Act to make
						  sure the Export Development Corporation upholds Canada's commitments to protect
						  the environment, human rights and the public right to basic information. The
						  changes presented yesterday will have negligible impact on the daily operations
						  of the Corporation. They leave a proven bad driver behind the
						  wheel.</small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That says it all in terms of the expectations around
					 the bill and why it falls short in terms of obligations and responsibilities.
					 It was an opportune moment to address those very concerns. There were
					 suggestions made about how that could have been done. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not too late to do just that. There are changes
					 that could be made to the bill to address those concerns and show good faith
					 with respect to the community that has been working so long and hard on good
					 legislation. Canada must continue to play a leadership role when it comes to
					 international trade and to our export development corporation. We must ensure
					 that we are always mindful and respectful of our obligations to preserve and
					 protect the environment and to enhance and uphold human rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three areas that the NGO community recognized as
					 shortcomings in the bill are the same as those enunciated by hon. members from
					 the Bloc and ones that the New Democratic Party also feels strongly about.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first concern is with respect to the environment
					 and whether the bill actually has a meaningful mechanism in place to carry out
					 proper environmental assessments of any projects undertaken by the Export
					 Development Corporation. The answer by all accounts is no. The bill does the
					 opposite of what one would expect to be a reasonable course of action in terms
					 of ensuring an independent environmental assessment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It proposes to keep it as an in house function of the
					 Export Development Corporation as opposed to making it subject to a complete
					 review under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. That is a fundamental
					 point in the debate and there is no reasonable explanation of why the bill does
					 not ensure that path is followed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is absolutely no question about the need for
					 Canada and for the Export Development Corporation's environmental review
					 framework to follow this long established tradition. This framework is not new
					 or unique. It is a model that is used by other jurisdictions. I think
					 specifically of the export credit institutions in the United States and Japan
					 which follow the idea of an environmental review based on an independent
					 environmental analysis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of how Canada pursues the path of
					 environmental protection in terms of all activities by the EDC is critical and
					 needs to be addressed by the government through the bill. That was one of the
					 concerns raised by the auditor general in his report of May 2001. It behoves us
					 to try to incorporate that constructive criticism into legislation before us
					 today. The organizations that have spoken out about that point say this very
					 succinctly and clearly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NGO coalition calls for the Export Development
					 Corporation's environmental framework to be regulated under the Canadian
					 Environmental Assessment Act. It calls for the mandate of the Export
					 Development Corporation to be changed to ensure that Canada supports and
					 develops Canadian trade in a manner consistent with our own standards and
					 obligations pertaining to the protection of the environment.</p>


	<A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1550)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point has to do with human rights. The
					 coalition of non-government organizations has spoken loudly and clearly on this
					 matter. Others in the House have done the same. We have done it in the Chamber
					 as recently as this past Thursday when my leader, the member for Halifax,
					 raised a question pertaining to a very serious situation known as the
					 Bulyanhulu case, which has been referenced in this debate as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serious allegations have been made in that case where
					 employees of the Kahama Mining Corporation, a subsidiary of Suttion Resources
					 which is now owned by Barrick Gold, in conjunction with the Tanzanian police,
					 buried over 50 artisanal miners by bulldozing over the entrance to the shafts
					 in which they worked.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some question around these allegations. As
					 reported in the press there are also those who refute those allegations despite
					 having reports from Amnesty International and other organizations that
					 witnessed developments in this regard. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is clear in this case is that these allegations
					 must be investigated. There needs to be a full scale independent inquiry into
					 Tanzania to determine what happened, why it happened and what our international
					 obligations are as a result of these developments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It begs the larger question of what we are doing
					 through the legislation to ensure that human rights are respected and enhanced
					 in all activities of international trade, specifically pursuant to the Export
					 Development Corporation. It has been our expectation, as I assume is the case
					 among other parliamentarians and many Canadians across the country, that the
					 bill should first and foremost stand up in terms of our role and responsibility
					 for the protection of human rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill does not take those concerns seriously and
					 does not ensure that there are mechanisms entrenched in it to provide for that
					 kind of leadership by the Canadian government to ensure that all avenues are
					 pursued in terms of human rights violations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point, which was also part of the auditor
					 general's criticism of the Export Development Corporation, pertains to
					 transparency and public disclosure. This has been a very important part of our
					 deliberations in parliament of late as more and more Canadians show a concern
					 about democratic traditions being upheld in parliament and in every legislature
					 of the land. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we take these concerns very
					 seriously and do whatever we can to ensure that the bill before us respects the
					 commitment we make to the Canadian people to be prepared at all times to be
					 fully transparent in our work and ready to disclose in a full and open way the
					 policies, practices, and programs pertaining to the Government of Canada.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absolutely clear from various analyses that Bill
					 C-31 fails to entrench the absolute maximum in terms of public disclosure.
					 Despite calls for the Export Development Corporation to be more open in its
					 decision-making process, Bill C-31 places no new requirements on EDC to
					 disclose vital information to the public. In the mid-1980s the Export
					 Development Corporation stopped releasing project related information. I
					 acknowledge that while the corporation is currently drafting its own disclosure
					 policy, potentially allowing for greater transparency, there are no changes
					 proposed under Bill C-31.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as I have mentioned with respect to the flawed
					 environmental review framework and just as I have mentioned with respect to the
					 failure to address stringent mechanisms around human rights, there is no
					 mechanism in the bill for dealing with the fundamental question of transparency
					 and public disclosure. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also no reason for the government to go slow,
					 to be hesitant in this regard. Public sentiment is with us. People want us to
					 do everything we can on this front. They want us to ensure fair public access
					 in terms of any kind of government program, crown corporation and legislation.
					 It is just a basic fundamental task for us today to try to convince the
					 government to ensure that the legislation respects that principle and to
					 require the Export Development Corporation to disclose basic information.
					 Surely that is not too much to expect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the three concerns we have. I repeat them
					 once more just by way of summarizing and by way of making a plea to the
					 government to hear these concerns and to act before this debate proceeds much
					 further.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that we have in the bill a clear mechanism
					 for independent environmental assessment so that the workings, the activities,
					 of our Export Development Corporation are consistent with the principles that
					 we all share around preserving and protecting our environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second, and again we make the strongest call
					 possible, is for an enforceable human rights review framework to be included,
					 incorporated and integrated as a part of Bill C-31. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we in the NDP call upon the government to
					 ensure increased transparency and public disclosure policies as an integral
					 part of Bill C-31. We feel that all these recommendations are supported by the
					 work of the NGO community, by the work of parliamentarians and by the report of
					 the auditor general. The evidence is there for action in those three areas. The
					 bill could be a very important, strong, leading edge piece of legislation if we
					 have the will to make those changes now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some of my colleagues said earlier, the bill tends
					 in fact to reduce our policies to the lowest common denominator in terms of
					 such basic issues as environmental preservation and protection and human rights
					 protections as well. Why do we keep doing that in this day and age? Why lower
					 our standards to the lowest common denominator? Why not instead become a world
					 leader in these areas, set the stage and raise the bar on such basic
					 fundamental issues as the environment, human rights and public disclosure? They
					 are fundamental to the values of Canadians today. They are fundamental to the
					 whole democratic process. We urge the government to consider these comments as
					 constructive criticism with the hope that changes can be made to the bill
					 before we go much further. </p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-31, an act
					 to amend the Export Development Act. The bill would change a few things. It
					 would change the name of the corporation. It would enable the board to delegate
					 its powers and duties to committees it may establish other than the executive
					 committee. It would require some environmental reviews and an environmental
					 process for projects. Also apparently the auditor general would have the
					 ability to audit the design and implementation of the directive established by
					 the board, at least once every five years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will examine these issues in more detail. First, in
					 regard to the name I do not think there is anything too serious there.
					 Basically the modification would mean that the corporation would have the same
					 acronym in both English and French. The new name would be Export Development
					 Canada, which I do not think is too earth shattering.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us move on to something more substantive, and that
					 is the Canada Account. The Export Development Corporation assists corporations
					 across the country to secure opportunities and orders abroad. Generally those
					 who apply for loan assistance through Export Development Canada need to meet
					 certain financial tests to ensure that they have the ability to repay it, if it
					 is a loan, et cetera.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Canada Account is a political account.
					 Sometimes those applying do not quite meet the test or there are other reasons.
					 I understand the necessity for it because I do believe there is a purpose for
					 it, however, all decisions on the Canada Account are based purely on politics.
					 They are cabinet decisions and are not made by industry or financial experts or
					 at arm's length. None of this is dealt with in the bill. That is something that
					 I think the government should look at. I understand that it is seldom used,
					 primarily for risky ventures. To give an example, the Candu nuclear reactors
					 were under the Canada Account.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However the account has been receiving unfavourable
					 attention in recent years. Two years ago the Canada Account was judged to be
					 illegal by the World Trade Organization. Nonetheless the government says the
					 account has been amended to satisfy the WTO concerns. It has been referred to
					 as a secret slush fund.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Export Development Corporation makes deals to the
					 tune of $4.5 billion worth of exports each year. It is a significant amount of
					 money. I suggest that we could remove political decision making from the Canada
					 Account and bring back a more accountable process. Of course that is not dealt
					 with in the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us move on to the next area. One of the suggested
					 government amendments would enable the board of directors to delegate its
					 powers and duties to committees that it may establish, other than the executive
					 committee. Right now 13 of the 15 board members are appointed by the Minister
					 for International Trade and the other two, the chairman and president, are
					 appointed by the Prime Minister. This appointed board currently formulates EDC
					 policies and practices and I find that somewhat questionable. It is an
					 unelected board, with all 15 appointments made either by the Prime Minister or
					 the Minister for International Trade, and it now wants to delegate its powers
					 and duties to more appointments, to its committees. The EDC board already has
					 incredible power and influence and it now wants to delegate that down even
					 further, so there are some questions that need to be answered.</p>


	<A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1600)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patrick Lavelle, the chairman of the EDC, called for
					 more independence for crown corporations and agencies such as the EDC, stating
					 that the objective of naming directors should be to “get the best people, no
					 matter where they come from”. Mr. Lavelle suggested that EDC move toward
					 privatization, noting that there is a culture of secrecy in government
					 bureaucracies. He stated that there is “an inherent believability in federal
					 Crowns that information is power and increasing its release will just generate
					 unwarranted criticism”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That puts it in a nutshell. This is the chairman of the
					 EDC who is calling for this. Furthermore he is recommending that Prime Minister
					 create a cabinet post that would make one minister responsible for overseeing
					 all crown corporations, with a parliamentary committee established to provide
					 oversight. What it comes down to on these appointments and committees is that
					 the government is proposing legislation to have the board of the EDC, with its
					 15 appointees, able to appoint other committees, as opposed to actually
					 bringing back more power to parliament. Right now it is very politicized. I
					 think we could do a much better job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the EDC is a $45 billion a year operation and
					 one of the big issues is the whole issue that seems to surround the EDC: its
					 secrecy, its transparency, its accountability. If there were ever a time that
					 the Export Development Corporation needed to be there it is right now in the
					 current situation where the economy is fragile at best. If there were ever a
					 time when we needed sound, solid management there for Canadian companies and
					 when we needed to make sure that the EDC is not based on politics and that it
					 continues to help the Canadian economy grow, it is now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to my next area and that is
					 accountability. There has to be more accountability in this crown corporation,
					 something that is evidently lacking at present. The government agrees that the
					 EDC should “publicly demonstrate its accountability by reflecting the full
					 range of public policy concerns and its activities and should introduce
					 appropriate transparency measures concerning its activities”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One suggestion that the government has come up with is
					 to propose that the auditor general audit the design and implementation of the
					 directive established by the board, at least once every five years. I believe
					 that accountability has to happen a lot more often than once every five years.
					 Such audits have to happen annually or at the very least every two years. Given
					 the deplorable misuse of taxpayers' money by HRDC, which is still fresh in
					 Canadians' minds, five years is a heck of a long time between audits and things
					 can go askew. I think audits need to happen a lot more often to ensure that we
					 do not have a repeat of that type of activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Export Development Corporation is not
					 covered by the Access to Information Act. That is a huge bone of contention. In
					 the past the corporation has been accused of keeping billions of dollars in
					 loans secret in foreign countries. In its defence, and I understand this, the
					 EDC says it is restricted by business confidentiality but that it encourages
					 its sponsors to release information about its projects. I understand
					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businesses do want certain aspects of things kept
					 confidential, but in turn these businesses are asking for public money, public
					 assistance. I think that is where we can draw the line. If a company has
					 business practices about which it needs to be that secretive, then maybe it
					 should be looking at other avenues. I think when a business is using taxpayers'
					 money it has to be completely transparent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent study for the federal government found that
					 crown corporations, including the EDC, should be subject to the Access to

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study notes that the reasons for crown corporations
					 such as the EDC being excluded from the law are unclear and that an agency
					 should be subject to the law if the government appoints more than half the
					 governing body. The government appoints them all in this case. We are getting
					 the message.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another big part of the legislation would be to have
					 full environmental assessments on projects to make sure they meet certain
					 standards. The Minister for International Trade insists that: </p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are committed to ensuring the environment is
					 protected while carrying out projects in Canada, should the same not hold true
					 when entering into transactions abroad? EDC has had to defend its environmental
					 assessment framework as recently as April 2000 when it was accused of assisting
					 in some of the world's most environmentally damaging projects. In any event,
					 the government's bringing forward of an assessment review is a positive aspect
					 of the legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real issue for me is accountability and
					 transparency. In May of this year a report of the auditor general gave a
					 failing grade to 24 of 26 projects backed by the Export Development
					 Corporation. To add insult to injury, Export Development Corporation decided it
					 would not make public details of three of the projects judged to have been
					 improperly assessed under the corporation's environmental review process.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spokesman for the EDC explained that three clients
					 that objected to releasing details of the projects have “good legitimate
					 reasons”. We will never know the details of projects that received failing
					 grades. We will not know even basic information such as the type of product,
					 the cost or which country was involved. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be recommending to members of the Progressive
					 Conservative/Democratic Representative caucus that on balance we oppose Bill
					 C-31 because it does not address the issues of accountability and transparency,
					 issues which should be paramount and at the forefront. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do see a need for Export Development Canada and its
					 projects, even more so at a time like this. However the fact that it is
					 excluded from access to information and is delegating its powers to committees
					 as opposed to bringing them into parliament are real concerns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government missed an opportunity to address these
					 important issues. Major concerns about the crown corporation have been out
					 there for years, but the government has chosen merely to change the name and do
					 some tinkering. I give the government credit on environmental assessment, but
					 the fact that it missed the boat on these issues means the bill is not
					 something we can support at this time.</p>

					 regarding areas in which the government has not seized opportunities.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to missed opportunities in other areas we
					 are dealing with the issue surrounding the events of September 11 and the fact
					 that the government, in particular the Prime Minister, is not speaking to the
					 House about what his plans are. Apparently he will be talking about them at a
					 fundraiser. He has been talking about policies on CNN rather than in the
					 House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could my colleague expand on the notion of missed
					 opportunities? It is becoming a theme not only for this piece of legislation
					 but for the government.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, one of the most important premises of a
					 missed opportunity is that we lose the opportunity. It is gone. We have seen
					 this during the tragic events which have touched all of us in the last few
					 weeks. We must be leaders. We must be up front and ready to make changes as we
					 need to. That is where the missed opportunities are in Bill C-31. Its critics,
					 even those within the crown corporation, are calling for more accountability
					 and transparency while its proponents say they need secrecy for business
					 practices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind these people that they are asking for large
					 sums of taxpayer dollars. Taxpayers have a right to know. . We could change the
					 legislation. We could find a balance which protects business interests but
					 gives taxpayers the knowledge they need to ensure accountability. We could
					 ensure that taxpayers get value for their dollars and that their dollars are
					 spent wisely.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has once again missed a huge opportunity
					 to effect positive changes to the legislation. That is why we in the
					 Progressive Conservative/Democratic Representative caucus will be opposing
					 it.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time today. I am
					 pleased to rise to speak in support of the legislation, as will be no surprise
					 to my colleagues on the other side.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not help but listen to my hon. colleagues in
					 the PC/DR who talked about missed opportunities. It is great to be speaking to
					 the issue today. I did not miss an opportunity to do so in the last session. In
					 the last session I was chair of the subcommittee on international trade, trade
					 disputes and investments. I was also an associate member of the Standing
					 Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade which examined the Gowling
					 report. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was not mandated to appear at those committees
					 I thought it was important to do so. It is important for small businesses in my
					 riding that I understand and appreciate what EDC does and the kind of value it
					 adds. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had an opportunity to lead two trade missions to the
					 Baltic states during the last session of parliament. At that time if there was
					 one criticism by small businesses it was that they wanted more involvement by
					 the Export Development Corporation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the bill because it means Canada's Export
					 Development Corporation would continue to be able to meet the financing needs
					 of our exporters but in a way that reflects Canadian values for corporate
					 social responsibility.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years Export Development Corporation or EDC
					 has become a valued part of our country's success as an exporting nation. Last
					 year EDC facilitated $45 billion in international business by Canadian
					 companies. The corporation served the needs of 5,700 clients, well over 80% of
					 whom were small and medium size enterprises. As a founding member of the Women
					 Entrepreneurs of Canada I know the value of small and medium size businesses as
					 well as businesses run and owned by women. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total last year EDC carried out some 70,000 short
					 term insurance transactions. These services are vital to our nation's export
					 success. We must ensure EDC can continue to provide them. At the same time
					 EDC's operating policies and actions must reflect the values Canadians believe
					 in, and they must do so both at home and abroad. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDC does business in more than 200 markets around the
					 world. One hundred and thirty of these are in developing countries. We need to
					 make sure Canadian values regarding issues like sustainable development and
					 human rights are part of the decision making process for EDC supported projects
					 in other countries. We also need to make sure the decision making process is
					 transparent and accountable so that Canadians know this is the case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the reasons Bill C-31 is important for us as
					 legislators. Along with other policy guidance from the government, the
					 amendments to the Export Development Act contained in the bill would help us
					 reach two overarching policy objectives: first, that the act support Canada's
					 exporters and the jobs and wealth they create; and, second, that it recognize
					 that Canadian values of corporate social responsibility must be included in
					 EDC's decision making process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no shortage of examples to show that EDC is
					 vital to our country's export success. As noted, last year the corporation
					 provided financial support of one kind or another to 5,700 Canadian companies.
					 Again, most of these were small or medium size enterprises. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the kinds of companies members on every side
					 of the House have in their ridings. They are companies like Cameron Seafoods
					 Ltd. of Nova Scotia, a family run business which is developing new markets
					 abroad for its specialty seafood products. EDC has provided it with financial
					 support such as credit guarantees that have facilitated new sales to buyers in
					 other countries. When EDC came on board in 1998 the company's sales increased
					 from $3 million to $5 million in one year. That is quite an
					 increase.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is Amec Earth and Environmental Ltd. of
					 Calgary, a firm that provides geotechnical and environmental engineering
					 services. EDC has worked with the company for several years and provided it
					 with financial support to reduce the risk of doing business internationally.
					 Amec now employs 1,600 people and is doing business in 30 countries.</p>


	<A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1620)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another good example is Klik Automation of Montreal.
					 This small, high technology firm is part of the new imaging software community
					 that has grown up in the Montreal region. When Klik was looking to develop a
					 new export market last year, the company turned to EDC for insurance to
					 guarantee payment by a new overseas customer. That deal resulted in 19 new jobs
					 in Montreal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are stories like this all across Canada. Each one
					 means increased exports for Canada and good jobs for Canadians. The government
					 is working hard to make sure that we see more of these success stories. Bill
					 C-31 is a key element of this work. It is not a long bill. In fact it can be
					 read quite quickly, and I would encourage members who have not read it to do
					 so. It is a bill that should be read and understood within the broader context
					 of change for EDC, both domestically and internationally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-31 is really the concluding step in a process
					 review that started over three years ago when the government commissioned a
					 consultant to carry out a legislative review and write a report. That was the
					 so-called Gowlings report. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process continued with the parliamentary committee
					 hearings and reports to government by the House Standing Committee on Foreign
					 Affairs and International Trade and the Senate committee on banking.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the auditor general has been involved and
					 has made useful recommendations, especially on EDC's environmental review
					 framework. In June of this year, the Minister for International Trade provided
					 guidance on updating EDC's mandate in a number of key areas, including
					 environmental review, human rights and broadening the base of participation of
					 the private sector in financing Canadian exports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the review, interested stakeholders have
					 also been involved in the process, another opportunity, I would say, to
					 participate. Although the review of the Export Development Act has not been a
					 matter of broad public concern, a number of organizations and committed
					 stakeholder groups, representing both business and public interest groups with
					 specific interest in EDC, have been actively involved in the
					 process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Minister for International Trade and EDC have
					 found this involvement helpful. I would remind my colleagues on the other side
					 that this is simply part of what the Liberal government is all about. In fact
					 the Speech from the Throne talks about the importance of consultation. This is
					 evidence of not just speaking about it but actually doing something about
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDC is perhaps best known for its success as an export
					 financing institution but the corporation has also shown that it is socially
					 responsible. Note, for example, that it was the EDC that initiated the
					 environmental review framework and it is putting in place a new disclosure
					 policy to improve accountability. These are significant developments.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all want greater attention to be given to
					 environmental and human rights issues and we all want a disclosure policy that
					 will reassure Canadians that EDC's decision making process is transparent and
					 accountable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is equally important that we have policies and
					 operating directives that are realistic as well as workable. That is why public
					 consultations are so important and the input of those stakeholder groups in
					 Canadian society who are most affected by EDC is also so helpful to the
					 government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDC has recently gone through a public consultation
					 process on its disclosure policy. Just this past September, the corporation was
					 going through a similar consultation with stakeholders to follow up on advice
					 from the auditor general and the Minister for International Trade on
					 strengthening and improving its environmental review framework. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representatives from both the business community and
					 public interest groups have been a welcome part of these consultations. They
					 are an important part of the process to develop the specific policies and
					 operating procedures that will meet the government's policy objectives and that
					 are realistic and workable in practice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the OECD, for example, we have led the discussion in
					 this area. Our negotiators sense a growing consensus for action by the OECD to
					 require the export credit agencies of member countries to conduct environmental
					 reviews of projects proposed for financial support. Canada can be a model for
					 this new approach. It is a balanced approach that best meets Canada's needs in
					 changing the international environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation is the right approach for Canada. It
					 brings the force of law to EDC's environmental review framework and it will
					 position us well to deal with emerging trends in the international community.
					 It is a bill that all members should support.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are talking about fixing up the corporation with

					 would do the best job, then why should she not be appointed that
					 position.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the bill and the amendments, the bill
					 does not really talk about appointments. It does say clearly that the
					 corporation is to be established as export development Canada and will consist
					 of a board of directors composed of 15 directors including a chairperson and
					 president. That is what is in the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the new changes in the bill, which was not in
					 the previous bill, is the fact that the board can now establish committees.
					 This is a new part of the act. It is not the method of appointment but that a
					 committee can be established and it can actually exercise any powers and
					 perform any duties delegated to it by the board. </p>

					 (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the constituents of
					 Etobicoke--Lakeshore who are very much involved and interested in businesses,
					 et cetera, where the Export Development Act would have some reference, I am
					 pleased to join in the debate today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Canadians we all understand the importance of a
					 healthy environment, not just within our bodies but for everyone on this
					 planet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past spring, I hosted a roundtable on the
					 environment, where many of my constituents expressed concern over the state of
					 the air we breath, the pollution of our lakes and rivers and global warming.
					 For them they want the federal government to ensure that Canadian corporations,
					 when carrying out their activities overseas, that they act responsibly toward
					 the environment as they would if they were here in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-31 answers that concern. The bill would
					 complement Canada's international and domestic obligations on the environment
					 front. The bill would allow those values that we share as Canadians and
					 initiatives that we implement on the environment to be implemented in an
					 international context.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's leadership role in the Kyoto protocol is
					 sending a strong signal to our international partners that the federal
					 government is committed to protecting and preserving the
					 environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also helping developing countries to reduce
					 toxic by-products that are industrial and agricultural based by encouraging
					 them to adopt best practices to ensure environmental sustainability. As
					 Canadians we have a responsibility to do this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituents understand that toxics know no border
					 and that we must take measures to respond to environmental challenges such as
					 climate change and air pollution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituents also understand that all sectors in
					 society, government, civil society and the private sector, must share in the
					 responsibility for a healthy and safe environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the Standing Committee on Foreign
					 Affairs and International Trade, I have had the privilege of hearing from
					 numerous witnesses who came before the committee. They spoke about the
					 operations of the EDC. We heard from the president, from labour, civil society,
					 business owners and exporters.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the hearings the message was loud and clear:
					 consideration must be given to the environment when EDC finances projects; and,
					 that a formal environmental review process must be established.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take this opportunity to remind the House that
					 EDC was established in 1944 with a mandate to support and develop Canada's
					 export trade. In the year 2000, it supported an estimated $45 billion in export
					 and foreign investments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of credit agencies financing activities,
					 particularly in the developing world, has prompted a call for sound
					 environmental practices, recognizing the importance of fostering trade
					 competitiveness that is consistent with environmental conservation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the early 1990s, as part of its risk management
					 process, the corporation reviewed projects for their environmental
					 impact.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago, EDC introduced its environmental review
					 framework to formalize and strengthen its environmental procedures. The
					 framework was developed at a time when few export credit agencies were seeking
					 to manage environmental risks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased that the EDC has followed through on
					 the suggestions and recommendations, not only of the foreign affairs committee
					 but also on the Gowling report studied by the foreign affairs and international
					 trade committee with the recommendations for a legislative framework and a
					 substantive approach following that of environmental practices in other areas,
					 including the World Bank.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government is committed to ensuring that
					 environmental standards are observed and defends the discussion today on the
					 bill, balancing the need for EDC to be environmentally as well as socially
					 responsible with the need to promote Canada's participation in a competitive
					 and international market.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-31 makes the EDC's board of directors--and we
					 heard mention of the board of directors earlier-including two deputy ministers
					 of the federal government responsible for the environmental review policy. This
					 is a binding obligation.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition the auditor general would have an ongoing
					 monitoring and reporting role on behalf of parliament and the Canadian public.
					 The EDC was among the first export credit agency to introduce such a review
					 framework, putting Canada and the EDC at the forefront of current practices in
					 the environmental review of export projects.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The framework has to two guiding principles: first, as
					 the witnesses we heard from stressed, that environmental reviews undertaken by
					 financial institutions to mitigate project risk can help encourage sustainable
					 development by promoting consideration of the environmental benefits and costs
					 of projects in host country jurisdictions; and, second, that EDC should decline
					 support for projects which after taking into account the implementation of
					 mitigation measures are in its opinion likely to cause significant adverse
					 environmental effects that cannot be justified by the anticipated positive
					 effects of such projects. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, if the end result of a project is
					 positive but there is a negative way in which to get to the end result, under
					 its guiding principle the EDC can say no.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This environmental review framework is a reflection of
					 ongoing multilateral discussions at the Organization for Economic Co-operation
					 and Development. In that forum an export credits group is working to develop
					 internationally acceptable standards for the environmental review practices of
					 the export credit agencies of all OECD member countries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a growing number of countries with formal
					 environmental review policies including all the G-7 nations and the majority of
					 OECD nations. Among the best are those of the United States, the United Kingdom
					 and France. My constituents know that EDC's environmental review framework is
					 regarded as being at the forefront of international initiatives in this regard.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier my colleague mentioned the report of the
					 auditor general. He stated that this framework contained all the elements
					 suitably designed to aid this process. It shows the following: how the
					 corporation would identify environmental risks, the information it would need
					 to assess them, the circumstances under which it would decline to support a
					 project or to make its support conditional, and the process for monitoring and
					 reporting to ensure that the risks are appropriately managed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is standing head to head with other nations.
					 These practices are in wide use. Bill C-31 would strengthen our domestic values
					 and international agreements relating to the environment. Canadians expect that
					 corporations doing business outside our shores such as EDC will reflect our
					 values and the environment. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call on all my colleagues to support Bill C-31 which
					 would work to ensure the concerns of Canadians will be echoed in both the
					 domestic and international spheres.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon.
					 member for Elk Island. One would think that after the member for Parkdale--High
					 Park finished with her catalogue of good things the EDC had done over the past
					 years that there was absolutely nothing in the world the EDC could not do to
					 promote business. I wonder what happened to all of our financial institutions
					 and our private enterprises that operate without EDC support. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to put on the record a balanced position which
					 clearly indicates there is something else besides EDC that might work. One
					 would think that according to the government the only corporations which really
					 know what to do are crown corporations. That is far from the truth. There are a
					 lot of other corporations that are doing very well. I suspect that is one of
					 the reasons CN, which was a crown corporation, is now a private
					 corporation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will speak to a number of amendments contained in
					 Bill C-31: the environmental provision, the increase of the contingent
					 liability ceiling from $15 billion to $32.5 billion, the empowering of the
					 board to make contributions to pension plans, making it an offence for
					 businesses to refer in their advertisement to EDC involvement in their
					 enterprises, the appointment of committees and the power of the board to
					 delegate its powers to them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will read into the record the clause pertaining to
					 the environmental provisions. I am sure many people who are watching do not
					 know exactly what is being talked about. Clause 10.1 states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Before entering, in the exercise of
						  its powers under subsection 10(1.1), into a transaction that is related to a

						  environmental effects despite the implementation of mitigation
						  measures;</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subclause 10.1 (2) states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The Board shall issue a directive
						  respecting the determination referred to in subsection (1), which directive
						  may</small></td>

						  “mitigation measures”;</small></td>

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that not interesting? The board has the right to
					 decide whether there will be adverse environmental effects. The next section
					 defines an adverse environmental effect. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill does not in any way refer to Canada's
					 environmental act. It is excluded specifically. Those projects are approved
					 under the Canada account which the Minister of Finance and the Minister for
					 International Trade need to approve. They are specifically exempted and do not
					 apply or come under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Environmental Assessment
					 Act. Clause 12 which amends section 24.1 states:</p>


	<p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now need to look at the very wide reaching powers of
					 the EDC. The corporation may acquire and dispose of any interest in any entity
					 by any means; enter into any arrangement that has the effect of providing to
					 any person any insurance, reinsurance, indemnity or guarantee; enter into any
					 arrangement that has the effect of extending credit to any person or providing
					 an undertaking to pay money to any person; take any security interest in any
					 property; prepare, compile, publish and distribute information; provide
					 consulting services; procure the incorporation, dissolution or amalgamation of
					 subsidiaries; make any investment and enter into any transaction necessary or
					 desirable for the financial management of the corporation; and there are
					 others.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers are overwhelming. The auditor could be the
					 president of the EDC and do anything he would want to do. It is like telling my
					 friends to form a corporation, make sure to do some exporting and make sure
					 that they get paid by the person who is buying the product they are exporting.
					 That is what is possible here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to recognize that these people will be
					 responsible, but the law is an open book and allows them pretty well to go
					 anywhere they want to go. That is the sort of thing that makes it possible for
					 a patronage appointment, for example, to reflect specifically what it is the
					 Prime Minister wants done in another country, another corporation, or whatever
					 the case may be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the board that runs the corporation may
					 now appoint committees which can have any of these powers delegated to them.
					 This is really interesting. That is the kind of bill we have before us. If it
					 were not for the trust, faith and common sense of some of people, we would have
					 the possibility and potential of making something corrupt. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy that we as Canadians do not live like that.
					 We trust one another. We have a sense of morality and a sense of ethics. That
					 is what makes this kind of thing work. It is not because the legislation is so
					 good. It is because the people are so decent. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why I am such a strong proponent of private
					 enterprise in the first instance. These people are now directly responsible for
					 their own money in their own way. They can do the things that have to be done
					 to benefit them and get the finest results they can get.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer lies not in forming crown corporations and
					 extending their powers and privileges but rather in creating an environment so
					 that private enterprise can win and can apply these kinds of things.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that. Institutions such as the Royal

					 the big development should take place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that the Export Development
					 Corporation does its business in two accounts: the corporate account and the

					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate
					 today on Bill C-31 regarding the Export Development Corporation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked my assistant to go to the website to find out
					 exactly what the mandate of the organization is and I will quote the very first
					 sentence: “EDC is a Canadian financial institution devoted exclusively to
					 providing trade finance services to support Canadian exporters and investors in
					 some 200 markets, 130 of which are in developing markets”. I believe the
					 website is relatively current. It goes on to say that last year, Canadian
					 business concluded $45.4 billion in export and domestic sales and investments
					 in markets using EDC trade financing services. It claims right up front that it
					 is not only involved in exports but also has domestic sales and investments in
					 the marketplace.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EDC also says that 90% of its customers are smaller
					 customers, but it does not indicate the magnitude of the business conducted
					 with these different corporations. While 90% of its customers are presumably
					 smaller companies, in terms of the number of them, we have no indication or any
					 way of finding out exactly who the other 10% are. It could well be, and I
					 suspect it is the case, that the 10% that are not smaller companies are large
					 corporations that benefit immensely from the majority of the financial activity
					 of the corporation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EDC goes on to say that it also has responsibility
					 for social corporate activity. It logs its code of conduct and business ethics.
					 It lists all of the things it is high on and we should commend it for that. It
					 is a global business and says that it is therefore a global citizen and works
					 within a global environmental context.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it quite incredible because the Government of
					 Canada has expressed its concern for global environmental issues. We are no
					 longer living in a world where what we do with our air, water and soil is
					 limited only to ourselves because of the fact that our world has become a very
					 small community. I commend these words, but when we look into the depths of the
					 legislation that is before us and what is proposed therein, we find that it is
					 somewhat inadequate in the sense that Canada's rigid environmental laws do not
					 apply.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will digress for a second. I think of Canada signing
					 the Kyoto accord. One of the questions that has been asked of me, and which I
					 actually have asked myself, is exactly how the environment is enhanced by
					 shipping Canadian money to other countries that for whatever reason do not have
					 as much pollution as our country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we are a northern country. We have heating
					 demands which are just not present in Africa. A person would have a hard time
					 making a living selling furnaces in Africa because they are not needed. No fuel
					 is burned and hence not as much pollution is produced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to solve the environmental problems of the
					 world, should we ship our money to Africa? How is the environment enhanced by
					 that? Would it not be better to keep the money at home in Canada and use it for
					 research and other activities in order to clean up our environment and the way
					 in which we produce our own energy needs?</p>


	<A NAME="T1655"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1655)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Export Development Corporation is not required to
					 adhere to Canada's environmental laws. It has its own law. I can see its
					 argument. It says that it is one that is internationally agreed to and in order
					 to allow it to play on a level playing field, that is the rule it needs to
					 apply. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time EDC becomes involved in financing
					 projects which would not fly in Canada because of Canadian environmental laws.
					 That to me is an anachronism. We are willing to send money out of the country
					 which has nothing to do with helping the environment yet, through the Export
					 Development Corporation, we may be financing projects which do not meet even
					 our own requirements. It is a contradictory use of Canadian taxpayers'
					 money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also something called the Canada account. My
					 colleague from Kelowna mentioned it. The Canada account is used to support
					 export transactions which are determined by the Minister for International
					 Trade to be in Canada's national interest. According to its website, this is
					 usually due to a combination of risks and it mentions what those are. Basically
					 the executive summary of it is it would become involved if ordinary banks would
					 not touch the matter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada account transactions are negotiated, executed
					 and administered by the EDC, just like the corporate account transactions are,
					 but the risks under the Canada account are assumed by the Government of
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see a direct involvement of the Minister for
					 International Trade who can say “This is a project which we will approve”.
					 Unfortunately, there is no check and balance in the legislation to prevent the
					 minister from using it for the purposes of propping up businesses of the
					 minister's choice rather than perhaps what is really good for the country as a
					 whole.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom is EDC accountable? It says that it operates at
					 arm's length from government. However, the way the corporation is set up, the
					 Government of Canada, i.e., the taxpayers of Canada, is the only shareholder of
					 the corporation. I was elected to speak for taxpayers in Canada. That was my
					 primary theme. Canadian taxpayers have “invested” into EDC in excess of $1
					 billion, yet the corporation claims that it operates at arm's length from the
					 government and does not cost the taxpayers anything. I beg to
					 differ.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, if someone were to give me $1
					 billion and said that I would have to pay it back, eventually I would give back
					 the $1 billion but boy, would I live a happy life in the intervening years. It
					 is a little thing called interest. One billion dollars could easily produce
					 $100 million per year in income. That would be adequate for a good weekend,
					 would it not? We are talking a lot of money here and it is money that is lost
					 to Canadians by virtue of the fact that it is tied up in the Export Development
					 Corporation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not kid ourselves. Let us not say that the
					 corporation does not cost the taxpayers anything. It obviously does since we
					 have this huge amount of money that has been invested in it. It is taxpayers'
					 money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not deny the fact that many businesses benefit
					 from the work of the Export Development Corporation. It enables them to promote
					 their own business and to export to countries around the world. In that sense
					 those taxpayers at least get something back. It obviously produces some
					 employment and that is also good.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to see legislation which would greatly
					 enhance the accountability to the Canadian taxpayers. I am appalled when I read
					 the details that although the auditor general has access to the accounts and
					 makes reports and the five year special report, those audits are not readily
					 available, even through access to information. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am specifically interested in the role of EDC as a
					 crown corporation and what the member said regarding the auditor general
					 looking at the account.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a question on a lot of people's minds. This is
					 a crown corporation and should be working under the rules of how a crown
					 corporation should work. It takes advantage of those rules but at the same time
					 when it comes to the question of accountability and where the money has been
					 spent, it hides behind private enterprise by saying it falls under privacy of
					 customer information. It has its feet on both sides. It wants to work as a
					 crown corporation but unlike other crown corporations that are accountable to
					 parliament the Export Development Corporation is not accountable to parliament
					 because of the Privacy Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the member would like to comment on
					 that.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, one of the perplexing things about the
					 Liberal government is that it is just not open about information. As a
					 comparable situation, I have noticed this particularly with respect to the
					 press conferences being held by government officials with respect to terrorism
					 lately. When we tune into CNN, government officials in the U.S. from the
					 president on down seem eager to give the maximum amount of information to their
					 citizens so that they are fully apprised of what is being done. In Canada
					 however, it is like squeezing orange juice out of a lemon. It is impossible to
					 get any information out of the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted with interest that in testimony to the foreign
					 affairs committee, an organization called Probe International made mention of
					 this. It asked for the five year report from the auditor general and was told
					 that he was not permitted by legislation to disclose it but that the inquirer
					 should go directly to the corporation, which they did. When they asked for that
					 information they were told that it was confidential information and was not
					 available.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the witness at the committee said
					 that a letter was written to the United States Export-Import Bank requesting
					 details of a similar, almost identical situation. Included in the response to a
					 Canadian from an American bank which was involved in a comparable situation was
					 information including tables, accounting, rescheduling agreements and the whole
					 thing. The Americans seem to be more accessible or more willing to give
					 information to its citizens and even Canadian citizens than is our own
					 government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it is a culture. It is time for the
					 Government of Canada to level with its citizens and give them as much
					 information as it can rather than hide behind all of those other little rules
					 all the time which prevents Canadians from knowing what is happening to their
					 money.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to talk on the
					 issue of the Export Development Corporation, following my two colleagues who
					 have pointed out very well many of the issues raised in debates on the
					 reliability and the existence of this crown corporation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the act talks about housekeeping duties and some
					 of the responsibilities, especially enabling the board to have some powers and
					 to debate some things, I would like to talk in general about the whole concept
					 of development and the role of EDC in what it is primarily set up to do, which
					 is to provide protection and incentives to Canadian companies to go into the
					 world market and start development assistance programs. As my hon. colleague
					 has rightly mentioned, EDC is very proud of saying it has spent a lot of money
					 in the developing countries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When EDC and CIDA were created, it was probably because
					 these organizations were needed at the time. However, events and subsequent
					 things that have taken place since then raises the question as to whether CIDA
					 and EDC are effective tools in today's marketplace conditions and are they
					 taking advantage of opening markets and the needs of developing
					 nations?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have very fine individuals in EDC and CIDA who have
					 over the years gathered a lot of expertise and have at times used this
					 expertise very effectively. We are very impressed by the hard work and
					 dedication of these people. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the political interference and changes in
					 direction have enabled both of these agencies to have broken democracies with
					 policy advisers. At times I shake my head and wonder where they are going with
					 their narrow agendas without looking at long term plans of action that would
					 ensure development and export dollars are spent more wisely and are better
					 utilized by Canadian companies and other agencies that do development
					 assistance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the international development critic for CIDA and
					 I am stunned to see the secrecy of the policy advisers of CIDA. It is as if
					 they have something to hide. They do have something to hide in not becoming
					 more transparent to the Canadian public. CIDA had $1.9 billion, but I think it
					 went to $2.1 billion. This huge department is scared to tell Canadians what it
					 is doing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does the normal auditing and normal things required.
					 However, when we go deeper into it and ask what is going on, we run into a
					 wall. CIDA is a prime example of that and that can be translated to EDC as
					 well. Secrecy has been one of the strongest criticisms of EDC. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a crown corporation that lives under crown
					 corporation rules. It gets government assistance and guarantees. At the same
					 time, it says that it acts like a private corporation, therefore, it cannot be
					 accountable to parliament because of privacy for its customers. When CIDA comes
					 into parliament to let Canadians know what it is trying to do, it merely gives
					 the crumbs off the table. It does this in generalities and not in specifics.
					 </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why these questions continue to be asked, not
					 only by the official opposition but by individuals in the public who want to
					 know how the corporations operate. The lack of knowledge is what we are
					 questioning. Time after time we have raised questions, and the EDC board of
					 directors is a very prime example of patronage appointments of those
					 individuals who have connections to the government. Some of them may have good
					 expertise but in general they are tied to Liberal connections. This in turn
					 curtails the ability of the fine officers who work at EDC and at CIDA to
					 implement decisions because they are hampered by political
					 interference.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the opportunity to meet with many
					 individuals who have worked for both CIDA and EDC. I seem to get a consistent
					 answer which is the inability of these ground level people to make decisions
					 that are the right ones based on their experience because of political
					 appointee interference.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would venture to say that EDC and CIDA are gradually
					 becoming irrelevant under the present context their mandates are. I will
					 explain why.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years EDC and CIDA have been giving out money.
					 Have we seen an improvement in the developing world where they are supposed to
					 be in the theatre of operations? No, we have not. There is something seriously
					 wrong. It is time to look at a different mandate for these corporations so they
					 work effectively.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could use the expertise of the people running EDC
					 whom I have met and with whom I am impressed. We could use the expertise of the
					 NGOs and business people to create an environment where they can work in tandem
					 with CIDA so that we can bring in the massive private investments, which
					 business people and Canadians would like. It would make a climate in which
					 investment dollars would flow to these countries and allow them to develop
					 their nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not talking about infrastructure and big projects.
					 I was in Africa in August and I came back a little disappointed. I thought
					 about how, in our overall capacity, we could help African countries move
					 forward. We have the Africa initiative that is supposed to come up at the G-8.
					 However, let me also say that many of the leaders in these countries recognize
					 that it is their responsibility to create environments for
					 development.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Museveni of Uganda, when he met with the
					 regional African countries in Kampala in August, proposed a program where they
					 would be willing to look to insurance companies to provide insurance for
					 businesses that would invest in these countries so that if they were taken over
					 through nationalization or disrupted by war company investments would be
					 safe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is an initiative that has come from Africa. A
					 mandate of EDC is to provide that kind of insurance but these other countries
					 are taking it over and are saying they will do it themselves.</p>


	<A NAME="T1710"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1710"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1710)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time for EDC to rethink its strategy. It is time
					 for CIDA to rethink its strategy. I would like these departments to have a
					 totally different focus. I am reluctant to say that perhaps we should now have
					 a department. I would not want it called CIDA itself, but maybe EDC should be
					 under CIDA. Let us remove the unitarian aspect of CIDA so it can concentrate on
					 these aspects with the NGOs, do it more effectively and create another arm on
					 the other side that has EDC under it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe if a DFI or development finance institution was
					 established in Canada, CIDA Inc. could create the environment or one window
					 shopping for Canadian businesses. This would allow businesses to work in tandem
					 with the private industry to create an organization that is focused to ensure
					 that private investment flows into these countries to help them out, which in
					 turn will help Canadian businesses.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time to look at these things because we have gone
					 through the whole lot of them. There has been government to government aid.
					 That has not been very effective. The IMF has given aid. That has not been very
					 effective. People in most countries are not happy with the IMF and its
					 conditions. We have gone through the route of CIDA Inc. We have gone through
					 the route of giving money to the NGOs, that are doing a marvellous job.
					 However, in view of their small organizations, they are not focused. As such,
					 dollars that go to them go to specific projects, but not in the overall
					 development of the nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole concept is that the NGOs have done a
					 marvellous job. We have gone through this route and have put dollars in there.
					 That is fine. However, now we have reached beyond this level. We need to look
					 at another way to go and how to help. That is why I say the whole mandate of
					 EDC should be reviewed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDC should come under a different department, maybe
					 called CIDA, but it should have a different mandate. The current mandate should
					 be removed and an other agency should be created where NGOs can be more
					 effective. However, then we have to look at the insurance issue, which would
					 then be privatized.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, countries recognize that and are taking
					 responsibility for it. I also mentioned that the African leaders were talking
					 about this. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can then talk about the fact that small and medium
					 sized businesses have this one window of opportunity to go out and sell their
					 expertise effectively.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a massive system or idea to see how we can get
					 this transfer of funds moving. I imagine that would be fine with their big
					 infrastructures. Countries need big infrastructure. However, at the end of the
					 day it comes to the point as to how to get it down to small and medium sized
					 enterprises?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about the Canada account, which is used to
					 subsidize our big corporations. We saw Bombardier receive Canada account money
					 under favourable terms. In a way it is subsidizing this huge corporation which
					 makes all the money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also say that we are really proud of its
					 achievements. It is very innovative and sells beautiful world class jets and
					 light rail. However, we do have somewhat of a problem with Bombardier coming
					 back to the government to ask for handouts or subsidized issues like the sale
					 of jets. This makes Canadians wonder why. We see the same thing with Air
					 Canada. </p>


	<A NAME="T1715"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1715)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Air Canada came along not in our wildest
					 imaginations did Canadians think that we would ever see Air Canada stand up and
					 ask for $3 billion to $4 billion because the Americans got the money. How does
					 it tie its business to American business considering that it has 80% of the
					 market and a monopoly in the country? I think that shocked many Canadians.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go back to the question of EDC, the question of
					 development assistance and the role of EDC in helping Canadian companies export
					 their goods. If under this new system we are talking about, in which there are
					 no taxpayer dollars involved and EDC operates under normal circumstances, which
					 I think would bring about efficiency, it would assist Canadian businesses,
					 which are very aggressive. I have been with them overseas. I know they are very
					 aggressive, but they also do seem to have problems with the way the present EDC
					 is set up and the way the present CIDA is set up. They find that the
					 environment is changing and these huge bureaucracies still lie back and are not
					 rising to the occasion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could privatize the insurance portion of EDC and let
					 the insurance industry take it. The industry has already complained about EDC,
					 because as a crown corporation EDC does not pay taxes. It is not a question of
					 paying taxes; they do not pay dividends to anyone. It does not have to worry
					 about shareholders because it is a crown corporation. To whom is it
					 accountable? Even if it is at less than par, it is accountable to nobody. If it
					 were privatized or looked at in a different manner, then at least it would be
					 accountable, with openness brought to parliament, to their shareholders. EDC is
					 now protected on both sides.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that EDC is in one of the best
					 situations in the business world. It is protected by not being open and it does
					 not have to answer to shareholders because no one is asking for accountability.
					 However, I think it is time for EDC to grow up. It is time for EDC to refocus.
					 It is time for EDC and the government to stop thinking and stop operating in
					 the same way that they have been for the past 30 years. When EDC had its five
					 year review by the minister, I was at that time the critic for international
					 trade. I looked at the review, and believe me, I could not find many things. We
					 went through a whole report on EDC. The federal government hired Gowling
					 consulting company to look at the complete operations of EDC. There were some
					 very good suggestions made, but EDC is still a slow moving institution and
					 needs to come into the 21st century. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, given the government's history of trying
					 to avoid accountability, given its lack of openness in disclosing what it is
					 doing and given its history of interfering with domestic financial
					 institutions, when we look at the structure of the EDC we see that for the most
					 part it has independence from scrutiny. There is a lot of power given to the
					 board. Its structure is set up so that it is not accountable to anyone and it
					 is given a great deal of authority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am wondering if my hon. colleague would care to
					 comment on whether he thinks the government, given its history, would be able
					 to keep its fingers from manipulating this agency, from sticking them in there
					 and trying to manoeuvre things for political purposes.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, there is no question about it: we know
					 that the boards of directors of all crown corporations have been used for
					 patronage appointments, even the refugee board, which the minister said the
					 government was going to get rid of. The government was reluctant to get rid of
					 it, could not get rid of it, because it helps all the Liberals who have lost
					 elections by giving them those positions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I agree with the member. The government has not
					 changed much, but I wish it would, in the running of the corporations because
					 that helps it put Liberal friends into positions and keep its flock happy at
					 the expense of the Canadian taxpayer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time to look at it. It is time to really look at
					 EDC's mandate and to get rid of its insurance operations. I think it is
					 becoming irrelevant, according to the latest developments that I have heard on
					 what has been happening. EDC is not happy with its Canada Account because of
					 course there is 100% government interference, and not much can be done about
					 it, as we know with what happened with the Bombardier issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must look at where the EDC would be most effective.
					 I think that at the end of the day EDC would be more effective if we were to
					 bring together all these institutions into what I would like to call the
					 Canadian International Development Agency, but with a totally different
					 mandate. </p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I want to follow up on the wide ranging
					 comments of my colleague and focus on two points, some of which were mentioned
					 by the previous member, those being the issue of accountability and the issue
					 of political interference.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in the area of accountability, as my colleague
					 mentioned, when there is a perception generated over time that failed
					 candidates are appointed to boards or friends of the government are appointed
					 to the boards, whether they are the best people for the jobs starts to wane as
					 the important question. The perception simply becomes that people are being
					 appointed because of who they know on the government side. I think that is to
					 the government's detriment. If it were able to be more transparent and not
					 shroud the workings of the EDC and CIDA in secrecy, which my colleague referred
					 to, I think it would do the government well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am wondering if my colleague might have some specific
					 examples that he may have uncovered in his good work in this area, specifics
					 that he knows of having to do with political interference or with political
					 appointees to different boards that have been involved in the granting of
					 government contracts.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-53723"></A><a HREF="#Int-53725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-53721"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for
					 raising a question that is a big concern for all Canadians in regard to the use
					 of crown corporation boards and refugee boards for Liberal patronage
					 appointments and rewards for the government's Liberal friends.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member has asked for examples. Over time we
					 have had numerous examples of people who have been on the EDC and the BDC. My
					 colleague will remember the gentleman involved in the golf course in
					 Grand-Mère, Mr. Carle, who was appointed to the BDC. He is the gentleman who
					 was involved in APEC when he was in the Prime Minister's office. He was
					 appointed to the BDC. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are numerous examples of how people previously
					 connected with the government have been tied to these boards.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I will say that maybe they were competent, maybe
					 they had the expertise, but it is the openness of the situation that is the
					 issue. Why is it not done in front of a parliamentary committee so that both
					 the government and opposition people could vote, as is done in the U.S.? Then
					 there would be excellent confidence in many of these people because they would
					 come in front of a committee made up not only of Liberals but of members from
					 both sides of the House. Questions could be asked. We could grill them. Maybe
					 they do have the qualifications to be on those boards.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing this would give confidence and send the message
					 that the people who are running these institutions have gone through a rigorous
					 search program, as is done in many independent corporations. When independent
					 corporations hire they do so through human resource companies to find the best
					 individual. For us the best way to do this would be through a parliamentary
					 committee. Hopefully the government will take that suggestion.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague from Calgary East,
					 my neighbouring constituency, for his remarks. His remarks reflect expert
					 knowledge of issues related to foreign trade, export development and
					 international development. They have helped me to have a better understanding
					 of the issue. The hon. member spends a lot of time overseas examining Canadian
					 aid projects and trade with foreign countries, and it is well reflected in his
					 remarks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-31, as we know, seeks to amend the Export
					 Development Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts. It provides
					 for delegation of powers to committees established by the board of EDC. It also
					 provides for the establishment of a procedure for environmental assessment of
					 projects supported by the crown corporation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues in the official opposition and I have for
					 a long time had fundamental concerns about the operation of Export Development
					 Corporation. We start from the first premise that the private sector is a more
					 efficient means of allocating scarce capital than government or government
					 agencies. We agree with the need for financing and insurance to facilitate
					 Canadian trade abroad. Foreign trade is an essential aspect of our economy and
					 it is absolutely essential to our economic growth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is a net exporting country. We have a current
					 account surplus of something in the neighbourhood of $27 billion a year. We
					 export more goods and services than we import, to the tune of $27 billion.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an urgent need for Canada to continue its
					 growth in exports. We have much to offer the rest of the world, not just in
					 terms of manufactured goods produced in Canada but in terms of services and
					 hard commodities which help feed millions of people around the world and
					 provide much needed equipment to raise living standards in underdeveloped
					 countries and economies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons it is necessary to focus on
					 assisting Canadian companies which trade abroad. Sometimes this can be
					 difficult. Sometimes it involves incurring political hazard. Sometimes there is
					 a need for special kinds of insurance for our export oriented companies.
					 Sometimes there is a need for financing to enable companies abroad to buy
					 Canadian goods and services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues and I believe most of these functions
					 could be carried out more efficiently by the private sector. Maintaining a
					 government run and taxpayer owned corporation such as EDC which provides
					 insurance, financing and services of this nature takes away opportunities from
					 Canadian capital markets and insurance companies. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These companies could provide the same services on a
					 commercial basis without exposing Canadian taxpayers to risk. This would
					 enlarge opportunities for private Canadian companies as opposed to government
					 run crown corporations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inevitably crown corporations present opportunities for
					 abuse and unaccountability. Nowhere is that more clear than with the board of
					 Export Development Corporation. It is used frequently by the executive council,
					 the government, the cabinet and the Prime Minister as a parking place for
					 Liberal patronage appointees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Calgary East and other colleagues
					 have mentioned the recent appointment of Bernie Boudreau. He lost a provincial
					 election in Nova Scotia, was appointed to the cabinet through the Senate and
					 lost a federal election. His reward for having lost two elections was to get
					 appointed to the board of EDC. This was his principal qualification.</p>


	<A NAME="T1735"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1735)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same man would not have been appointed to the board
					 of a private insurance company, private venture capital company or bank which
					 provides the same services in the private sector. The criterion for people who
					 govern such corporations is not the ability to lose elections for the right
					 party. It is the demonstrable ability to manage the bottom line and create
					 profits and dividends for shareholders. That is the sort of governance we need
					 for the services now provided by Export Development Corporation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw my friend, the hon. government House leader, a
					 moment ago and it brought to mind the Liberal standards on patronage. They were
					 very high indeed between 1984 and 1993. When I was a young Liberal I used to
					 receive mailings from the current hon. government House leader. Every year
					 between 1984 and 1993 he put out something called the black book on Tory
					 patronage. It was an exhaustive litany of all the horrendous patronage
					 appointments made by the then Tory government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was indeed an orgy of patronage during those
					 years but it was the current government House leader who raised his voice in
					 great indignation about it. He said if the Liberal Party ever formed a
					 government again it would never engage in patronage, the kind of patronage we
					 now see day after day in appointments to boards like that of EDC.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask my colleagues opposite, when they reflect on
					 government control of organizations like EDC, to consider that they should
					 perhaps be consistent with what they have said. Perhaps they should walk the
					 talk about patronage that they offered to Canadians between 1984 and 1993.
					 Perhaps they should consider our non-partisan constructive criticism that many
					 of the functions of EDC could be spun off more effectively into the private
					 sector.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague from Calgary East has said, there are
					 two basic functions at EDC. First, there are functions managed within the
					 corporate account such as export financing, insurance and guarantees. These are
					 financed primarily by borrowing on domestic and international capital markets.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is the Canada account which provides
					 government the means and authority to support export transactions that do not
					 meet EDC's normal criteria for prudent risk management. That is another way of
					 saying companies which finance agreements that would not normally meet
					 commercial criteria can get money from the Canada account. These sometimes
					 include large corporations that receive hundreds of millions of dollars from
					 Canadian taxpayers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the services provided by EDC such as short and
					 medium term export insurance and financing should be turned over to the private
					 sector. The rest of EDC could become a division of DFAIT. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Calgary East has suggested somehow
					 linking it with certain functions carried out by CIDA, the Canadian
					 International Development Agency. Those functions could then be accountable to
					 parliament directly rather than through the indirect relationship of a crown
					 corporation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new export division could provide occasional loan
					 guarantees and other services beyond the scope of private companies such as
					 long term insurance, political risk insurance and small premium insurance. It
					 could support projects which are not commercially viable but are deemed to be
					 in the national interest. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I accept that from time to time there are projects that
					 need non-commercial financing and that Canada needs, for strategic reasons of
					 national interest and not just economic reasons, to be present in the economies
					 of countries abroad. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason we in the Canadian Alliance would
					 support, as a function of our international aid portfolio, financing of that
					 nature. However we could do so with greater parliamentary accountability while
					 allowing the more commercial aspects of EDC to operate in the private sector
					 where they belong.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until we finally see changes of this nature, changes
					 which would increase accountability, reduce taxpayer risk and allow functions
					 that could be in the private sector to go into the private sector, my
					 colleagues in the official opposition and I cannot and will not support the
					 changes to the Export Development Act because they do not deal with the
					 fundamental problems of this crown corporation.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are moving into a time of great fiscal and economic
					 uncertainty. The Bank of Nova Scotia reported last Friday that the government
					 would face a deficit of $5 billion in fiscal year 2002-03. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are almost undoubtedly in the midst of a recession.
					 The finance minister will accuse me and anyone who uses that word of alarmism,
					 but it is an unavoidable fact. We had negative economic growth in the first two
					 months of the third quarter of this year. There is almost no doubt that given
					 the events of September 11 and its economic consequences we will see negative
					 growth at the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two successive quarters of negative growth constitute a
					 recession. Unfortunately it is not only plausible but likely that we will find
					 ourselves in that position. That will have a negative effect on the fiscal
					 position of the government. It means revenues will go down and so-called
					 automatic stabilizers and social expenditures will go up. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this puts us close to a deficit position mainly
					 because the government is increasing its program expenditures far beyond the
					 level of growth in the economy, inflation or population.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I say this? I say it because it is time once
					 again for parliament and the government to make hard choices. As the finance
					 minister said three years ago, we can never again allow ourselves to go into
					 deficit come hell or high water. I asked him last Friday if he would again make
					 that commitment. He pointedly failed to do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge imperative to invest more resources
					 into areas of national security such as the Department of National Defence, the
					 RCMP, intelligence services such as CSIS, customs and border control, the coast
					 guard and restoration of the ports police. These demands will undoubtedly cost
					 several billions of dollars. Together with the oncoming recession and the
					 enormous spending pressures the government has imposed on taxpayers through
					 various discretionary programs, they will add up to a time in which we must be
					 single minded and make difficult decisions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That will mean liquidating assets such as some crown
					 corporations. It will mean privatizing functions now performed by government
					 agencies and crown corporations which could be carried out more efficiently in
					 the private sector. These are some of the decisions we must make if we are to
					 avoid a deficit. Our argument for the partial privatization of the functions of
					 EDC is more important now than ever because we are once again staring a deficit
					 in the face.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recommend we go back to the drawing board on EDC,
					 look at how its functions could be operated in the private sector, save the
					 taxpayers a potential risk of hundreds of millions of dollars and prepare
					 ourselves for some of the difficult choices which lie ahead in the near
					 future.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the member for Calgary Southeast continues
					 to espouse these simplistic solutions that the market does everything and that
					 governments are not needed to intervene. He glibly states that he understands
					 that companies may need some insurance and financing to deal with the export
					 markets. How kind of him. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, last year $45 billion in exports were done
					 using trade financing services from EDC. The question is, could the private
					 sector do this? The role of the EDC is to move in when the private sector will
					 not move in and provide the kind of financing or insurance that is needed to
					 compete in those markets. I will give an example.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding of Etobicoke North there is a company that
					 is now doing some major work in the United States. It was not able to get
					 bonding in the Canadian markets because we do not have the diversity, the
					 richness, the size, the breadth and the scope of the markets to step up to some
					 of these challenges. It received performance bonding working with EDC and the
					 Canadian Commercial Corporation. That company is growing in leaps and bounds.
					 It now has a presence in the U.S. market and is growing from strength to
					 strength. It was because of EDC and the Canadian Commercial Corporation that it
					 was able to do the deal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not to say that we should not be holding EDC
					 accountable to its mandate and not to be crowding out the private sector. We
					 are talking here at the margin. We are not talking about a vast generalization
					 which the member opposite tries to portray, that EDC should just get out of the
					 market completely and let the market do the business. If we look at the facts,
					 the reality is that the market does not always respond in the way the member
					 would dream that it could. These are called market failures. It is the role of
					 government to move in when the market is not there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDC and the Canadian Commercial Corporation serve this
					 country very well. They perform an outstanding service. I for one would like to
					 support them. I will be supporting the bill. I would encourage the member for
					 Calgary Southeast to get off his ideology and look at the facts because this
					 crown corporation helps Canadian business and helps create jobs in
					 Canada.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased with my colleague's
					 intervention because a sure sign of a Liberal losing an argument is when he
					 mischaracterizes his opponent's point of view, as we have just heard. It was
					 either a deliberate effort to mischaracterize my position or he simply was not
					 listening.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made it amply clear that my colleagues and I believe
					 that there is an appropriate but limited function for certain forms of
					 government assistance when related to our overall international development
					 objectives, as part of our overall strategic objectives. There is some limited
					 role, but those functions now performed by the EDC which could be performed in
					 the private sector ought to be. It is very simple.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course whenever a conservative in this country makes
					 an argument of that nature, immediately a Liberal or a socialist jumps up and
					 suggests that we are advocating the elimination of government and the sort of
					 night watchman state, which is an absurd, laughable, ridiculous
					 mischaracterization of our view. Our view is simply that through history, the
					 market in this country and every other jurisdiction in the world by and large
					 consistently produce more wealth and better results at lower costs, raising
					 people's standard of living, than does the state. It is a fundamental principle
					 which cannot be contested.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I simply want to say that we do believe that companies
					 that need financing will be able to find that financing and insurance in the
					 private sector. The member said that $45 billion of exports happened because of
					 government intervention. What nonsense. The member talked about being
					 simplistic. He does not understand the first principles of economics if he
					 really believes that. It is called moral hazard. Any company worth its salt is
					 going to seek government financing for export deals it would execute without
					 that financing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is, what are the opportunity costs? How
					 many companies have spent how many hours and how much time filling out how many
					 forms and changing their export business in order to satisfy the EDC and to get
					 government financing? There is enormous opportunity costs associated with any
					 government granting program of that nature. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would simply suggest to the member that it is much
					 like the government's Team Canada missions. They go abroad with a big dog and
					 pony show. Companies which are signing up deals anyway are told to initial
					 memoranda of understanding when the Prime Minister is there. Then the
					 government says that the Prime Minister has created $5 billion or $10 billion
					 of new trade with that jurisdiction. That is absolute nonsense. Commerce
					 happens despite the intervention of government, not because of it.</p>

					 tremendous pressure because of the events that have taken place. As such one
					 does not have to be a rocket scientist to know that trade globalization by

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the member raises an excellent point. As I
					 have indicated, the economy both domestically and internationally is an
					 entirely different one than it was even a year ago, even six months ago. I
					 believe we are undoubtedly in a domestic recession and a large international
					 recession. One of the first signs of that has been and will continue to be a
					 reduction in trade, both exports and imports, from Canada and many other
					 jurisdictions. This is a unique opportunity for us to reconsider our trade
					 policy and in particular, the role of EDC. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been some times that the government and some
					 of its ministers have been willing to look beyond the status quo, beyond the
					 old way of doing things. I would encourage the government to adopt the attitude
					 of change, of reform, of free markets even though it may not suit its ideology
					 from time to time. This is such an instance. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government should look at taking the functions of
					 EDC and putting them in the private sector which could be better served that
					 way. That would assist our export companies at this time of uncertainty that we
					 are now encountering at the international level.</p>

					 Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada,
					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to begin second rebating
					 debate on Bill C-30, an act to establish a body that provides administrative
					 services to the Federal Court of Appeal, the Federal Court, the Court Martial
					 Appeal Court and the Tax Court of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal objective of the bill is to improve the
					 efficiency and effectiveness of the administration of the Federal Court of
					 Canada and the Tax Court of Canada through certain structural modifications to
					 these courts. As important, these amendments are designed to respect fully the
					 courts' independence and to ensure the continued provision of the high quality
					 of justice that Canadians have come to expect from these courts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our constitution establishes that responsibility and
					 powers for courts administration is shared between the judiciary and the
					 government. On the one hand, it is the responsibility of the government to
					 provide and be publicly accountable for the provision of the necessary
					 resources required to support the courts' functions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief justices on the other hand are responsible and
					 accountable for the effective administration of the courts as it relates to the
					 judicial function. It is a constitutional requirement that the courts enjoy an
					 established level of institutional or administrative independence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the seminal case on judicial independence, Valente
					 v. the Queen, the Supreme Court of Canada indicated that an institutional
					 independence requires that the judiciary remain in control of all matters
					 bearing directly on the judicial function.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that the administrative structure
					 proposed in Bill C-30 creates the appropriate balance between judicial
					 independence and financial accountability for the use of public funds in a
					 manner that meets or surpasses the test in Valente. I would add that the courts
					 have agreed that the proposed structure satisfies the constitutional test for
					 institutional independence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasize, however, that it was not
					 solely the constitutional imperative but, as important, the practical realities
					 of shared responsibility for courts administration, that led to the proposed
					 structure of the courts administrative service. Between the two poles of their
					 respective authority and accountability, there is a large operational and
					 policy area in which both government and the judiciary have an interest and a
					 role.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recognition of the need for government-judicial
					 partnership in this area was the starting point in developing the reforms
					 reflected in the bill. The objective of these reforms was not to alter the role
					 of the chief justices in the administration of their courts. Rather the
					 proposed structural reforms would build on the current strengths in order to
					 achieve improved efficiencies through a consolidated administrative service at
					 the direction of a single experienced senior official.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed courts administration service was
					 developed partly in response to efficiency concerns that had been raised by the
					 former auditor general in 1997 with respect to the administration of the
					 federal court and tax court.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government and courts jointly recognized that there
					 was an opportunity to be responsive to the auditor general's concerns, without
					 undermining either the requisite institutional independence of the courts or
					 the high quality of justice they are committed to delivering. Designing an
					 administrative structure with the input and collaboration of the judiciary was
					 seen as a key to ensuring its viability and ultimate success.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for that reason that the proposed model was
					 developed in close collaboration with the Federal Court, the Tax Court and the
					 Court Martial Appeal Court. The advice and views of the chief justices were
					 sought throughout the process on both the overall structure and its technical
					 implementation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore pleased to be able to advise hon.
					 members today that the proposed new courts administrative service enjoys the
					 full support and commitment of the courts. I am equally pleased to advise that
					 the former auditor general also expressed his satisfaction and support for the
					 proposed reforms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out that the former auditor general had
					 recommended the complete merger of the federal court and the Tax Court of
					 Canada as a means to address the administrative in efficiencies he identified.
					 However, after serious consideration of all of the former auditor general's
					 recommendations, the government has decided against wholesale merger of the
					 courts and opted instead for consolidation of the administrations
					 only.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Federal Court and Tax Court are established
					 and respected national institutions that separately and ably perform important
					 necessary functions. The government is satisfied that the overall structure of
					 the two courts is essentially sound and that the proposed consolidated courts
					 administration service would achieve the auditor general's objectives for
					 improved co-ordination and overall efficiencies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to advise that following introduction of
					 former Bill C-40, the predecessor of Bill C-30, the then auditor general
					 indicated his support for this approach. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a letter to the Minister of Justice dated June 26,
					 2000, the former auditor general wrote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are confident that the new courts administration
					 service will provide the strong and cohesive administrative framework necessary
					 to ensure the effective and efficient use of public resources.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the consolidation of the current
					 administrative services of the two courts into a single courts administration
					 service, Bill C-30 includes two other important structural reforms: first, the
					 creation of a separate Federal Court of Appeal; and second, a change in the
					 status of the tax court to that of a superior court. I would like to first
					 provide more details on the courts administration proposals and then explain
					 the objective of the two latter proposals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have indicated, the most significant structural
					 modification in the bill is the consolidation of the current administrative
					 services of the two courts into a single service. The service would serve the
					 administrative needs of the Federal Court, the Tax Court and the Court Martial
					 Appeal Court. This would entail common management of all aspects of
					 administration, including court facilities, registries and related real
					 property and common corporate services. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill provides that the courts administration
					 service would be headed by a chief administrator. This experienced senior
					 official, appointed by governor in council, would be responsible and
					 accountable to parliament for all matters of administration relating to the
					 courts. The bill expressly provides that the judiciary would continue to be
					 responsible for all matters relating to judicial functions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have indicated, this structure contemplates
					 regular and ongoing collaboration between the chief justices and the chief
					 administrator in their areas of shared interest and responsibility. Regular
					 consultations with individual chief justices and their associates will no doubt
					 be a regular mode of operation. It is noteworthy that the bill expressly
					 requires that the chief administrator consult with the chief justices when
					 making decisions concerning the establishment and operation of registries and
					 when preparing budgetary submissions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is expected that the judiciary and the chief
					 administrator will work toward consensus with respect to all important
					 decisions relating to the effective operation of the courts, there may be
					 occasions in which their respective views differ sufficiently that a definitive
					 decision needs to be taken. To provide for such occasions, which we expect
					 would be rare, the bill provides statutory authority for chief justices to give
					 binding written directions to the chief administrator on any matter within the
					 authority of the chief administrator.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to pause here to make what may appear to be an
					 obvious point. The proposed courts administration service and all matters of
					 courts administration would remain subject to the same legal and statutory
					 framework as other federal government institutions, including the estimates
					 process, the Financial Administration Act and the applicable public service
					 employment statutes. Any directions that may be provided by a chief justice to
					 the chief administrator under this proposal would have to be consistent with
					 that framework.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courts administration service will be at arm's
					 length from the government, thus reinforcing an appropriate degree of
					 independence. However, the bill also provides for improved accountability,
					 particularly before parliament, for both administrative effectiveness and
					 probity in the use of public resources. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief administrator would be required to report
					 annually to parliament on the administration of the court and would appear
					 before parliamentary committees to answer questions on the courts' estimates.
					 In fulfilling his or her duty to account for all aspects of court
					 administration, the chief administrator would have the discretion to publish in
					 the annual report any written directions from the chief justices. In addition,
					 the chief administrator could use the written directions in the context of any
					 appearances before parliamentary committees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the main elements of the proposed courts
					 administration service. The proposed structure has the support of all the
					 affected courts as well as the former auditor general.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second element of the proposed reform in the bill
					 would alter the structural relationship between the Federal Court Trial
					 Division and the Federal Court of Appeal. The objective of this reform is to
					 clarify the respective roles of the chief justices of the trial court and the
					 court of appeal, and to ensure the most efficient judicial management of each
					 court.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the court of appeal and the trial court are
					 two divisions of the same court with the chief justice responsible for the
					 overall management of the court. The bill would create two separate courts. The
					 current chief justice would continue as chief justice of the Federal Court with
					 responsibility for judicial management of the court of appeal. The current
					 associate chief justice of the trial division would become the chief justice of
					 the separate trial court with overall management responsibility for that court.
					 This structure is the norm in most provincial superior courts. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final key reform element would confer on the Tax
					 Court of Canada the status of superior court. This change of status is intended
					 to recognize the Tax Court as a well respected institution that provides an
					 exemplary service to Canadians. Superior court status would also establish the
					 Tax Court as a full equal partner with the other three courts in the newly
					 consolidated administration. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that this change of status
					 would not result in either enhanced remuneration or jurisdiction for the judges
					 of the Tax Court. The judges of the Tax Court already receive salaries and
					 benefits at the level equivalent to superior court judges. Moreover, superior
					 court status for the Tax Court is intended to support and reinforce the
					 administrative objectives of the structural changes. The court does not seek
					 through these reforms to effect any substantive change to the current
					 jurisdiction and remedial powers of the tax court.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that these reforms will receive
					 widespread support from all those served by the Federal Court and Tax Court. By
					 creating a single administrative framework, as I have just described, the
					 opportunities for administrative improvements and efficiencies will be
					 effectively realized and the high quality of justice that Canadians expect from
					 these important national institutions will be maintained.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government puts forward the bill and I commend it
					 to parliament for consideration.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-53747"></A><a HREF="#Int-53750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-53745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick (Prince Albert,
					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, what is the purpose of Bill C-30? It is a
					 very simple bill consisting of 94 pages in length. The bill would establish a
					 body that provides administrative services to the Federal Court of Appeal, the
					 Federal Court, the Court Martial Appeal Court and the Tax Court of
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the benefit of Bill C-30? The auditor general
					 said one benefit might be some cost savings if the bill were passed. The member
					 referred to the independence of the administrative side of the court system as
					 one rationale for this. I am not sure what that has to do with the independence
					 of the judiciary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third benefit we should look at is a greater
					 efficiency of the court system, although the other side of it has a cost factor
					 attached to it. Presumably there will be cost savings by bringing this
					 administrative regime into being. However will people be laid off now that we
					 are consolidating all the courts into one administrative system? If one
					 administration system is to be instituted, will there be some labour savings
					 from it?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will there be empty government spaces as a result of
					 the consolidation? Will paperwork be reduced? Who will manage this change and
					 who will measure whether we get the results the government says we will get out
					 of it? I do not know how clerks and other people who work in the court system
					 have anything to do with the question of greater independence of the judiciary.
					 Who will measure it to see whether it is worth all the time and trouble to do
					 it?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the name of saving some dollars and bringing greater
					 efficiencies, there are 54 pieces of legislation affected by this one little
					 change. How much time did lawyers in the justice department spend to find out
					 which 54 pieces of legislation will be affected by this one minor change? How
					 many hours did they work on it? How many hours will it take to fully implement
					 the legislation?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there were 1,000 copies of a piece of legislation
					 that the government needs to carry out its duties affecting 54 pieces of
					 legislation in both official languages plus the regulations that go with it, it
					 could work out to something like two million pieces of paper. Yet the
					 government says that it is for the environment and that it will not waste
					 resources and so on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will check the quality of this administrative
					 system? We went through all the trouble of tinkering with the bill. Is there
					 anyone in charge to see whether we will get any quality improvements from our
					 judicial system? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many people outside the judicial system who
					 have tons of complaints about the system and the lack of response to their
					 needs when they required justice. Is there anything in the bill that measures
					 quality improvements in the delivery of our judicial services?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liberals believe that if there is a problem out there
					 all they have to do is have the justice department manufacture another law and
					 order a result. I am sure in the government's mind it could get cats to bark if
					 it got the justice department to work on it. All the cats in Canada would be
					 barking the minute the government passed it through the House, got it through
					 the Senate and made it law.</p>


	<A NAME="T1810"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1810)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the problem I have with the bill. It is a
					 knee-jerk reaction to consolidate administrative services under one roof, with
					 the assumption that all these pluses will come out of it. I am very skeptical
					 that any real results will come out of it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has a tendency to believe that if things
					 can be centralized and consolidated they will get better. For 125 years it has
					 managed native and aboriginal services in the country from coast to coast out
					 of one centralized department in Ottawa. Do we have anything positive to show
					 for that? We have welfare dependency, poverty, and a lot of problems that we do
					 not like. That is the government's way of dealing with it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government said it would be a good thing if it ran
					 our pension system to guarantee pension benefits for Canadians. What do we find
					 after 30 years of it operating our pension system? We have a very dismal type
					 of benefit package in relation to what people have contributed to it. We have a
					 huge contingent liability. We are imposing huge surcharges and extra charges on
					 other people to deliver those things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like the fisheries department. The government has
					 been running the fisheries department for a long time. If I look at the
					 fisheries correctly, the Atlantic Canada fisheries are almost dead. The B.C.
					 fisheries are close to that. There are probably more people working in the
					 fisheries department than there are fishermen in the country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals have a lot of belief in that sort of
					 thing: if they could build a few more stories on top of the justice department
					 and pass a few more pieces of legislation then everything would look
					 up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the changes to 54 pieces of legislation how
					 much time will it take the government to retrain all its administrative people
					 so they can learn all the new changes that will take place? Will it be holding
					 a whole series of meetings over the next six months to retrain people on the
					 great changes it has introduced under Bill C-30?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to the area of whether we will get any
					 real benefits from consolidation. At one time there was a supreme court trial
					 division, provincial courts of appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada. We did
					 not have the Federal Court of Canada. For over 100 years the country got along
					 without the federal court system. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals thought they needed another court system,
					 a federal trial division and a federal appeal level, even though we already had
					 those in existence in the provinces with our provincial courts of appeal and
					 trial divisions of the superior courts. The Liberals appointed those judges and
					 set their salaries, but we had to have another layer of judges.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very confusing in a jurisdictional sense. It is
					 very complex and difficult to decide where an action or proceeding should take
					 place, whether it should go through the provincial or federal court system.
					 However when it gets to the Supreme Court of Canada it all ends up in the same
					 place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government really wanted to consolidate things
					 and bring some real clarity, accountability and savings in terms of tax
					 dollars, it would consolidate the federal system with the provincial court
					 system. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would eliminate 200 judges and save $4 million a
					 year at the bare minimum without even getting into all the clerical help and
					 everything else. That is an area in which we could benefit from some
					 consolidation, but the Liberal government does not do things that way. It does
					 not want to downsize the empire it helped to build. A lot of its pals in the
					 legal community would lose potential esteem by being appointed to one of these
					 courts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some comments made by a colleague about the
					 independence of the judiciary. I have a lot of problems with that
					 argument.</p>


	<A NAME="T1815"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1815)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our system is based on the British system we have
					 inherited and refined. In the final analysis the 301 people who came to the
					 House of Commons, providing that public sentiment is with us, should have the
					 final say on the laws of Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the courts. They are not elected and not
					 directly accountable to anybody. They are there for life or until they retire.
					 They do not have to face the media or parliamentarians. If we say something
					 that is not quite right for some of them, we can be held in contempt of court
					 by them. They have a lot of power. I am disturbed at how much power we have
					 transferred to the courts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the Ressam case that we dealt with in the
					 House, one of the problems with Ressam and our immigration refugee system was
					 the courts. They decided that we did not make the rules in the House, that they
					 did, and that if they did not like someone being sent back to some country like
					 Algeria they would not send him back.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not agree with transferring power from a
					 democratic institution to an institution that is not democratic, and then
					 transferring more and more power. I do not know how the secretaries, the clerks
					 and the administrative people in the court system have anything to do with
					 judicial independence and the separation of powers of the judiciary in the
					 court system. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is another tendency where we are transferring fiscal
					 power from the House of Commons, from the finance minister and so on, to the
					 courts. They are making court decisions that are imposing huge financial
					 burdens on Canada and on the taxpayer. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indirectly they are now getting to a position where
					 they can start deciding who in the public service comes within the ambit of
					 judicial independence. They will have the final say on the benefits package,
					 the salary benefits that are paid out to these employees. I find this
					 disturbing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have thought that based on experience the
					 government would realize the tendency to move in this direction is wrong and
					 that we will have to back off in a lot of areas. The Americans will make us
					 back off in a lot of areas, as will the United Nations with its conventions on
					 deportation of refugees. We will have to back off, get off our high horses and
					 use some common sense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am disturbed the government would be giving more
					 power to our court system. The courts have plenty of power and do not need any
					 more than they already have.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are kind of reluctant supporters of the bill. It is
					 a very timid type of bill. If the government had some courage it would be
					 looking at a serious consolidation of our judicial system and at some of the
					 big time savings we could have on a year by year basis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt whether the bill will save anything. By the
					 time we are finished implementing it, changing all these laws and retraining
					 everyone, we will be in the hole for a long time. My Liberal friends figure
					 that if they pass a law, bingo, everything will be okay, that tomorrow the law
					 will be in place and everything will fall into place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the way things are managed in the world. If
					 we want results we manage those results; we do not order them or command them.
					 The government has to learn that. It is very poor at that and it is time it
					 started looking at a whole different way of doing public
					 administration.</p>

					 (Berthier--Montcalm, BQ): </b>

	 Mr. Speaker, it is a good thing I do not have much
					 time to talk on this bill, because I do not have much to say on such a bill,
					 except that we support its passage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one in this House can oppose the desire to modernize
					 the major federal courts and bring them together into a single administrative
					 body.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those not watching earlier, the aim of this
					 legislation is to combine the administrative services of the Federal Court of
					 Canada, the Court Martial Appeal Court and the Tax Court of Canada. Clearly
					 then, the Federal Court Act and the Tax Court of Canada Act will be
					 amended.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim is a worthy one. It is somewhat like what the
					 Government of Quebec did for the administrative tribunals. The aim was to help
					 people find their way around in the statutes and in the courts that had any
					 bearing on taxpayers' rights. The federal government is doing the same thing
					 for three of its courts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we examine Bill C-30, we realize that the
					 objective of the bill is to be found in clause 2. This is usual. There was no
					 effort to have a preamble that contained nothing but empty wishes, as has been
					 the case with some government bills in the House, including the Young Offenders
					 Act. It had a fine preamble that was practically meaningless, and the courts
					 interpreted it that way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this bill, instead of being included in a preamble,
					 the aim of it appears in clause 2. It should always be this way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 provides:</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>2. The purposes of this Act are to
						  </small></td>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>(a) facilitate coordination and co-operation among the
						  Federal Court of Appeal—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think anyone can oppose that. The bill also is
					 intended to:</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>(b) enhance judicial independence—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, I do not think that anyone in this House
					 can object. I would have preferred it if the government had gone even further.
					 If it wants the courts to be totally independent, it should perhaps change the
					 way federal justices are appointed, which is very archaic. The appointment
					 continues to be made by one or two people in cabinet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also has as an objective:</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>(c) enhance accountability for the use of public money in
						  support of court administration—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that grouping together all the resources and
					 putting these three courts under the same administrative umbrella will ensure
					 greater efficiency. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I object to, but this is to be expected from a
					 Liberal government, is that it is always a little hard for the government not
					 to engage in politics and partisanship, particularly after being in office for
					 years. There are many friends to reward. For example, the appointment of the
					 chief administrator will be purely and simply a partisan appointment. Sure, the
					 government will consult judges of the Federal Court of Appeal, the Tax Court of
					 Canada and the Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada, but the final decision
					 will be made by the governor in council. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all intents and purposes, the process with the
					 chief administrator will be exactly the same as with the judges of the federal
					 court, supreme court and superior court. It will simply be an appointment by
					 the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to achieve the laudable objective of
					 enhancing judicial independence, we should begin with the appointment process.
					 We should begin with the appointment of the chief administrator, if we really
					 want to be consistent with the purpose of this legislation, which is not the
					 case right now. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I really like in this bill is that the chief
					 administrator will report to parliament.</p>


	<A NAME="T1825"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1825"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1825)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 states:</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>12. (1) The Chief Administrator
						  shall, within six months after the end of each fiscal year, send to the
						  Minister of Justice a report on the activities of the Service for that year.
						  </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>(2) The Minister of Justice shall
						  have a copy of the report laid before each House of Parliament on any of the
						  first 15 days on which that House is sitting after the day on which the
						  Minister receives the report. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all well and fine that there is a report to
					 parliament, but since the chief administrator reports to parliament, why is it
					 not parliament that appoints the chief administrator?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the government House leader is saying no. I
					 understand, because that would mean they could not appoint their friends to
					 these positions. Yet, of course this would enhance independence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it is fine for the chief administrator to report
					 to the House, but the appointment needs to be reconsidered.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is there the chief administrator, there is
					 also a series of judicial administrators. This bill's weakness, in my opinion,
					 is the series of appointments and this government's approach.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, the objective is laudable. It is similar to
					 the Quebec national government's approach to its administrative tribunals. The
					 federal government is taking up their idea. That is fine. These days we have to
					 streamline and group administrations together. This is what the federal
					 government is doing.</p>

					 Transport, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise tonight to address
					 this very important issue.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to deal with the impact of September 11 on the
					 air transport industry from two perspectives: security and safety and the
					 financial viability of the industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously on September 11 a total review of safety and
					 security measures was instituted and that is ongoing. Before planes returned to
					 the sky after September 11 Transport Canada instituted tougher, more rigorous
					 standards which were developed in consultation with the FAA.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important Canadians understand that we have
					 instituted tougher security measures at airports, both for screening of
					 passengers and employees but also on planes. It is also important to impart
					 this information because the country needs to have people go back to the skies.
					 We must encourage people to fly because flying is safe, especially with the new
					 security measures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the measures have included: limited access to
					 restricted areas at airports; security controls and screening checkpoints have
					 been tightened; increased police presence at major airports; increased
					 passenger screening; enhanced baggage security measures; measures to prohibit
					 small knives and knife-like objects on board aircraft; the requirement for
					 cockpit doors on all Canadian airline passenger flights, domestic and
					 international, to be locked for the full duration of the flights; the purchase
					 of advance explosive detection systems for a number of Canadian airports; and
					 the active pursuit with the FAA, European authorities and others of security
					 improvements to cockpits, including fortifying cockpit doors. We are in the
					 process of implementing further enhancements to passenger screening and
					 additional security measures with respect to cargo shipments. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My strategy since the tragic events have unfolded is to
					 announce initiatives as they are ready to be implemented, not to stand and make
					 some big speech for public consumption but to announce them either in question
					 period as I did with cockpit doors, in scrums or in other venues, and be
					 available in the House of Commons every day since parliament has opened to
					 answer questions from hon. members on a daily basis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a lot made of the announcements of Mr.
					 Bush. I do not take those announcements lightly. Except for the issue of
					 federal marshals on board planes, Canada's new security measures mirror or
					 complement initiatives taken in the U.S. In some cases the U.S. mirrors our own
					 regulations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While allowing armed sky marshals on flights is not a
					 direction in which Transport Canada is actively going at the moment, we will
					 carefully consider all practical means to improve security. A comprehensive sky
					 marshal program would have serious practical and financial implications which
					 would need to be considered in co-operation with other departments and
					 agencies, including the RCMP.</p>

	With respect to the U.S. measure on funding of $500
					 million for cockpit modifications, we are now discussing similar modifications
					 with the industry. With respect to the measure to restrict the opening of the
					 cockpit doors, I announced that prior to the U.S. announcement. With respect to
					 the fortifying of cockpit doors to deny access from the cabin to the pilots in
					 the cockpit, together with funding for cockpit modifications, we are pursuing
					 these issues with the FAA and European authorities because any new regulations
					 really have to affect Boeing in the U.S., Airbus in Europe and Bombardier.
					 Those funding issues are now being discussed with the industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another measure the U.S. is bringing forward is that of
					 alerting the cockpit crew to activity in the cabin and ensuring continuous
					 operation of the aircraft transponder in the event the crew faces an emergency.
					 Again, we are working with the FAA and others to make the best use of new
					 technology to enhance aircraft security. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are part of this effort. It is a transborder, it is
					 an international effort.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. announced the establishment of new standards
					 for security operations. We already play a strong role in the management and
					 oversight of airport security services. Our current role includes setting
					 standards for the training and performance of screening personnel. Transport
					 Canada employs inspectors across the country at all major airports to oversee
					 the test and performance of screening procedures. Our inspection and testing
					 procedures have been increased since September 11. We have retained additional
					 personnel, many of them with experience in security and other technical areas,
					 former Transport Canada employees. We will be building on that as the weeks go
					 ahead. In this case the new U.S. measures bring them more into line with
					 Canadian practice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the supervising of the passenger
					 baggage security at 420 commercial passenger airports in the U.S., we already
					 play a strong role in the management and oversight of airport security
					 services. This includes setting the standards for training and performance of
					 screening personnel. The U.S. is following Canada in becoming more involved in
					 security oversight. The government's assuming direct management and operation,
					 which of course was the practice a few years ago, is something that has been
					 advocated by many in the House. We are not closing the door on anything, but I
					 would like to have the views of hon. members on this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, the president of the United States talked about
					 extensive background checks and test screeners and security personnel. We are
					 already doing this. We are working with the RCMP and CSIS conducting background
					 and security checks of anyone requiring a permanent restricted area access
					 pass, including screeners and airside workers. Steps are already under way to
					 further improve the clearance program. In fact, again the U.S. is adopting
					 practices which are already in place in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not to say that we have all the wisdom. We are
					 learning from the FAA. We are working together. Canadians have to know that
					 there will be a seamless security regime in North America. It does not mean to
					 say that we cannot do things our own way, implement our own measures as we did
					 on September 11. Of course the FAA was comfortable with the measures that we
					 instituted on September 11, as we were comfortable with theirs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the remaining minutes I want to talk about the
					 viability of the Canadian airline industry because there has been a lot of
					 discussion on that in the last few days. Certainly the House provided
					 leadership in the restructuring of the airlines because we ensured that the
					 interest of the general public, travellers, employees and small communities
					 were protected. Despite the difficult problems of merging operations of the two
					 carriers in the last 18 months or so, and there have been many bumps as we know
					 and we all have our own little tales to tell, frankly Air Canada has done a
					 very good job on a macro level of merging the two carriers. In recent months it
					 was turning its attention to improved customer service and plans for the future
					 when the business environment began to change.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-26 was designed to protect and enhance
					 competition and express confidence in the ability of the industry to meet the
					 needs of the travelling public. That competition was there before September 11.
					 The market share domestically of Air Canada declined from about 82% to 65%.
					 Even before the events of September 11 the combination of an economic slowdown,
					 a rise in fuel prices and a major drop in the level of business travel began to
					 take a bite out of the airline industry worldwide. Canadian carriers, including
					 Air Canada, announced plans to adjust its operations to the new realities.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrible events of September 11 and the major cost
					 of the shutdown period have pushed the airline industry, already suffering from
					 the beginnings of an economic downturn, into a tailspin. The losses threaten
					 the financial viability of some carriers. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation has been made worse because many
					 travellers choose not to fly or use alternative modes for travel. Forward
					 bookings are down.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the changed conditions, airlines all
					 over the world have announced painful restructuring programs to deal with the
					 crisis. Air carriers have announced layoffs, capacity cuts and aircraft
					 withdrawals. Within two weeks, over 125,000 jobs worldwide have been lost,
					 including in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock prices of major carriers around the world have
					 declined dramatically in the aftermath of September 11. Carriers have
					 experienced problems in raising loans as the perceived risk of investing or
					 lending to air carriers has increased. The cost of the shutdown, the drop in
					 revenues from declining air travel and the inability to borrow money has placed
					 a great strain on the cashflow of most Canadian carriers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisis in the airline industry has wider impacts
					 beyond the industry itself. The drop in airline travel has affected a broad
					 range of related industries, NavCanada, airport service providers, aerospace
					 and tourism to name but a few.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reassure Canadians that the government
					 will take firm action to maintain the viability of the Canadian airline
					 industry throughout this crisis. I want to hear the views of members of the
					 House tonight before the government moves forward. I must remind my colleagues
					 that the government has already acted in some areas, such as in providing 90
					 day indemnity for third party war and terrorism liability for essential
					 aviation service operators in Canada. I think that since September 11 we have
					 shown that we want to act and we are prepared to act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has a view on the future of the airline
					 industry. However, I can say categorically that the government is committed to
					 the continued viability of all of the air carriers in the industry and
					 especially our nation's flag carrier, Air Canada, which is the world's 11th
					 largest airline. We are committed to that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape and the form of Air Canada as we go forward
					 in the months ahead is something for debate in this House and is something to
					 be determined. I believe that when this is all done, Air Canada and the other
					 companies affected will come out of this crisis stronger and renewed to provide
					 Canadians with the kind of air service that they want and deserve.</p>

					 Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam, Canadian Alliance):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, all of this hype and that is it. A
					 statement. There is no commitment to legislation, no commitment to coming to
					 the transport committee, no announcement of broadening security measures. The
					 transport minister bragged about the fact that he has new security measures,
					 but he has not said whether or not they are permanent. He has not entrenched
					 them into law. He has not in fact apologized for Transport Canada's one in five
					 failure rate in smuggling replica guns, knives and bombs past
					 security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the reforms the minister is offering to change
					 that? He has offered no legislation whatsoever. He has talked about new
					 technologies at the airport, new screening devices, but he has not announced
					 that the airport staff and security teams are going to be trained on the new
					 technologies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> There was a bomb scare in
					 Calgary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. James Moore:</b> As the hon. member just said,
					 there was a bomb scare today in Calgary. There is a concern in the airline
					 industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transport minister said that he likes to come to
					 question period to make small little announcements in scrums. That is not what
					 the country needs. The country needs a broad, firm public statement and a
					 showing of leadership by the transport minister. Frankly we need to see what
					 happened in the United States on Thursday last week.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. President George W. Bush stood in Chicago with the
					 transportation secretary and the governor of Illinois and announced some bold
					 initiatives. It was not just some fluffy rhetoric or a prepared statement. It
					 was not a bunch of fluff like we just heard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president said that the U.S. is going to put 12,000
					 air marshals on planes. It is going to retrain all airport security staff . It
					 is going to look at whether or not it should re-nationalize airport security.
					 He made some bold initiatives and committed some real capital and some real
					 financial resources to making it a reality.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood before the American people on CNN, live on a
					 national, global network and said, “Fly the friendly skies. Our standard of
					 living will not be impacted by these terrorists. There are air marshals on the
					 planes. You are free to fly. There are new security measures on the ground”. He
					 made real substantive announcements. He said, “Get on planes. America is behind
					 you. We will not have our standard of living impacted by these terrorists”.
					 That is the sort of leadership we need to hear in Canada but instead we have
					 gotten fluff and a vague statement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to move specifically to the issue of Air Canada.
					 The debate has been hyped all day. Frankly I do not know that many Canadians
					 were holding their breath for serious answers, but we were looking for them and
					 hoping for them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;September 11 did have a devastating impact on airlines
					 around the world. Canada has been no exception. In other countries leaders have
					 undertaken bold initiatives to reinforce public confidence in the airline
					 industry and to quickly address the public security concerns with regard to
					 flying. They understand only too well that the best way to restore the
					 international health of the airline industry is to put people back in airline
					 seats where they belong.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Airplanes filled with passengers more than any
					 government bailout of cash that may be proposed is the long term solution to
					 airline competition in Canada and around the world. I must say it is more than
					 difficult to fully engage in this debate regarding financial compensation for
					 the airline industry given the absence of some crucial information.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, the fact is that neither Air Canada nor any other
					 air carrier has publicly stated the compensation amounts they are
					 seeking.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, neither Air Canada nor any other air carrier has
					 submitted a written request for tax dollars.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, we have not had a full audit and accounting of
					 the rumoured lost revenue to the air carriers as a direct result of the
					 terrorist attacks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four, neither the transport minister, the finance
					 minister nor the Prime Minister has publicly and unequivocally ruled out even
					 the most inflated rumoured requests for taxpayer dollars giving the House and
					 the public no clear indication of their direction vis-à-vis a possible bailout
					 for the air industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five, neither the transport minister nor any other
					 cabinet minister has tabled in the House or before any of the standing
					 committees a specific proposal as to how the government should assist the
					 airline industry in this time of difficulty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six, the finance minister has not committed to bringing
					 in a budget at any time in the foreseeable future. Therefore, parliamentarians
					 are left without a clear sense of Canada's fiscal capacity to assist any
					 industry let alone the airline industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that absent this data, absent having these
					 fundamental questions answered, this debate has been rendered largely neutered.
					 Absent this information, this debate is taking place in an information
					 vacuum.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That having been said, as the transport critic for the
					 official opposition, there are some principles I would like to outline that
					 should guide this debate as we move forward.</p>


	<A NAME="T1845"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1845"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1850"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1840"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1845)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is a dangerous game to go down the road of
					 subsidizing business without a clear objective and an end to the subsidization
					 in sight. To reinforce this point, I would like to quote Air Canada CEO Robert
					 Milton. When he appeared before the Commons transport committee on Wednesday,
					 October 27, 1999, he said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>For Canada what we really need to do
						  is to draw a line in the sand and say we're going to stop these unnatural
						  market forces taking place. We're going to truly do what the minister said two
						  and a half months ago and let the market forces prevail in order to achieve a
						  really sensible competitive set in the industry where competition can really
						  flourish. That's what I believe will happen if the government gets out of the
						  game and lets the market prevail.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Milton was right then, but I am afraid that it may
					 now be up to others to address this principle.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a second principle, it is, I would say, a moral
					 obligation for members of parliament, those of us entrusted with overseeing the
					 spending of billions of taxpayer dollars, to ensure that those dollars are
					 spent efficiently and appropriated to the areas of highest collective priority
					 for Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent days, various Canadian air carriers have made
					 statements regarding the financial impact of September 11 on their businesses.
					 We, as the official opposition, are prepared to consider any proposal that is
					 tabled in the House. With regard to Air Canada specifically, we understand that
					 Air Canada was reported to have requested roughly $1 billion prior to September
					 11. The debate should be focusing on how to assist Canada's airline industry in
					 dealing with the drastic consequences of the September 11 attack. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering this, we are prepared to examine the
					 airlines' reservations for September, October, November and December of this
					 year and compare them to similar numbers in recent years with a view to trying
					 to determine the financial impact on each airline due to the events of
					 September 11. These numbers can be compiled and they will help answer questions
					 surrounding how big an impact the attacks had on the industry and how much
					 money Canadians might be asked to contribute.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That having been said, the situation with Air Canada
					 prior to September 11 must be taken into account. It has lost $168 million in
					 the first quarter of 2001 and $108 million in the second quarter, but was
					 forecasting a pre-tax profit of $28.6 million for its third quarter, which
					 includes July, August and September airline traffic. The net financial reality
					 of these three quarters has been abysmal. Normally if an airline cannot turn a
					 profit over the summer season its long term viability is in doubt.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that my time is running low but I want to
					 make this point from the official opposition very clear. If any compensation
					 from the government is forthcoming, for the official opposition it must follow
					 three guidelines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number one, it must maximize taxpayer and consumer
					 benefits. Number two, it must be fair to all carriers and that includes the
					 view from the official opposition that Air Canada should not be subsidized by
					 taxpayers in order to create a low cost regional carrier that can be seen to
					 drive its competitors out of business. Number three, Air Canada should ask for
					 taxpayer bailouts only after it has maximized all other avenues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Milton in his speech in Montreal last week said
					 that he has over $1 billion in cash on hand, he has assets that he has not
					 refinanced and he has credit that he has not tapped into. All these other
					 resources need to be tapped into fully before taxpayer dollars are asked
					 for.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, as a fundamental principle of this party,
					 any potential bailout must come to the House for a full vote. There must be no
					 secret deals. This should not be decided by cabinet in the absence of the
					 contributions of the members here, in the absence of the full House. It should
					 come to the House for a full vote, a free vote. That is the only way to do this
					 properly. Until then, Canadians and the official opposition certainly hope to
					 see much more concrete, not rhetorical, leadership from the Minister of
					 Transport and the Prime Minister than we have seen thus far.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, let me read again the motion now before
					 the House. It says:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That this Committee take note of the
						  difficulties experienced in the Canadian airline industry.</small></td>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To listen to the Minister of Transport, the industry's
					 problems are all linked to security issues. He told us that he has solved all
					 these problems. He has had or will have changes made to cockpits. He was very
					 eloquent about the viability of the industry. What he promised is that he would
					 look after things if the industry ever got into trouble.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what the Minister of Transport had to say in a
					 debate that is surely watched by some air industry workers. After all, Air
					 Canada did announce 9,000 layoffs; Air Transat, 1,300; Rolls Royce, 22; and
					 Pratt &amp; Whitney, 600. All the government has to say for itself today is
					 that security in the cockpit will be improved, which brings us back to the same
					 old question “Does the government have a plan? If so, will it tell us what it
					 is?”</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been requests from the airline industry. Air
					 Canada was one of these. Can we know today what Air Canada asked for, and what
					 the government's financial situation is? How is it capable, with the taxpayer
					 money, of predicting the impossible, this tragic and horrible situation that
					 occurred last September 11, putting the safety and security of air travellers
					 in jeopardy as well as the future of an entire industry that is highly
					 prosperous in Canada, and in Quebec in particular?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a debate as important as this one today, an
					 emergency debate on the airline industry, all that we get out of the Minister
					 of Transport is “We have improved security”. As was necessary. It was what
					 everyone would want to see to restore travellers' confidence. That was obvious.
					 The decision has been made to reinforce cockpits, and we agree with that. What
					 about the 13,602 jobs lost in the airline industry in recent weeks? What about
					 that? That is the debate we thought we would have seen develop here in the
					 House today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois will give its position to the
					 minister. That is what he wanted and we are prepared to do so. What we want is
					 for the airline employees not to be the ones that have to pay through job
					 losses for the entire problem arising out of the September 11 events. That is
					 what we want. That is what the 13, 602 workers want from the minister. They
					 want to have job security, as far as the events of September 11, which were not
					 of their doing, are concerned. It is as simple as that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today then, it is clear: the airlines must be helped,
					 in all sectors, the men and women who have lost their jobs or will do so in the
					 weeks to come, because of this dreadful situation to which they had no
					 connection and for which they assuredly did not ask to lose their jobs. That is
					 what we are proposing: to help the struggling airlines and the entire
					 aeronautical and aerospace sector to absorb all the repercussions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now seeing the domino effect of these sad
					 events. People are less inclined to fly. Airlines are losing money. This has an
					 impact on aircraft manufacturers and parts suppliers. The whole industry will
					 be penalized. If we look even further, there are repercussions also on the
					 tourism industry and on everything international tourism could bring to Quebec
					 and Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to know if the government is willing to deal
					 with all job losses resulting from events beyond the control of any of the
					 employees who have been laid off since September 11. That is what we want to
					 hear today. The government has the money. We know that the accumulated surplus
					 since the beginning of the year is estimated at nearly $10 billion, and the
					 government has access to that money. Is it ready to sit down and negotiate with
					 businesses, to find ways of getting the industry back on its feet? That is what
					 we want to hear. We want to know if the government is willing to help all
					 sectors that have suffered losses because of the sad events of September 11, be
					 it the airline industry, the aeronautics industry, international tourism or any
					 kind of tourism. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what we are hoping to see develop tonight. That
					 is what the Bloc Quebecois will focus on over the next few days. We will not
					 stop asking questions because we want to know what the government plan is and
					 what the airlines' demands are. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take the case of Air Canada, we know very well
					 that, prior to September 11, Air Canada had made requests. Cuts had already
					 been announced. There was talk of 3,500 jobs being lost. In Air Canada's annual
					 report to shareholders on May 15, the president, Mr. Milton, had already
					 announced that there would be staff cuts in his company, which were to be
					 achieved through voluntary departures, authorized leave, and attrition. No one
					 would have their job ripped away from them. This was the policy Air Canada had
					 announced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a request for loans. We were told that
					 there would be a request for $500 million in loans to help buy new aircraft.
					 The company asked for a $500 million reduction in federal government airport
					 fees, as well as a reduction in fuel tax. These were requests made by the
					 company prior to September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are requests about which the Bloc Quebecois will
					 be very demanding. We do not wish to enrich the shareholders of a private
					 company without due cause. We want everyone to be very clear on this: we are
					 prepared to agree to assistance to the industry for all the problems associated
					 with the September 11, 2001, attacks; but the industry will have to pay for
					 mistakes it made on its own prior to September 11, 2001.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, the minister told the House that errors were
					 made along the way. What the public needs to understand is that those mistakes
					 were not made only by the industry. The government also made mistakes when
					 planning the integration of the two airlines, because that is what we are
					 talking about here, the integration or merger of two airlines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the circumstances, we have to be able to put
					 things in perspective for the benefit of those who are watching us. We need to
					 cover the losses incurred by the industry since September 11. Investors and
					 shareholders have to face the music for what happened before September 11, just
					 like the other companies have to do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a press release, WestJet announced it was doing
					 fine, that, despite the tragic events, it was in top shape financially. It was
					 in great shape at the beginning of the year, unlike Air Canada. As we can see,
					 some companies did well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to tell the men and women who are
					 watching us, who work hard to pay their taxes, that the federal government will
					 not spend their money to correct the mistakes made by some airlines managers.
					 We will leave it to the shareholders to assess the decisions made by the CEOs
					 and the boards of those companies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with the serious impact a tragedy like the
					 terrorist attacks of September 11 has had on the airline industry, the
					 aeronautics industry and the international tourism sector, what we want and
					 what we need is a governmental action plan. We know the federal government has
					 money. Some of that money could be made available following a thorough debate,
					 and not just the rhetoric we heard from the Minister of Transport
					 tonight.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evening, on the strength of a motion as simple as
					 “That this Committee take note of the difficulties experienced in the Canadian
					 airline industry”, the minister managed to boast about the merits of his
					 decisions on security, for which he guaranteed that, if the industry had a
					 problem, it would have the support of his government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that the minister must reveal now or
					 never the demands of the industry so we, with him, may be able to make
					 recommendations. How much money does the government have to help out the
					 industry and the 13,602 people who, as we speak, have seen the layoff notices:
					 9,000 men and women at Air Canada will lose their job, 1,300 employees of Air
					 Transat, 2,680 people at Bombardier, 22 at Rolls Royce and 600 at Pratt &amp;
					 Whitney. So, we have 13,602 people who have paid their taxes like everyone else
					 and who did not deserve to lose their job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the result of a single day, a single tragic event we
					 all deplore, they are today, with their families and their children,
					 practically out in the street. This event occurred, and the government made no
					 provision for special assistance or for money to be available to help these
					 13,602 people and the others who will join them in the coming days.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope there will not be others. We do not want to be
					 prophets of doom, we want no more loss of jobs, but these are the logical
					 consequences of the domino effect in an industry that strongly felt the
					 backlash of a catastrophe Canada had never imagined.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that the government makes the right decisions

					 types of industry and the amounts that should be made available so that the men

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Chairman, I would like to acknowledge all the
					 members who are here this evening to take part in this take note debate to
					 highlight some of the key issues related to the September 11 attack.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the airline industry perspective, we are looking
					 at three specific types of issues. First is the security of airports. Second,
					 is the devastation of the industry and the economy and the domino effects it
					 will have. Going along with that, third, and it is important that we list it
					 and pay special attention to it, is the number of workers who will be laid off
					 as a result of the number of the companies that have been affected. This has
					 been mentioned by my colleague from the Bloc and we need to highlight that as a
					 key issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the last issue and the second one, it will involve
					 not only the transport minister's willingness but the willingness of the
					 members of his cabinet to do what was intended by their own departments. I will
					 comment on those a little further.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will start off by commenting on the security. The
					 minister mentioned a number of things that have been done. Quite frankly, a
					 number of things now being done as we go through airport security, such as
					 checking with electronic devices and all these things, have been in place for a
					 number of years. They should have happened all along, but there was a failure
					 to ensure that they were being done. Electronic devices were always supposed to
					 be checked. Every laptop was to be opened and every cellular phone and camera
					 checked. However the travelling public gets in the way of that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security guards take a lot of flack at the airports.
					 They earn $6 or $7 an hour.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> $7.20 in Halifax.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais:</b> Mr. Chairman, my colleague
					 from Halifax says $7.20 in Halifax. Every couple of years the contract comes up
					 for renewal, but the employer tells them if he cannot keep his costs down he
					 will not get the contract and they will be out of a job. I have seen it happen
					 on numerous occasions where those contracts have changed every two years in
					 some airports. It is crazy. How can we have qualified, experienced people
					 working at an airport doing airport security checks making $6, $7 or $8 an hour
					 and taking the flack they take? It just does not work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened since September 11 is that the
					 failure in the security system has been highlighted and people are uneasy. I am
					 not saying that that is the reason the attack happened on September 11 because
					 it is not. I do not think that because those few knives went through that the
					 attack happened. However, people are more uneasy now because they are
					 questioning everything that is happening as far as security. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week or the week before that, ten pounds of
					 cocaine were found on the inside panel of an Air Canada jet landing in
					 Winnipeg. It had come from Bermuda or the Bahamas through Florida up to
					 Winnipeg. I believe that has happened on eight occasions in the past five years
					 where drugs have been put in panels in different spots in an aircraft. It comes
					 right through all the systems. A fairly easy way to deal with that, at a little
					 more cost, is to have sniffer dogs to check this out.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all recognize that when drugs are involved, this
					 increase tension and the risk of danger on aircraft because these people can be
					 dangerous to deal with. Workers are enticed in some of those areas to be part
					 of that, thus increasing the risk to travellers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a security perspective, a number of things have
					 happened. The minister announced improvements to the cockpit doors. I think
					 everyone thought, thank God at least that has happened. People will at least
					 feel they have a door between them and that hopefully it will be thick enough
					 that it cannot be booted in. Let us face it, if any of the doors on the planes
					 right now were locked, we could boot them through with a little kick of our leg
					 or a push of our hand. So hopefully that will help. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have to wonder that, if the pilot of the
					 plane knows his crew and passengers are at risk, how strong will he feel about
					 not opening that door? No question, September 11 will have changed a lot of
					 people's thoughts, but in time how would that pilot feel about leaving his crew
					 and passengers on their own? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe other security issues are being looked at
					 such as cameras or contact devices where there can be notification that
					 something is happening.</p>


	<A NAME="T1905"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1905"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1910"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1900"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1905)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are all excellent security measures, however,
					 there is a lot more that could be done and it needs to be done. If we want to
					 get the confidence of the travelling public back, it is not good enough just to
					 say the skies are safe, get up there and fly. We have not proven to Canadians
					 that the skies are safe, not when reports indicate that 18% of checks show that
					 all these different things go through. These are not little things, not like a
					 little file that is in someone's pocket, but guns and explosives. That is
					 crazy. It should not happen. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly from a security perspective there is a lot
					 that needs to be done. As a caucus we strongly believe that the department and
					 the Government of Canada needs to take over the responsibility of operating the
					 airport security, without question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a sure way. I do not agree with everything the
					 U.S. has suggested, certainly not the air marshals. An air marshal with a gun
					 on a plane is not going to make me feel a whole lot safer about flying. There
					 are some things that can be done to improve the security measures. Having the
					 national security overseeing what is happening and doing part of the baggage
					 checks now is definitely a plus.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of the situation of the industry
					 and where it was before, we all recognize Air Canada was in a bit of a pickle
					 before September 11. If anyone goes through their clippings from Transport
					 Canada and from the industry, they will see numerous clippings about the number
					 of job layoffs in the province. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my perspective that just exemplifies what we as a
					 caucus, as a party, have maintained all along. Merging those two airlines
					 without any kind of regulation was not going to save the airline industry.
					 Something as basic as regulating domestic capacity would have saved both
					 airlines, Air Canada and Canadian Airlines, if we had done it internationally
					 with a strong international market. In other words, if there were so many
					 people flying out of Calgary, then there should be so many carriers there. If
					 they reached a certain number, then another carrier could be allowed
					 there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not allow this cutthroat kind of approach
					 where we have two aircraft right after one another and not expect to have
					 problems in the airline industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Air Canada, Mr. Milton made a lot of promises he
					 did not kept. I listened to that man say to numerous employees and numerous
					 people that this was what they were going to do and that everything would be
					 wonderful. He said that he would save the world, that everyone would have their
					 jobs and that it would be fair for Canadian Airlines and Air Canada employees.
					 It has not been, but in spite of that they tried to work it out. It was not a
					 pleasant situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of that, even at this crucial time with a
					 destabilized industry, he is still talking about pulling certain jets off from
					 regional areas and starting up a low cost airline. Mr. Milton should give his
					 head a shake. If we will not fly with his company on regular basis, why would
					 we fly with him on a low cost one? Most air passengers will say that they
					 cannot get much more low service than what they have got for the last little
					 while. Jokes about the pretzels are minor. The service was not good just a
					 short while before September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that perspective, there needs to be some rules put
					 in place. I hope the market can handle this. I hope all these people who
					 believed in a capitalized, private market that would set the tone and pace and
					 provide everything we need feel good about this because it has not and it has
					 jeopardized the whole airline industry in our country. It has not worked.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage, especially at this time, the government if
					 it does not do any other regulation, at least regulate domestic capacity and do
					 not allow the airlines at this time try to cut each other's throats and
					 jeopardize the whole industry. There needs to be a cooling off period. We need
					 to put up the cautionary flag like on the race track. The yellow flag is up for
					 this many laps guys, until the industry gets a chance to stabilize. Let us see
					 how that works. We might find it is the best thing we can do for the airline
					 industry in Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To also assist in the economic downturn, we mentioned a
					 number of things over the last couple of weeks. I will credit the minister
					 because he has been in the House probably every day since this all started.
					 Although we do not always appreciate his answers, to his credit he has been
					 here each and every day, taking the flak and doing it rather
					 graciously.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that I have never been one for favouring the
					 cutting of the airport leases because I always felt that if they wanted this
					 privatized system, they could pay market value. </p>


	<A NAME="T1910"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1910"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1915"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1905"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1910)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However with the situation in the airline industry, the
					 government should look at cutting the airport leasing fees or reducing them,
					 whatever needs to be done to give all airports in Canada a fair shake, and as a
					 result make sure they pass that savings on to the airlines. Again, everyone
					 benefits.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government should be giving greater support to
					 NavCan so it does not have to increase its fees and hopefully be able to low
					 them. Again, this would benefit every airport in Canada. We would not have a
					 situation where only a few benefited.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will not often hear us talking about giving
					 corporations tax deferrals, but this probably is one of those times where
					 interest free loans are an appropriate way to go. This is a crucial time. The
					 rules changed on September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of the workers, the Minister of
					 Finance will have to give up part of his cash cow, the EI fund of the Minister
					 of Human Resources Development. He will need the assistance of his colleagues
					 in the cabinet. That EI fund is intended for specific things. Numerous members
					 have criticized the use of it over the years. It has been used as part of
					 general revenue. This is a crucial time and that EI fund needs to be there for
					 all those workers who will feel the impact.</p>

					 unions such as the IAM, CUPE, CAW--</p>

					 Rock—Langley, PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Chairman, I will begin by complimenting the
					 minister on his attending and giving us an opportunity to share with him some
					 of our thoughts on where the government should be going with regard to the
					 crisis in which the airline industry finds itself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that the world of aviation changed
					 on September 11 but not all the problems that are being faced, particularly by
					 Air Canada, began September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the problems, quite frankly, are decisions that
					 the government made in responding to the last crisis in the airline industry. I
					 think Canadians would agree, some more so than others, that there is a
					 financial responsibility that the Government of Canada has in regard to the
					 airline industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear that Canadians accept the fact that
					 the Canadian government should be responsible for the direct costs that
					 Canada's airlines have incurred since September 11. There might be different
					 ways of dealing with that direct cost. It could be money up front and then,
					 after audited statements, additional support given months down the road. It
					 could also be credit assurances or whatever. Canadians will accept the fact
					 that the direct costs incurred should be covered.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of my colleagues this evening have spoken about
					 the security issues. I think Canadians want the federal government to take back
					 control of security at all airports in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only three countries in the world that the
					 government does not control airport security: Canada, the United States and
					 Bermuda. Canadians want the security of knowing that it is the Canadian
					 government that is looking after the security at airports and making sure that
					 the security agents are well trained and paid well so they do not end up
					 rotating because of cheap labour.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Canadians are comfortable with that but what
					 September 11 showed us is that it is not just airline pilots that have to be
					 concerned. Those airplanes were used as a tool of destruction. Many innocent
					 people who merely went to work in an office building ended up losing their
					 lives. So it is not just airline passengers for whom security is
					 required.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Canadians would also acknowledge that the
					 government has a role to play in insuring airports and airlines for terrorist
					 activities if that insurance cannot be found at a reasonable cost in the
					 private sector. I believe Canadians would be comfortable with the government
					 making sure that airlines and airports are properly insured for events such as
					 the one that occurred.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where we get into greater concern is when we start
					 talking about the loss of revenue that airline companies may be looking forward
					 to or not looking forward to. This is more of a controversial
					 subject.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada has made its claims based strictly on the
					 numbers used in the American legislation. The American legislation does permit
					 subsidizing the loss of business but it is very specific. It is for a period of
					 time from September 11 to December 31. It is not for the ongoing loss of
					 revenue for days, months or years ahead. The response from government has to
					 keep that in mind.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question we must ask is whether Canada is obligated
					 to follow the U.S. numbers. We certainly do not in the agricultural industry.
					 We do not subsidize our agricultural industry to the degree that the Americans
					 subsidize their agricultural industry. One has to question the premise that
					 because the U.S. government is subsidizing to this tune that Canada must do the
					 same.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Air Canada is competing with an American airline for
					 a flight from say Toronto to New York and the American airline is being
					 subsidized for that flight, would it be fair that Air Canada or the other
					 Canadian airline is not subsidized? There is an argument that there is some
					 support that would be required. The question is how we give that support. If it
					 is given through insurance, through direct costs, through taking away the
					 security measures and other things, then there are ways of helping the airlines
					 to compete.</p>


	<A NAME="T1915"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1915"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1920"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1910"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1915)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly think that Air Canada and all officials who
					 are concerned about this issue must have the right to appear before the
					 transport committee to give their case so that all the evidence and all the
					 information is done in a public way. If decisions are being made and having to
					 be supported by the Canadian people then they have the right to have exposure
					 to the information that is being laid on the table.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government does decide to subsidize--and I am
					 not convinced that is the decision it should come to other than the direct
					 costs and other measures that I have put on the table--conditions need to be
					 placed on the table at the same time. The unions have to agree to waive the no
					 layoff provision. Every airline company around the world is dealing with
					 restructuring. It is not right that a Canadian airline feels it does not have
					 to deal with that whole restructuring as well. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sympathize with all the employees. I would wager that
					 there is not any other constituency in the House that has as many airline
					 employees as my constituency. A lot of people will be directly affected by any
					 kind of layoffs. However I have to ask the government how it could possibly
					 pick out one industry and protect that one industry from layoffs when it would
					 have to consider the trucking industry, automotive industry and every other
					 industry that has been or would be affected by the events of September 11.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourteen thousand British Columbians have been laid off
					 from their jobs because of the duties placed on softwood lumber. Communities
					 have been devastated because of these layoffs. Do these 14,000 British
					 Columbians not deserve the same consideration that the government might be
					 giving to the airline workers? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern I have, which I have raised before,
					 is how the government could subsidize an air carrier that is in direct
					 competition with another existing air carrier in Canada. That would be
					 subsidizing one business to provide competition to another. It is very hard to
					 find any rationale to support that. I do not see any indication on the part of
					 Air Canada to change its direction on that issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limitations would have to be placed on compensating
					 high income employees or officers of the company if the government decided to
					 subsidize the company. The government would need to examine the recent stock
					 market dealings of major Air Canada shareholders, including its largest
					 shareholder, Caisse de Dépot et Placement which apparently made a large profit
					 for selling short on Air Canada stocks. In other words, profiting from the
					 decline of Air Canada stocks. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In looking at the comparison between Air Canada's
					 quoted market value and WestJet's quoted market value, I cannot understand how
					 the major airline in Canada, the flagship in Canada with almost a monopoly on a
					 lot of air travel, is worth one-third of what a small, low cost carrier can be.
					 The management issues there have to be questioned if the government is planning
					 on any kind of subsidization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned earlier that not all of Air Canada's
					 problems relate to September 11. From a high of $17.50 in November 2000, Air
					 Canada shares had dropped to $6 before September 11. After September 11 they
					 dropped an additional $2.50, just a small portion of that initial $11.50 drop.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada's current market valuation is $270 million.
					 I would suggest to the government that puts Air Canada in a position where the
					 private sector could very easily manage to adjust the management of the
					 company. The private sector is in a position where it could come in and take
					 over the company and do a restructuring.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we contrast that with WestJet, we really have to
					 wonder if that is not what needs to happen here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the federal government should not take
					 an equity position in Air Canada, but rather should eliminate the restrictions
					 on private, domestic ownership to allow more capital into the company. The
					 private sector solution is the best solution and it is available.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a little concerned that we should not even be
					 having this debate. Had we allowed the private sector more ability without that
					 limitation, perhaps it would have looked after itself over the years. However
					 that was a decision that was made a couple of years ago and now we need to make
					 sure that we do not make another decision that prevents Air Canada and all
					 Canadian airlines from being viable, well run airlines that compete and are
					 solvent companies that give good, solid, long term employment to their
					 employees whom they treat fairly. I think that can happen with private sector
					 involvement. I would urge the government not to get involved in any kind of
					 equity share in Air Canada.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Chairman, since September 11 the Minister of
					 Transport has been on the job from the first hour. Canadians and members of the
					 House forget that within three hours nearly 300 planes that were not allowed in
					 U.S. airspace landed at every airport across Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within days other security measures were taken,
					 measures which have not been mentioned tonight by some members of the
					 opposition. These included drug sniffer dogs at airports across Canada. We are
					 not saying tonight that it was enough. Nor is the minister. He announced a
					 number of other security measures that would be taken. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most important, it is tremendous that we as members of
					 parliament have an opportunity tonight to put forward our ideas and thoughts
					 and the views of our constituents on the floor of the House of Commons. The
					 minister is here and I know the Prime Minister is listening to the debate. I
					 hope he moves quickly on some of the constructive and doable ideas tomorrow in
					 cabinet or before the end of the week. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin with an experience I had Friday night. I
					 landed in Toronto and got into a taxicab. Coincidentally the driver was Nick, a
					 man who has been in the cab business for years and who happens to be, of all
					 things, from my riding. I asked him how business was. He said that since
					 September 11 his business was down by 50%. When someone makes a wage of $500 to
					 $700 a week and it is all of a sudden cut in half, members must know what a
					 shock it is to one's system, one's family, one's grocery bill and one's rent
					 payments. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appeal to the Minister of Transport that the debate
					 tonight is not about Air Canada and the airline industry alone. It is about the
					 thousands, not hundreds but thousands, of small and medium size business men
					 and women from across the country who are affected by the operation of the
					 airline system. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When twenty daily flights from New York City to Toronto
					 are all of a sudden reduced to three there is a ripple effect on the person who
					 does not have the leverage to go to a bank manager for more money. Most people
					 cannot go to a bank manager and ask for the difference until cabinet and the
					 House of Commons decide what will happen with the airline industry of Canada.
					 It does not work that way. Banks do not operate that way. They will give time
					 to the airline industries and the lead corporations but not to the thousands of
					 small business men and women.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appeal to the Minister of Transport, the Prime
					 Minister and our cabinet colleagues to move quickly on this file. I will be
					 specific in my recommendations tonight because it is a night of thinking
					 outside the box. It is a night of trying to propose creative, constructive and
					 doable ideas. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not share all the ideas of the previous speaker,
					 my colleague from the riding of South Surrey--White Rock--Langley. It is no
					 secret that I have always been a person who believes in government
					 intervention.</p>


	<A NAME="T1925"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1925"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1930"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1920"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1925)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are facing a national challenge in terms of consumer
					 confidence. Anyone who would challenge consumer confidence in airlines right
					 now has not been walking through airports or flying on airplanes. We have a
					 crisis in consumer confidence in our airline industry and we need to do
					 something to deal it. I propose the following ideas for restoring consumer
					 confidence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we should figure out a way to creatively apply a
					 50% reduction to all airline fares for youth under 25 and people over 60. This
					 would encourage and stimulate people to fly again, not just with Air Canada but
					 with all airlines in the country. It would have a tremendous ripple effect on
					 our tourism industry and national unity. It could be achieved through the
					 transport committee but it should be done quickly. The reduction would apply
					 only to flights within Canada, only outside the busy periods of Christmas and
					 Easter and only for eight months.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to stimulate people to get them back on
					 airlines. I have a lot of respect for President Bush. He gives great pep talks
					 and tells everyone to fly to Disneyland next weekend, but it will not happen
					 that way. In this country we must give it a stimulus. This is where I disagree
					 with my friend from South Surrey--White Rock--Langley because her party says we
					 should have no government stimulus.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I have stood behind Air Canada from the first
					 day I was elected to the House and will continue to stand by it. Two years ago
					 it was voted one of the best airlines in the world. It has been going though a
					 super bad patch since September 11, but I believe any taxpayer money that goes
					 into stabilizing Air Canada should be exchanged for equity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Industry would be responsible for that.
					 I hope the Minister of Industry, who is sometimes referred to as Captain
					 Canada, would agree to stabilize Air Canada even if that means it becomes a
					 crown corporation again. That is my view. I know some people will not like it
					 but it is my view. That is the beautiful opportunity of having a debate
					 tonight.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the member for South Surrey--White Rock--Langley
					 said something tonight that I totally agree with. She said we cannot deal with
					 only one airline. We must do something in the next couple of weeks that will
					 stimulate all industries and every sector of the economy. Even before September
					 11 we knew we had a bit of a fragile economy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think my friends in the Canadian Alliance will love
					 this idea, and I call on the Minister of Finance and every member of the House
					 to consider it. As a bold, broad step to stimulate the whole economy we should
					 spend the GST for one year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would cause a blast of confidence to go through
					 the entire economy. It would touch every sector. It would stabilize the
					 temptation of many industries that are thinking of laying off Canadians. As
					 taxpayers and as a government we would ultimately pay for this through various
					 government programs.</p>


	<A NAME="T1930"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1930"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1935"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1925"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1930)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful thing about the GST is that we do not
					 need to consult the provinces. We do not need to consult the municipalities. We
					 can come in here and put it to the House. What member of parliament would not
					 support it as a means of re-igniting the economy and touching every sector?
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it would cause the Minister of Finance a bit of a
					 jar because the standard line around here is to ask where we would get the
					 money. However if we do nothing we may have to come back here eight months from
					 now to find more money. Let us bite the bullet and do it now.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-53771"></A><a HREF="#Int-53773"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-53769"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast,
					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Chairman, as always I am sure the finance minister
					 will be pleased to hear the latest suggestion from the hon. member for
					 Toronto--Danforth. He has a reputation for being one of the few policy
					 innovators opposite. It is a well earned reputation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to rise on this take note debate. I thank
					 the House for the opportunity to join my colleague if he would agree to yet
					 again press for a flat tax in the Liberal caucus or a single tax as the case
					 may be. I thank the government and all parties for allowing us to bring this
					 matter forward because the airline industry is a central element in our modern
					 economy, especially in a country so huge.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Canadian who spends many days and dozens of hours
					 every month on airplanes I have a personal understanding of how central the
					 industry is to the flow of traffic, goods, services and human capital across
					 the country. I do not envy the difficult position the transport minister finds
					 himself in although to a great extent he and the government's policy have
					 created the predicament in which they find themselves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the immediate economic consequences of the
					 September 11 tragedy, my colleagues in the official opposition and I support in
					 principle the notion that all our airline companies, not just the principal
					 monopoly of Air Canada but all airline companies, that suffered direct economic
					 harm as a consequence of the shutdown of our airspace and commercial air
					 traffic from September 11 to September 13 ought to be compensated for those
					 losses and any perhaps other provable losses as a consequence of the
					 shutdown.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not yet seen, at least in the opposition, what
					 kinds of losses the airlines might have incurred. I understand from published
					 reports that it could be in the neighbourhood of $100 million for Air Canada
					 and several dozen million more for the smaller air carriers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That seems reasonable because the companies operate on
					 small margins to begin with and their ability to operate is dependent on the
					 government authorizing open air space. For two or three days they did not have
					 that and were unable to operate or generate revenue. Because the shutdown of
					 commercial air traffic was clearly the consequence of a national and
					 continental emergency, I think all parties and all Canadians would support in
					 principle compensation limited to the direct consequences of the
					 shutdown.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in my party support the idea of an appropriate
					 degree of government fiscal support for additional security imposed on airline
					 companies by way of federal regulation. Clearly all Canadians expect the
					 government to engage in a comprehensive review of airline security. We do not
					 think the government has moved quickly enough in regard to certain obvious
					 measures, certainly not as quickly as the government of the United States.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be costs associated with this. In so far as
					 the costs are the result of a federal mandate to protect Canadians and promote
					 public security, my colleagues and I would support limited government fiscal
					 compensation for some of the additional security measures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am disturbed to see certain companies, Air Canada in
					 particular, playing the lobbying game, seeking special interests and engaging
					 in rent seeking behaviour. We understand from published reports that Air Canada
					 approached the government prior to the September 11 disaster for a major
					 bailout in the order of $2 billion. Shortly after the September 11 disaster the
					 CEO of Air Canada upped the ante to $3 billion or $4 billion. </p>


	<A NAME="T1935"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1935"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1940"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1930"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1935)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This raises the question, was Mr. Milton using the
					 outpouring of public concern and compassion following September 11 as a
					 political lever to squeeze more tax dollars out of the federal government? I
					 think that is an important question. I find it quite troublesome that we would
					 have seen his company seeking corporate welfare before this event and then
					 doubling its ante afterwards. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe as my colleague, the member for 
					 Port Moody--Coquitlam--Port
						Coquitlam, has already stated in this debate, we need a strong,
					 vibrant airline industry. We have tens of thousands of people employed in that
					 industry and millions of Canadians served by it. We need to maintain a strong
					 industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However let us not be coy about this. We do not have a
					 strong airline industry in this country. As a result of government inaction and
					 government policy, we have a de facto monopoly, a virtual monopoly, in a
					 tightly government regulated industry in the hands of Air Canada. We have
					 predatory pricing practices. We have a company, even though it has a virtual
					 monopoly, that still has managed to lose money, quarter after quarter and month
					 after month, rather than making the difficult management decisions that it
					 needs to make in order to provide the services and make a profit or at least
					 not continue to run quarterly deficits. That is a management requirement. It
					 ought not to be laid at the feet of the taxpayers of Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge, trillion dollar, complex, free market
					 economy with a number of enormous industries and corporations. If we accept the
					 premise of Air Canada's request for a bailout of some $2 billion, and I think
					 it has gone back down to $2 billion now which really raises the question about
					 on what basis it is making these claims and these requests, we are essentially
					 establishing a precedent that the Government of Canada and the public treasury
					 will be available to backstop and bail out companies in any sector of the
					 economy that find themselves in a period of economic difficulty. That is simply
					 wrong in principle. Every day, unfortunately, dozens if not hundreds of small
					 businesses and entrepreneurs go bankrupt, lose their businesses, have to lay
					 off employees and have to go without incomes themselves because they are
					 struggling to operate in the marketplace. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it would be wrong to prejudice the federal
					 government and the taxpayer to subsidize one chosen industry, one chosen
					 monopoly corporation, at the expense of all of those taxpayers, entrepreneurs,
					 small businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises in various sectors,
					 including the transportation sector, which are struggling day by day to make it
					 by, to make their payroll and to make a profit. We need to treat all sectors of
					 the economy with a degree of equity and not prejudice ourselves in favour of
					 any particular one.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would speak out against any unspecified bailout of
					 any corporation. This is not just with respect to Air Canada. Again, this
					 points to a greater need for a review of government policy in the airline
					 industry to allow for greater competition. I now look forward, in light of
					 September 11, to the government allowing a continental security policy in terms
					 of a common border and a common perimeter so that we can look toward a common
					 transportation policy. I would hope the government would consider allowing
					 American carriers to compete on an equal footing with their Canadian
					 counterparts to give more choices and more services to Canadian
					 consumers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the opposition critic for transport, has
					 addressed a number of security issues that have arisen. I do not need to delve
					 into them. However, I will say in closing that this is a particularly difficult
					 moment. I believe we are moving into a recession. We had negative growth in the
					 last month of the second quarter and the first month of the third quarter. I
					 have no doubt in light of September 11 that we actually are in a domestic and
					 international recession. In fact, the Bank of Nova Scotia is now projecting a
					 $5 billion fiscal deficit for the government in the fiscal year 2002-03.
					 </p>


	<A NAME="T1940"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1940"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1945"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1935"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1940)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That means that it is time to make some tough choices.
					 At a time like this we have an urgent imperative to invest more public
					 resources in areas of national security such as national defence, where we
					 spend less than any country in NATO save Luxembourg, or such as CSIS, which has
					 the lowest relative intelligence expenditure of any major western country, or
					 such as the RCMP, which has had major cuts. These are all areas of the highest
					 public importance and we cannot justify unspecified corporate bailouts and
					 corporate welfare at a time like this when public resources must be dedicated
					 to national security. I hope the government will find the right priorities to
					 govern those decisions in the future.</p>

	Mr. Chairman, I would like to use the few moments I
					 have tonight to talk about three main issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the minister asked me to explain that he had to
					 leave to take part in a meeting. He apologizes and will be back as soon as it
					 is over. His parliamentary secretary, the hon. member for Chicoutimi--Le Fjord,
					 is here and is taking note of what is being said tonight.</p>

	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first item I would like to cover briefly is the
					 matter of safety in our air transportation system. I readily recognize that I
					 am not an expert in this area and I will not attempt to provide advice as to
					 what can be done to improve it. There is certainly a recognition nationwide
					 that it has to be improved somehow. There will be those who are more familiar
					 with these matters who will come forward and provide sound advice and we will
					 improve the system.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a consensus throughout the country
					 that the government must take the lead in ensuring safety and security in the
					 airline industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone I have talked to since the tragic events, the
					 horrific events of September 11, agrees that the government must ensure that
					 Canadian airports and air carriers implement the best security measures
					 possible. The government has a role to play in this area. It must once again
					 assume some responsibilities, ask the RCMP to be more visible, and so on. That
					 is the first point I guess on which most Canadians and certainly the residents
					 of my riding of Ottawa--Vanier, with whom I have had the opportunity to discuss
					 this issue, would agree.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second item I would like to bring up is the matter
					 of insurance companies that a few days after the horrors of September 11
					 decided they were no longer offering a certain item of coverage relating to war
					 and terrorism. I find that behaviour despicable. I am speaking of companies
					 that have been engaged to provide insurance coverage and suddenly decide,
					 unilaterally, that they will no longer offer this coverage no matter how much
					 they are paid.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That essentially put governments in the position of
					 stepping up to the plate. Otherwise the entire system would have been grounded.
					 I congratulate the government for having stepped up to the plate and for giving
					 a 90 day breathing period to the industry to come up with a different
					 solution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that we look in terms of those solutions to a
					 self-insurance mechanism of sorts, whether it be through a co-operative venture
					 involving all partners in the airline industry, whether it be through
					 government or whatever mechanism we eventually end up with on self-insurance. I
					 would hope that at that point we would look at the three other product lines
					 that these insurance companies have not revoked and perhaps offer them to this
					 joint venture, co-operative self-insuring mechanism that we have devised.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unacceptable that the private sector, which I
					 hear being lauded by a lot of people across the way, would in a time of crisis
					 and a time of dire need pull the plug as they have on their coverage. This is
					 behaviour that I would not have expected from Canadian corporations. They are
					 not Canadian. They are multinationals, I gather, and three of them control this
					 market worldwide. I would hope that we have learned a lesson in not trusting
					 monopolies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter of insurance is one that I wish to bring to
					 the attention of the government because I hope it will push these insurance
					 companies very hard and reprimand them for their behaviour.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third item is Air Canada itself. I have to admit
					 that I am one of those who were quick to criticize Air Canada in the past,
					 either because of its casual attitude or because of its lack of service or
					 because of one of its employees or representatives. I have to admit that I am
					 not always pleased, even today, with its behaviour, particularly since it has
					 indicated its intention to ask $3 to $4 billion in government assistance. It is
					 now down to $2 billion. I find this behaviour most reprehensible. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, I think it is absolutely crucial for a
					 country like ours, a country that has trading partners all over the world, to
					 have a national air carrier. I think it is a must. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a national carrier. For a trading nation it is
					 a necessity. Therefore we either deal with Air Canada or we invent another one.
					 We have Air Canada for the moment and I for one think that it would be very
					 detrimental to our economy and to our international reputation should this
					 carrier be grounded. I am of the view that somehow, somewhere, we have to help
					 Air Canada restructure itself and be sure that it can continue occupying the
					 air space that Canadians wish to occupy.</p>


	<A NAME="T1950"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1950"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1955"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1945"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1950)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should we do? On one hand, the company is asking
					 us for money; on the other hand, we do not want to give it a blank cheque, and
					 I agree with that. There is no question of giving a blank cheque to Air Canada,
					 and I think the government was pretty clear on that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must show some imagination. I want to go back to a
					 suggestion made by the member for Davenport. We should invest in Air Canada. I
					 do not think we should buy Air Canada shares that are currently
					 available.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about 120 million shares outstanding. I think
					 Air Canada closed at somewhere around $3.35 today, so its market capitalization
					 is around $400 million. I am not suggesting that the Government of Canada buy
					 those shares, buy back Air Canada. I am suggesting that it should consider
					 making an equity investment to be issued as treasury shares, and it could make
					 a significant equity investment before it goes out to secure loan guarantees
					 and so forth. There might be a package of measures to sustain Air Canada but at
					 the same time protect the Canadian public and its tax dollars.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government should seriously consider some form of
					 investment for which it would receive treasury shares, which would give it
					 seats on the board, and I said seats, in the plural. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is rather important that the government
					 obtain through that mechanism seats, in the plural, on the board to help Air
					 Canada restructure. For instance, having a good presence on the board, it could
					 force Air Canada out of unfair competition, out of the regional carriers, out
					 of the low cost carriers where there are others in the country that are
					 prepared to compete in that area. It could concentrate on long haul flights in
					 Canada and certainly on our international routes, which is what we would expect
					 a national carrier to do. That is my first idea that I would encourage the
					 government to consider. I am not the only one who has such an idea.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is a need for loan guarantees, it goes
					 without saying, especially if the government has a major investment in Air
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, It is perhaps time to act quickly and offer Air
					 Canada employees, those remaining anyway because, unfortunately, there are many
					 fewer than before, an opportunity to buy shares in Air Canada, so that they too
					 are at the table to protect their interests.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An employee share ownership plan that might encourage
					 some equity investments into Air Canada at this time could be very useful,
					 certainly for the remaining employees of Air Canada. It might have been useful
					 for those who may have been given notice that they will not work there any
					 more.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are some of the measures that I think the
					 government should look at: equity investment, some loan guarantees and
					 certainly employee share ownership. As well, once we have seats on the board we
					 can reorganize Air Canada and help it restructure. The government has proven
					 that it can be a good manager. A private-public partnership would help us
					 protect two things. As a private concern Air Canada is focused on maximizing
					 shareholder value. That is its job. However, as a public concern we are here to
					 be mindful of service to the public.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as Air Canada heads into some very difficult times
					 over the next few years, a private-public partnership would be one way of
					 ensuring that the government does not just maximize value for shareholders and
					 profitability, but that it also concerns itself with service to the Canadian
					 public. It is important that we have a national carrier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, the government could ensure that Air
					 Canada reviews the percentage it gives travel agents who sell its tickets.
					 There was a decision on this very recently. Air Canada took a very tough stand
					 against travel agents who sell plane tickets. This would be a way of forcing
					 Air Canada to review this treatment of travel agents which is, in my view,
					 heavy-handed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the basic ideas I wanted to present. It is a
					 very difficult situation and I hope that wisdom will prevail.</p>

	Madam Chairman, I am pleased to take part in this
					 debate. The motion reads:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That this Committee take note of the
						  difficulties experienced in the Canadian airline industry.</small></td>

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to make a distinction between the
					 difficulties experienced before September 11 and those that result from the
					 events of September 11. If the events of September 11 had not occurred, the
					 House would not have met to settle Air Canada's problems, including its
					 longstanding management problems, and problems with the Official Languages Act
					 and with providing adequate services in the regions. It is quite possible that
					 this company, with the type of services that it provides to the regions, is
					 experiencing serious financial problems. It is always necessary to have
					 business clients to succeed and, in the end, make money. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if services are disorganized, as they have been in
					 recent years, it becomes less and less practical to fly. This problem is one
					 that existed before September 11 and it should not influence the efforts that
					 must be made to solve the current situation at Air Canada and in the whole
					 Canadian airline industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened since September 11, since these terrible
					 events? The terrorist attack generated a fear that has resulted in a major loss
					 of clientele within Canada and in terms of the number of passengers coming from
					 abroad, because this is very much an international crisis, since travellers all
					 over the world are still traumatized by what happened. Some efforts should be
					 made in that regard. The most harmful effect being felt today as a result of
					 this loss of clientele is the loss of thousands of jobs everywhere. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years society kept saying “The less governments get
					 involved, the better it is”. We are now realizing that it is important to have
					 a true state, a real state that can take action to ensure compliance. Today, we
					 heard that safety should really be a government responsibility and that we
					 should make sure that security officers are properly trained, that the hired
					 staff is well paid and that it gets the necessary training to do its job.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe these are the essential basic conditions
					 because what has to be done is to get people back to taking the plane. They
					 have to be told that people are flying again. MPs have begun to fly again
					 within Canada. So have others, and this must be made known. I believe a
					 promotional and advertising effort needs to be made to tell people that yes,
					 things are safe again. But, as always in marketing, claims must not be made
					 that cannot be guaranteed. If we are going to assure people that the system is
					 going to be safe, means must be taken first to correct the situation so that it
					 is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, a very thorough assessment of losses is
					 necessary. What are the consequences of the September 11 terrorist attacks?
					 What are their true consequences on the air industry? Have all companies been
					 affected, not just Air Canada? Do they have to be considered as well? As well,
					 we need to realize, and this is very important, that this is going to be a
					 terrible test of our social programs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us keep in mind that EI has been cut markedly in
					 recent years, rather viciously and deeply cut. Today, we have to realize that,
					 in circumstances such as these, an emergency solution has to be found. Also, in
					 my opinion, a long term solution is necessary so that our social programs will
					 not only serve the people in the airline industry who are living through a
					 catastrophic situation, but also the other people also affected by
					 it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tourist industry does not have the lobbying power
					 that Air Canada does, because it is often made up of a number of small
					 businesses. Today, we are already aware that there are fewer tourists from the
					 U.S. and Europe. Why would the tourism industry not also be entitled to some
					 form of government assistance? It is no more responsible than was Air Canada.
					 These elements must therefore be taken into consideration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the EI system is concerned, this afternoon I
					 asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources
					 Development whether the minister was indeed prepared to agree to job sharing.
					 There seems to be some openness toward this, and it must be available as well
					 to all other industrial sectors affected by the situation. We do not want a
					 response like the one given today about “proceeding on a case by case
					 basis”.</p>


	<A NAME="T1955"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1955"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2000"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1950"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1955)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does case by case mean that the important company with
					 a lobby will win points and that the small businesses, which lack the power and
					 influence with the government, will not? The government has to make a clear and
					 definite decision. It must make a commitment to the effect that, yes, it will
					 make airline travel safe, show that it is safe and provide equal help to all
					 industrial sectors that were affected, and will unfortunately continue to be
					 affected, by the events of September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a set of situations that requires a much more
					 dynamic approach than what we have seen from the minister this evening. I was
					 really disappointed, because this afternoon, during oral question period, we
					 were told “Wait for the debate. We will see what the outcome is”. This evening
					 we have been debating practical matters, but they do not get to the heart of
					 the problem and the issue on the table.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like someone from the government to tell us
					 whether the suggestions by a Liberal member, who said the price should be
					 lowered for all young people and seniors, will be the government position. We
					 are anxious to know.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again this is a bit of interventionism. Another
					 attempt at targeting and creating bureaucracy. What it would take basically is
					 something that brings customers back to planes, something that makes them want
					 to fly. It is a good, quick and efficient service. The services provided must
					 meet consumer needs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow morning, even if everyone were asked to take
					 Air Canada planes in the regions of Quebec, we still have the problem of few
					 flights. The customer gets very little consideration. It is not easy to arrive
					 at a reasonable time. When changing planes is involved, it becomes really
					 awful. It is quicker to drive from Ottawa to Rivière-du-Loup than to fly there.
					 This is a fact. It is a specific example and must be addressed in the recovery
					 planned for Air Canada and the entire Canadian airline industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that tonight's debate will make the government
					 understand that it has to show some leadership, so that people can believe that
					 flying is once again a safe and efficient way to travel. Through word of mouth,
					 people will come to realize that flying is once again a valid option and will
					 regain confidence in other industries as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to realize that. We need to show
					 compassion to the people who stand to lose their jobs. When people lose their
					 jobs, it has an impact not only on their families, but even on the corner store
					 operator and on the whole economy. If we take all these things into account, if
					 the Liberals show the leadership the people expect to see from them, I think we
					 will manage to pull through this crisis and find some kind of solution to put
					 the economy back on track. We will erase all the fear the terrorists have put
					 in the heads and hearts of our fellow citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be our main purpose. To show the terrorists
					 that they have not won anything by the attacks they carried out on
					 September 11, we have to pull through, to turn things around, and to restore
					 the people's confidence in the airline industry, which would be in the
					 interests of all Quebecers and all Canadians.</p>

	Madam Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to speak
					 to this take note debate on the difficulties being experienced at present by
					 the Canadian airline industry. Our airline industry has long and short term
					 challenges. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These challenges should be dealt with separately. We
					 should not be mixing apples and oranges. The short term challenges result from
					 the dramatic decrease in the appetite of the consumer for flight travel,
					 especially international flight travel resulting from the terrorist incidents
					 that occurred in New York City, Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania on September
					 11.</p>

	Before dealing with the financial assistance that a lot
					 of us are speaking about tonight, the first issue that has to be addressed is
					 providing consumers with total confidence in the security of our airline
					 system. Our Canadian system is safe and has been safe. Canada has an enviable
					 aviation safety and security record and is committed to improving that record.
					 However the system is not perfect and improvements have to be made.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada and all other countries around the world are
					 taking extraordinary steps to improve the system. Changes must be made in both
					 airport and air flight security. There must be increased terrorism response
					 training for flight crews; increased use of sophisticated technology; total
					 separation of the cockpit from passenger areas; worldwide identification and
					 tracking of known terrorists or people who in the past have associated with
					 known terrorists; and increased penalties for both the travelling public and,
					 more important, the companies that operate within our Canadian airports for any
					 violation of airline security regulations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said tonight that many of these actions are
					 being taken. I compliment our Minister of Transport for the actions that have
					 been taken to date.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the privatization of our airports. I have
					 read or heard nothing that convinces me the Government of Canada is better able
					 to operate the country's airports than the companies that are presently
					 operating them. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improvements have to be made, especially with the
					 financial plight of our smaller airports. The Government of Canada must make
					 and enforce the rules. What the Canadian airline industry needs right now is a
					 return to normal flight levels.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Airline traffic will return. We are seeing positive
					 signs, especially on domestic flights, that the number of passengers is slowly
					 returning. Immediately after the September 11 incident traffic was down by 60%.
					 Today it is my understanding that traffic is down by approximately 20% and
					 decreasing daily.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of financial assistance to Air Canada, I
					 am compelled to recommend a go slow and cautious approach. Any decision has to
					 bear in mind that Air Canada lost $108 million in the second quarter of this
					 year. That is nearly a million dollars per day for every day that it was
					 operating during that period. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Milton, president and chief executive officer,
					 announced that Air Canada had to adopt a new business plan and lay off
					 approximately 4,000 employees. That announcement was made prior to the
					 September 11 incident.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the commitments made by Air Canada during the
					 takeover of Canadian Airlines and incorporated in Bill C-26 were in serious
					 jeopardy prior to the September 11 incident. Any compensation package should be
					 based on losses directly incurred as a result of the September 11 incident, and
					 any package should be available to all airlines operating in Canada. That is
					 the short term solution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike some of my colleagues, I am against the
					 Government of Canada taking over Air Canada. A government owned airline would
					 be cumbersome, uneconomical and inefficient. It would not have the flexibility
					 to operate in today's complex airline industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike many of my colleagues, I am against the
					 Government of Canada taking an equity position in Air Canada. This would be
					 politically pleasing in the short term but would cause considerable grief to
					 the Government of Canada. I see difficulty convincing the public as we go
					 forward that the government is not operating Air Canada. As the saying goes,
					 “if you are in for a penny, you are in for a pound”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industry's long term problems are caused to a large
					 extent by the sheer size of our country. </p>


	<A NAME="T2010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2010"><!-- Hour: 8--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T2005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(2010)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is a geographically large country, the second
					 largest country in the world, with a relatively small population. Servicing
					 cities like Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver will not be the
					 challenge. The challenge will be providing air service to other cities, towns
					 and regions that require economical, stable and reliable air service.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Canada is to remain a strong country, regular,
					 stable and cost efficient service is needed in smaller centres. We need a
					 competitive environment, the environment that existed prior to the September 11
					 attacks. We also need mechanisms that in the long term protect service to our
					 smaller communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the long term and going forward, I invite
					 the transportation committee and the Minister of Transport to look at the
					 following positive recommendations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, all airlines should be required, depending on
					 the number of flights they have, to offer service to outlying communities, to
					 the smaller towns, to the smaller regions. This would be done on a comparative
					 basis, based upon the size of the airline and the flights they
					 operate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, all airlines operating on major routes should
					 be required to accept passengers of a competitive regional carrier at a
					 reasonable cost. This code sharing is similar to the concept that has been
					 already successfully adopted in the long distance telephone
					 industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, and most important, there are many routes
					 because of their remoteness that will require government assistance. Air
					 service is the lifeblood of many communities in the western part of Canada,
					 right across the northern part of the country and in Atlantic
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada provides assistance for roads
					 and wharfs. It assists the rail industry. It is only normal to accept the
					 proposition that some assistance would go directly to the airlines that provide
					 service to these communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is tremendous pressure today, tonight and
					 tomorrow on the government to straighten all the problems of the airline
					 industry. We are under some artificial deadline this week. There is suggestion
					 the train is leaving town and that everyone should be on the train. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am saying tonight is that the trains are already
					 gone from a lot of these smaller towns, cities and regions. They do not have
					 trains and they need air service.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public is returning and will continue to return to
					 the air. The short term difficulties should be dealt with as such. At the same
					 time the government should seize this opportunity, this crisis, to look at a
					 made in Canada solution to the long term challenges facing our Canadian airline
					 industry.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Chairman, I am happy to participate in this take
					 note debate. I will begin by looking at the federal government's role, in
					 particular its role and legacy with respect to Air Canada and the airline
					 industry in general. It is a sad legacy that goes back several
					 decades.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada was incorporated by an act of parliament in
					 1937, although it was called TransCanada Airlines at the time. In 1965 it
					 became a crown corporation and was renamed Air Canada. Like most other airlines
					 it expanded dramatically during the sixties and seventies, largely fuelled by
					 revenues from the population of Canada. However by the mid-1970s rising fuel
					 costs, price wars and the recession took its toll.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before restrictions were removed from CP Air, Air
					 Canada carried almost 80% of domestic air traffic. However passengers and cargo
					 declined drastically in the early 1980s with the recession that occurred. The
					 previous Conservative government privatized Air Canada in 1989. It was a good
					 move as it got rid of some of the crown corporations that were bleeding a lot
					 of money from the Canadian public. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was no surprise that financial losses for Air Canada
					 continued even though it came out of it with a pretty generous restructuring
					 package and a modern fleet when it was privatized.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of the open skies agreement
					 between Canada and the U.S., Air Canada introduced 99 direct flights to
					 Florida. Overseas and transborder flights are where Air Canada earns the bulk
					 of its profits. Domestic service, however, remains a problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Onex bid to merge Air Canada and Canadian
					 Airlines was declared illegal by a Quebec court, the transport minister
					 suspended the competition laws to give the two companies 90 days to talk
					 merger. In December 1999, against the advice of the Competition Bureau, the
					 government permitted Air Canada to swallow its only large competitor, Canadian
					 Airlines, for $92 million or $2 a share. That is where it started to come
					 apart.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a market economy in all sectors in Canada.
					 Essentially 99% of all businesses operate under a market economy. We have a few
					 regulated industries as well. Why was the market not allowed to take its
					 natural course in the time that Canadian Airlines had problems?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bankruptcies occur all the time. Many Canadian
					 businesses are subject to bankruptcies in tough times. It is a natural part of
					 the business cycle. The shares and product of Canadian Airlines could have been
					 picked up by a company. It could have been accomplished for 20 cents on the
					 dollar and a company could have been structured in a way that it could make
					 money. However we gave it to Air Canada, the only major competitor. Not only
					 that, we put it through a regulated environment, took it back to regulation,
					 and the market economy was not allowed to take its course.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when Canadian Airlines was operating and swallowed
					 PWA about 10 years earlier, it acquired too much debt. The same thing occurred
					 with Air Canada when it took on Canadian Airlines. There was too much debt. Too
					 many conditions were imposed in a regulated environment by the
					 government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monopolies are not good for consumers. With 80% of the
					 domestic market the new Air Canada was close to a total monopoly. In the vacuum
					 of competition the Liberals attempted to regulate the situation by setting up
					 watchdogs who, despite having $10 million in fines and jail terms to back them
					 up, turned out to be rather toothless in practice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Transportation Agency was given powers to
					 determine acceptable levels of prices to protect consumers against price
					 gouging. The Competition Bureau was ordered to ensure that Air Canada did not
					 deliberately undercut what little competition it had. It did not take long for
					 the new Air Canada to flex its muscles against smaller airlines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following complaints from WestJet and CanJet the
					 competition commissioner issued a temporary order requiring Air Canada to
					 withdraw a targeted seat sale for routes served by the two discount airlines.
					 This put the Competition Bureau in an awkward spot. An organization dedicated
					 to protecting consumers by enhancing competition now found itself arguing for
					 higher prices.</p>


	<A NAME="T2015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2015"><!-- Hour: 8--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T2010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(2015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government's style of corporate governance
					 is a sham. It is a sad legacy of what should have happened in the country.
					 There is no substitute for the market economy, and we are living evidence of it
					 today when we talk about the difficulties in Air Canada. We have had regulated
					 airlines and airlines that fail. There were three small ones in the last year.
					 RootsAir is one that comes to mind. That is the legacy of the
					 government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada responded by challenging the order of the
					 Competition Bureau on a constitutional basis that was rebuffed by the Quebec
					 superior court. Air Canada tried again before the Competition Bureau but again
					 it lost.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently the whole issue of whether Air Canada is
					 abusing its dominant position by offering tickets below cost to drive out
					 competition is before the tribunal. I recall being in Calgary about a month ago
					 when two Air Canada flights, each half full, left for Vancouver seven minutes
					 apart. Price is not the only way that competition can be discouraged.
					 Overcapacity is another.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the September 11 incident Air Canada was
					 getting busy to launch its own discount carrier and musing about entering the
					 growth charter business. Obviously 80% of the market was not enough for Air
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why a monopoly was less tasteful to the Liberal
					 government than increasing the foreign investment caps or allowing foreign
					 airlines to compete in Canada is not the subject of this debate. However we
					 would like to get involved in that another day. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals should resist the urge to intervene yet
					 again in the airline industry. Let the market take its course. If the company
					 goes bankrupt, somebody will pick up some of that fleet and offer service
					 across the country in a good fashion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance to airline companies could include lowered
					 or deferred air navigation fees, gas tax relief and continued third party
					 liability indemnity. However no bailout for the industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What industry will be next? We have many that are
					 suffering difficulties as a result of September 11. There have been four hour
					 backups at the border with the United States last week. Members should think of
					 the trucking companies and the tourism business in Quebec City and Whistler,
					 B.C., that had conventions cancelled.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any post-terrorist attack drop in air passenger traffic
					 should be allowed to work itself out through the market. Ninety-nine per cent
					 of Canadian businesses operate in a market economy. Why should the airline
					 industry not do the same?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unfortunate reality that existed prior to September
					 11 was that passenger traffic was down. There were too many half empty
					 airplanes flying and too many employees to retain during the economic downturn
					 that we all knew was coming. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no question and answer period this
					 evening I would like to end with a question. If we bailout the airline industry
					 how long will the list be of those who come next asking for the same treatment?
					 Let the market decide what should happen.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Madam Chairman, following the horrible events of
					 September 11, Transport Canada worked together with the airline industry to
					 help them adapt to the new operational realities in the transportation sector.
					 The Minister of Transport and his department, Transport Canada, must be
					 congratulated for the way they are managing the current crisis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layoffs announced by Air Canada last week are not
					 related to commitments made by the airline, which were incorporated into Bill
					 C-26 regarding the merger with Canadian Airlines. It is worth acknowledging
					 that these circumstances are not unique to Canada or North America. Airlines
					 around the world have been forced to reduce their number of flights, and have
					 announced layoffs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada announced that it would be reducing its
					 workforce by 9,000 employees. Four thousand of these layoffs were already
					 announced in August. Eight thousand positions will be cut from the main airline
					 and 1,000 more are to be cut from the regional carriers. Air Canada has also
					 announced that it will be reducing service by some 20%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, our priority for the airlines right now must
					 be to help them until business returns to normal, and all of our efforts must
					 be concentrated on achieving this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not support opening Canada's airspace to foreign
					 carriers. I feel that foreign airlines operating in our country would only be
					 interested in the major routes, leaving smaller Canadian communities without
					 service. Therefore, it is appropriate and even essential that the federal
					 government take the time to review all the issues relating to the airline
					 industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If compensation is provided to the airline industry, it
					 should only be for financial losses directly related to the closing of the
					 airspace following the events of September 11. Any federal compensation program
					 should include the whole industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that there are other airlines
					 operating in Canada and that if we provide some kind of assistance, they must
					 all be treated fairly since they are all equally affected by the events of
					 September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Minister of Transport said on September 27
					 that whatever form this assistance may take, it will be costly. It will cost a
					 lot of money. The Minister of Transport is currently assessing the financial
					 situation of not only Air Canada, but of all the other airlines. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This federal assistance should in no way be used to
					 solve some Canadian airline companies' major financial problems that are not
					 related to the events of September 11. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any financial assistance provided to Air Canada should
					 not give it more resources to maintain its seemingly anti-competitive behaviour
					 and should not allow it to pursue what seems to be a fight for total domination
					 of the market. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the issue deserves to be considered from a
					 different angle. Of course, the tragic events of September 11 have had a
					 terrible impact on air carriers. Unfortunately, the whole transportation
					 industry is affected by this crisis. Be it trucking, shipping or transportation
					 of manufactured goods, the whole industry is weakened by this
					 crisis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Transport referred to this in the House
					 on September 19, when he said there was a need to assess the degree of the
					 dislocation and the damage, and there was no doubt that there had been a lot of
					 it. He added that the airline industry is just one aspect of the transportation
					 industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ensure that any compensation provided is fair
					 and equitable. For that, we must also look at the other components of the
					 transportation industry and not only focus on the airline industry. </p>


	<A NAME="T2025"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2025"><!-- Hour: 8--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T2020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(2025)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of safety, Transport Canada is committed
					 to maintaining and increasing the safety of passengers. In fact, safety
					 measures in place in Canada's aviation industry meet and even exceed
					 International Civil Aviation Organization standards. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to excel even more, the Canadian government
					 has taken extra safety measures. These measures deal with the presence of
					 dangerous substances and sharp objects aboard an aircraft. They also deal with
					 access to aircraft by airport workers, security personnel training, ID photos,
					 improving infiltration testing and reinforcing cockpit doors. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, the Government of Canada must reexamine its
					 policy with regard to the protection of sensitive and highly populated areas
					 such as downtown cores, sites where major cultural or sporting events are held
					 and very tall buildings. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, it is unthinkable and ridiculous that all
					 kinds of aircraft are allowed to get close to the Peace Tower for tourism or
					 for recreational purposes. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, passenger safety must remain the
					 priority of the Government of Canada.</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Chairman, we have heard from a myriad of
					 individuals speaking about security issues and about the best way to approach
					 the issue from an economic perspective. What I would like to concentrate most
					 of my time on are the workers themselves, those individuals who are going
					 through a very uneasy time at home. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am speaking to this from the perspective that my
					 riding of Fundy--Royal will be heavily affected. Members may be aware that the
					 principal reservation system evolves out of the call centre facility in Saint
					 John and essentially half of those workers reside in the riding of
					 Fundy--Royal. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very appreciative of the comments that I have
					 heard from many constituents. The management of the call centre were also very
					 concerned with the issue, as was the vice-president of the Atlantic CAW for
					 local 2213. These people helped to shape the remarks that I will be making.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us first admit that the grand experiment by the
					 Government of Canada failed. It tried to have a private sector company work in
					 the environment of a regulatory regime as if it had a function as a crown
					 corporation. We understand as a point of fact that particular case did not
					 work. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Progressive Conservative/Democratic
					 Representative Coalition is advocating is that we need to look at the issue
					 from a holistic perspective in terms of how we approach this. We must admit
					 that in the coming days, weeks and months the airline industry that we
					 presently have will need to be reshaped and reformed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the ideology that may be advanced by
					 members of the Canadian Alliance, they may not subscribe to one perspective. I
					 would like to compliment our transport critic from Vancouver in that regard. We
					 need to recognize that a lot of the revenues from Air Canada happen from
					 international flights. If the Americans help their carriers compete with Air
					 Canada which may not have governmental intervention, then that would unfairly
					 penalize Canadian companies in their capacity to compete. There are legitimate
					 reasons for us to look at that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Canadians are also concerned about just giving
					 money to Air Canada in the form of a blank cheque. They are concerned that Air
					 Canada may actually use the cash to set up a discount airline. It might have
					 been a good idea but are we going to use taxpayers dollars to compete with a
					 private sector venture like WestJet or Canada 3000? Those are things that
					 should raise legitimate concerns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, there are other methods the Government of
					 Canada should engage. If it does engage in that regard it must do it with
					 respect to what I would see as a logical thing in terms of a severance
					 perspective. It could use the cash to ensure that the employee ratio that Air
					 Canada has per flight compared to maybe a WestJet flight is addressed.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We still need to recognize the fact that although we do
					 have more competition, Air Canada is still part of Canada's national
					 transportation infrastructure. We have to ensure that we do have a competitive
					 national airline but not to the detriment of private sector
					 competition.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to highlight another issue, which is
					 clearly a solution the Government of Canada has to look at and which we have
					 been raising in question period. If we want an infusion of cash, if we are
					 really serious about having liquidity in terms of actually helping the private
					 sector lift this industry, we clearly have to drop the 15% stock share issue
					 and also the 25% foreign ownership issue. Those issues have to be raised as
					 well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Madam Chairman, I want to thank you for
					 the opportunity to participate in the debate. My first priority is the workers
					 affected by this issue. I want to stand with the workers as they go through
					 this transition. I want to thank my constituents who have helped me shape my
					 debate this evening.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Madam Chairman, I would like to thank my colleague from
					 Fundy--Royal for sharing his time. Coming from the far east of the country, we
					 are certainly affected by what is happening as much as anyone in the country,
					 and more than most except for the people from the far west, including my
					 colleague from 
					 South Surrey--White
						Rock--Langley.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newfoundland is often referred to as the rock, even
					 though those who know it know it certainly is not. It is a tremendous place.
					 Ottawa is often referred to as a hard place in which to get anything done. I
					 guess I am always caught between a rock and a hard place. I am at the mercy of
					 Air Canada because basically it is the only regular airline we have coming in.
					 It is basically a monopoly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does it do for service? Let me say this: not very
					 much.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all my colleagues who have spoken, I have concern
					 about what is happening. We saw a tremendous change in the air industry after
					 September 11. In fact, while I am on my feet I should pay tribute to the
					 numerous Newfoundlanders who played a tremendous part in assisting all those
					 who were affected and who helped out the many people who had to land in
					 Newfoundland, at St. John's, Gander and some others, perhaps at Goose Bay and
					 Stephenville. I guess even Deer Lake was affected to a large degree by the
					 people who landed there and had to stay there for quite some time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact one person was met by a friend of mine. He said
					 “So are you stuck here for a few more days?” The person said “I'm not stuck.
					 I've never had such a time in my life”. That speaks pretty well for the members
					 of the Newfoundland and Labrador constituencies and it is no surprise to anyone
					 who knows the area.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However these people from Newfoundland and Labrador who
					 were so gracious are also greatly affected themselves, not only the people who
					 work in the airports, but as others mentioned, the people who work in the
					 hotels, the taxi drivers, the truckers, the tourism industry, the stores. I
					 could go on and on because everyone is affected. Consequently, if we are to
					 help one, we must help all. If we are to help one airline, we must help all
					 airlines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two things we must look at: first, that we do
					 have what we call a national carrier, and second, that a way must be found to
					 keep it flying, but not at the risk of negatively affecting others who are in
					 competition because it is competition that makes the world go round.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Newfoundland if we had more competition we would not
					 have to put up with some of the poor service we have been getting. I will take
					 a minute or so just to illustrate a couple of examples. I can use personal
					 examples from the weekend.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I left here on Friday, rushed to the airport to find
					 out my flight was delayed and got into Halifax to find out we did not have a
					 plane. Finally one was found and when we were ready to board, after another
					 hour and a half wait, there were mechanical difficulties with the plane and
					 more delays. Finally we got into St. John's and I got home at 1 or 1.30 in the
					 morning after driving from the airport. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was coming back on Sunday, most people on the
					 flight I was on would have left home at 12 o'clock to get to the airport in
					 time to check in. We got on our flight, got to Halifax and were told we had an
					 hour's wait. We got up to get off the plane and were told we could not get off
					 the plane unless we were changing planes; if we got off we would not be allowed
					 back on. We waited for an hour and a quarter and then came on to Ottawa.
					 Between St. John's and Halifax, we had a bag of peanuts. Between Halifax and
					 Ottawa, we had a bag of peanuts. It was about eight hours from the time people
					 would have left home until they got to Ottawa, and others probably went
					 further, and they had two bags of peanuts, including a person who had a
					 diabetic condition and needed some sugar. There was no fruit or anything on the
					 plane to give to that person. That is the type of service we get for paying
					 $2,200, round trip.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dangerous thing I heard here tonight was the
					 suggestion that there is a possibility that an influx of money might be put
					 into Air Canada but it would be the responsibility of the Minister of Industry,
					 Captain Canada, as someone said, the person who arrested the Spanish
					 fishermen's boat, gave back the fish, gave them extra quota, apologized, kissed
					 them and sent them on their way.</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Chairman, I have listened to the debate now for
					 over two hours and would probably have to admit that I am only member of
					 parliament now in the House of Commons who can speak from personal experience,
					 because I am technically on leave from Air Canada. I worked for the industry
					 for over 18 years and I am now on leave as I perform my public service in the
					 House of Commons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I begin my remarks, I would like to extend my
					 condolences to the members of all the families of those airline employees who
					 were killed in the unfortunate circumstances of September 11. As an airline
					 employee I know exactly how those people must have felt. That day they stood on
					 the bridgehead, closed the door, said good-bye to the flight attendants, gave a
					 thumbs up to the captain and less than an hour later that plane was on the
					 ground in a disastrous way. I must say that I spent a long time crying during
					 those days, knowing that those airline employees perished in a terrible way. My
					 heart goes out to those families, along with my condolences and those of my
					 colleagues from Dartmouth and Halifax and the rest of the NDP caucus,
					 provincial and federal, across the country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give the House the names of some
					 airline employees so that we can put this in perspective. The fact is that we
					 are not talking about numbers. We are talking about human beings and their
					 families. I was a proud airline employee for 18 years. I must say that in 1997
					 when I was nominated Paul Withers of the CBC said: “The Sackville--Eastern
					 Shore nominations are now complete. The Conservatives have picked the well
					 known, hard working member Ken Streatch, the Liberals have picked the former
					 hard working member of council, Beverley Peters, the Reform have picked the
					 former lieutenant-colonel of the military, Robert Cuthbert, and the NDP picked
					 some airline worker named Pete Stoffer”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is exactly what he said after the nomination in
					 1997. I have yet to forgive that man for that comment, because the fact is I am
					 proud to be an airline worker. I am proud to say that if I am not elected in
					 the next election I would be proud to go back to the airline industry. For the
					 thousands of airline people, their families and the affiliated associations
					 connected to the airlines, I must say that it is a proud and noble job to have.
					 I was very proud to work nine years in Yukon and nine years in the Halifax
					 airport. I take offence to anyone saying that this is just a numbers game, let
					 the market decide everything and we will have it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot believe the PC/DRC would stand up and say let
					 the markets decide. The fact is that the United States has the most
					 unregulated, market oriented airline industry on the planet and it is begging
					 for money from the government. That was long before September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many combinations in the problems of the
					 airline industry. It has very little to do with September 11. I will give you
					 the names of Bob Lochyer, a 26 year employee of Air Canada, Harvey Lane from
					 Newfoundland, a 40 year member of the airline industry, Dan and Jennifer
					 Carrier of Nova Scotia and Dave and Ronalda Savard of Nova Scotia. What a lot
					 of people fail to understand is that this industry has a lot of husbands and
					 wives working together. There are a lot of partners working together in this
					 industry throughout the entire country. When the airline goes into a tailspin
					 for whatever reason it does not affect just one income. It affects the entire
					 income of that whole family. Probably there is not a pilot, an agent, a
					 mechanic or a cleaner on those aircraft who would not move anywhere in the
					 country to follow the job. Airline people are like that. I was like
					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998 I was told I no longer had employment and that
					 if I wanted employment I had to go where my seniority held. Thank God I had a
					 union to protect my interests. I moved to Halifax, a decision I have never
					 regretted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very easy for me to stand up here and rally
					 against Robert Milton, the CEO of Air Canada, but that will not solve the
					 problem of the day. However I will tell Mr. Milton how offended I am by a
					 comment in an e-mail sent to all the employees of Air Canada on September 26.
					 This is the part that absolutely offends me as a person who has watched many of
					 my colleagues follow down to the Canadian regionals, Air Atlantic and everyone
					 else with the promise of jobs, equitable wages and everything else, only to
					 have the rug pulled out from under them. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the e-mail he says that it is expected that the
					 launch of the low fare carrier will mitigate job losses in both the mainland
					 and regional carriers as qualified surplus staff will be hired on a

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to thank the regional carriers. One
					 suggestion I should make is that if Air Canada wants any government money or if
					 the airline industry wants any government money they will have to sell off the
					 regional carriers and allow them to be profitable on their own.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another suggestion is that if the government plans to
					 put in more money it has to have an equity share in the airline industry. It
					 has to make sure that the government has people on the board of directors to
					 give the public a say in the future of the airline carrier.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could go on forever in this regard, but I want to say
					 in closing that as an airline employee myself and now a member of parliament, I
					 salute each and every one of those airline people throughout the country. I ask
					 them to stop fighting among themselves and work toward a positive conclusion so
					 that we can have an airline industry in the future that we can all be proud
					 of.</p>

					 (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, Lib.): </b>

	Madam Chairman, we are a prisoner of our own symbolism.
					 The current Prime Minister is fond of recalling that he got his name as a
					 novice member of parliament by moving a private member's bill that renamed the
					 national airline carrier Air Canada. Since that time, Air Canada's jets have
					 been like emissaries of the country worldwide. They are seen in airports
					 everywhere and they say Canada. The reality is that no major nation in the G-7
					 can afford not to have a national airline and not to have a national air
					 carrier whose planes are shown in the airports of the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is more than just a symbolic thing. Symbols have a
					 powerful impact on people's imaginations and the way they interact with one
					 another. The Air Canada symbol helps us in world trade. It helps us in selling
					 ourselves as a nation across the world. That may be small in numbers, but large
					 in heart, large in expertise, large in much of what we have to offer to the
					 world. Therefore, I do not feel that we really have any choice but to rescue
					 Air Canada. We have gone far enough, shall we say, in losing Canadian but we
					 certainly, as a nation, cannot lose our airline symbol.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a second reason why the government is
					 obligated to rescue Air Canada. I speak of Air Canada and not the other
					 airlines, even though I think that they would be entitled to claim help as
					 well. We have to rescue Air Canada because the government, for the right
					 reasons or the wrong reasons depending on how we look at it, is responsible for
					 putting Air Canada in the very difficult position that it finds itself in the
					 wake of this crisis. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should have actually happened when Canadian was
					 having difficulty, was market forces should have been allowed to operate and
					 Canadian should have gone under. The government instead, wishing to protect the
					 jobs of Canadian airline employees, forced Air Canada, indirectly perhaps, to
					 undertake a merger.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, those of us who have some knowledge of how
					 business operates would have argued very strongly that the better thing for Air
					 Canada and the airline industry would have been to let the market forces have
					 their way. That is a terribly harsh thing to say when we are talking about
					 people's jobs and livelihoods. Nevertheless, the fact remains that Air Canada
					 is less able to withstand the events of September 11, because of the fact that
					 it acquired Canadian, than it would have been if Canadian had been allowed to
					 perish economically, as would normally happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me the question of rescuing Air Canada is academic.
					 How we do it is the subject of other people's speeches here. I feel very
					 strongly that what is more effective than any rescue or any valid bailout, is
					 to get the passengers back on Air Canada, get the travelling public back up in
					 the air. I am concerned because the government has been very unwilling to take
					 a position on airline security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the debate tonight was about the fact the
					 government would bring in better technology to beef up security at airports,
					 bomb sniffing machines and that kind of thing. However, the tragedy that
					 occurred on September 11 and the reason why people are not flying is not
					 because of airport security. It is aircraft security that has everyone
					 frightened. Nothing changed on September 11 with respect to airport security.
					 Airports have always been at risk by terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes back to the bombings of which I think the first
					 was 1968. It was an airplane hijacking but not with the intent of a suicide
					 flight into a ground target. In imaginations of people, they have this picture
					 about what must have occurred on these aircrafts when people realized they were
					 destined on a suicide mission. That is quite different than a normal hijacking
					 where people on the aircraft might have had some hope of survival.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually I have nightmares about this. I think people
					 across the land and across North America, if not the world, occasionally have
					 dreams of this horrible situation in which they find themselves trapped in an
					 aircraft that is on a mission of destruction and death.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government wants to get people flying again, it
					 needs to take a strong line on aircraft security as soon as possible. The
					 reality is Madam Speaker, that the Americans have moved very quickly in this
					 regard. We cannot, as a country with a national carrier, not follow suit.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was watching the news this evening and Peter Jennings
					 was interviewing various people who were talking about the fact that Washington
					 national airport will not open until it gets sky marshals in place and gets
					 various other security provisions in place. The reality is that if the
					 Americans do that with their aircraft, it is extremely unlikely, as a matter of
					 fact it is not likely at all, that American aircraft flying out of Canada will
					 not have sky marshals on them when they go to the United States. Similarly, it
					 is extremely unlikely that the Americans will allow Air Canada aircraft to land
					 in Washington or New York unless they have an equivalent level of security. I
					 suggest that equivalent level of security would be sky marshals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members on the opposite side, and on this side for
					 that matter, might find it extremely hard to hear me, of all people, talking
					 about the idea that our airlines should carry armed guards because I deplore
					 the free use of firearms. I am not a hunter and I have no argument against
					 hunters. However I certainly have a very large argument against the
					 proliferation of weapons in the United States in the possession of
					 civilians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this instance, if we are going to get Canadians back
					 on to Air Canada as quickly as possible, we have to make a strong statement
					 that at least for the short term until other security measures are in place
					 that are just as strong, we have to do it. If we do not do it, I can assure the
					 House that in my area of the province of Ontario people will simply go to
					 Buffalo if they feel they can get an airplane that is safer. I do not think the
					 government will have any choice because if the Americans bring in this level of
					 security, Air Canada and any other carrier going into the United States from
					 Canada will have to follow suit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One might ask why the transport minister has not come
					 out with this decision if it is so logical? I would suggest that it is one of
					 the strengths and weaknesses of the Canadian parliamentary and cabinet system
					 that this country, because of the cabinet system, can act very decisively. Once
					 a decision is made in cabinet things move very quickly. On the other hand, to
					 make sure that ministers do not go on expeditions solo, usually when there is
					 the necessity of making a very important decision in their portfolios, they
					 seek cabinet consensus. I would suggest to the House that when cabinet meets
					 tomorrow this very subject of the security of aircraft will be high on the
					 agenda.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is certainly a very serious thing we have been faced
					 with as a result of the terrible tragedy in New York. However the last thing
					 we, as Canada, want to do to give any support to these terrorists, is to allow
					 Air Canada to crash as a result of a terrorist act by these extreme groups like
					 we saw in New York. Air Canada is a symbol of Canada. We have to maintain that
					 symbol one way or another. If it involves a rescue package that is one thing.
					 If it involves peace and security that is another. One way or another we have
					 to preserve Air Canada.</p>

					 (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Canadian Alliance):
				  </b>

	Madam Chairman, I am pleased to participate in this
					 debate tonight to provide a few ideas, I hope, which the minister said he was
					 looking for when he spoke earlier this evening. I trust he is paying careful
					 attention to the ideas that have been brought up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said that many industries are affected by
					 this, not just the airlines. There are the aircraft manufacturers, hotels and
					 tourism outfits. It is all true. Of course, people ask how can we provide money
					 when so many industries are affected and how do we deal with it? The reality is
					 that it all evolves from the airline industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the airlines do not take passengers and do not
					 travel, they downsize which affects aircraft manufacturers and all their
					 various suppliers. It affects hotels because there are no passengers
					 travelling, and it goes on and on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can address a lot of the industry wide problems that
					 have been created by this terrorist attack in September by dealing first and
					 foremost and decisively with the problems in the airline industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing we need to do to try to get airlines
					 back on their feet is to regain the confidence of passengers that it is safe to
					 travel and that we are taking prudent measures to ensure their flying
					 safety.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember years ago when I flew out of Castlegar,
					 there used to be scrambled seating on the 737s. I happened to like to fly in
					 the front seat because I found it much more comfortable. However everybody
					 scrambled on ahead of me and those seats were always taken until somewhere in
					 the world there was an airline accident. Then invariably the investigators
					 talked about how it was so much safer at the back of the plane. For the next
					 several weeks or perhaps months, I had no problem getting my front
					 seat.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the same thing happening right now. People have
					 heard about this and they envision it occurring even in the smallest little
					 communities from which they may fly out. They suddenly have this fear that
					 flying is very dangerous. That is the first step the government needs to take.
					 It needs to look at airport security. We have heard tales already tonight of
					 how one in five attempts to smuggle fake weapons of one type or another through
					 security have been successful. That is pretty scary in light of what happened
					 and in light of passenger confidence. That needs to be cracked down
					 on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also heard some people, particularly on the
					 government side, talk about reforming a crown corporation with Air Canada. For
					 heaven's sake, if we have learned anything in the past, we should have learned
					 that the airlines cannot be run by a government agency. The minister squanders
					 enough money on VIA Rail, and that is small potatoes beside Air Canada. We do
					 not need him dabbling in ongoing and permanent subsidies to Air Canada as
					 well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He might consider taking airport security back under
					 the wing of the federal government, instead of having all the various airlines
					 provide the security with minimum priced help, with unsupervised training and
					 obviously not very good training. If one in five attempts to smuggle fake
					 weapons through are successful, then obviously a much better job needs to be
					 done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we could regain the confidence of the flying public
					 and get the passenger count up, that helps not only the airlines, but it helps
					 many of the other industries and of course their employees. We have heard quite
					 a bit spoken tonight about the tremendous number of people who are becoming
					 unemployed as a result of this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has made a lot of mistakes in the past
					 and not necessarily this government, because I do not want to pin everything on
					 it. However governments in the past, this one and others, have made a lot of
					 mistakes. When Air Canada was privatized, most of its debt was written off by
					 the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the Liberal government. When it
					 privatized CN, it did not make that same mistake. I was on the transport
					 committee at the time and I argued very loudly against doing that. The
					 government to its credit listened and got a much better result in the
					 privatization of CN than it did with the privatization of Air
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not blame Air Canada. It was a private corporation
					 now responsible for making money. It suddenly found itself out in the
					 marketplace with a competitor, CP Air that had a heavy debt load. It did not
					 have any debt load so it could go after CP and become the carrier of Canada.
					 That is where the problems of the airline industry in the country really
					 started.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign ownership rules that restricted the amount
					 of shares that could be held by non-Canadians ultimately was part of the
					 downfall of Canadian Airlines. Canadian Airlines had partners outside Canada
					 willing to make further investment and they were not allowed to. That was one
					 of the roadblocks that ultimately brought Canadian Airlines to its
					 end.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another one was the foreign ownership rule for Air
					 Canada. Air Canada, unlike the Onex deal, used its own internal funds and
					 financing abilities to take over a troubled airline. There was no new capital.
					 It was all just Air Canada taking on a lot of the debt of Canadian
					 Airlines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Onex deal involved bringing a lot of new capital to
					 the table. If it had been allowed to go through, in the end it would have been
					 a much better operation for all those employees and for the travelling public.
					 What finally brought down Canadian Airlines was the government's unwillingness
					 to change the 10% ownership rule that any one shareholder could not own more
					 than 10% of Air Canada. That was the final bring down of Canadian
					 Airlines.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada was operating with tremendous debt structure
					 and in severe financial problems before the September 11 crisis. There have
					 been some changes since then. There have been changes to the layoff rules. In
					 all honesty, the structure with regard to job guarantees that Air Canada went
					 in with, while reassuring, was hardly practical. In my own home airport the
					 employees of both airlines all stand behind the counter now and unfortunately,
					 they did not see fit to get expanded counter space. There are so many of them
					 they have to take turns standing up at the counter. It is very frustrating for
					 the manager of the company in Castlegar to deal with that and still try to be
					 responsible in terms of the bottom line.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the big issue of fuel taxes. I trust the
					 minister is paying close attention to this one because this is one very fast
					 way he could bring some relief to the air industry in Canada. When the GST was
					 brought in by another government, the airlines were promised in return for
					 imposing on their passengers this tremendous cost of an extra 7% on all
					 tickets, that the government would get rid of all the other taxes that they had
					 to pay. The airlines were promised that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Chairman, because it was not the government that
					 is here now, I think can say that that government lied to the airlines. They
					 did not take away all those taxes. They left a fuel tax. For this year alone
					 Air Canada budgeted $46.7 million for excise tax on jet fuel, taxes that are
					 largely not paid by its foreign competitors. That puts Air Canada at a severe
					 disadvantage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been talk of loan guarantees. For the record
					 I would say that if loan guarantees are being considered, they should be only
					 that amount that is necessary to ensure that Air Canada maintains the credit
					 rating it had prior to this occurring. Those loan guarantees should be
					 available to its competitors as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be no discount airline startups until all
					 those guaranteed loans are paid. Then if it still wishes to go ahead with that
					 discount airline, there should be an audit provided by the government that
					 ensures there is no cross-subsidization of that discount airline from Air
					 Canada. Otherwise all it is is a fancy name to do predatory action against the
					 other airlines in Canada without having any accountability for it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be, as some people have suggested,
					 although not tonight, but I hear it brought up quite frequently, no unilateral
					 action toward cabotage in Canada. Cabotage is where a foreign carrier can fly
					 from point to point inside the country. There should be no unilateral
					 declaration of that. If the United States wants to allow Air Canada to fly
					 freely from point to point inside the United States, that is fine. However, it
					 should not be done unilaterally in Canada. In the end that would kill Air
					 Canada and it would not help the flying public in this country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government needs to move fairly quickly, but it
					 needs to do it with prudence, if it has a good plan which it has brought to the
					 House and which has been approved by the House. The government should not
					 confuse prudence with vacillation. This problem cannot go on for a long period
					 of time.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sky marshals have also been mentioned. That is
					 something the government needs to look at. In the United States people are
					 being hired from the street, but they are soundly screened for both
					 psychological profile and ability to do the job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the government might even consider asking some
					 high frequency travellers if they would be interested in going through the
					 screening and training process. Those people travel anyway. They would be
					 authorized under the same provisions of a hired sky marshal. It might be a way
					 to bring the numbers up without cost.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as reimbursing Air Canada, it should only be for
					 the exact cost that it can prove occurred as a direct result of the September
					 11 events. I have many more ideas but I realize other members wish to
					 speak.</p>

					 (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.): </b>

	Madam Chairman, this evening's take note debate gives
					 me an opportunity to discuss Canada's airline industry and its present
					 situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrific and tragic events of September 11 have
					 left an indelible mark on our lives and the world of civil aviation. My
					 condolences go to the families and friends who lost loved ones on that terrible
					 day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many sectors of the Canadian economy have been greatly
					 affected by the events, none more so than the airline industry. The airline
					 industry, tourism industry, automobile industry, investment industry and others
					 are still reeling from the economic impact of the tragedy. The crisis threatens
					 to plunge us into a full blown economic disaster. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of Canadians have already lost their jobs as a
					 result. In my riding of Etobicoke--Lakeshore, a large number of my constituents
					 are employed in the airline industry. They are indeed concerned about the
					 impact of the events on their livelihoods, jobs and families. Since the crisis
					 they have expressed to me, both through telephone calls and letters, the need
					 for some federal government support to help the sector through this difficult
					 period of uncertainty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of September 11, 2001 are unprecedented in
					 aviation history. I repeat this simply because I think this unprecedented event
					 requires special measures in response. At no other time in modern history have
					 we seen airline shares worldwide decrease at such an accelerating rate and
					 competition choked off. Large airline carriers in the United States, France,
					 Britain and other countries have significantly scaled back on their staff and
					 usage of their fleets.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada small carriers have cut back. Air Transat is
					 an example as is Canada 3000. Similarly Air Canada, Canada's flagship carrier,
					 announced 9,000 job cuts, a direct result of recent events.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came to Canada 41 years ago on Trans-Canada Airlines.
					 I believe in flagships. I believe there is a responsibility to provide safe
					 service and that has been provided to us by Air Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our airline industry has lost billions of dollars over
					 the past two weeks. There has been difficulty in meeting insurance payments and
					 operating costs. Many of us have had letters written to us outlining the
					 position. We understand that reduced demand is leading to overcapacity, higher
					 costs and lower revenues. All this has affected the bottom line. The sector is
					 vital to our community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of
					 Transport that we must do all we can to help the industry through this rough
					 patch and to shore up confidence in Canada's airline industry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was pleased to hear the Minister of Transport state
					 earlier that he will not allow Canada's flagship carrier to be bankrupted by
					 these events.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this tragedy we have seen the U.S., U.K. and
					 other governments move to provide some financial assistance. In this crisis we
					 as Canadians owe this to our industry. It is not in the best interests of
					 Canadians to allow a vital sector of our economy to be wiped out.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am advising the minister to proceed with assistance
					 based on the facts and come up with a fair plan to ensure the viability of the
					 sector. We know that Air Canada in particular was experiencing difficulty
					 before the events, but we also know that we should be assisting it to stabilize
					 the turmoil that is now in the industry.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians want us to act. Canadians want us to show
					 responsibility to the industry. My constituents want us to act on that front in
					 their own interests. We need to put confidence in the system. We need to
					 continue to do what we have started to do. For example after insurance
					 companies cancelled their third party war and terrorism coverage, the federal
					 government got right in there and provided an indemnity for such liabilities
					 for essential aviation service operators in Canada. There is also a 90 day
					 period of coverage and limits to existing terms and conditions placed in that
					 agreement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the federal government can help. We know
					 it can give support. We know that it can do what is necessary. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Air Canada employees in my riding want a strong
					 airline company. They want the assurance the government will take steps to
					 ensure that they will eventually return to their jobs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing I want to assure the minister that not only
					 will we support him as he evaluates and comes up with a plan or program, but we
					 will work with him as he is doing with the Federal Aviation Administration to
					 enhance aviation security throughout North America.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since September 11 I have flown a few times from
					 Pearson airport in Toronto. Those of us who travel on the airline have noticed
					 heightened security measures: increased police presence, passenger screening,
					 hand searches, airport security controls, enhanced baggage screening, passenger
					 baggage screening, and the closing of the cockpit doors. I commend the Minister
					 of Transport for those measures that have been brought in. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to affirm that I stand behind Air
					 Canada and the employees of Air Canada. I support our flagship. I support
					 stabilizing Air Canada, stimulating all sectors of that industry, encouraging
					 the passengers to continue to use the system. I look to the Minister of
					 Transport to keep public confidence in our airline industry. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the decline in passenger travel is reversed,
					 manufacturers of aircraft and their components will also soon be impacted. It
					 is a huge blow to our economy given present circumstances. The slowdown is
					 affecting carriers worldwide. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American Airlines, the world's largest carrier with
					 over 110,000 employees, is contemplating layoffs of 20,000 people. Last month
					 American Airlines went through $1 billion in cash and is now working
					 aggressively to arrange additional financing so it can keep its doors open,
					 according to its chief executive officer, Donald Carty. He also stated that the
					 primary challenge is survival, not profitability. He noted that as of last week
					 the scaled back system of American Airlines had a load factor of about 50%, the
					 equivalent of operating the pre-September 11 schedule with a 40% load
					 factor.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swissair group could also go out of business within
					 the next few days if a last minute rescue initiative fails to materialize. The
					 chairman and chief executive officer, Mario Corti, said on Swiss television
					 that the company will be threatened with bankruptcy without the
					 recapitalization it expects in the next few days. Its problems, like Air
					 Canada's, predated the September 11 tragedy but the outlook is not much
					 different without some sort of assistance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada is in trouble and that is the reason for
					 this debate. The job of the government is to fix the problem. Air Canada must
					 be kept afloat because we need a safe and dependable national carrier to do
					 business. If Air Canada flounders, given the state of the world's airlines,no
					 one is likely to come in to fill the gap. There will be a huge disruption which
					 will be very costly to business. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we should do? Some have urged the government to
					 take an equity position in Air Canada. I reject that position on the premise
					 that government's role is to regulate. The job of private enterprise is to
					 maintain the successful operation of a business. All too often the success of
					 private enterprise is dependent on good regulations. That is the case now.
					 Turning the clock back and making Air Canada a crown corporation will not
					 help.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their comments on the Air Canada crisis,
					 fundamentalists if I may use that term, the free market, no rules and no
					 regulations theorists, would allow the hangar to burn along with all the
					 planes. They would have us believe that some free market good fairy would put
					 it all together again at a lower cost, with increased levels of safety, and so
					 on. It does not quite work that way in the real world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada's problem prior to September 11 centred on
					 the failure of the government to provide leadership for the airline sector. Its
					 problems after September 11 were no different. Bolstering consumer confidence
					 in the safety of our skies is the surest way to help Air Canada recover from
					 this difficult time. The government must take action on this front
					 now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the tragic events of September 11 airline
					 bookings in the country have plummeted, resulting in huge shortfalls not only
					 for the airlines but also for others. Despite repeated requests for increased
					 and improved airport security, the use of sky marshals and additional security
					 procedures aboard Canadian commercial aircraft, the government has refused to
					 take action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us compare this inaction with the resolve of the
					 Americans. President Bush is expanding the use of armed and plainclothes
					 officers aboard commercial airlines, restricting access to the cockpit,
					 developing aircraft tracking equipment that cannot be turned off, and putting
					 the federal government in charge of all airport security and screening,
					 including the purchase and maintenance of all equipment. In addition the U.S.
					 government is committed to stabilizing its industry with $22 billion
					 Canadian.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the direct losses and increased costs related to
					 the events of September 11, given the dislocation to the Canadian economy and
					 the job losses, both direct and indirect, the government must commit to
					 ensuring the stability of the Canadian airline industry with prudent cash
					 support, appropriate security regulations and a reasonable regulatory
					 system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government took this common sense approach to
					 restoring public confidence in air travel, it would go a long way toward saving
					 jobs threatened by the current situation. A healthy airline industry would have
					 a positive influence in these troubled times.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need from the government is a commitment to the
					 success of a national carrier, commitment to the success of regional carriers
					 and commitment to the success of the independent carriers. Commitment to
					 success in the airline industry has long been lacking in Canada. It is time for
					 a change.</p>

					 Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
				  </b>

	Madam Chairman, there is no doubt that the tragic
					 events of September 11 had a very profound effect on the airline industry
					 worldwide. Immediately following the attack, planes were ordered to land and
					 the airspace was closed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Canadians found themselves unable to return home
					 from abroad to be with their loved ones. I was one of a number of Canadian
					 provincial, territorial and federal parliamentarians participating in an
					 international meeting of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in
					 Australia at the time the attacks took place. We were unable to return
					 home.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the planes started flying and the skies over the
					 United States were gradually opened, people who had been stranded slowly
					 returned home. I must add that I was so pleased that I was able to return home
					 aboard an Air Canada flight that would fly over American airspace. I knew it
					 would be Air Canada and I knew I would be safe and eventually return home to my
					 family.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after those initial returns traffic did not
					 pick up. A week later the airports were visibly empty. I can say that because
					 within a day of my return from Australia I was coming back to Ottawa and the
					 flights were empty. People who did not need to travel and had returned home to
					 their loved ones were no longer travelling.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends of mine cancelled their holidays to Europe, not
					 for fear of flying but because they had a feeling that it was better to stay
					 home to be with their families during these uncertain times. Today, getting on
					 a flight to return back to Ottawa, almost three weeks after the attack, I note
					 that the airports are still empty. There are no longer traffic jams outside
					 departure levels at the airport. The lineups have disappeared. People are not
					 flying.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The airline transportation system is an important part
					 of our national and international economic infrastructure. Consequently, as the
					 government has a key role in ensuring that our trade in goods continues to flow
					 as quickly and efficiently as possible across our borders, so too I believe
					 that our government has a role in ensuring that our trade in services continues
					 to flow both nationally and internationally. It must ensure that the people who
					 perform those services have access to the transportation they need in order to
					 efficiently and quickly access their markets and perform those
					 services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our trade in services is a foundation for our future
					 prosperity. Our economy is largely service based, so much so that three out of
					 four jobs in Canada are in the service industries. Last year services accounted
					 for 90% of the 319,000 new jobs that were created in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 26 I received a letter from Air Canada,
					 which I believe was also sent to all members of parliament, to advise of its
					 recent appeal to the Government of Canada for direct and indirect assistance
					 resulting from the terrorist attack. The letter noted that numbers of
					 passengers heading to the United States were down by 30% and that Air Canada
					 had reduced its overall network schedule by 20% and also had removed 84
					 aircraft.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada also advised that it approached the federal
					 government for a financial package which would address the following: first, to
					 offset the losses that occurred as a result of the three day service
					 interruption; second, to help mitigate the anticipated medium or long term
					 decline in passenger volume; and third, to compensate Air Canada for staggering
					 new airport security and insurance costs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the third request, I would like to note
					 that Air Canada and WestJet have just added a $3 surcharge to each ticket to
					 offset the increased insurance costs. Air Canada has acted quickly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before considering the requests I have just noted, it
					 is very important to examine how other airlines are faring internationally and
					 what other governments are doing to assist their airlines.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American major airlines suffered substantial losses.
					 Two of the airlines lost four aircraft and all the passengers aboard those
					 aircraft died on September 11. It is not just United Airlines or American
					 Airlines that suffered losses. All major airlines announced layoffs and
					 schedule reductions as a result of the decrease in traffic. The United States
					 government provided airline industries with an equivalent of $7.5 million
					 Canadian in cash payments and also $15 million Canadian in loan
					 guarantees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at what is happening in Europe. British
					 Airways, Europe's largest airline, reduced a number of its scheduled flights as
					 a result of the drop in demand for air travel since the United States attack.
					 Transatlantic travel has fallen sharply.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week British Airways cut 5,200 jobs on top of the
					 1,800 jobs announced earlier and it grounded 20 aircraft. British Airways,
					 similar to Air Canada, was suffering the effect of gloomy economic news with
					 the result of a decrease in air traffic before September 11. Similar to Air
					 Canada, it responded prior to September 11 by cutting capacity, jobs and
					 flagging more job cuts in 2002.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly enough the government of Prime Minister
					 Blair has not come up with a compensation package. Swissair is also struggling
					 to stay alive. I use the example of Swissair because like Air Canada it is a
					 national airline and it too was suffering losses prior to September
					 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swiss government indicated that it was willing to
					 play a role in the refining of the airline but that role has not yet been
					 defined. Jean-Pierre Roth, chairman of the Swiss National Bank, was reported as
					 having stated that he did not think government action to bail out any company
					 in difficulty was a viable long term solution. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important to note that he did not rule out
					 state intervention. He was quoted in the Sunday Toronto <i>Star</i> as having
					 stated </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>State intervention may be necessary
						  in a case of an emergency, in an extremely specific situation, but...in the end
						  a private sector response will be the long-term solution.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Ross also stressed the importance of a national
					 airline to Switzerland with Zurich as its main financial centre and Geneva, the
					 European headquarters of the United Nations and home to many international
					 organizations. However, notwithstanding what Mr. Roth said, this morning the
					 shares of Swissair ceased to be traded.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that the decline in the demand
					 for air travel also affected those industries which support the airline
					 industry. We read last week that Bombardier announced that it will be cutting
					 3,800 jobs and decreasing production for fear the airlines will not be able to
					 come up with the cash being the gap between the amounts financed by third
					 parties and the purchase price of the aircraft. There is a fear that whatever
					 cash will become available will be used to cover operating costs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landing fees decreased due to less volume. Catering
					 operations decreased by 18% and it is anticipated that fuel providers will also
					 be affected. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensuring the long term viability of the airlines is
					 important not only for the airline industry but for the many sectors that
					 support that industry. The important question that arises is how to best ensure
					 that viability.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a general feeling that a private sector
					 solution is preferable. However we must bear in mind that the September 11
					 attacks were unpredictable and devastating. Canadians would generally agree
					 that it is important for Canada to have a national airline because it is more
					 than just a national symbol.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should be done? First and foremost we should look
					 very closely at compensating Air Canada for the losses it sustained in the
					 three days it was not in service. How do we assess those losses? It could be
					 done the same way that we prove losses in court by indicating direct
					 consequences and losses resulting from that three day period.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government and the airlines must continue
					 to assess the impact of the events of September 11 on the airline industry. We
					 must continue to examine all requests for financial assistance by Canadian air
					 carriers carefully and in light of the global context of the
					 industry.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government would like Air Canada and the
					 unions representing its employees to work together toward a solution acceptable
					 to all parties. Canada, because of its sheer size, needs a viable aviation
					 industry with an economically strong national carrier. I hope we in the House

					 BQ): </b>

	Madam Chairman, all the impacts the events of
					 September 11 will have on our lives and particularly on our economy are not
					 known yet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very first impact, besides the horror and the
					 bitter taste we were left with, is certainly that we have come to realize that
					 things will never be the same on our planet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every serious political and financial pundit in this
					 world agrees that things will never be the same as before this awful day.
					 Democracies and their economies have all been tremendously affected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These events have led countries to collectively reflect
					 on the situation, like they never had before. Every state had to stop and
					 rethink, if not reconsider, their relations with other countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be great if all this rethinking would lead us
					 to sustainable peace, the redistribution of wealth, shared values, mutual
					 respect and especially respect for life and freedom.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These last few days, a great many people made almost
					 the same statement. The world is going through a crisis. The economies are in
					 crisis, and the various countries have to do something about it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some observers even go as far as to question the way
					 globalization has taken place or is taking place. The great states of the
					 north, of which we are part, have not really listened to the wishes expressed
					 by poorer countries that wanted free trade to be more respectful of people and
					 of local and regional economies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the lessons we must learn from the events of
					 September 11 is that the concentration of decision-making centres in one place
					 make us most vulnerable to this new form of war, terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many large corporations operating at the international
					 level lost their senior executives on September 11. It will take years before
					 they can rebound from that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closer to us, thousands of people find themselves
					 unemployed. Thousands of families will see their income reduced by nearly 50%.
					 Thousands of families will suffer from this new kind of insecurity, which
					 inevitably brings with it a host of social problems. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that what we see in the media reflects a form
					 of insensitivity that we have felt in the words of our political leaders. The
					 first page of major newspapers and the news on major television networks all
					 say the same thing “Air Canada cuts 9,000 jobs; another carrier, 1,200; another
					 business, 200; another one, 600”. It looks a lot like a list of statistics
					 which, like any other statistics, will soon be forgotten. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not only talking about lost jobs here. We are
					 talking about human beings who find themselves unemployed. We should not be
					 reading that 9,000 jobs were cut, but rather that 9,000 people are now
					 unemployed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, I think this is just the tip of the iceberg.
					 As I was saying earlier, we have not yet felt the full impact of the events of
					 September 11. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will likely be more layoffs announced over the
					 course of the next days, weeks, and months. Of course, these people will be
					 eligible for employment insurance, as a government member mentioned, as though
					 employment insurance were some sort of magic solution to all of the pain caused
					 by the events of September 11, as though employment insurance could solve the
					 problem of all of the Air Canada employees and allow them to continue
					 living.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of employment insurance are we offering them?
					 An employment insurance that has been slashed, virtually destroyed by a
					 government whose sole objective was to pay off a deficit and debt caused by
					 years of waste, of shameless spending, which continues in some sectors,
					 particularly by overlap that could easily be fixed if the political will
					 existed.</p>


	<A NAME="T2135"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2135"><!-- Hour: 9--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2140"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T2130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(2135)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with the situation in which we currently find
					 ourselves, we need more than today's employment insurance, that is to say, in
					 its current form. For years, we in the Bloc Quebecois have been asking for a
					 return to a real employment insurance program, which would protect workers
					 adequately in difficult times such as those we are currently
					 experiencing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our message then and now is glaringly relevant,
					 especially today, unfortunately. The events of September 11 have led us to
					 reflect, collectively, on the role of the state. This is the specific issue
					 that tonight's motion deals with.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we elect governments in so-called democratic
					 societies? What good does a government do if, in hard times, it answers
					 stupidly that we have to wait and see? Do we really need to wait until the ship
					 has sunk before launching the life rafts? Does the economy need to be rock
					 bottom before we take action?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally believe that the government has a role to
					 play as regulator, particularly with respect to Air Canada and the airline
					 industry. To support the economy and employment during hard times, a government
					 must shed its conservative ways and wait and see attitude and show some
					 creativity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years, the government's attitude has led to
					 abandonment of the regions. This is particularly the case for air
					 transportation. This government has done everything possible to unload the few
					 infrastructures it did have in the regions. From the state as provider, we have
					 moved to the state as non-presence. One might even think that there was an
					 avowed wish to close down the regions, to leave them so little leeway that they
					 would disappear through attrition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, air transportation is a good
					 example. It had virtually ceased to exist in the regions, and I trust that,
					 despite the cuts announced at Air Canada, the regions will not again have to
					 pay for what has occurred. In our regions, we are already in an extremely
					 difficult situation. Services have been cut back. We are poorly serviced, if at
					 all, and at ridiculous cost. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great care must therefore be taken when addressing the
					 difficulties being faced by the Canadian airline industry. Vigilance and
					 prudence are necessary to avoid having this difficult and serious situation not
					 simply put an end to a fundamental service, our air service, which is already
					 in a precarious position.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to make the point that the cuts announced
					 by Air Canada involved 9,000 job cuts, and apparently 1,000 of those are in
					 regional airports. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons and given the current situation,
					 it is imperative that services be maintained. I say maintained, but I should
					 really be talking about development and improvement in the regions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the regions will not have to pay a high
					 price. Considering what limited services we were getting, the state has a
					 responsibility to take action so as to ensure that we will at least keep what
					 little we had. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government must be proactive and it must speed up
					 the review of all the investment projects submitted by regional companies. It
					 must adopt more flexible criteria, because its criteria often do not reflect
					 the realities and needs of the regions. It must also co-operate with the Quebec
					 government and with the other provincial governments. This is no time for
					 pointless squabbles. Democracy must be respected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Quebec government has already begun a process that
					 is giving excellent results in so-called remote areas. Whether in the Gaspé
					 Peninsula or in the Matapédia Valley, people are beginning to hold their heads
					 high, and it would be tragic if the events of September 11 were to stop this
					 new momentum. It would also be tragic if these events were to prevent us from
					 developing and expanding because, among other things, of a lack of
					 transportation services. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am asking this government to work with the Quebec
					 government and with the other provincial governments to help our regions make
					 it once and for all. This is a necessary and urgent change of attitude.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remain convinced that we will be less vulnerable when
					 our regions are stronger and when our decision making centres are not all
					 concentrated in the same location. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Bloc Quebecois member, I am asking the government
					 to take action and to do so to help the regions.</p>

	Madam Chairman, no one asked for the events of

					 abhorred with the results and how those actions have basically turned the world
					 upside down. It is a reality that we in Canada and others throughout the world
					 have to deal with the fallout from those terrible events. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those events have had a huge impact on the airline
					 industry. IATA estimates the economic cost of the current crisis on the airline
					 industry at $15 billion Canadian. In the United States alone 133,000 jobs have
					 already been lost. The Swissair group could be out of business in the next few
					 days.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are very serious matters that we are dealing with
					 in very difficult times. The question before us is whether or not the federal
					 government should assist Canada's airline industry and, if it does, what form
					 that assistance should take.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my riding of Etobicoke North, which is very near

					 Authority or Lester B. Pearson airport, airline taxi or limousine drivers or
					 owners, car rental businesses, airport hotels, airport restaurants or whatever.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us refresh ourselves on some of the facts and some
					 of the history. In the year 2000 we effectively named for all intents and
					 purposes Air Canada our national carrier. The alternative was to allow Canadian
					 Airlines to go bankrupt. Maybe in hindsight this would have been the more
					 preferable thing to do. Having lived in western Canada for 12 years I know the
					 attachment and the symbolism of Canadian Airlines, as many of us in the House
					 know.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government tried to make it work. Overall I believe
					 the integration of Air Canada and Canadian Airlines has been reasonably
					 successful. Granted there are Canadians who have encountered some deficiencies
					 with Air Canada. In fact many of us have encountered them, whether it is
					 cancelled flights, peanuts of the wrong flavour or whatever. We know there have
					 been some service deficiencies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are not talking about minor service
					 deficiencies. We are talking about the very survival of Canada's airline
					 industry. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to articulate the principles I would use
					 to determine what federal support the government should be responding with for
					 the airline industry. The initial comment by Air Canada's President Milton when
					 he threw out the number of $3 billion to $4 billion unfortunately has tarnished
					 the debate. The number is totally unrealistic given Canada's fiscal
					 positioning. Frankly I think it was a number that was sucked out of the air.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be considering the losses that the airlines
					 have incurred as a result of closing down the skies. More important, we should
					 be looking at the challenges facing Canada's airline industry as we move
					 forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fairness and being fiscally responsible we should be
					 limiting it to the airlines themselves. In my riding I know many ancillary
					 industries are affected, but the reality is that if we can get Canadians back
					 into airline seats, if we can get travellers into airline seats, it will begin
					 to have a ripple effect through the ancillary industries we all
					 want.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us to look at compensating all secondary industries
					 that support the airline industry, we would be having auditors reviewing this
					 for the next 10 years. Frankly at the end of the day I am not sure it would be
					 affordable. We need to keep our eye on the issue of getting passengers back on
					 to airlines. That is a global problem. That is a global challenge.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is responding with measures to make passengers
					 feel more confident about flying in aircraft. Closing the cockpit doors and
					 other security measures at the airport are all helping, but it will take some
					 time for us to get back to that position.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some argue that the whole world has changed irrevocably
					 as a result of September 11, that we will see businesses teleconferencing and
					 that the demand for air travel will be permanently down. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not one who shares that view. Over many months
					 people will start getting into planes. It behooves us all to make sure that our
					 security systems, our border controls and our other ancillary services are done
					 in a way to make sure our security is safe and sound.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the airlines are up and running again, I think that
					 businesses and individuals who work in that sector directly and indirectly will
					 benefit from that. That is the most realistic approach to take.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In looking at Air Canada and the whole airline
					 industry, although Air Canada seems to be the one with the bigger problem, we
					 need to look at it from the point of view that all stakeholders need to be
					 involved. The federal government alone cannot solve Air Canada's problems
					 moving forward. We have to look at the airline employees, including management.
					 What can they contribute the make Air Canada structurally sound moving forward?
					 What about the debt holders? This has been an impediment to the restructuring
					 of Air Canada. The debt holders of Canadian and other debt holders will have
					 to, as the expression goes, put some water in their wine. Governments at all
					 levels will have to make a contribution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to separate out what happened as a result of
					 September 11 and what issues were impacting the airline industry in Canada
					 before September 11. We do know that Air Canada had some problems. Is that a
					 function of their cost structure? Did it have certain overheads that were
					 disproportionate to what was allowed in the marketplace? Did it have enough
					 flexibility in terms of its union contracts? I know that one of my constituents
					 talked about the concept of in-house scope, which he believes is the largest
					 single impediment to the restructuring of Air Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was Air Canada in trouble because of increased market
					 share being taken by some of the competitor airlines? If that is the case, that
					 is a problem, because we want to encourage WestJet and the Canada 3000 to
					 create more competition for Air Canada domestically.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have given to Air Canada an incredible opportunity
					 with a world mandate in terms of the international routes. Yes, granted, there
					 is severe competition on those routes. However, it has an opportunity here, and
					 I know I would like to see it succeed. I think most Canadians would like to see
					 it succeed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is, what is its business plan in moving
					 forward? Does it have a sound business plan? What does that involve? Does that
					 mean restructuring? Does it mean refinancing? Does it mean employees being more
					 flexible with their contracts? Does it mean management taking some salary cuts?
					 Whatever it takes, we have to understand that the federal government alone
					 cannot get Air Canada back into the situation it once was.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone asked why does the Government of Canada not
					 purchase treasury shares in Air Canada and maybe deprivatize Air Canada. I am
					 not sure that would be a positive thing to do. I think that would be a
					 retrograde step. Nonetheless, any aid that the Government of Canada gives to
					 Air Canada and Canada's airline companies should have some performance
					 standards, some strings attached to that so that moving forward Canadians feel
					 confident that there is something in it for them, that we have helped Air
					 Canada and the airline industry restructure and because of all that it will
					 become a more responsive and a more customer focused airline industry in
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although taking treasury shares or maybe deprivatizing
					 Air Canada is tempting in many respects, the question also is why would the
					 Government of Canada want to inherit some of the challenges that Air Canada is
					 facing right now. I am not sure the government can do any better a job than
					 management at Air Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada is an amazing company and has an amazing
					 opportunity, as do all airlines in Canada. We have to make sure that it is
					 restructured on a sound business footing, that it is sustainable into the
					 future and that whatever Canada does is also matched by some contributions by
					 all the stakeholder groups so that we have a sound airline industry and we can
					 get over the September 11 crisis.</p>

				  </b>

	Thank you, Madam Chairman.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 11, I was one of the few members of
					 parliament who was here in Ottawa and on Parliament Hill. I saw firsthand,
					 during the attacks on the United States, how unprepared our government was to
					 protect those people on the Hill, whether they were tourists or whether they
					 were workers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By noon on September 11, airport landings in the United
					 States had been halted. Planes in the air were being diverted to Canada. If
					 terrorism was still in the air, it was coming to Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, President Bush had issued orders for the
					 United States air force to shoot down any plane approaching Washington. It was
					 only at 2.00 p.m., more than four hours after the crisis had begun to unfold,
					 that the RCMP closed Parliament Hill to the public traffic, with barriers and
					 guards.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of countering terrorism, September
					 11 was not a day of which Canadians can be particularly proud. Today, though,
					 is an opportunity to assess our weaknesses and make security improvements that
					 are in the interest of both Canada and the world. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such improvement was made by the president of the
					 United States. President Bush appointed of Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge as
					 head of their newly created office of homeland security, and in the words of
					 President Bush, “to lead, oversee and co-ordinate a comprehensive national
					 strategy to safeguard” the United States against terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Canada must follow this lead in establishing
					 a mirroring co-ordinated agency or ministry within Canada to act against
					 international terrorism. The need for a co-ordinated effort is clearly evident
					 for continental security. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some approaches that might be explored by a homeland
					 security ministry include the development of unconventional security analyses
					 and recommendations. For example, we should upgrade the security credentials of
					 all frontline airline workers, those responsible not only for security
					 check-ins but the caterers, as well as ticket agents and customs workers.
					 Airline personnel should be required to meet tougher new terrorist prevention
					 awareness standards, standards that would be set internationally, possibly
					 regulated through ISO 9001 standards or by Canadian General Standards Board,
					 the CGSB. Presently, security scanner operators may be landed refugees with
					 poor communications skills and only a work permit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other security strategies would include two. There is a
					 danger of chemical and biological infiltration in airline cabins that can be
					 met by electronic detectors, plus rapid emergency cabin air evacuation and
					 repressurization to re-establish air quality. Flight deck security should be
					 enhanced by armored integrated cabin doors. Flyby wire control conduits can be
					 armour plated for security from explosive damage.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional measures and controls are numerous. Improved
					 electronics could allow for flight plan lock-in to autopilot with limited
					 release and range operation by pilots that would not allow an aircraft to be
					 diverted without ground control release of security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plain clothes armed air marshals are an absolute
					 necessity to keep in step with the threat reduction initiatives of other
					 nations. The only issue to be debated should relate to the number of flight
					 marshals and the percentage of flights that they should be present on, yet the
					 Minister of Transport vehemently disagrees.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, another initiative could be that the flight
					 recorders, the black boxes, should be improved to provide not just voice and
					 digital data from the cockpit but also voice and video data from the cockpit
					 and passenger cabin. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to flight recordings with multiple point
					 sound and visual sensors, there also should be concurrent transmission to
					 ground of all air activities, sound and video. Obviously breaking technology
					 would help address some of these proposals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a choice. Better shared security over our
					 continental perimeter with the United States or alternatively we will expose
					 our great hitherto undefended international border to greatly hampered trade
					 and tourism that will adversely affect our economy.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starting point is to establish a mirroring homeland
					 security ministerial office to work in step with the United States on
					 continental security against terrorism.</p>

					 Fuca, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Chairman, I thank the member for Edmonton
					 Centre--East. My 10 minute speech will be truncated to two and a half minutes
					 so that I can share the time with the member for Surrey Central.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the highlights of my 10 minute speech in bullet
					 form on how to save Air Canada. It is a vexing problem but it can be done. We
					 should in part look at Continental and Southwest, two carriers that have been
					 making money in the period of a downturn.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bailout issue, we are not going to give $3
					 billion, but a smaller number should be given to a company that prior to
					 September 11 was worth $710 million.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of merging, date of hire should be the
					 method used. It is the fairest method. Imagine having a pilot in the right seat
					 with 15 years seniority over the pilot on the left. Those cannot be merged
					 together if it is not date of hire.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to deal with the issue of labour woes,
					 which airlines across the world are suffering from, is with final offer
					 arbitration. It will force both sides to come to the centre. It is reasonable
					 and effective. Striking should be forbidden in groups working in the airline
					 industry. Airlines are absolutely essential and crucial for an economy to
					 function.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the organizational side, Air Canada is drowning in
					 paperwork as we speak. It has at least doubled the amount of paperwork that
					 individuals have to labour under. That should be removed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ticketing side, it should go back to using
					 SABRE. It works. For baggage a computerized tracking system is needed. The
					 current baggage handling system does not work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parts inventory must be computerized. Right now it
					 is not. Mechanics do not know where the parts are. This leads to increased
					 inefficiencies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut down the routes that do not work. Decrease the
					 number of flights on those routes that do not produce revenue. Maximize the
					 number of people travelling on those routes. This will increase
					 profitability.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the manpower issue, scoping by pilots should not be
					 allowed. Pilots should be allowed to work on the planes they are familiar
					 with.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of equality, it is equal pay for equal
					 work. There simply cannot be individuals who do the same job in the same or
					 different areas who are being paid different amounts. Listen to all the groups.
					 Bring in managers from Southwest and Continental. Both of those airline
					 companies have done a superb job in rejuvenating those two airlines which were
					 on the brink of bankruptcy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On aircraft maintenance, contracting out to privatized
					 handlers would probably not work and there could be an element of danger. Look
					 at the airlines that crashed in the U.S. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow the regional carriers to manage their own
					 affairs. They are doing a good job. They fly at capacity. Allow that aspect to
					 be decentralized to the regions and they will function very well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot give money to Air Canada and allow it to
					 function as a low cost carrier to drive WestJet into the ground. It is not fair
					 and reasonable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to the people who work for the company. The
					 employees have excellent suggestions. Provide a venue for them to offer
					 solutions. Reward them for providing cost-cutting solutions. It will increase
					 morale and there will be a functional airline at the end of the day.</p>

	Madam Chairman, I thank the hon. member for allowing me
					 to share his time. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps there are more airline employees living in
					 Surrey Central, the constituency I represent, than any other constituency in
					 Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Competition Act was suspended in 1999, an
					 offer for Canadian Airlines from Onyx Corporation of Montreal was blocked. The
					 result was that Canadian Airlines was swallowed up debt free by Air Canada. Air
					 Canada failed to live up its 180 day guarantee it made in 1999. Instead, it cut
					 routes, shed 9,000 jobs, raised prices and lowered the quality of service in
					 Canada. This resulted in the troubles that accumulated in Air Canada.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-competitive practices that Air Canada has
					 continued have driven other carriers out of the industry, such as Canadian
					 Airlines, Greyhound, Roots Air, CanJet, Vista and Royal. They have all fallen
					 victim to Air Canada's anti-competitive practices.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first people who should bear the brunt of this
					 mismanagement of the airline should be the shareholders and bondholders. The
					 second group of people should be the credit adjusters who take risks and give
					 credit. Since they expect to share the benefit they should also share the
					 losses if there are any. It should not be the taxpayers who pay the price for
					 the mismanagement of the airline.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air Canada has the highest capacity among all the
					 airlines and capacity is function of cost, so the cost is high, the debt is
					 high, there are more employees, more inefficiency and more waste. That is the
					 accumulation of the problems which the chief executive officer of Air Canada is
					 trying to camouflage under the September 11 incidents. I believe this problem
					 should be taken care of mathematically, economically and on a cost profit
					 basis. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as safety is concerned, the government has not
					 given any concrete proposals. The government has not yet said whether it will
					 allow air marshals on flights in Canada. The security measures that are in
					 place are not adequate. After someone checks in with security at the gate they
					 can buy knives in the terminal from the gift shop. Security is not particularly
					 efficient.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see the light at the end of the tunnel. I see
					 tunnel at the end of the light. I believe the government should take concrete
					 action, come up with a proposal and present some legislation to that effect so
					 that our air industry can be competitive and safer. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The airline industry is not the only industry bearing
					 the brunt of hard times. The softwood lumber industry made 14,000 to 15,000
					 employees in my province of British Columbia suffer as well. The situation is
					 similar in the agriculture and trucking industries. They are also suffering.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have run out of time, I would ask the
					 government to look at the bigger picture rather than just giving handouts to
					 their Liberal friends.</p>
