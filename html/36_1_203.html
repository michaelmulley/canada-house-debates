Mr. Speaker, the struggles and joys of Canada's home caregivers 
and those to whom they give care for reasons of infirmity, 
disability or illness reflect the eloquence of our societal 
values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>André Picard and his team at <I>The Globe and Mail</I> are to 
be commended for drawing attention to this issue, the magnitude of 
which is staggering.  Over one million Canadians need 
help—flexible work time, training, financing, respite and basic 
services—to cope with the demands of caregiving for their loved 
ones, most of whom are their parents or spouses.  Indeed, 
governments at all levels have a duty to act and to act promptly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May the issue ignite and the new social union framework 
facilitate the creation of a national home care program.  To 
ignore its urgency is to surrender Canadian values at our own 
peril.  The challenge to do good is at hand.  We cannot long 
endure.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Canadian Heritage, in an attempt to 
protect Canadian magazines, introduced legislation to limit foreign 
split-run publications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, in a bizarre turn of events, the minister is creating a 
split-run policy for Canadian publications, taking away the 
favourable postal classification from a group of Canadian 
religious publications.  The <I>Catholic Register</I> and regional 
catholic publications, the <I>New Freeman</I> of New Brunswick, 
the <I>Prairie Messenger</I>, and the <I>B.C. Catholic</I> all lost 
their favourable postal classifications because they use material 
from Canadian Catholic News, a news service they jointly 
finance.  For the past 10 years, these publications have pooled 
their resources in order to report on national issues, something 
they could not afford to cover individually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These catholic magazines are Canadian at their heart and soul. 
The Minister of Canadian Heritage should be a supporter of such 
publications rather than trying to kill them with friendly fire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian magazines are not protected by singling out catholic 
publications for destruction.  I would ask the minister to 
reinstate these catholic publications under the publications 
assistance program.

extensively throughout Canada and the U.S.A. and as far as

choir and its outstanding director, Eileen Baldwin, for the 
standard of excellence they achieve year after year.

this past Sunday Canadians recognized the International Day for

multicultural centre's website.  The grand prize is a brand new

the Canadian government cares about the plight of our poor.

Canadians' quality of social life.

plight of the homeless, who have not been as lucky as others in

this is to the credit of the Prime Minister, who was acting on

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Harry Flander joined the Canadian army during World War II so he 
could do his part for his country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He completed basic training and was one of dozens of soldiers 
transferred to the Suffield Experimental Station where he 
underwent chemical weapons tests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Flander had to swear secrecy about the tests and was told he 
would go to jail if he ever told anyone.  Military scientists 
placed mustard gas on Mr. Flander's arms.  They instructed him to 
walk through gas chambers.  They drove him into a field and 
dropped gas all over him.  These experiments left Mr. Flander 
with chronic chest pains and egg size blisters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For more than 50 years he lied to his doctors and his family 
about the cause of the scars on his body.  His mother and two 
sons died without ever knowing what caused them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the Suffield experiments have been declassified, Mr. 
Flander and hundreds of other Suffield victims are free to speak. 
So far they have been rebuffed by the government for recognition 
and compensation.

Speaker, on Monday Reverend Ilce Miovski was tragically killed 
by a stolen vehicle as the driver was trying to evade the car's 
owner and the police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reverend Miovski was a constituent of mine and his loss will be 
deeply felt by the congregation of St. Clement Church. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His death adds to the carnage across Canada resulting from 
someone using a motor vehicle to evade police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police officers also put their lives on the line and are placed 
in the unwinnable position of trying to apprehend the driver or 
withdraw.  In some cases the police are subject to legal action 
for the pursuit even though they were only carrying out their 
direct duty to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Current Criminal Code provisions dealing with dangerous driving 
and criminal negligence causing death are not appropriate 
sanctions for this crime.  A specific provision is needed in the 
code, with severe penalties for the offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the Minister of Justice to incorporate Bill C-440 into 
legislation to make those who evade police pay for this act and 
for the senseless death and injury it can cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot wait for more innocent people to die and for their 
killers to evade justice in the same way they tried to evade 
police.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the end of 
the opposition day when we invited the government to take steps 
to relieve poverty in Canada, the Liberal members denied us the 
unanimous consent we needed to establish a joint parliamentary 
committee to study this matter of national urgency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it appears that the Prime Minister has finally seen the 
light on this, I would ask him once again whether he intends now 
to agree to the establishment of a committee that would benefit 
from the expertise and participation of all opposition 
parties. 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is now very 
familiar with parliamentary procedure.  She knows that, first, 
members are not to comment on a vote in the House and, second, 
under Standing Order 108(2), a parliamentary committee is master 
of its own proceedings. 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is hard to 
believe the Prime Minister feels compassion toward the poor in 
this country.  Even yesterday he thought it a good idea to make 
fun of them as he tried to explain his unsuccessful dealings in 
Shawinigan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This flagrant lack of respect for the most disadvantaged casts 
doubt on the reasons behind the appointment of a minister for 
the homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that this appointment, 
occurring as it does two days before an important conference on 
the homeless in Toronto is nothing more than a publicity stunt 
intended to camouflage his inaction to date in this matter? 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a lot of respect for the member opposite, 
because she has worked very hard for the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Homelessness is a national problem.  It is true that I will be 
going to Toronto tomorrow.  We took part in a symposium on 
Dr. Golden's report.  I believe it is important for me to go 
tomorrow to discuss these issues.  I will also be going to 
Vancouver to have a look at our programs there.  I intend to 
travel throughout Canada, not just to Toronto.

women entrepreneur constituency is one of our main priorities. 
That is why we led a women's mission exclusively to Washington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we established the women's research coalition so 
that we can understand not only what is happening with women led,

and Canada will be holding the first women's trade summit.  We

Mr. Speaker, thank you for recognizing me and let me at the 
outset indicate that I will be making a joint statement today 
with my colleague, the Minister of National Defence.  Because the 
situation in Kosovo has such a shared responsibility we thought 
it would be appropriate for both of us to take the time available 
to give the House a full explanation of where we stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is proper to begin with an expression of some 
sadness and disappointment concerning the events that are taking 
place, as we speak, in Kosovo.  We all regret the need to have to 
use force, but at the same time I want to make it clear that 
Canada is very determined to play a proper role in ensuring that 
we can help to right the wrongs that have taken place so 
tragically in that area over the last year or two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international community has been faced with a deteriorating 
situation where the government of that area has been denying the 
most basic rights to its people, using force to quell any form of 
dissidence, sending tanks and artillery to destroy villages, 
murdering innocent people and forcing thousands upon thousands of 
people from their homes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 10 years now, the world has witnessed the tragedy unfolding 
in the Balkans: first in Slovenia, then in Croatia and then in 
Bosnia.  In the last year the same extreme violence against 
civilians from a targeted ethnic group has appeared in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international community has spared no effort to encourage 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to find a peaceful 
arrangement with its Albanian Kosovar population. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the House know, there have been many diplomatic 
missions sent to Belgrade.  The security council, acting under 
chapter VII, adopted crucial resolutions identifying the threat 
to peace and security in the region.  Council resolutions 1199 
and 1203, and the following October agreements between the 
federal republic and NATO and the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation, imposed a clear legal obligation on the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia to respect a ceasefire, to protect 
civilians and to limit deployment of security forces in Kosovo.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also participated, along with many other nations, in a 
verification mission created to monitor the ceasefire and to 
build confidence in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following that, the parties were convened at a negotiation 
conference in Rambouillet and were asked to give up their 
maximalist positions and accept an honourable compromise for 
peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kosovars at that conference demonstrated a degree of courage 
and vision by signing on to the agreement.  It was only the 
President of Yugoslavia who refused to depart from his 
intransigent position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past year, I want to underline to the House that Canada 
has made every effort to push for active engagement of the 
security council on this issue.  I have instructed Canadian 
diplomats to urge the council to act in accordance with its 
mandate.  As council president in February, our ambassador 
chaired many sessions dealing with the situation and crisis in 
Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have supported the peace negotiations and we have been an 
active participant in the OSCE efforts, at one point having close 
to 68 Canadians as part of the verification mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, in March and June 1998 I announced 
measures to prompt the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to resolve 
the Kosovo issue by imposing a degree of economic sanctions.  We 
suspended EDC credits.  We denied landing rights to airplanes. We 
had discussions on bilateral agreements on certain economic 
programs.  We placed a ban on investments in Serbia and a freeze 
on the assets of the Serbian and FRY governments in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out that the Minister for International 
Cooperation was very active in providing humanitarian efforts. 
Close to over $3.8 million have been given to UNICEF, to the High 
Commissioner of Refugees, the Red Cross, CARE Canada and the 
World Food Program to help the humanitarian suffering in that 
particular area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Diplomacy and civil effort have been given every possible effort 
and every chance to succeed, but to no avail.  The looming 
humanitarian disaster caused by President Milosevic's 
unwillingness to come to any kind of accommodation to protect his 
own people leaves us with very few options.  Every day the 
situation has grown worse and more and more civilians suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been estimated that, as I speak today, over 450,000 
Kosovars have been displaced from their homes.  Since last week 
it is estimated that in that week alone 25,000 people were 
displaced.  We have no way of counting the number of people who 
have been forced to experience the worst indignities, in some 
cases the loss of their lives, their precious possessions and 
their homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as it remains unresolved, as long as we do not find the 
willingness to come to a solution, the conflict in Kosovo 
threatens to precipitate a humanitarian disaster and destabilize 
the entire region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come to act and Canada is ready to play its part. 
As the Minister of National Defence said in question period 
today, already there are CF-18s of the Canadian Armed Forces 
participating in air actions.  He will explain in much more 
detail the exact nature of our commitments in the military area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to explain to the House that NATO's foremost objective is 
to avert a humanitarian crisis by enforcing compliance by the 
federal republic with the obligations which it has undertaken to 
respect, including respect for a ceasefire an end to violence 
against civilians, full observance of the limits of force and 
police action in that area and trying to bring again to the 
table Milosevic and his government to come together to finally 
sign an effective peace agreement that will provide full 
protection to civilians in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out that while we have had to take this 
action, we do so knowing the full consequence that it carries. 
We debated this in the House of Commons three weeks ago when all 
members had an opportunity to participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to say that we have acted to ensure the safety of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of the verification mission of the OSE, including 
the 68 Canadians I mentioned, have now safely left the area, as 
well as the Canadian staff at the embassy in Belgrade. 
We have advised Canadians to defer all travel to the area and we 
have given proper advisory notice to any Canadians contained 
within that country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Humanitarian considerations are the main impulse for our action. 
We cannot stand by while an entire population is displaced, 
people are killed, villages are burned and people are denied 
their rights because of their ethnic background. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remain very concerned about potential atrocities.  Those 
responsible for any action against civilians should be aware 
that they will be held accountable. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want everybody in the House to understand that one of the 
primary objectives of Canada in pursuing things like the 
international accord, supporting the work of the tribunal in The 
Hague, is to make sure that someday, somewhere and somehow Mr. 
Milosevic and his cohorts will be held accountable for their 
actions.  Make no mistake about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada wants a world where rights are respected, where peaceful 
solutions to regional conflicts are negotiated, where war 
criminals do not act with impunity, a world free of land mines. 
We want to consolidate a multilateral international system, which 
was created to make the world a better place, and institutions 
such as the United Nations, the OSCE and NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our actions today in Kosovo are guided by these humanitarian 
concerns, a clear defence of these goals and real representation 
of the interest of Canadians to make sure that the rule of law 
and the safety of civilians are preserved and protected around 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close my remarks by saying that all our prayers go with the 
brave members of our armed forces who are now carrying out 
Canada's mission in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the Chair understand that the 
statement by ministers will be considered one statement given by 
two ministers?  Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today our Canadian forces are taking part 
in NATO air operations over the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have said all along, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs has 
reiterated today, that we wanted a negotiated settlement to end 
the crisis in Kosovo, to end the human tragedy. Unfortunately 
efforts to achieve a peaceful political solution have failed to 
this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Continued Serbian aggression presents a challenge, 
to NATO's resolve, and the time has come for military action.  We 
are not taking this step lightly but, as the Prime Minister said 
last night, inaction in the face of oppression only invites 
further aggression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of NATO's military action is clear: to prevent further 
violence by the Yugoslav security forces in Kosovo and to avert a 
large scale humanitarian disaster.  To this end, Canadian forces 
are working alongside and in partnership with the forces of our 
NATO allies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Make no mistake. NATO has assembled a powerful force, one that 
is fully capable of meeting its military objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has roughly 130 Canadian forces personnel and 6 CF-18 
fighter aircraft stationed in Aviano, Italy.  All our CF-18s are 
equipped with air to air missiles and precision guided munitions 
for a ground attack role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our air task force is well equipped and well prepared.  Our 
people have been well trained for the role that they are taking 
on right now and in the days ahead.  Our CF-18s have been in 
Aviano since June of last year.  We also have Canadians with the 
NATO airborne early warning group in Germany. They are also 
taking part in the air operations over Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This operation is not without risk.  The Yugoslav military 
possesses a sophisticated air defence system, but we are 
satisfied that the NATO commanders have taken every step to 
reduce that risk as much as possible. 
There are escort aircraft, for example, when our jet fighters are 
out on missions.

required to make a significant contribution to the alliance's 
efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that all Canadians will join with us in the House 
in extending our support and encouragement to our CF members 
involved in this operation.  Also, our support and thoughts are 
with their families in Canada.  We wish them a safe return.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs has given a detailed overview of the situation 
in Kosovo.  We have been provided with an explanation of Canadian 
policy toward the conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen much evidence over the last few weeks and months 
about the issue. I do not believe I need to repeat most of 
that.  Indeed we agree that there is an international crisis in 
Kosovo.  As I said earlier today, we support our involvement in 
that crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the tragedy of Yugoslavia and Kosovo as it has unfolded 
lends itself to our stopping a moment and looking at the crisis 
that war creates.  The many comments that have been made and the 
reasons for intervention allow us to support this, but I do not 
think it should be a blind support.  I want to state very clearly 
that I believe I am as patriotic as anyone in this country.  I am 
here because I believe in this country.  I think, though, that we 
need to stop for a moment and ask a few other questions about our 
intervention in Kosovo and what it might mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me very briefly address those points.  As the days and the 
bombings unfold, we will probably have to evaluate just how long 
this sort of action can be sustained.  The first question is what 
if Mr. Milosevic does not give in to this bombing.  Obviously the 
reason for the bombing is that he will see the light and say he 
will come to the table and stop what he has been doing in Kosovo. 
That will be good for us and for the Serbian people, and that 
will certainly be good for the Kosovars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should remember, however, that the Serbs have a long history 
of war and of fighting anything they disagree with.  They are not 
Iraqis.  They are quite different in how they might respond. 
History tells us that.  We have to ask what will happen if, at 
the week's end, bombings have not brought the reaction we want. 
What will happen next? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second question concerns the degree to which Canada will be 
involved in further NATO missions in Kosovo.  The House has never 
freely debated what would happen if we had to send in 
ground troops in an escalation of this event.  We have already 
made a commitment to provide 700 or more troops to a NATO led 
peace monitoring mission in Kosovo should that become necessary, 
and we hope of course that it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will this engagement go further than that?  If it does go 
further than that and we are asked to send combat forces on a 
ground invasion, will we come back to this House to discuss that 
issue?  I believe it is our job here to ask that question and to 
receive assurances that it will happen.  I am concerned for the 
safety of our men and women in the Canadian forces, as all of us 
are.  We need to ask ourselves if the armed forces are equipped 
to handle a sustained attack in a situation like that.  No one 
doubts the courage of our men and women in uniform, but we do 
have to question whether they are prepared for what they might 
face in that invasion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to ask about the role of parliament in this whole 
issue.  This is the House of Commons. This is the place where 
elected representatives should take this issue very seriously. We 
are talking about the sons and daughters of many of our 
constituents.  The Commons must be consulted before this country 
undertakes any further serious foreign affairs action in this 
event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that the debates on Kosovo that took place in 
November and February dealt with a future escalation.  It is not 
satisfactory to simply have a statement and to have the sort of 
debate that we have had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we and our NATO allies attack Yugoslavia, we are now at war. 
Some might call it peace enforcement.  Others assert that it is 
simply forceful diplomacy.  Let us not mince words.  We are at 
war, and while we find that word distasteful, I believe that is 
the word we need to use. This is the reality of the international 
system.  Military force is required to deter and punish 
aggression or to alleviate human suffering.  The rhetoric of soft 
power cannot hide these simple facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to express my hope for a speedy resolution to this crisis 
and to extend all of our prayers to the men and women of the 
Canadian forces.  May they all return safely.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise today to speak about NATO's imminent intervention in the 
former Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the secretary general of the Atlantic alliance, 
Javier Solana, gave the go-ahead for NATO bombing, after one last 
attempt by American envoy Richard Holbrooke to negotiate an 
agreement with Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic.  The 
Serbian leader has categorically refused to sign the Rambouillet 
accord, which would have resulted in a ceasefire in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This peace accord was negotiated in a suburb of Paris under the 
supervision of the contact group for the former Yugoslavia, a 
group made up of the United States, Russia, France, the United 
Kingdom, Italy and Germany.  Only the Kosovar separatists 
signed.  The accord would have given them substantial autonomy 
for a three year transition.  The peace plan also would have 
allowed the deployment of 26,000 NATO troops in Kosovo to ensure 
enforcement.  This is the main stumbling block for Serbian 
President Milosevic.  Even faced with imminent allied air 
strikes, he repeated on Serbian television only a few hours ago 
his firm opposition to what he considers to be occupation of 
Serbian territory by foreign military forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be kept in mind that from the onset of the conflict 
between the Yugoslav forces and the Albanian separatists more 
than a year ago now some 2,000 people have been killed and more 
than 200,000 people made refugees.  For 10 months the 
international community has tried every possible approach to end 
the war and repression in Kosovo.  Kosovo has not respected UN 
security council resolutions 1199 and 1203, or last October's 
agreements between the Organization on Security and Cooperation 
in Europe, NATO and the former Yugoslavia.  Belgrade has not 
complied with its obligations to limit the deployment of its 
forces in Kosovo, protect the population and bring about a 
ceasefire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be kept in mind that Yugoslavia has, 
moreover, been involved in bloody conflict for 10 years. 
There was Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia, and now Kosovo. 
Faced with this intolerable situation in which defenceless 
civilian populations are being fired at by the ex-Yugoslav army, 
the international community cannot remain indifferent.  The 
international community will lose all credibility if it does not 
act immediately.  Otherwise, it will find itself encouraging the 
various abuses being committed by the Serbian government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to protect the civilian population of Kosovo, it seems 
that the armed solution is the last plausible option.  It is 
unfortunate that it has to be contemplated and supported, but 
the situation as it stands renders it necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, we understand and support Canada's desire to act with 
NATO forces to help the civilians of Kosovo.  However, the 
minister did not tell us what would happen should the forces of 
the former Yugoslavia, with President Milosevic at their head, 
refuse to give in to NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, what will happen if the NATO air strikes do not make 
Yugoslavia bend?  What will happen if the conflict drags on? 
What are the long term objectives of the alliance and Canada in 
this conflict? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs' speech did not provide answers 
to this question.  However, the hostilities with the former 
Yugoslavia are real. While we know when the adventure begins, 
who can claim to know when and how it will all end?  Obviously, 
this is all the more true if the Serbs feel they have nothing to 
lose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the people of Quebec and Canada are entitled to know 
whether Canada will become more involved in this conflict should 
it continue.  What will Canada contribute in terms of 
humanitarian aid to the thousands of civilians who are in need 
and obliged to leave their homes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, I invite the minister and his government to 
inform this House of the latest developments in the former 
Yugoslavia and to hold here a debate on possible changes in the 
nature of Canada's involvement in the former Yugoslavia. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK145"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, last October members of the House debated the serious 
humanitarian crisis that was unfolding in Kosovo.  At that time 
my colleague, the member for Halifax West, the New Democrat 
defence critic, and I rose in the House to say that there are 
times when the global community must respond to serious human 
rights violations, not just with words but with action.  I 
profoundly regret to say that we have now reached that point of 
humanitarian tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that diplomatic attempts at a negotiated settlement 
to the Kosova crisis have failed.  The Serbian government has 
refused to sign a peace agreement that would provide Kosovo with 
autonomy within the Yugoslav federation, a plebiscite in three 
years on the future status of Kosovars and the presence of a NATO 
peacekeeping force in Kosovo.  The Albanian Kosovars have signed 
and accepted this settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present situation in Kosovo is indeed unacceptable.  We see 
villages in flames and refugees fleeing in terror.  Serbian 
offences against the Albanian Kosovars continue as we speak. More 
than 40,000 Serb security forces are poised in and around Kosovo, 
with additional units on the way.  In January the bodies of 
almost 40 ethnic Albanians were found at the scene of fighting at 
Raca in southern Kosovo in what appears to have been a mass 
execution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time this type of ethnic violence erupted in the region 
was in Bosnia in the early 1990s.  It took three years and 
200,000 deaths and too many warnings before the west finally took 
action in August 1995.  It was not unfortunately the United 
Nations at that time, it was NATO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I visited Vukovar in Croatia and saw firsthand the terrible 
effects of Serb aggression against Croatia and its people there. 
I have often wondered since then if the international community 
had acted sooner in these conflicts a great number of civilian 
casualties could indeed have been prevented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the horrors of World War II, the international community 
has spent many years trying to develop covenants and treaties 
that focus on respect for international human rights.  Yet too 
often, while we have these human rights norms, the international 
community has failed miserably in enforcing them. It has only 
been recently that we have begun the difficult process of 
developing mechanisms to enforce international human rights.  I 
note that the creation of the international criminal court, a 
creation in which Canada played an important role, is a step in 
the right direction to ensuring that dictators and tyrants will 
face prosecution for the crimes they commit while in office. 
Yet the Yugoslav government, the Milosevic government, has 
shamefully refused to allow Judge Louise Arbour to enter Kosovo 
to investigate crimes against humanity there.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of crimes against humanity, I note today how 
pleased my colleagues in the New Democratic Party and I are at 
the decision of the House of Lords to allow for the extradition 
of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain to stand 
trial for crimes against humanity.  We urge the Government of 
Canada to seek his extradition as well.  I know there is a case 
of a Canadian nun who is seeking that extradition and others, and 
we appeal to our government to take that action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The possible NATO air strikes against the Serbian government are 
unprecedented.  It will be the first time since the alliance was 
founded 50 years ago next month that NATO has prepared to go into 
action collectively against a sovereign state.  Certainly we in 
the New Democratic Party have not reached the decision to support 
this military action without much anguish and much soul 
searching.  Our party has a long and honourable tradition of 
opposing NATO's military structure and doctrine, of calling 
for Canadian withdrawal from NATO and of strengthening the United 
Nations and regional security mechanisms.  This is particularly 
the case when NATO continues to cling to a neanderthal cold war 
doctrine of first use of nuclear weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The type of political will that has led to the decision for 
military action in Serbia has certainly been lacking in other 
parts of the world.  We need only look at the humanitarian crisis 
in Africa, stretching from the Horn to Angola, to see these kinds 
of inconsistencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister in his statement to the House said: “We cannot 
stand by while an entire population is displaced, people are 
killed, villages are burned and looted, and a population is 
denied its basic rights because it does not belong to the `right' 
ethnic group and we remain very concerned about potential 
atrocities”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Precisely those conditions apply in the NATO ally of Turkey with 
respect to the Kurdish minority and yet the Government of Canada 
and the world stand by.  Similar conditions apply in East Timor 
and elsewhere.  To those who say there is a double standard, I 
say they are right and certainly we opposed Washington's 
unilateral bombing of Khartoum, of Afghanistan and of Iraq.  To 
point out these inconsistencies and to suggest that NATO is not 
the most desirable international institution to enforce human 
security is at the end not enough.  We are left with the 
humanitarian crisis in Kosovo and the question of what Canada's 
response and what the global community's response should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Slobodan Milosevic has systematically refused to engage in 
dialogue and compromise.  He has continued his reign of terror in 
Kosovo against ethnic Albanians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party supports military action against 
selected Serbian military targets to address the humanitarian 
crisis facing Albanian Kosovars.  Certainly there are significant 
risks in taking this military action, risks to the lives of 
Canadian service people and to the lives of civilians in 
Yugoslavia and in Kosovo itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly want at this time to indicate on behalf of my New 
Democrat colleagues that our thoughts are with Canadian forces 
personnel stationed in Italy and their families in Canada, 
particularly those who are in the air at this time in the four 
CF-18s.  They deserve the support of all members of the House. As 
well we want to take this opportunity to salute the 63 brave 
Canadians who took part in the OSCE Kosovo verification mission 
and did their part to ensure compliance with UN resolutions for 
peace in the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly any military action has to be taken with the greatest 
possible care for the lives of civilians and of those in the 
armed forces. We must do everything in our power to bring 
about, even at this late stage, a peaceful settlement with 
Milosevic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize there are those who approach international security 
challenges from a pacifist position of opposing the use of force 
in all circumstances.  A former leader of my party, J. S. 
Woodsworth, took that position.  These are strong, deeply held 
views and they must be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I understand and frankly I share many of the concerns 
of groups like the Canadian Peace Alliance, Veterans Against 
Nuclear Arms and End the Arms Race which oppose the use of force 
in this situation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have raised legitimate questions, legitimate concerns that 
such strikes would be a violation of state sovereignty and that 
the UN security council should be the only body to authorize such 
use of force.  We in the New Democratic Party have recognized 
that without reform of the veto powers, of the permanent members 
of the security council, the UN is too often paralysed in an 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerns have been raised as well that the state of humanitarian 
objectives cannot be reached by military means.  There are valid 
concerns of escalating the conflict in a region that is already 
historically a powder keg, that this may draw in Albania and 
Montenegro. What next? Will Milosevic simply use this as a means 
of consolidating his support for standing up to the international 
community? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the New Democratic Party accept that the use of military 
force as a last resort is sometimes necessary in grave 
humanitarian crises when all efforts at diplomatic settlement 
have failed, and we believe this meets that test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canada is prepared to back up our concern for human security 
with military action, we must be equally prepared to provide the 
necessary financial and personnel resources for humanitarian 
relief as a result of the conflict.  This action will certainly 
create a large refugee crisis, and Canada should play a very 
generous and constructive role in addressing the needs of the 
refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister underlined in his comments earlier the truth that 
Canada wants a world in which human rights are respected.  May 
this be a turning point for the international community to accept 
that our present international institutions are incapable, sadly, 
of ensuring those human rights for all.  We must all come 
together and reform these institutions to put peace and respect 
for human rights at the forefront of relationships between people 
and relationships between nations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and I want to see an 
end to the humanitarian tragedy taking place in Yugoslavia in 
Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to make it clear that we support our soldiers, 
sailors and air crew who have now been placed in harm's way and 
also those of our allies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada and the NATO alliance made up of sovereign states have 
just gone to war with a sovereign state, the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia, over a civil war with the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have done this without a declaration of war and without the 
support of the United Nations.  The minister quotes security 
council resolutions 1199 and 1203, but they do not specifically 
give NATO the right to use military force against Yugoslavia. He 
might want to brush up on his international law and his long lost 
text of realpolitik.  We as a country and an alliance may have 
broken the codes of international law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bosnia in 1995 NATO was directed by the United Nations to 
keep the peace and to intervene in a bloody civil war, but NATO 
is now engaged in an offensive military operation outside its 
own territory. We are quickly subscribing to the view of NATO 
as a global policeman.  Let there be no mistake. We have just 
launched an air attack with our allies on a sovereign state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government has said by its actions that the United 
Nations and the soft power are not up to the task of ensuring 
global peace and security.  We have just heard the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Mr. Soft Power, state that the use of force is 
the ultimate guarantee of peace and security.  I hope this act of 
violence will not tarnish his Nobel peace prize, the one he wants 
so bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us leave the minister of war or foreign affairs for the 
moment and the fact that we may be violating international law. A 
minister of the crown just stood in the House and made a 
statement as the attack is going on.  After the first weapons 
have impacted on our opponent's territory, the saddest thing for 
Canadians and the parliamentary process is that this country has 
slipped into war without briefing its people through parliament 
and through meaningful debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very sad indeed to see what little regard the government 
has for the principles of parliamentary democracy and the House. 
It obviously did not support the Somalia inquiry recommendations 
for a vigilant parliament and that is very upsetting to 
Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until now, a foreign bank that wanted to establish an operation 
in Canada was required to set up an autonomous separate 
corporation in Canada with its own board of directors, its own 
accounting firm.  It would operate for all intents and purposes a 
Canadian company with an asset base that was established at the 
time of its being set up. In many respects this presented a lot 
of difficulties for foreign banks that wanted to do business in 
Canada and participate in the economy through lending, deposit 
taking and various other operations that banks pursue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far back as 1996 the then secretary of state for banks and 
financial institutions, Mr. Peters, told the House that the 
government was going to make provisions for what we have come to 
know as foreign branch banking.  A change in the Bank Act through 
legislation would allow foreign banks to simply establish 
branches here once they have met certain criteria. Their branches 
would have the benefit of being able to operate in Canada, plus 
be able to draw on the full asset base of their parent company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was 1996.  It is now 1999.  The question to ask is why it 
has taken the government so long to bring this plan to fruition. 
In our opinion, not only has the government been dragging its 
feet on this issue, but it has been doing some pretty heavy foot 
dragging on the whole issue of the changes to the financial 
services industry.  This has created a lot of confusion.  Quite 
frankly, it has left the Canadian owned banks that are operating 
in Canada as well as consumers at somewhat of a disadvantage. The 
banks' point of view is that they have not been able to pursue 
opportunities on a global basis to the extent they would like to. 
Our consumers of bank services have not had the choices they are 
entitled to and which they deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1998 I produced a report for the Reform Party 
entitled “Competition:  Choices You Can Bank On”. It was quite 
a lengthy report.  We went through most every phase of the 
financial services sector.  We examined it and we put forward 
recommendations which our party supports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to see the Liberal government is following one of our 
recommendations which deals with foreign bank entry.  We said 
very clearly in the report that the federal government must end 
its long delay in allowing foreign branch banking.  Foreign 
branch banking legislation must offer foreign banks that wish to 
have a branch in Canada the same regulatory and taxation regime 
encountered by domestic banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also said that foreign branch banking must be in place before 
the government considered the merits of any merger proposal.  As 
we saw last year when four of our major domestic banks put 
forward their merger proposals, because the government had been 
dragging its feet on introducing changes that would allow for 
more competition in the banking industry in Canada, it had no 
choice.  The government dug itself into a hole with its foot 
dragging and had no choice but to turn the mergers down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had we had changes in this country's financial services sector 
where Canadians had more choices on where they did their banking, 
perhaps the mergers could have been looked at in an entirely 
different light, in a more competitive light, in a more 
competitive environment here in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are going to be basically two types of foreign branches in 
Canada.  One will be what they call a full service branch, which 
will be able to operate primarily in the commercial sector, in 
the business area.  I am sure that will be their target.  They 
will not be permitted to take deposits of less than $150,000, but 
they will be able to lend money to Canadian companies, to small, 
medium and large companies that wish to start up or expand their 
operations in Canada.  I am sure that this new access to 
financing will be of huge value to the Canadian business sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other type of banking they will be able to do is what they 
refer to as a lending bank, in which there will be no deposit 
taking.  It will simply be a branch of a foreign bank that will 
be lending money primarily to businesses that want to expand, 
develop or otherwise increase their services in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to mislead Canadian consumers, the retail 
consumers.  It is very clear that foreign branch banking will 
really not have much of an impact on their lives.  They will not 
see foreign branches established on different street corners in 
their communities or in their cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreign branch banking will primarily be setting up in Canada to 
service the commercial business.  There may be a trickle down 
effect on Canadian consumers, because by providing increased 
access to financing for business, perhaps there will be some new 
start-ups of businesses for which individuals may not have been 
able to get financing from existing domestic banks or other 
sources.  There may be easier financing available for companies 
that wish to expand in Canada, and this will create more 
competition in the marketplace.  Whenever competition is 
thriving, consumers always do well.  We see it in the big 
megastores that have been established in Canada, the big box 
retailers, the grocery stores, the superstores.  Consumers are 
really, in my opinion, getting a huge benefit from having more 
competition in Canada at stores and in places where they want to 
spend money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will support Bill C-67.  Not only do we think it is good 
legislation. We cannot go without saying that it is about time 
the Liberal government brought it in.  We also question why this 
government took so long to bring in this legislation, which was 
promised back in 1996 when the former secretary of state talked 
about it in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current secretary of state for banks made some comments in 
his speech that I think bear response.  He said, for example, 
that a considerable number of foreign banks have cut back on 
Canadian activities or have pulled out of Canada altogether, that 
between 1990 and 1998 the number of foreign banks with 
subsidiaries in Canada dropped from 57 to 45.  It is no wonder. 
The government has been negligent in making changes to the 
legislation that would allow these foreign branches to come into 
Canada and service the needs of Canadians who require their 
services.  That legislation simply was not in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did a survey among some 30 very large foreign banks and 
asked them what changes to the environment in Canada would make 
this marketplace most attractive to them.  The number one answer 
was to bring in the long overdue legislation that would allow 
foreign branch banking.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to see, finally, that the government is doing 
something that is truly needed in this country.  That is a rarity 
in itself.  I can certainly say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our opinion, all the supervisory checks and balances of the 
regulatory structure are in place to ensure that this is to be a 
secure system for foreign branch banking in Canada.  We are 
satisfied that Canadians who deal with these new institutions 
will be able to deal with them in a very confident fashion, 
considering the criteria that these banks must meet before they 
are allowed to establish here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secretary of state also said “I want to put on the record 
very clearly that I could not be prouder than to be the secretary 
of state dealing with Canada's financial institutions”.  I am 
sure he is very proud of that.  I suggest that we could all be 
prouder of him if he would keep encouraging the Minister of 
Finance to take some of the steps that have to be taken to make 
Canada a leader in the world banking industry, not just a 
follower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we believe that there should be a regular review of 
the regulations put in place by the Office of the Superintendent 
of Financial Institutions and the Competition Bureau, the 
guidelines they operate under and the demands they make on the 
financial services business, to ensure that the regulations are 
effective and cost effective.  Canada, as we know, can be best 
described as a very overregulated country to do business in.  In 
so many cases overregulation costs Canadian consumers and 
businesses a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About three years ago a survey was done on all the types of 
regulations that were in place in Canada.  The bottom line of the 
survey was that overregulation and useless regulations in this 
country cost Canadians about $5 billion a year. Cost 
effectiveness in regulations is something that we should 
look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing the government has been dragging its 
heels on.  We talk about the constitutional division of powers as 
we deal with the regulations that govern the financial and 
securities sectors. There is a profound overlapping of federal 
and provincial regulatory structures, where the regulations are 
exactly the same but there are two different bodies doing the 
regulating.  This is very costly and very confusing to people who 
operate under these regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can take a giant step by getting rid of the 
overlap.  One regulation covering the same subject, with two 
different bodies administering it, can be very costly and very 
annoying to Canadian business.  In the banking system, there is 
overlap and there is regulatory structure that can be made a lot 
simpler.  Maybe it could be overseen by either the province or 
the federal government.  It would be a cost saving step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that a lot of politicians will not dare talk 
about is the subject of taxation and how it applies to banks.  I 
am not afraid to talk about that for two reasons. Canada is 
an overtaxed country, whether you are a worker or have a business 
or a large megacompany like a bank.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party constantly talks about banks not paying 
their fair share of taxes.  Incidentally, for the interest of the 
New Democratic Party, banks are a business, a business like any 
other business in Canada, and they are required to pay a fair 
share of their taxes, but they alone are one of the most 
overtaxed segments of Canadian business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason, in the November report that I presented to our 
party I recommended that a comprehensive review of the taxation 
regime encountered by Canadian financial institutions be required 
with the aim of improving competitiveness.  The Canadian 
financial institution taxation regime must be brought in line 
with the taxation levels of their domestic competitors and other 
Canadian businesses.  That has to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government also has to take some very serious steps to 
examine alternative financial institutions, like the 
proliferation of credit unions.  The government could make a lot 
of changes that would allow credit unions to expand and to serve 
Canadian consumers' needs.  Eliminating provincial trade barriers 
in that area would be great, as would allowing credit unions to 
pool their capital so they can take advantage of financing 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other ways the government can take some steps to 
improve the industry in Canada is in the area of the clearing and 
settlement of cheques, better known as the Canada payment system. 
We need to have the Canada payment system opened up to more 
players than simply those that we know as banks.  Large 
securities companies do not have access to the payment clearing 
system and must deal second hand through a bank in clearing their 
cheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk briefly about improving the role of the national 
ombudsman, who oversees all banking operations.  We believe that 
when the ombudsman investigates an alleged infraction by a bank, 
he or she should have increased powers to go in and do a very 
thorough investigation and, if that institution is found to be in 
contradiction to the regulations, to actually name names and 
assess penalties.  There is a system like that in the U.K. which 
we understand works very well. We would like to see that 
addressed as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supporting Bill C-67.  We think it is long overdue and is 
needed.  The only question we have about the bill is what took 
them so long. What took this Liberal government so long to bring 
in this bill that will allow foreign branch banking?  It talked 
about it in 1996.  The then secretary of state he said he would 
do it.  It is 1999, almost four years later, and we are finally 
seeing it.  We are happy about that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like the ask the hon. member a brief question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was probably one of the few members in the House who were open 
minded on the bank mergers.  I said to the banks and to all who 
would listen that as long as bank mergers did not reduce 
competition and did not reduce the rights of Canadians to have 
access to free and competitive business in the banking circles, I 
was willing to support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at other things that have happened with mergers since 
then, like the consolidation of the grocery business in eastern 
Canada.  In Newfoundland and all through Atlantic Canada all the 
reports show that through the merger of a couple of large grocery 
retail outlets, grocery costs for every family in Atlantic Canada 
will go up by an average of 7% a year. We allow mergers in one 
sector when we will not allow mergers in another sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we are allowing foreign banks to come into Canada and 
increase the competition, maybe they will just come into the big 
cities.  Maybe they will come in and take the cream of the crop 
and just open branches in bigger places, in the places that are 
more profitable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equally now that we will have a more competitive banking system 
in Canada which will give better access to all Canadians, should 
we not reassess the bank mergers which were rejected 
primarily upon the basis that we would have a less competitive 
banking system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question.  It is a good one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that when the merger proposals were put forward, 
because of the government inaction in making changes that would 
allow more competition in the financial services sector, the 
Minister of Finance basically painted himself into a corner. 
Under the current regime the merger of the banks would have 
indeed created a lessening of competition because the Minister of 
Finance and Liberal government have not taken any steps since 
1993 to allow the opportunity for more competition in the banking 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this step, this very important but still small step, we 
will have foreign branch banking in Canada that will be able to 
compete head-on with the big banks for commercial business.  It 
may fill a void.  There may be some switching of business between 
domestic banks and new foreign banks.  Yes, this is more 
competition indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a few more steps, and this is a good one, that the 
government could take to increase competition.  Then we should let 
those bank merger proposals come forward to be viewed in an 
entirely different light, in a more competitive environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banking industry is going to go through a number of changes 
to compete in the global economy in the next few years.  It has 
been doing it now, but there are some big changes to be made. 
One of those changes may very well be that our domestic banks 
will have to get together in some sort of marriage to take 
advantage of all the opportunities there are in the global 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, this is a good step and it will create more competition, 
but there is more to be done.  This government is the only thing 
standing between a fully competitive banking industry in Canada 
and what we have right now.  It is time that it stopped its 
foot-dragging and brought Canada into the 21st century where we 
can compete with big foreign banks in other countries. 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I cannot let this opportunity pass without making a 
comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My read on the bank merger was that the danger of having the big 
banks merge at this time was the amount of exposure to Canada's 
economy that would be incurred if our banking institutions 
merged.  In the context of a world economy where we have major 
disasters like the Asian flu, I think the Minister of Finance 
showed genuine prudence in putting off, at least for now, the 
prospect of a merger.  If there were to be a major loss with 
these merged banks it could have a catastrophic effect on the 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to the member opposite that the CIBC experienced 
this past year a major downturn and very significant losses.  I 
suggest that we keep our comments closer to the truth.  It is not 
just a matter of competition; it is a matter of the safety of our 
fiscal and economic nationalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am afraid the 
member is completely wrong in that assessment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that our big Canadian banks are among the finest 
bankers in the entire world.  They are leaders in the way they 
run their operations.  They are leaders in making prudent 
business decisions that will benefit not only their companies but 
also the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is irresponsible to compare our Canadian bank 
structure and our Canadian bank expertise with those of the banks 
that ran into trouble in Asia and in some third world countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can compete and we can lead in the industry with any bank in 
the world.  I do not believe for a moment that our Canadian banks 
are in any danger of making decisions that would lead to anything 
like what happened during the Asian flu.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the finance minister and this government since 
1993 have been dragging their feet on making changes to the 
financial industry that would allow Canadian banks to get even 
stronger and have more opportunity to be leaders in the global 
economy.  That is what they have to do.  They know it, and this 
is just one small step.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not want to get into the merits 
or the pros and cons of whether we should allow foreign banking. 
However, if foreign banks were allowed in and allowed to compete, 
as he and his party wish, 
would he not agree or take under advisement the 
private member's bill of my hon. colleague from 
Regina—Qu'Appelle which would force banks to have more community 
investment, similar to the credit union movement, where they 
would have to reinvest so much of their profits in the community 
so that we could have regional development, especially in the 
rural areas?  I know that he comes from a rural area. Would he 
not agree that would be one hell of an idea and would he not 
agree that his party should support that initiative? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard M. Harris:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I was a rabid 
socialist I probably could support that idea very well, but the 
fact is that I am a free enterpriser, always have been and always 
will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To place those types of requirements on Canadian business of any 
kind, whether it is a bank, Magna Industries or Bombardier, is a 
profound intrusion of government into free enterprise and I could 
never support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out to this member that it is Canadian business 
which provides millions and millions of jobs in this country. 
Those members may think that it is government that should employ 
everyone, but the fact is that Canadian business 
is the number one employer, always has been and always will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this economy grows we can look to Canadian business, which is 
employing workers who support that party and other parties. 
Canadian business writes the cheques for this 
country and keeps the economy going.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to stand in the House today to speak in favour of 
Bill C-67, an act to amend the Bank Act.  This bill is very 
important, not in itself necessarily, but because it begins the 
process of creating a more competitive financial services sector 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the 1998 national Liberal caucus task force on 
the future of the financial services sector, which was chaired by 
my colleague from Trinity—Spadina, I met with Canadians and 
listened to their concerns about the financial services sector. 
Canadians of all walks of life are concerned with both the 
accessibility and the affordability of financial services in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, seniors and seniors' organizations shared with the 
task force many of the same concerns about banking services as 
did other Canadians.  Seniors are concerned about reduced choice 
in banking services, tied selling, poor service in rural areas, 
access to capital for small businesses, high levels of profit and 
privacy issues.  Seniors also brought forward issues regarding 
the cost of banking services, reduced teller services, fewer 
branches, reduced pedestrian access and a lack of information 
about basic accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although many seniors are having their banking needs properly 
met, the multitude of different banking options now available can 
be very confusing.  Banks have a tendency to promote the most 
expensive service packages, which may include features seniors do 
not need. It is particularly important that services available to 
seniors and basic low-cost service packages in general be 
advertised prominently at bank branches and automated teller 
machines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trend toward automated services cuts costs for banks and can 
provide a convenient service for many customers.  Many seniors, 
however, are uncomfortable with some of the new technologies and 
prefer to deal with a person rather than a machine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, not all branches have lower counters for persons with 
limited mobility or provide areas where seniors and others can 
sit while waiting for service.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many seniors dependent upon public transportation, a visit 
to a bank branch a few kilometres away can cause significant 
travel time while waiting for buses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Low income Canadians and ethnocultural communities in Canada 
have also raised concerns about the accessibility and 
affordability of financial services in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, small and medium size businesses, which are the driving 
force behind economic growth, also need affordable and 
accessible financial services.  There are 2.4 million SMBs in 
Canada.  Half of all private sector jobs are in these 
businesses.  They are also responsible for 45% of the production 
in the private sector, and 95% of all new jobs. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small businesses are highly dependent on the chartered banks for 
financing.  This dependence has been increasing over the past few 
years.  The Conference Board of Canada has shown that domestic 
chartered banks held 50.3% of the total SME financing market in 
1996, compared to 48.4% in 1994.  In addition, they held 72% of 
outstanding commercial loans to SMEs in 1996, up from 66% in 
1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With such a large share of the SME lending market, the chartered 
banks face little competition from other institutions.  This 
absence of competition is even greater in some regions of the 
country and in rural areas where small businesses may be totally 
dependent on one or two banks that operate in their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is even worse in areas located outside financial 
centres.  Women, young entrepreneurs and aboriginal people in 
particular have poor access to debt financing.  Small and medium 
size businesses are an integral part of our economy, yet they 
have only limited access to bank capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the gallery are two business people from Alberta, Darrell 
Toma and Tom Clark, who have a very good entrepreneurial idea 
involving innovation in the agricultural and agribusiness sector. 
Capital is an issue that is constraining them.  For that reason I 
am hoping they are successful in their visit to Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for these reasons that our caucus task force made it a 
priority to offer solutions to ensure that affordable financial 
products and services are available to all Canadians and their 
businesses, regardless of where they live.  We, the members of 
the task force, concluded that the most effective way to make the 
financial services sector more affordable is to encourage more 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other measures, the task force recommended the 
introduction of foreign bank branching into Canada.  Our 
government again has responded. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, foreign banks wishing to operate in Canada 
must open distinct Canadian subsidiaries.  For foreign banks not 
wishing to receive retail deposits in Canada this constitutes a 
needless regulatory requirement, which adds to their costs of 
doing business in the country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since reaching a peak of 59 in 1987, the number of foreign bank 
subsidiaries in Canada has declined to just 45 in 1998.  Their 
share of total banking sector assets, which stood at about 12% in 
1990, fell to just under 10% by the end of 1998.  Almost all of 
the foreign banks in Canada operate solely as investment banks 
specializing in financing large corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreign banks have publicly stated that they currently find the 
cost of trying to compete head to head with Canadian chartered 
banks for personal and small business lending to be so high as to 
make it futile.  These banks cite tax, regulatory issues and the 
delay in introducing branching as factors inhibiting the entry of 
foreign banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to note that earlier this year our government 
announced measures which will ensure that Canadian branches of 
foreign banks, Canadian subsidiaries of foreign banks and 
domestic banks are all taxed on a similar basis.  Bill C-67 
further levels the playing field for foreign banks.  At the same 
time, however, no advantage has been provided to foreign banks 
over our domestic banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compared to other industrialized nations, Canada is falling 
behind.  The 1998 world economic forum on global competitiveness 
ranked Canada 39th in the ease with which new banks can begin 
operation and 40th for the participation of foreign banks in the 
Canadian financial sector.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question there are significant barriers to entry for 
foreign banks and that is why this bill is so important.  It is 
also why our national Liberal task force encouraged the 
government to move expeditiously to allow foreign banks greater 
access to Canada, and our government has responded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-67 will bring Canada's foreign bank entry policies into 
line with practices in other major industrialized countries, all 
of which allow foreign bank branching.  The new rules will give 
foreign banks the option of establishing one of two types of 
branches, a full service branch or a lending branch.  Full 
service branches will not be allowed to accept deposits of less 
than $150,000 from Canadians.  Lending branches will not be able 
to accept any deposits or borrow except from other financial 
institutions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the branches of foreign banks will not be accepting retail 
deposits, they will be subject to slightly less stringent 
regulatory requirements in Canada than the subsidiaries of 
foreign banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The restrictions applicable to deposits ought not to discourage 
the arrival of any new banks, since most foreign banks want 
primarily to provide commercial banking services in Canada. 
Those wishing to accept retail deposits will still be able to 
establish a distinct subsidiary in Canada for that purpose. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed banking regime will permit foreign banks to use 
their larger capital base to support lending activities in 
Canada.  Over time this should allow foreign banks currently 
operating in Canada to increase their lending activities.  This 
will provide new sources of capital for small and medium size 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-67 is the first step in a process to encourage more 
competition in Canada's financial services sector.  I encourage 
our government to unleash the power of our domestic financial 
institutions such as the credit unions, near banks and some of 
our very own crown corporations through further legislative and 
regulatory change.  This will further encourage greater 
competition in Canada's financial services sector. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the bill benefits all consumers of banking 
services. It will, in particular, help small businesses to 
create still more jobs in the 21st century. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for this reason that I am proud to support Bill C-67 and I 
hope my colleagues will do the same.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak on behalf of the NDP in the debate today on 
Bill C-67, basically a bill which implements an agreement the 
current federal government signed at the World Trade 
Organization. Interesting that it signed it a day before the 
banks announced their plans to merger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always remember being struck with what I thought was the 
simulated shock on the part of the Minister of Finance that the 
banks had not told him this, that he had no idea what was 
happening.  He was appalled and yet surely to goodness the 
Minister of Finance must have realized that by signing this 
agreement he created some of the significant conditions that led 
to the banks feeling they had to merge. We did not agree with the 
proposal to have the banks merge. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I was saying before I 
was so procedurally interrupted, the Minister of Finance feigned 
surprise when the banks said they wanted to merge.  It is not a 
coincidence as far as I am concerned and as far as many other 
people are concerned that they made this announcement a day after 
the signing of this international financial services agreement of 
which we are now debating the implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this will do is introduce an element of competition at a 
certain level in the Canadian banking industry and obviously the 
banks felt, wrongly, that they had to merge in order to meet the 
new conditions.  These new conditions whether or not the banks 
merge still should be of concern to Canadians.  What I think will 
happen is that these foreign banks will be allowed to compete at 
the high end of the banking industry.  They will be able to deal 
with the people who have $150,000 to deposit.  These foreign 
banks will not have anything to do with sort of ordinary folks 
who cannot keep $150,000 in their account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian banks if they do not win this competition with 
these foreign banks and begin to lose money, where will they look 
for more profits in order to meet the inquisitive instincts of 
their shareholders?  They will look to ordinary Canadians who are 
still captive customers of the Canadian banks.  I see more and 
higher service charges ahead, more of all the little ways the 
banks have devised to take a little money off people here and 
there and everywhere and nickel and dime them to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when people actually had the feeling that 
banks, although it was probably an illusion, were there to serve 
them. When I was a kid the bank used to come to our school every 
Monday. This is what we would call capitalist inculcation or 
something like that.  Nevertheless people from the bank would 
come to this school on Mondays and we would all have our bank 
books and we would put a dime in or whatever. This was to teach 
us to save.  It was also to create sort of a lifetime brand 
loyalty to this bank which I will not name because I would not 
want to give it a free advertisement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was service.  Teller did things for people.  There are 
still some banks that do that, some individual bank locations. 
Certainly what the banks would like us to do is not have anything 
to do with a teller at all, not having to do with any human 
being.  If we need something to do with a human being we are 
supposed to stand there and fill out all the forms while they do 
something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went the other day to pay a Visa bill for somebody else. There 
is a special charge to pay somebody else's Visa bill. Pretty soon 
they will be measuring people's footsteps from the doorway to the 
teller and they will charge by the footstep or how long they are 
in there using up air.  They will have a long line-up and then 
they will be charging so many bucks per cubic inches of oxygen. 
I do not want to get too ridiculous but the banks have in my 
judgement become ridiculous in the manifold ways in which they 
find new inventions to charge people money for things they used 
to do for nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to move on to the larger issue, the WTO, and this 
international financial services agreement.  There are two things 
here. There is the way the WTO works and the way the government 
allows itself to be worked over by the WTO, and the fact that 
these agreements are signed without any input from parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no debate before the government signs these agreements. 
Then what we get here is an agreement that is already signed.  It 
is a fait accompli and we do not really have any say in the 
matter whatsoever.  I do not think that is right and it shows up 
the undemocratic nature of the WTO.  Governments sign these 
agreements and then they simply expect them to be ratified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is part of a larger trend, particularly on the part of this 
government, which we see unfolding that I find objectionable not 
just in terms of the WTO but in terms of some of the other 
significant decisions it has made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just today, for example, people were commenting on the NATO 
operations in Kosovo. NATO was recently enlarged.  Three 
countries were added to NATO.  Every other NATO country had a 
debate in its parliament about the enlargement of NATO. Most of 
those other NATO countries, I think 13 out of 15, were required 
by their constitution or statutes that when such a significant 
decision would be taken there would be a real debate in 
parliament about the merits of that expansion, because a treaty 
was being changed.  Certainly it was mandatory in the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only other place like Canada where it was not mandatory was 
Westminster, United Kingdom, but it did have a debate. Its 
parliamentary tradition is stronger and it would not make such a 
significant decision without having a debate in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened in Canada?  We just issued a press release.  The 
Minister of Foreign Affairs just issued a press release saying 
that the Government of Canada had ratified the expansion of NATO. 
Not a take note debate, not ministerial statement, absolutely 
nothing, no consideration by the standing committee on foreign 
affairs.  Zippo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is the WTO or NATO, we see a pattern on the part of 
the government that it simply signs agreements and expects 
parliament to ratify them or expects parliament to be silent 
about the ratification, depending on whether there is legislation 
required.  When it came to the NATO expansion there was no 
legislation required so it did not have to go parliament a year 
later for implementation purposes.  It never has to go to 
parliament.  I think it is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the WTO sooner or later it has to go to parliament, but 
then we are debating things a year and a half after the fact. 
That is inadequate also because what we find with respect to 
international financial services is that there is a great need 
for reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not having that debate about reform of the international 
financial services and system, although we did make progress 
yesterday.  We made progress when the private member's motion of 
the hon. member for Regina—Qu'Appelle was passed in this House, 
not unanimously but nevertheless by a significant majority, 
calling for the enactment of a tax on international financial 
speculation, sometimes called the Tobin tax after Professor Tobin 
who invented it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sometimes think that for years we have been trying to get the 
Minister of Finance to agree to the Tobin tax and then finally 
somebody got to him and told him that the tax was not named after 
the Premier of Newfoundland.  Then he was willing to go along 
with the idea.  I do not know if his feelings about the future 
Liberal leadership were getting in the way of his relationship 
with the Tobin tax.  Anyway, at some point the Minister of 
Finance decided that it might be okay to support something called 
the Tobin tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not inconsistent with some of things the Minister of 
Finance has been saying over the last little while about the need 
for a new global architecture for the international 
financial system.  We need a Bretton Woods agreement for the 21st 
century, not an imitation in any way of the Bretton Woods system 
that broke down, but something that has the same principles and 
goals, not just the goals of creating an unfettered global free 
market in capital movement and speculation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At least the world leaders after the second world war had some 
kind of vision of what kind of world they wanted.  They were not 
afraid to talk about a world in which the systems they devised 
were there for the purposes of creating employment.  They were 
there for the purposes of bettering the social conditions of 
people in all countries of the world.  These sort of uncritical, 
brainless mantras about trade investment and liberalization as if 
this would be the salvation of mankind were not for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, it might be a good learning experience for you to 
go to a WTO meeting.  People get up and speak about trade 
investment and liberalization as if it had salvific qualities; 
whatever problems humanity experiences, a little more 
liberalization of trade and investment will do the trick. It is a 
quasi religious experience to be at a WTO meeting.  It is like 
being at some kind of revival meeting where a guy gets up, like 
Ruggiero, the head of the WTO.  I am not kidding. They talk about 
liberalization of trade and investment as if it is the solution 
for everything; if there is a problem, all that is needed is a 
little more investment liberalization or trade liberalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not working.  We are in a world in which there is a 
greater gap between the poor and the rich countries, and a 
greater gap between the poor and the rich within countries.  It 
is creating a world which is very unjust, very unstable and very 
unsustainable environmentally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not so long ago some of us in the House rose on jubilee 2000 and 
the call from the leaders of many of the churches in Canada for 
forgiveness of debts for the poorest nations in the world.  Are 
we doing this just because we want to be nice guys?  Partly I 
hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize the situation in which these countries have found 
themselves.  Many of these countries are in these situations as a 
result of decisions taken by previous authoritarian dictatorship 
unelected governments. They are in a hole which they have a hard 
time getting out of. The churches have said that we need to have 
some debt forgiveness.  We need to realize in our own time the 
insights of the biblical teaching about the year of jubilee in 
which debts are forgiven, slaves are freed, captives are 
liberated and people have a chance to begin anew, to start over. 
Many of these countries need to have that. It is not just for 
that.  It is also in our own interests that we do this, 
particularly from an ecological point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do these countries do?  This is part of the problem with 
the international financial system.  They have to pay these debts 
in hard currency. In order to get hard currency they have to 
export.  In order to export they have to do things that are not 
necessarily good for the population or good for the local 
environment.  They have to stop doing all the things they might 
normally do to provide food for the local population.  They grow 
coffee, or they have to burn down the rain forest and turn it 
into pasture, or they have to harvest the rain forest and turn 
it into exportable hardwoods or other wood products.  Acres and 
acres of forest in southeast Asia are being turned into 
chopsticks as part of a growing export market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not being very smart in the extent to which we make these 
people destroy our common environment in order to pay these 
debts.  We are cutting off our nose to spite our face.  Penny 
wise and pound foolish.  There are an infinite number of morals 
which we are not paying attention to when we ask people to do 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine a world in which all the debts are paid, but we cannot 
breathe the air.  We cannot drink the water.  We cannot enjoy a 
stable political relationship with other countries because 
everything is in absolute violent chaos. 
But the banks will be okay.  The debts will be paid.  And that is 
the important thing because that really is our god, is it not?

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is a god after all, at least in the sense of a false god, 
an idol?  That which has this power over human life, that is a 
false power, that is there only because we give it that power and 
we pretend that it has that power over us in some objective way 
rather than realising that it has that power over us because we 
give it that power.  That is one of the commandments.  Thou shalt 
not make a graven image.  Thou shalt not have false gods before 
me.  It means that we give power to something which has no power, 
except that power which we give it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we do here over and over again is we give power to systems 
over us, as if they have some kind of objectivity and reality 
apart from our acquiescence, apart from our own participation in 
giving them that power. What I am saying here today is that we 
need to name those idols, those false gods for what they are, as 
just that: something over which we should have more control as 
human beings instead of them controlling us.  Because when we are 
controlled by something other than ourselves, when we are captive 
to something, we are captive to a particular point of view or to 
some power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what they meant in the old days by the demonic.  If you 
had a demon it meant you were not in control of your own life, 
that something else was controlling your life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here now is the elevation of the free market to the 
level of the demonic.  We cannot control anything.  We want to 
have a decent drug system in this country, generic drugs.  We 
cannot do it.  That would get in the way of the free market and 
intellectual property rights. We would like to have our own 
culture and protect it through split-run magazines, but we cannot 
do it.  That would get in the way of the free market. The list 
goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Soon it will be, we would like to keep our water and not export 
it to a country that is irresponsible in its use of water, like 
we ourselves are but nevertheless, we cannot do it.  It will be 
NAFTA and free market principles that will keep us from doing 
that. The list goes on and on of the ways in which we have ceded 
the power that we should rightly hold individually and 
collectively, politically, over our own lives to this thing that 
we call the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this bill is about and what many other bills that 
come before this House are about.  That is why the NDP is against 
it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the member opposite.  He brought up the 
issue of the Tobin tax.  I have to say it is terribly typical of 
members of his generation in this House who talk about issues 
long on sentiment but very short on practicality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday we passed a private member's motion with respect to 
supporting a Tobin tax, which is a global tax on financial 
transactions.  I have to say that many of the members on my side 
of the House supported the motion.  I did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not because anyone should realize that the only way this 
financial transaction tax can ever work is if every country that 
has a financial transaction market gets on side, everyone.  The 
United States, Europe, the Cayman Islands, everyone has to get on 
side otherwise the money, the transactions will just flow to 
wherever there is no tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the member that here again we have a do good notion 
that raises expectations.  Just as the member said, it is such a 
great thing, it will solve the world's problem, but he ignores 
the fact that it can never be implemented.  We in parliament 
should be dealing with issues that are possible with things that 
can be done, not with simple dreams that look good in the public 
and perhaps will win the member a few votes.  That is not where 
we should be at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I suppose the member is 
free to say what he just said, but the record should be clear 
that what he said obviously applies to 95% of his own caucus. 
They voted for that particular motion by my New Democratic 
colleague.  It was not my motion. It was the motion of the member 
for Regina—Qu'Appelle.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if we took that attitude toward everything, that it cannot 
be done, that it cannot be done until everybody does it? There is 
some truth in that.  We are talking about an international tax. 
We understand it is not going to have the effect we want it to 
have if only Canada does it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about Canada showing leadership in international 
fora, trying to get such a tax to be imposed not just by Canada 
but by other countries.  The member has set up a straw man and 
then conveniently knocked him down.  Unfortunately for him, I am 
not a straw man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never said it would solve everything.  I never said anything 
of the kind. I said it would be a step forward in trying to set 
up an international financial system that was not driven by the 
greed of international money speculators.  If he is for that, 
good for him.  He should go out and get a job as a PR agent for 
the money speculators.  As for me, I would rather drive them out 
of the temples. 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
very briefly for anybody who might be following the debate, the 
motion dealt with by the House last night was to consider the 
advisability and in fact to study, not to approve a tax and to 
move forward with it.  Obviously, this needs a starting point.  I 
wanted simply to clarify that.  I am sure the member would also 
want to confirm this is a starting point for consideration of the 
advisability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is the way all 
motions read, but we all know, in spite of the fact that they 
read that way, politically they are taken as approval of the idea 
that is contained in the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the government so very often resists motions.  If 
the government were to take the member's comments, technically 
speaking the government should vote for everything because it is 
only considering the advisability of it.  But the government does 
not vote for everything.  Some things it does not want to 
consider the advisability of because it is against them.  When we 
get to the point that the government wants to consider the 
advisability of, this is a step forward and should be recognized 
as such. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do 
not know whether the discussion has now moved back to the Tobin 
tax, but I was very interested and I did support that. It is a 
step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the member with some interest.  Unfortunately, for 
me, the member paints a very gloomy picture of the state of the 
nation state as we move into the 21st century.  If we look at the 
works of Joseph Frankel or Hans Morgenthau on the role of the 
nation state in the international system, what we have seen is 
that over the years the nation state has become more important 
particularly in terms of its relationship between the citizens 
and government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In listening to the member, the member gives me the impression, 
and hopefully it is a wrong impression, that we as 
parliamentarians and indeed as a government are losing our 
ability to act on the international stage.  Certainly anything 
which would infringe on an issue, whether the issue is water—and 
I certainly concur with my colleague across the way about the 
export of water—one of the things we have to be very careful 
about in Canada is the loss of sovereignty both in economic and 
political terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want some clarification from the member with regard to 
the picture he was painting.  Does he feel that we have lost our 
ability, again in dealing with this bill, to serve our citizens? 
Will we become not only slaves to the market but to other 
international organizations to the point that we might as well 
just close up shop, because at the end of the day it will be 
those international bodies, both in an economic and political 
sense, that really will be dictating our future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes, I was painting a very 
gloomy picture.  I do feel that parliament has a lot less power 
than it had certainly when I arrived here 20 years ago this May. 
A lot of the power that parliament had in 1979 it has since ceded 
through various international trade agreements, depending on how 
we want to describe it, either to the marketplace or to the 
culture of those particular international organizations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking particularly about the WTO.  Things that this 
parliament has done have been literally struck down by these 
international organizations.  The member from Kamloops was 
talking about the MMT decision.  Thanks to the investor state 
dispute settlement process in NAFTA, we now have a situation in 
which various decisions taken by governments can be challenged by 
corporations in the courts.  Governments are suffering what is 
called the chill effect, that is, they are very reluctant to move 
on certain environmental matters because they may be sued in the 
courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I already mentioned the drug patent and property rights thing 
and the split-run issue.  There is a long list.  I say to the 
hon. member that there is a long list of things that parliament 
can no longer do.  We in this place have lost a lot of power, not 
just to the international marketplace.  We have lost it to 
executive federalism.  We have lost it to the charter of rights. 
We have lost it in at least three different ways. We have lost it 
to polling.  We have lost it to the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot to be gloomy about as parliamentarians. 
I think we should be concerned and I do not think we should puff 
ourselves up with a sense of false importance.  We should be 
concerned about how unimportant we are in this place and about 
how many decisions that used to be made in parliament are no 
longer made here, for a variety of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was concentrating on those national economic decisions that 
used to be made in this place but which now cannot be because of 
the free trade agreement.  I cite a recent speech by the member's 
own former leader, Mr. John Turner, former Prime Minister of 
Canada, who spoke in the Canadian Club of London in January. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I circulated a copy of that speech to every Liberal member just 
a week or so ago and I recommend to the member that he read that 
speech by Mr. Turner.  It certainly does not read like anything 
that anybody in this Liberal government has ever said since they 
were elected in 1993.  One of the reasons why we do not have the 
power we used to is the total betrayal by the Liberal Party of 
the position it took on the FTA in 1988 and on the NAFTA in 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is something to be gloomy about, most of it can be 
attributed to that betrayal.  At least the Conservatives had the 
decency to run on the free trade agreement.  At least you always 
knew where the Tories were coming from.  They were coming right 
at you with a machete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people say one thing and do another and they continue to 
behave in that same deplorable way. I feel a little gloomy about 
it.  I have a lot to be gloomy about when our country is run by a 
pack of people like the members opposite, who say one thing and 
do another. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
enjoyed the spirited discussion between the member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona and the members opposite.  When I hear the 
member for Winnipeg—Transcona, I have a great deal of respect 
for him.  This House is a better place due to his presence. As he 
was saying, he has been here for 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I respect about the New Democrats, even though 
I disagree with them on particular issues, is their consistency 
on these issues.  There is a set of core values.  Even though I 
disagree with them fervently on a number of them, it is like the 
quotation that was falsely attributed to Voltaire: “although I 
disagree with what you are saying I will fight to my death to 
protect your right to say it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also say that the member for Winnipeg—Transcona has a 
terrific oratorical flair.  I guess that comes from his time in 
the clergy.  He makes me very proud to be a member of the United 
Church of Canada.  If he ever decides to leave this political 
life and re-enter the clergy on a full time basis, I would 
probably move to his community just to hear him on Sunday 
mornings.  He is a terrific orator even though I disagree with an 
awful lot of what he says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before us today on the liberalization of the 
regulations for foreign banks in Canada is a very important piece 
of legislation.  It is part of Canada's compliance with the WTO 
agreement on financial services. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also part of an ongoing trend, a global trend of 
significant changes in the financial services sector and in every 
sector.  Much of this change that is occurring is technologically 
based.  For instance, in the financial services sector and in the 
banking sector, many of the changes have been developed through 
technology.  There has been the death of distance as a 
determinant in the cost of telecommunications. There have been 
the advent of the bank machines and the automation in banking, 
which have changed and revolutionized banking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would say, and there is some credence to the argument, that 
it has depersonalized banking, that it has made banking services 
less friendly, that there are not as many tellers in the 
communities. Others are saying that in fact there are some 
positive developments: we can now 
withdraw money at a grocery store with a bank card, which 
effectively makes a grocery store like a bank, to a certain 
extent, due to the fact that we can withdraw or deposit money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the members opposite in the Liberal Party says this can 
be done at liquor stores too.  I do not frequent those 
establishments, but I certainly would not speak judgmentally of 
anyone who does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, the fact is that there are many changes occurring 
in terms of trade and commerce and there are changes that are 
technologically driven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the banking sector, we have seen a great deal of merger 
activities around the world over the past several years. This 
week there were announcements coming out of Italy, where there 
has been significant merger activity. There has been activity in 
Switzerland and in the U.S.  Banks are getting larger, partly to 
develop economies of scale in order to afford the types of 
technologies necessary to be competitive in the global 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Canadian banking sector, one of the difficulties that has 
occurred over the past 50 years is that there has not been enough 
competition in the Canadian banking sector, particularly in terms 
of lending to small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent some time living in the U.S.  One of the things I noted 
when doing business there was that the banking sector was far 
more entrepreneurial.  For instance, if you lived in Maine and 
were turned down as a small business person by the Bank of Bath, 
one could go to the Bank of Bangor.  If one lived in Georgia and 
were turned down by the Bank of Loganville, an actual bank that 
has been there for about 150 years, one could go to the Bank of 
Snellville, an actual bank in Snellville, Georgia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, the banks used to do something called character 
lending, which was very positive in some ways.  They would lend 
to people because they knew them and trusted them.  They knew 
they would get their money back, regardless of the financial 
situation.  Banks stopped doing that a few years ago. Effectively 
it is all ratio lending in Canada now. If we do not match one 
bank's ratios, we do not match any of them.  It is very 
difficult for small business to attain financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do need to move to increase competitive factors in Canada in 
the banking sector, in particular to improve lending to small 
business.  In this legislation, the government has made a baby 
step to address this.  Having more foreign competition in the 
Canadian banking sector, for instance creating more competition 
in small business lending, will help somewhat.  The fact is even 
before this legislation we have seen players like Wells Fargo 
introduce services in Canada.  In 1997 Wells Fargo had about 
10,000 customers in Canada.  By 1998 that had grown to 120,000. 
Much of that is in small business lending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is occurring and the competition is growing.  We would argue 
as well that part and parcel of the government's response to the 
MacKay task force recommendations should be that we allow the 
credit unions to compete more directly with banks. Changing the 
co-operatives act to allow credit unions to compete directly with 
banks would help as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that while we do these things to allow more 
competition in Canada we do not do things that hurt the Canadian 
banking sector too much. 
It is very easy to pick on banks.  It is like picking on 
politicians.  One of the nice things about the bank merger 
discussions was that there were a lot of bankers in Ottawa 
and they made politicians feel more 
popular.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very easy for us to attack banks, but one thing we have to 
realize is that over 50% of Canadians own bank shares, either 
directly or indirectly through their RRSPs and pension funds.  We 
have an RRSP policy that basically forces Canadians to invest 80% 
of their retirement savings in the Canadian equities markets or 
in Canadian investments, which represent about 1.5% of global 
equities markets.  At the same time, it is hard to invest in 
Canadian equities markets without buying Canadian bank shares. 
They dominate the TSE. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be a careful that we do not, in the interest of 
short term political gain, make decisions that actually hinder 
the long term growth of Canadian retirement savings plans. All 
these things should occur as parallel initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking forward to the government's response to the MacKay 
task force, which I believe will be a white paper—I hope it is 
not a whitewash—on the Canadian financial services sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are advocating greater competition in the Canadian financial 
services sector through more foreign competition and through 
changing the co-operatives act.  It is important to recognize 
that more competition in the Canadian financial services sector 
and more efficiency in the Canadian financial services sector, 
with better services for Canadians, is a productivity issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke earlier about small business.  For small business access 
to capital is critical to growth and to getting started. That has 
hindered economic growth in Canada relative to the U.S., because, 
frankly, it is easier for a small business person to raise money 
in the U.S. than it is in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the strengths of the Canadian banking system is that we 
have five very strong banks that will never go broke.  The fact 
that they never take risks with small business people is one of 
the weaknesses we have.  There is a risk and reward question 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. banking system is more entrepreneurial and does contain 
higher elements of risk, which results in more capital being 
available to U.S. small businesses when they want to grow and 
prosper.  That does have a significant impact on our productivity 
in a competitive sense, particularly with our largest trading 
partner, the giant to the south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will help facilitate more small business lending. 
This bill will help foreign banks currently participating in the 
Canadian market to expand their operations.  It will also help 
attract more foreign banks to initiate lending to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the bank merger discussions, some people who were opposed 
to the mergers said that foreign competition is really not a 
factor in the Canadian banking sector, that this was a red 
herring being used by the proponents of the mergers.  The fact is 
that foreign competition has had and does have a presence in 
Canadian industry.  It has not had a strong presence because the 
regulatory framework was not conducive to it or supportive of it. 
That had to be changed.  It is changing.  This is one step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are what I think are some reasonable arguments for the 
government to move quickly on liberalizing and allowing more 
foreign competition in Canada.  At the same time, it is very 
important that while we increase foreign competition and allow 
more small business lending from foreign competitors, co-ops and 
others, we do not, by some shortsighted political decisions, 
handcuff Canadian banks or Canadians who are saving for their 
retirement with their investments in the equities of Canadian 
banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The types of decisions I am talking about can have a significant 
impact on the savings of Canadians.  For instance, the gap 
between the Dow Jones index and the TSE has grown by about 500 
points since December. 
Part of that had to do with the performance of the Canadian banks 
in the past several months.  Part of that had to do with the 
decision the minister made in December.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadian bank stocks fall, it is not without an impact on 
the average Canadian, on ordinary Canadians who through their 
pension funds, mutual funds and union pension funds have their 
investments.  It is very important.  The fact is some of these 
decisions by this government do threaten the future standards of 
living of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, since 1993 the Dow Jones in the U.S. has grown by 
about 180%.  In Canada the TSE has gained by about 60%.  Wealth 
being a relative thing, we have to realize that if our largest 
trading partner is getting richer, we are getting poorer.  When 
it gets richer, the price of goods and services due to 
competitive factors actually will increase and we, as Canadians, 
can less afford to have them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe now the best selling car in the U.S. is the Toyota 
Camry and the best selling car in Canada is the Honda Civic.  I 
believe that is the latest factor.  I would think that if the 
government is in much longer the best selling car in Canada will 
be perhaps one of the old Austin minis or maybe it will be a 
bicycle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be very careful because with public policy the law of 
unintended consequences can wreak havoc.  When we do not really 
realize it, sometimes the decisions we make here can really have 
a tremendous impact on Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things we felt very strongly about and we were not in 
support of was the bank mergers.  What we were in support of was 
the government's using an opportunity that it had from the merger 
proponents who were seeking approval for something to engage in a 
discussion and negotiate on behalf of Canadians, to stand up for 
Canadians and to get from the banks commitments on things like a 
reduction in service charges, more customer service staff, 
continued service to rural Canada, creation of new banks for 
small business lending, increased bank branch access and that 
sort of thing.  Those are the types of things that are very 
important to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a <I>Maclean's</I> poll done in November that indicated 
that 53% of Canadians were opposed to the mergers based on the 
information they had.  Some 57% said they would be supportive if 
the government were to negotiate commitments from banks and the 
banks were to make specific commitments on particular areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the MacKay task force actually recommended 
making these commitments legally binding so that the banks would 
have to make good on these commitments.  It could not just be a 
marketing ploy.  They would have to actually keep the commitments 
or ultimately directors would end up going to jail or facing 
legal penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was interesting was that during that process some of the 
bank merger proponents, for instance the Royal Bank and the Bank 
of Montreal, said they would reduce service charges by 10%.  They 
would increase customer service staff and they made specific 
commitments in numbers.  They would continue their services to 
rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, they committed to doubling their small business 
lending.  I believe it was from $25 billion to $50 billion.  That 
is $25 billion more for the Canadian small business sector as a 
result of this and a new bank for small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the terrible things about being in small business, 
particularly in small town Canada, is that they change the bank 
managers every few years.  We just get to know one manager and then they 
switch him or her. It is a real problem.  That was one of 
the things they were willing to address with a small business 
bank where they would keep people in the same area for longer and 
it would create better relationships.  I think that a lot of that 
stuff was positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately we kind of lost our opportunity to get these 
commitments because we sort of shut the door before the 
negotiation even began.  Now we are seeing banks closing 
branches.  It is happening all the time.  Last week in 
Nova Scotia I believe two communities lost bank branches, their 
only bank branches.  We are seeing on an ongoing basis services 
threatened.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now in some ways the banks are trying to do the right 
thing because they have a responsibility to their shareholders 
and when they were willing to make those kinds of commitments the 
minister kind of shut the door.  I hope the minister has not made 
a shortsighted decision that would prevent Canadians from having 
received the best possible banking services that they could have 
achieved and at the same time not necessarily handcuff our banks. 
We will see how well that decision ages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the Dominion Bond Rating Service's downgrading of 
the Canadian banks a few weeks ago is one of the indications that 
the minister's decision was a little shortsighted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately when that kind of downgrading occurs it means that 
for Canadians there will be higher borrowing charges ultimately 
for banks.  The cost of the banks' money for capital goes up. 
The banks will pass that on to consumers.  When Dominion Bond 
Rating Service downgrades the Canadian banks and the cost of 
capital for the Canadian banks goes up that means for Canadian 
consumers the cost of services will face increased pressure and 
interest charges will face increased pressure. The effects could 
be quite significant.  I am quite concerned that we in the future 
study these issues as parliamentarians and do not just 
make shortsighted decisions that may be politically expedient in 
the short term but in the long term are very deleterious to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the legislation to reduce the regulatory impediments to 
foreign banks in Canada we are supportive of this direction.  We 
believe that if we are serious about increasing and improving 
competition and services for Canadian consumers as a parallel 
initiative we need to ensure greater access to the markets by 
foreign competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe there should be greater efforts by the government to 
make it possible for more domestic competition to grow through 
changing the co-operatives act so that the credit union can 
compete with banks or through what the MacKay report suggested in 
terms of changing the ownership rules such that small banks could 
actually start up in Canada as long as they meet the safety and 
soundness regulations of OSFI.  We could actually see more small 
banks start up for instance by changing the ownership rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these things have to occur quickly.  The government has had 
since 1993 full knowledge of the global competitive forces in 
this very important sector and has sat on its hands for a 
long time not doing a whole lot.  There were two things 
that pushed the envelope.  One was the WTO financial services 
agreement that the government signed on to.  The other was 
those proposed bank merger announcements.  It kind of pushed the 
envelope and brought this debate forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately it is another example of where the government only 
deals with these complex long term issues that are on the horizon 
when they are directly in front of the government and they have 
reached a crisis proportion.  We need to develop these issues or 
these policies a lot more quickly in response to issues not as 
they evolve today but as we see them evolving tomorrow and well 
into the future and into the next millennium.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate the member for Kings—Hants for his 
excellent speech which in comparison to the New Democratic MP who 
preceded him was a full glass of thought versus an empty glass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw attention to one item in his speech. He commented that in 
the United States banks much more aggressively chase small 
business. I suggest to him that part of this is 
because in the United States there is a whole galaxy of small 
banks.  There is tremendous cutthroat competition and there are a 
great many failures in the United States banking system because 
there are so many small banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he said, we enjoy because of our five banks much greater 
security in the banking system.  The price we pay is less 
aggressiveness in terms of providing a competitive environment 
for getting the business of small business.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that we have five large banks that should be competing for 
the small business and yet we feel they are not, not effectively, 
what makes him certain, and maybe he is not certain, these new 
foreign bank branches will competitively go after small business? 
Are the competitive incentives there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his typically erudite intervention. The foreign banks have 
significant incentives in the Canadian market and there 
are opportunities.  As I mentioned earlier, Wells Fargo in a one 
year period went from 10,000 customers to 120,000 customers.  One 
of the ways Wells Fargo succeeded or is succeeding in Canada is 
by lending to small businesses and individuals with fairly wide 
margins, fairly wide spreads, for instance lending sometimes 
at prime plus four or five. A lot of small business people can go to 
a bank and the banks in Canada are reticent to that type of high 
margin lending because I think part of it is the political stigma 
of doing it.  They do not want to be seen as loan sharks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a lot of small business people if they cannot get any 
capital they will pay a premium to get capital. Wells Fargo has 
discovered a niche in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The differences between the Canadian banking system and the U.S. 
banking system have had a real impact on the growth of our 
economies. I read a study about 12 years ago that compared the 
concentration of wealth in Canada to the concentration of wealth 
in the U.S.  In the early 1900s in Canada wealth was fairly 
concentrated with a few families.  In the U.S. it was 
concentrated similarly, the Duponts, the Kelloggs, the 
Vanderbilts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then in the U.S. wealth has become very much disbursed, 
whereas in Canada it remains fairly concentrated.  This study was 
basically positing that the Canadian banking system had played a 
role in that because frankly it is awfully difficult in this 
country to get capital to grow our business without actually 
being a part of one of those families or knowing somebody who is 
or getting a guarantor.  Banks are not that entrepreneurial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there is a significant market in Canada for more 
entrepreneurial banks if these foreign banks will pursue quite 
aggressively.  I have heard from a number of constituents in 
small business who have been receiving letters from Wells Fargo. 
Probably every member of parliament has received letters from 
MBNA on credit cards. Maybe members of parliament typically do 
not receive those types of solicitations because we are 
considered a bad credit risk with no job security and that sort 
of thing.  In any case, I think foreign banks will grow 
their markets in Canada because they will pursue them 
aggressively and smartly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member mentioned a number of ways government actions can 
cripple the activities of Canadian banks. That takes me back to 
the previous speech from the NDP member who was talking about 
the Tobin tax and how it would solve the problems of the world 
because it would get those nasty speculators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the government side did vote for that Tobin tax 
last night. The only reason I can think for doing that is that 
it is a tax and Liberals like taxes.  They voted for it because 
it is a tax.  There simply was not any logical reason to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An NDP speaker earlier was talking about how these dreadful 
speculators had to be stopped.  If there is one way to cripple 
our Canadian banks it is to introduce a Tobin tax and remove from 
their possession all the major international transactions and the 
major corporate business that would be going on. It would all be 
transferred to different countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I came to Canada 20 years ago, 1979, the Canadian dollar 
was worth more than 90 cents U.S. Today it is down to about 67 
cents U.S.  I ask who caused that. Overspending, overtaxing, 
oversized government caused that. It did more damage than all the 
speculators we could name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the hon. member think of any case, any example where 
speculators did more damage than overspending, overtaxing, 
oversized government?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to explain the 
government's position on this, the Minister of Finance has been 
very busy lately.  He has had a lot of things on his plate. He 
has this leadership thing coming up and everything.  He was 
walking along one day and one of his staff asked what he was 
going to do about this Tobin tax.  I think the minister thought 
it was a Tobin attack.  He was thinking of the premier in 
Newfoundland and he said, “I support any attack on that guy 
because he is going after the same job I want” and ultimately 
this changed things very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of speculation, the southeast Asia meltdown 
occurred partially because governments were operating monetary 
policies that were inconsistent with their fiscal policies.  They 
had pegged currencies, and that could exist only for so long. The 
speculators saw a huge opportunity.  The only time there is a 
huge opportunity for speculators to make a lot of money is when 
governments operate fiscal policies inconsistent with monetary 
policies, and that is not sustainable anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effectively, if the speculators had not done what they did in 
southeast Asia, it is kind of like someone who is injured and is 
lying on the sidewalk bleeding to death.  The difference would be 
getting hit by a bus and being taken to the hospital as opposed 
to lying on the sidewalk and slowly bleeding to death.  Those 
economies ultimately were not sustainable with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way that kind of speculation occurred, sometimes can be 
considered to be very negative.  The other kind of speculation 
that occurs every day and is an operating mechanism for floating 
exchange rates is not a negative speculation. Even the Prime 
Minister who calls the speculators the guys in red suspenders 
would probably agree that it is not so bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bad thing about a Tobin tax is that it would punish the good 
speculation, but would not inhibit the bad speculation because 
the margins on the good kind of speculation that we need if we 
are going to have floating currencies, or floating exchange 
rates, are minute.  The margins are very small.  The Tobin tax 
would discourage that, but it would not stop the Soros type of 
speculation because the margins are so big. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way a Tobin tax would ever be able to work is if every 
jurisdiction in the world signed on.  Even if we had every OECD 
country sign on, and for instance a Singapore or a Cayman Islands 
opted out, we would be creating havens there or increasing the 
level of tax havens those countries would have.  With the death 
of distance as a determinant in the cost of telecommunications, 
we cannot afford to do that to our Canadian financial services 
sector because there would be an exodus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue is these new financial instruments.  For 
instance, derivatives have become so complex that they cannot be 
traced.  It is almost impossible.  One of the issues we have in 
terms of safety and soundness issues in Canada is how the heck 
can OSFI which is already overburdened deal with all these 
financial complexities in the global environment, plus the 
complexities in the instruments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at what happened in Orange county, California. I think the 
treasurer of the county was actually a hero for years because he 
had been investing in derivatives and making copious quantities 
of quid on behalf of the people of Orange county.  Ultimately, 
when the derivatives he was participating in went down, Orange 
county faced bankruptcy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very difficult and we have to be very careful to watch 
those kinds of things.  When there are failures, those are not 
failures of speculators; those are failures of regulatory 
authorities within our countries. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
wanted to ask a question of the member for Kings—Hants. 
Since the time has expired, I want to put on the record a couple 
of points which he may wish to consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to this debate, one of the important areas that has 
not been discussed as much as it probably should have been is the 
whole issue of consumer protection.  Members and Canadians should 
know that the government is working on a consumer protection 
package, particularly with regard to issues such as coercive tied 
selling and other business practices of the banks. Canadians need 
to understand better what their rights are and what the situation 
is with regard to their options within the financial services 
sector.  I wanted to make that point. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT44"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT44"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1735

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Kings—Hants also spoke, as many members did, 
about the access to capital issue for small business.  There is 
no question that this is an important area. Canadians want to 
know that the accessibility issue is going to be addressed, and 
that foreign competition is going to provide some additional 
competition and access to capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Kings—Hants gave a speech with regard to the 
small business sector, which was very much reminiscent of what 
Brian Mulroney spoke about in this place when he introduced a 
$100,000 lifetime capital gains exemption. The whole discussion 
was with regard to how we could put some incentives for Canadians 
where they could start to invest in small business and get a tax 
break by doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The flaw and the big flaw of the Conservative government of the 
day, and I recall raising it with the then leader of the Liberal 
Party, John Turner, was that there was no grandfathering of the 
provisions.  In other words, the capital gains exemption was 
applicable not just to gains that would be earned on investments 
made from today forward, but they were eligible even for holding 
gains, gains that people had made on investments and other assets 
that they had held from wherever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When capital gains taxes did come in, there was a V-day, a 
valuation day on which any gains or appreciation in the value of 
investments and assets were not going to be captured under a 
capital gains provision. There was prospective legislation so 
that capital gains tax would only be applied on gains from the 
point at which the tax was brought in to the time of disposition 
or deemed disposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members are very serious about access to capital issues, they 
also have to be very realistic about the risks that face lenders 
when they are dealing with small businesses.  When there is a 
smaller capital base, when there is less ability to take that 
financial hit, there is a risk premium associated with it.  That 
is one of the contributing factors to small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the other is that most small businesses are not having 
difficulty getting capital for capital expansion purposes where 
there would be collateral assets for the loan.  One of the 
biggest problems they are having is with regard to getting 
working capital loans.  This is where businesses need the cash 
flow to finance their receivables, their inventories and their 
general float of cash requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Capital gains taxes and the lifetime exemption have gone away 
now. They have been basically eliminated except for those who 
have made declarations that were permitted when it was phased 
out. Maybe it is time we reconsidered some sort of a tax benefit 
or a capital gains exemption for small businesses, where equity 
investments made in small business would get the kind of support 
from the taxpayers of Canada who pay for all tax expenditures, to 
the extent that we could stimulate the investment in small 
business equity financing.  Canadians would have an opportunity 
to support the biggest job generator sector in the country, that 
being small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to raise those issues because as we deal with 
legislation, whether it be opening up the foreign banking and 
amending the Bank Act et cetera, there will be many complex 
issues and collateral issues to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, Wells Fargo is in the business of electronic 
banking over the Internet.  It does not pay tax to Canada on 
profits because it is not resident here. It has no physical 
building that it is a resident in Canada and has to register that 
company. In fact, it has an arrangement with Revenue Canada 
whereby when it pays interest to the depositors of Wells Fargo 
for instance, a withholding tax on payments made to non-residents 
would have to be remitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some significant anomalies or challenges to be 
addressed in terms of the banking sector.

important issues. I think the member from Kings—Hants well knows 
that the finance committee has not finished its job.  In fact, we

continue to promote consumer protection and consumer confidence 
in the banking sector, regardless of whether it is provided 
domestically or through foreign bank facilities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton—Victoria—Brock, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I hate to let the member for Mississauga South off 
the hook that easily.  He has not given a complete speech.  I 
would like to have his comments on a couple of the items that 
were mentioned by the member for Kings—Hants and the member for 
North Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for North Vancouver has indicated how bad the 
Canadian dollar is and that his native country, New Zealand, is 
so much better because of its political system.  Actually this 
afternoon a New Zealand dollar can be bought for 65 cents 
Canadian, so that should be on the record.  The actual 
parliamentary system in New Zealand has almost collapsed because 
of MMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member for Mississauga South could comment on 
the assault right now on the Canadian public and the almost 
misleading advertising from the foreign nationals that are trying 
to come in here, the foreign banks, Bank One and so forth. They 
are assaulting Canadians with massive credit card applications. 
Almost nothing is required to get on the list.  The lists are 
sold to them by veterinary clinics and all kinds of 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My dog received an application for a MasterCard.  I am sorry to 
say my dog probably has a better credit rating than I do. I sure 
hope there is never a big sale at the dog food store. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member for Mississauga South comment on those items? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the 
question.  I do not know his dog, but I am sure the member's 
credit rating is quite healthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things we did learn of in the review of the MacKay 
task force report was the increasing control of the credit card 
business of the financial services sector by foreign banks.  Our 
big five banks have basically admitted they cannot compete in the 
credit card business. Virtually all organizations now have their 
own marquee card.  This is a very large business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our banks are dealing with the issues. They are not going to 
compete in an area in which others can compete through economies 
of scale, can provide services and are prepared to take risks 
which maybe are not very commensurate with the returns but they 
are still prepared to do it.  Who knows what happens after this. 
That is why we have to be more vigilant in moving to expand our 
financial services sector.

Bell has been purchased by the Americans.  The other day we lost 
the Canadarm from Spar to the Americans.  The member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona indicated in a question a couple of days ago 
that almost $63 billion of what used to be Canadian is now gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member not agree that if foreign banks are allowed 
into this country, with the power and the size they have, they 
would eventually not only gobble up our own financial 
institutions, but also would intrude into areas of auto leasing 
and insurance?  Would he not think that would not be a good thing 
for Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it would be an interesting 
debate, but the member fails to realize there is a non sequitur 
here.  It is not the foreign banks that are buying Canadian 
corporations; it is other corporations.  Maybe if the member has 
another opportunity at a later date, he could phrase the question 
in a way in which it could be answered.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 8 consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again 
we have an opportunity to debate an issue of considerable 
importance put forward by the member for Kamloops, Thompson and 
Highland Valleys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has put forward an interesting motion.  He is 
proposing that we influence human behaviour by the manipulation 
of the tax code.  The member is saying that if we want a person 
to do <I>a</I>, then we tax that less and the person will do 
<I>a</I>.  If we do not want the person to do <I>b</I>, then we tax 
that more and <I>b</I> will happen less often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a deep philosophical question here:  To what extent are 
governments justified in using the tax code to manipulate 
behaviour? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this particular case the argument is fairly strong that this 
may be a valid use of the tax code.  The proposal is that if 
employers want to provide a benefit for their employees they can 
do so by providing them with free transit passes in the various 
urban communities of our country.  In return for that the company 
will presumably use the benefit as a tax write-off because it is 
a part of doing business.  On the other hand, the employee would 
receive it as a non-taxable benefit.  That is the way I 
understand the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immediately when we look at this we can see that these are 
pretty laudable goals.  It forgoes a bit of government revenue, 
but one can immediately turn around and argue that it saves a lot 
of government expense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It helps us to meet our emission goals.  It helps the 
environment, presumably, by reducing the number of vehicles on 
the road.  Instead of having 100 vehicles with one person in 
each, we may have two or possibly three buses to haul the same 
number of people.  If we ignore the black smoke that comes out of 
the diesel buses, then we have made an environmental gain. 
Certainly we have made a gain with respect to the amount of road 
infrastructure required, since 100 cars require more road space 
to move the same number of people per hour than a couple of buses 
on the same road.  This looks like a good, laudable motion which 
has been put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have a few problems with it.  They are not serious 
problems, but I have a few problems with this whole idea.  I have 
a prior aversion to using the tax code to manipulate human 
behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I lived in Edmonton I took the bus to work.  I am one who 
thinks it is important to do our part environmentally.  I know 
members will appreciate this.  I could hardly wait until spring 
so I could ride my bicycle to work and did not have to use the 
bus any more.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a real pioneer in this area because I rode my bicycle to 
work, a total of some 6.8 miles, and I rode it before there were 
bike racks.  I was the only one and people looked at me as if I 
were still a child because only children rode bicycles in those 
days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I found it very convenient.  It was an excellent 
physical workout.  It was, except if a guy rode too close behind 
me, essentially pollution free.  It was very enjoyable to be out 
in the fresh air.  I always felt very good making my contribution 
to reducing the amount of pollution and the rate at which we were 
using up our non-renewable resources.  I always thought that was 
a worthy goal.  When I speak the way I am now, being in at least 
tentative favour of this motion, I am simply carrying through 
with the commitment that I have had for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how many millions of dollars we spend as taxpayers 
building roads and bridges.  In fact, between here and the 
airport in Ottawa, in the last two or three years, the road was 
constricted while they were extending it, adding another lane to 
one of the bridges.  It must have cost millions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am annoyed at that because when I look at the traffic on that 
bridge not only are there very few buses, not only are there 
many single passenger vehicles, there are thousands of vehicles 
with only a driver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an insane rule which says that only those who pay the 
money can actually go to the airport to pick up passengers.  So 
every taxi that takes a passenger to the airport is not permitted 
to pick up a passenger and bring one back.  Therefore, half of 
the cabs are going empty in one direction and, of necessity, the 
others are coming back empty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just by the stroke of a pen we could have changed this and saved 
the taxpayers an awful lot of money, and basically cut the amount 
of traffic on that road in half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have changed it so that at least the cabs would be 
permitted to take passengers both ways.  In fact I might have 
even gone so far as to say it was required.  But that is too much 
common sense for a government town, Canada's capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle the motion contains some very worthy goals.  There 
would be a reduction in the amount of taxpayers' money required 
to build roads.  It would certainly make a contribution to the 
reduction of pollution.  However, I have a bit of a problem with 
respect to the application of it.  As I said earlier, there are 
many people who either cannot use public transportation because 
of their location or, in some cases, because of the nature of 
their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, this would become a tax break to only one group of 
people, and I am a strong advocate of saying that everybody in 
this country needs a tax break.  I would like to see tax breaks 
or tax reduction on a large scale because we end up having 
approximately half of our income confiscated by the various 
levels of government in this country.  Every dollar that our 
citizens earn is cut in half.  They get to keep only half of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have mentioned before in the House that when I was a young man 
and we had a young family we decided that my wife would be a full 
time mom.  In order to make ends meet, as expenses went up, I 
took an evening job teaching night classes.  I used to teach 
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  I always said that Tuesdays I worked for 
Trudeau and Thursdays I worked for my family.  It was pretty well 
a 50:50 split on my incremental income.  We are overtaxed in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the motion was proposed to have public transportation 
provided to employees without making it a taxable benefit I liked 
that.  However, I would like to see that principle expanded and 
broadened in a very major way to apply to the millions of 
Canadians who are overtaxed in a very great way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other problem that I have is with respect to accessibility.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years now my wife and I have lived approximately 20 
miles from the nearest bus.  I know I need the exercise.  It 
would be good for me to walk to meet the bus I am sure, but it 
would take quite a big bite out of my day.  As a matter of fact, 
after we moved out into the country I had been riding my bicycle 
for many years and I was in fine condition.  I put over 4,000 
miles on my bicycle just driving it to work and back.  I decided 
to drive my bicycle to work from our new country place, but 
unfortunately it took me two hours each way and I just could not 
spare four hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we should be looking at that as well.  Perhaps we should 
look at ways in which we can encourage our citizens to walk and 
to use bicycles.  From a physics point of view, the bicycle is 
the most efficient form of transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that you are giving me the signal, Mr. Speaker, because 
I am just getting warmed up.  However, I do appreciate this 
member's motion and I think that we should probably support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives me tremendous pleasure to 
rise in the House on behalf of my most hon. colleague from 
Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys who has introduced this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say for the benefit of all those listening that when 
this member, with close to 20 years of parliamentary experience, 
brings forward a motion, we can guarantee that it is a good one 
and well thought out.  With minimum debate we should support it 
because he is such a great member.  In fact, this member is so 
highly respected in the House that I expect to see a statue of 
him when he retires so I can come by and remember him every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are discussing Motion No. 360 which would make employer 
provided transit passes an income tax exempt benefit.  This is 
probably one of those motions in the history of the House of 
Commons where it is a win win win situation for absolutely 
everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions of Canadian children every day go to school on a bus 
and return home on a bus.  However, when these kids get older, 
what do we teach them?  To drive a car.  They forget about 
transit services and the fact that they have been riding a bus 
for the last 10 or 12 years.  Now they are going to drive a car. 
It is absolutely insane that they stop using the bus once they 
finish their schooling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the year 2000, 80% of the Canadian population will live in 
urban areas with access to public transportation.  Our trade 
minister said this in Ottawa in 1997.  By increasing public 
transit use, all transit users will benefit:  lower income 
families, women, students and the elderly.  By increasing transit 
revenues and service, all taxpayers benefit from health care 
savings, infrastructure cost savings, and so on.  Very few tax 
policies impact so favourably on so many people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day in Nova Scotia the gas companies, in their 
relentless attack of greed on the people of Nova Scotia, raised 
the price of gasoline by 6 cents a litre.  It is absolutely 
abominable that these corporations can get away with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always say that the best way to get back at these corporations 
is to use the transit services.  More people would love to ride the 
buses, but unfortunately in many areas, as my hon. colleague from 
the Reform Party has pointed out, there is no access to transit 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many employers would love to give this benefit to their 
employees.  One of the reasons they would love to do that is that 
it makes a happier employee.  They do not have to worry about 
getting into their car in the morning.  They do not have to worry 
about finding a parking space.  The employees would save a 
tremendous amount of wear and tear on their vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also, as a community of communities, 
save a tremendous amount and actually get to fulfill a promise 
now and then.  This government could actually fulfill a promise, 
many of which it has broken.  It could meet its commitments to 
the Kyoto agreement.  It would be an absolutely wonderful thing 
for our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When building new infrastructure in cities we would not have to 
build massive parking lots, which are always ugly.  I do not 
think I have ever seen an attractive parking lot. 
I have been through a good part of this country and I have not 
seen one yet.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been getting a lot of occurrences of road rage. 
In areas like Vancouver, for example, every hour is 
rush hour.  As my colleague from the Reform Party said, from here 
to the airport, 95% of the vehicles have just one driver.  They 
then put in an exit sign to Red Hill Road or whatever it is and 
there are huge lineups.  I have even missed a plane because of 
it.  It is insane.  There should be rapid massive transit in this 
country, especially in areas like this, but of a more frequent 
nature.  That would benefit all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also be a drastic decrease in our dependence on fossil 
fuels.  We would not have to destroy the planet.  Maybe we could 
actually leave something for our great-grandchildren.  They would 
know that we did not have to burn every fossil fuel just so we 
could make it easy for ourselves to get from point A to point B. 
It would also bring a lot more safety to our streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, in Halifax, for example, there is an increase in 
incidents of people being hit at crosswalks.  I noticed it here 
when walking from the hotel to Parliament Hill.  A lot of people 
just narrowly miss getting hit because people in their vehicles 
are in a rush to get somewhere.  I watch people get off the buses 
and they are happy and generally more easygoing because life has 
been good.  They sat down and read a book or spoke to their 
colleagues in the morning.  They are much happier employees. I 
believe most employers would honour this type of motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should put in a plug now for all the transit workers in this 
country who wholeheartedly agree with the member for Kamloops, 
Thompson and Highland Valleys that this is an excellent motion. 
It would create employment in the transit field.  It would create 
employment for their long term security.  It would also help out 
our elderly, those who are disadvantaged and many of our students 
who cannot afford to get from one area to another, who could then 
spend the money they have on more important things like their 
books or tuition.  Maybe they could even go and have a glass of 
beer now and then.  Who knows what students do these days?  We 
would have to ask the pages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this motion is passed this House will have 
shown a terrific responsibility toward the future of this 
country and toward all citizens by showing leadership, the 
leadership that the member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland 
Valleys has just displayed by bringing forward this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to hear that our colleagues in the Reform Party 
will be supporting it.  I understand that our colleagues from 
across the House may be supporting this motion as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It is an individual decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Exactly.  It is an individual 
decision.  We know that the hon. member has an awful lot of 
influence with the leader and many other members of his party 
even though he sits on the backbench like me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to concur with the member.  This an honourable and very 
good motion.  It would do an awful lot of good for this country. 
It is one that should get the unanimous consent of everybody in 
this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to begin by congratulating the member for Kamloops, 
Thompson and Highland Valleys on his November 4, 1998 motion. 
It as important than it is topical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, greenhouse gases represent one of the greatest 
challenges facing the planet for the next 100 years.  They cause 
adverse climatic changes affecting all nations, not just Canada, 
but every country in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we have quite a challenge ahead of us.  We undertook 
in Kyoto to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 6%.  We were 
already over 13% behind target. 
We will therefore have to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 
20% over the coming years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transportation generally accounts for one quarter of all 
greenhouse gases.  If we can concentrate on the issue of 
transportation and public transit, together we will make a huge 
contribution to the debate on climatic changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, public transit has become a key issue.  In all our 
urban centres—whether larger centres where the problem is even 
more serious, or smaller ones—all our roads today are completely 
clogged with traffic during rush hour.

</I></B></P><P align=left>North Americans have a real love affair with automobiles.  But, 
more and more, urban stress, the stress of taking one hour and 
sometimes two to get to work in the morning, is beginning to get 
people thinking about the whole issue of public transit. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to provide them with a means to be able to shift from 
the personal automobile to massive public transport, because, as 
I mentioned, the issue of public transport is closely tied to 
climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the climate change secretariat, the government has set up 
16 issue tables that are looking at all the various questions, 
including transportation and fiscal and economic incentives.  The 
various stakeholders, the federal government, the provincial 
governments, the municipal governments and Canadians at large, 
have joined these issue tables. Therefore my colleague's motion 
is timely and topical.  The issue tables are going to report in 
the fall. It is important that we consider the question of mass 
transit, of providing tax benefits for transit passes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to know that in 1993 a study by the U.S. 
General Accounting Office showed the drawbacks and benefits of a 
tax transit program.  In the drawbacks, is the whole 
question of cost, of whether we should give tax exemptions for 
this particular program or another particular program.  It 
seems from the study that the benefits far outweigh the downside. 
Out of 150 U.S. federal agencies, 75% now have a transit benefit 
program. Among those agencies, which represent thousands of 
employees, the people who are using mass transit are encouraged 
to continue to do so.  In that crucial 25% of agencies, where the 
employees use personal automobiles to get back and forth to work 
from large urban centres, the transit benefit pass system showed 
that nearly a quarter of them shifted from using personal 
automobiles to mass transit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study showed that if the program shifted from half of the 
federal agencies to all federal agencies, if it shifted into the 
private system and if tax benefits were given to corporations to 
encourage workers to take mass transit, we could wean at least 
50% of the total personal automobile population from private 
transit to public transit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a tremendous goal, for all kinds of reasons:  the 
declogging of our roads, the reduction of pollution in our cities 
and in all our centres of population, and the social benefits, 
especially the health benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is timely.  It is important.  It has to be carried 
out.  It is an incentive for the government, as the issue tables 
are now in place and are discussing these various subjects, to 
pick up the motion, which I hope will be supported the great 
majority of members of parliament, and to give more momentum to 
the benefits of transit passes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that all of these various issues that touch on the 
environmental question are not just environmental issues.  They 
are also cost cutting issues.  As I mentioned, they touch on 
health side and the social side of our lives and on the economic 
benefits as well.  As a country, one thing we never do is to add 
up the massive cost of keeping our roads in shape, especially 
given our climate, and of keeping our individuals in single 
driver cars day in, day out. There are massive costs to the 
country as a result of pollution and of road repairs, as well as 
social costs.  These costs are never accounted for in our 
taxation system.  We should put back some of that money into a 
productive and constructive system of transit passes.

quality of life issue.  It is fitting and propitious that it is 
before us today.  We should consider with great seriousness the 
motion before us, both the pluses and the minuses.  I think we 
are going to find that the pluses are going to greatly outweigh 
the minuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I congratulate my colleague from Kamloops, Thompson and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am happy to rise today to speak on this private member's motion 
presented by my colleague from the NDP, for whom I have great 
respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will support this motion because this is a win win win 
situation.  The only gamble the federal government takes is a 
potential loss of revenue which to my knowledge would be 
small.  It is the responsibility of other levels of government 
and individual transit properties to market their services 
according to this new policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue losses can occur only if transit properties are 
successful at encouraging businesses to participate. The impact 
of success on ordinary Canadians, economically, environmentally, 
and on our health, will be tremendous.  Also, it is a real window 
of opportunity, because the balanced budget has increased the 
finance department's ability to examine and invest in new 
strategies that promote sustainable transportation practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a rare opportunity for the federal government to effect 
public policy at a local level.  This tax exemption is one of the 
few financial instruments available to support transportation 
demands and management efforts and is one of the easiest to 
implement. This measure is supported by social, environmental, 
business, labour, health, transit, political and municipal 
organizations across Canada, representing a wide variety of 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forest fires, floods, ice storms, cyclones, extreme 
temperatures, smog days, high UV reading days and children with 
asthma have opened Canadians' eyes to the dangers of climate 
change and greenhouse gas emissions.  The tax exemption would be 
an immediate concrete action, proving that the federal government 
is serious about working toward a sustainable future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a reality.  The federal government is unable to meet its 
international obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
Provincial governments are struggling with the high cost of 
health care due to pollution related illnesses.  Municipal 
governments do not have the resources to maintain and expand 
transportation infrastructure.  Canadians can no longer afford to 
support an indefinite increase in single occupancy vehicles and 
yet they have little incentive to use public transit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transportation is the largest single sector source of Canadian 
carbon emissions, 32%.  It accounts for 30% of energy used and 
65% of petroleum consumed.  In cities where public transit is 
available, 50% of transportation related emissions occur due to 
cars and light trucks.  Only 10% of Canada's 9.1 million 
commuters use public transit.  This was reported by Statistics 
Canada in 1994.  Today the number might be a little higher, but I 
do not think it is really that much higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Support for this initiative continues to grow steadily. 
Encouraging the use of public transit is no longer viewed solely 
as a transit issue.  It is a health issue, a social issue, a 
pollution issue, an environmental issue and an economic issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a national level this proposal is a solid foot forward in the 
battle to meet our Kyoto obligations.  It is a proposal that 
makes sense.  It is cost efficient and has been proven to be an 
effective incentive in other countries, most notably the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New riders are defined as those changing their primary commuting 
behaviour, but current riders were also found to increase their 
transit use by 25% to 30% after receiving transit benefits.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that single occupancy vehicle use is reduced 
when an employer provided tax exempt transit benefits.  The same 
GAO report quoted by finance discusses the limitations of the 
report in following paragraphs.  Employees surveyed were 
receiving an average of $21 per month in transit benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be noted that because employers are not currently 
supplying transit passes except in some rare instances there is 
no existing revenue to be lost.  The revenue can only be lost if 
the transit pass is substituted for taxable wages.  All other 
revenue is not lost but forgone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a huge difference when we look at the cost of other 
initiatives that may require immediate funding from existing 
budgets.  This revenue that is forgone does not happen 
immediately but will be spread over many years as transit 
properties begin marketing these incentives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxation is already effectively used to discourage some 
behaviour while encouraging others.  We have taxes increased on 
alcohol and cigarette use, tax credits to all companies for land 
replenishing costs, tax reduction for charitable and political 
donations.  This tax exemption is a proven incentive in the U.S. 
to use public transit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ground level ozone, the smog, has increased by 20% 
and that was from a report on advancing the dialogue on 
sustainable transportation in Canada, 1996.  Four hundred Toronto 
residents die prematurely each year due to poor air quality. 
Ozone is a pulmonary irritant that results in inflammation of the 
lungs, decreased lung function and decreased resistance to 
infection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transportation related air pollution is particularly harmful to 
people at risk, young people, the elderly, those with asthma or 
chronic lung and heart disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By 2010 the number of cars on the planet will double and the 
number of vehicle miles travelled will triple.  Again this is 
from a report on moving the economy from a conference held in 
Toronto in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the greatest economic and environmental challenges now 
facing the world is control of carbon dioxide, CO2, and other 
greenhouse gasses that threaten to destabilize climate and lead 
to global warming.  Rising sea levels, regional aridity, drought 
and extreme weather events cause human displacement, severe 
regional food shortages and losses that exceed the financing 
capabilities of the insurance industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government response to date will not meet our international 
obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the Kyoto 
protocol.  That is why I am urging members from both sides of the 
House to support this motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am always pleased to speak to private members' initiatives.  I am 
a very big fan of private members' bills and motions because they 
provide the ordinary member of parliament, most of us, an 
opportunity to raise issues which we feel will promote and 
stimulate dialogue and discussion on issues which we otherwise 
might not deal with in terms of government business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gets people thinking.  It gives them an opportunity to 
demonstrate the thinking behind and the philosophy behind some of 
the things we are doing.  It is very easy in this place to argue 
why we should not do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the strength of Private Members' Business is it gives 
people an opportunity to argue why we should do something and why 
we should find ways.  Do not tell me why we cannot, tell me how 
we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to speak to this motion because we could certainly 
argue it on an environmental basis.  However, if we wanted to 
speak against this motion, we could clearly deal with it totally 
on a tax basis and come to a different position in the context of 
only taxation or in the context of only the environment, or in 
terms of any other impacts this may have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question this proposal has some merit and should be 
considered by the House.  Motions are not binding on the 
government.  They are simply to consider the advisability of an 
idea, in this case that the government should consider making 
employer provided transit passes an income tax exempt benefit. 
It is quite straightforward.  As has been clearly laid out by 
other speakers, the proposal contained in the motion is not 
simply a taxation matter.  It is also very much an environmental 
matter related to climate change, an issue which is extremely 
important to the House and which will be a major item as we enter 
the new millennium because of our commitments under the Kyoto 
agreement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to deal with this motion on behalf of the member from 
Kamloops in the affirmative. I want to speak in favour of this 
motion. The Government of Canada has announced the establishment 
of a climate change secretariat.  We have done a number of things 
which I think will advance the issues.  I know the government is 
working on a comprehensive approach to the environmental aspects 
of the matter before us.  It is part of the solution.  It is not 
part of the problem.  It is an interesting perspective to raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question as we adopt strategies and move toward 
implementation the important strategies will be those that are in 
a co-ordinated fashion so that there is an efficiency and an 
effectiveness in terms of making changes in policy.  It would be 
very easy to say this is premature, that it pre-empts somehow the 
process in place on the environmental side. Any time is a good 
time to talk about ideas.  That is exactly what this motion has 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware of a couple of arguments that could be opposed. The 
one about being premature is a valid argument.  In the context of 
advancing the dialogue, advancing the knowledge and kind of 
raising this issue, maybe even getting it to committee where we 
can have experts to further evolve the thinking and the knowledge 
on the issue that has been raised, in all its broad context I 
think it is a good thing.  It is a good thing for the House.  It 
is a good thing for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an argument that one could make that the proposed 
measure would be unfair to individuals who are not supplied with 
employer paid passes.  That is quite true.  I was mentioning to a 
colleague that this is an issue which tends not to be as 
inclusive as we would want simply because there are not public 
transit systems in all parts of Canada which would even allow 
businesses to take advantage of some sort of tax exempt status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does raise the interesting point about philosophy of 
providing benefits or supporting consensus initiatives or 
objectives of government.  Do we have to treat everybody the 
same?  Does everybody have to be treated exactly the same? Or, is 
it that we are trying to promote equity or equality of benefits? 
If you had two children you might give one a book because they 
are a good reader.  You might give the other a chemistry set 
because they want to get involved.  You treated them equally 
because they both got something that maybe brought out the best 
of their talent but you did not treat them the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think in this context we have an item which admittedly may 
have more of an urban thrust to it.  Yet it has some linkages 
which make it important for us not to dismiss it simply because 
it is not universally accessible and relevant to all Canadians. 
I think it is one of those arguments we could go either way on.  I 
think we as parliamentarians always want to be as open as 
possible with regard to broader implications and maybe the 
philosophy of approach to dealing with issues that Canadians feel 
are important as we enter the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another argument brought to my attention was that the bulk of 
the assistance of non-taxation of employer paid transit passes 
would accrue to individuals who already are using the transit 
system and therefore it would not be an efficient way to increase 
the ridership of our transit systems in our major centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that is the case.  I think it would be somewhat 
difficult to determine how many employers would start providing 
tax exempt passes, if this were to come to pass, and whether it 
would have the impact on people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe people have made up their minds.  Maybe there is a price 
elasticity here when using one's car. There are really not very 
many options. I think we have cases right across the spectrum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real point is there is a broad range of issues that would 
have to be balanced.  A motion like this helps to probably 
identify the circle of issues to be considered not only on this 
motion but generally the thinking we have on a lot of matters 
that come before the House.  There are conflicting interests or 
there are competing interests with regard to almost everything 
that comes before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The laws of Canada are by their very nature discriminatory. 
They have to be discriminatory.  If there were no discrimination 
in the law then there would be no need for the law because 
everybody would be treated the same, and we do not have laws and 
policies which try to treat everybody the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have certain benefits, for instance employer paid health care 
benefits, which are not taxable benefits in the hands of 
employees.  Dentists et cetera have brought this to us. There are 
so many people who are directly or indirectly covered by employer 
paid plans that to make that taxable may have an adverse 
consequence in terms of the number of people making use of health 
care services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is discriminatory because those people in Canada who do not 
have employer paid health plans are left to their own devices, 
either to buy insurance themselves or to pay as they go for the 
services they require. They are all subject to a deductible and 
only get a modest break on our tax return system for medical and 
dental and vision care expenses that would be incurred directly 
on their behalf.  There is a discrimination there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I had suggested is that for those who do not 
have group life plans which cover the broad range of health 
services, maybe there should be a super or an extra tax benefit 
or deduction, those kind of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the tax exempt status of bus passes, yesterday on 
the news I saw that Northern Telecom and I believe the transit 
system in Ottawa have kicked off a one month pilot on this very 
thing where the employer is providing those passes.  The Ottawa 
transit system announced that it needs to increase its ridership 
by some 70% over the next few years to maintain the 
efficiency and service levels it presently enjoys simply because 
of the changing of this region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be at least a dozen different angles or issues on 
this. I believe it provides an ample opportunity for members from 
all sides of the argument to be engaged in debate, which is one 
of the most important reasons we have private members' bills 
and motions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity at least for a few minutes to 
comment on Motion No. 360 by my colleague from Kamloops, Thompson 
and Highland Valleys. I will just make a couple of key points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly support his motion and whatever we can do to 
encourage a public transit system, get people off of the roads. 
Certainly as someone not in a huge urban area, I have no problem 
acknowledging that if larger urban centres can put something in 
place to have fewer vehicles on the roads, decrease emissions 
within their areas, we can have some kind of benefits such as a 
tax exempt bus pass benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Mississauga South indicated, there is not 
equality throughout the system.  Northerners have a northern 
remoteness allowance and we get a tax exempt status for 
remoteness in some areas.  It acknowledges that Canadians 
recognize there is diversity and we need to reflect that in the 
actions we take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventy-three per cent of Canadians are in favour of this type 
of legislation. 
I think the comment that it is already taking place in a pilot 
project in Ottawa is an indication that there is certainly 
support for this type of a program within Canada. Canada needs to 
work very hard in meeting its Kyoto commitments. This is 
certainly one way of doing that.  The number of large urban 
centres that would put this type of a practice in place could 
certainly go a long way to helping Canada reduce its emissions 
and meet those Kyoto commitments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last Friday I asked the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food a question and he responded by declaring that my 
comments were absolutely false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent my constituents in this House.  My constituents call 
me with their problems and I raise their concerns in the House. 
When the minister accuses me of making false statements, he is 
calling my constituents liars.  The minister should pay more 
attention to what farmers are saying about his programs than what 
his bureaucrats are telling him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Friday I asked the minister “The disaster application 
forms are 40 pages long and accountants are charging farmers 
between $500 and $1,000 to fill them out.  Why is the minister 
giving western grain producers more bills to pay instead of the 
disaster assistance they desperately need?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents are telling me that the AIDA application forms 
are not even available in printed form yet. I checked the 
Internet, found the application forms and counted the pages for 
myself. There are 50 pages, not 40. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I checked with a few accountants in Saskatchewan and asked them 
how much it was going to cost farmers to have the accountants 
fill out these AIDA applications. One accounting firm in Regina 
that does thousands of returns for farmers said the charges for 
filling out an AIDA application would be about the same as 
filling out an application for the Alberta farm disaster program. 
That is $500 to $1,000. Is the minister saying that his AIDA 
application is simpler than Alberta's? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said “It is so simple.  Just transfer information 
from one form to another”.  The minister's statement is an 
absolute falsehood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what accountants who do thousands of returns for western 
grain farmers are saying.  The information a farmer needs is more 
than just his tax return and his NISA forms.  Accounting firms 
told me that grain tickets or permit books are needed as well as 
their crop insurance records and documentation to prove their 
level of inventory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Producers who are not a part of NISA will have another eight 
pages of forms to fill out.  Accountants say producers cannot use 
the cash basis but need to determine what their inventories were 
on January 1, 1998 and then again on December 31, 1998. 
Accountants say getting the accurate records to comply with the 
accrual method on the AIDA forms is going to be quite a struggle. 
The form asks not only how much wheat a producer has, but what 
grade and protein content it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even when the AIDA forms are filled out, there is no way of 
knowing if that is how much compensation the farmer will receive. 
These forms are directly tied to NISA.  The farmers' NISA numbers 
might not reflect the same numbers that the bureaucrats have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the timeframe given to complete these AIDA applications in 
Saskatchewan is June 15. That is too short.  Accountants say it 
will be a struggle to get all of their producers' forms filled 
out by that deadline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are getting into seeding season and it is going to be 
extremely tough to get farmers off the tractor and into the 
accountant's office.  In Ontario and Alberta, farmers have until 
July 31 to fill out their applications.  Why is the federal 
government putting such a strict deadline on the forms coming 
from Saskatchewan and Manitoba?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One accountant said that these forms are extremely complicated 
and that it looks like a make work project for the bureaucrats in 
Ottawa.  The whole package could have been much simpler. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are telling me that when they see the forms, they get 
extremely frustrated.  Many wonder if it is worth taking the time 
to fill out the AIDA application. They feel they will not be 
entitled to anything anyway because of the way the program is 
structured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The AIDA program does not take into account any bills or 
outstanding lines of credit that a farmer may have.  As a result, 
the AIDA form is not an accurate representation of a farmer's 
financial situation.  This final point is very key. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final question is why did the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food create a make work project for bureaucrats and 
accountants instead of a simple cost effective system that the 
farmers were asking for. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all 
we should straighten out just how many pages we are talking 
about.  The hon. member for Yorkton—Melville has stated 40 to 50 
pages.  In actual fact the number of pages for the AIDA form, if 
the farmer is enrolled in NISA, is seven pages.  The rest are 
instructions.  There are an additional five pages if the farmer 
is non-NISA, with the rest being instructions.  The number of 
pages may be relevant in one way but very irrelevant in another. 
The actual form is from five to seven pages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic information needed is revenue and expense data filed 
for income tax purposes for the current year and the preceding 
three years.  Everyone with a farm business has this information 
already on hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year the tax forms also serve as the NISA application. The 
forms now fill three functions.  They can do their income tax, 
their NISA and their AIDA.  There is a limited amount of 
supplementary information required for AIDA.  The added 
information relates primarily to the changes in inventories, 
accounts payable and accounts receivable and is essential to 
ensuring that the applicant receives the appropriate payment. Let 
me provide two examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let us consider a farm which had a major production loss 
in 1998.  The cash receipts will not be down that much because 
the farmer will be selling the inventory on hand, emptying the 
barns or the bins.  Inventory decline must be reflected in AIDA 
or the payment will not reflect the true loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, those in difficulty will leave bills unpaid.  This must 
be reflected to determine the true loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, if a producer has an accountant for income tax and 
NISA, it should not cost too much more to transfer that data to 
the AIDA application form.  The cost of hiring an accountant need 
not be overly excessive.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
various Liberal members like to claim that they are friends of 
the farmers.  This is interesting because in each of the last two 
budgets the finance minister never allowed the word farmer to 
pass his lips during his speeches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food should tell his 
Liberal colleagues that many Canadian farmers are facing a 
full-blown income crisis which is getting worse day by day. 
Predications are that realized net farm income for Canadian 
farmers will drop as much as 40% in the year just ended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grain prices last year were at the worst level since the Great 
Depression and hog prices were not much better.  We saw some 
farmers giving their hogs away to food banks because they were 
being paid next to nothing for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food promised a 
contribution of $900 million from Ottawa to be supplemented by 
$600 million from the provinces.  Now there is a clear indication 
that the bureaucrats are fiddling around with the program design 
to ensure that Ottawa will pay less than it promised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister says that the program will not cover losses or 
negative margins.  It means if farmers actually lost money as 
they did in northwestern Saskatchewan because of the drought, 
those losses are not covered.  These farmers say that this 
program will do nothing for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is also going to deduct from his payments to 
farmers any contributions the government has made to the net 
income stabilization account, NISA.  By setting up this program 
the minister will pay about $600 million or even less, not the 
$900 million he promised as recently as December.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should mention that the forms the government is sending out to 
farmers, as another hon. member has stated, are long and 
complicated. A lot of farmers are throwing their hands up in the 
air and saying to heck with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem is that the provinces are being forced to pay 
40% of this program.  That is not fair.  North Dakota or 
Minnesota are not paying disaster relief to American farmers; it 
is Washington.  And it should be Ottawa, not small provinces like 
Saskatchewan, that foots the bill to help our farmers through 
trade wars.  Our small provinces cannot afford to take on the 
treasuries of the United States or Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until the late 1980s Ottawa took major responsibility for safety 
net and disaster programs.  This Liberal government has walked 
away from its responsibility.  The Liberals have slashed spending 
on agriculture by 60% since 1993.  The money they plan to spend 
on the disaster relief program is just a brief two year blip.  By 
the year 2000 the Liberals will again be spending less than they 
did last year.  In turn, it is much less than what they had spent 
in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, our farmers have been impacted by the falling 
commodity prices, as everybody is well aware, but their increased 
input costs have compounded the financial squeeze that is driving 
our families away from their farms.  This government should 
immediately investigate the input costs in agriculture, the 
unrealistic fuel costs, the whole issue of concentrated control 
of our food supply, as referenced by the <I>Western Producer</I> 
recently, and claim it as food clusters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers have played a key role in the deficit reduction of this 
country and the restoration of the balanced budget this 
government is so proud of.  It is time for Ottawa to put back 
money into agriculture.  We in the NDP believe that Canadian 
farmers need stable incomes. Our federal caucus intends to keep 
the pressure on the agriculture minister so that a solid 
sustainable farm income disaster plan will be there not just for 
one or two years, but for the long haul.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I must say 
this question goes back to November 26, 1998.  A lot of things 
have happened since the member asked the minister the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have addressed the length of the application, which 
has been fairly well exaggerated.  The amount of money is $900 
million plus $600 million, $1.5 million federal-provincial, 60:40 
cost shared because the jurisdiction is a shared jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food and his provincial 
colleagues announced after their meeting on February 23 and 24, 
Canadian farmers now avail themselves of comprehensive income 
disaster protection.  Whatever commodity they produce in whatever 
province, agriculture producers will be eligible to receive 
government assistance if their gross margin falls below 70% of 
their three year average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spirit of federal-provincial co-operation and our sense of 
urgency, given the gravity of farm income difficulties, meant 
that the new agricultural income disaster assistance program was 
developed very quickly and expeditiously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of March 5, application forms were available in electronic 
format and in hard copy a week or so later.  This is quite an 
achievement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national program will not be delivered in isolation of its 
existing instruments.  AIDA is built on the substantial 
protection already offered by other safety nets, including NISA 
and crop insurance. The design and administration of AIDA 
includes several built-in incentives to take full advantage of 
the existing safety nets. This encourages farmers to get actively 
involved in the management of their own risks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, the disaster program will be delivered in full 
respect of existing provincial initiatives.  Where a provincial 
program decreases the cost of AIDA by enhancing producers' 
incomes, this will be taken into account.  It was agreed that 
producers should not be compensated twice for the same income 
shortfall.  Ways were found to accommodate and build on other 
initiatives with the same purpose as the national disaster 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I am very satisfied with the progress that was made 
in such a short time.  Farmers impressed upon us the urgency of 
the situation and the government has taken action.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on March 4, I asked the Minister of Finance a question 
about shipbuilding.  The Minister of Industry replied to my 
question. He did not answer satisfactorily in my opinion.  On 
several occasions, I had questioned him in committee.

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 28, 1997, he replied that it would be better to ask 
the Minister of Finance, who would perhaps be in a better 
position to answer my question about shipbuilding and tax 
credits. Similarly, on April 22, 1998, the Minister of Industry 
told me that many issues were not the responsibility of his 
department, but rather that of the Secretary of State for 
International Financial Institutions or the Minister for 
International Trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 4, I directed my question to the Minister of Finance, 
but the Minister of Industry replied. 
What can we do?  I note that, today, the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Agriculture is likely to be responding, 
because he is the only member I can see at the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to give up and be content with the government's game of 
ping-pong and incomplete responses?  We can see easily that the 
Minister of Industry relies on the Minister of Finance.  The 
latter does not want to intervene, because he already has 
interests in Canada Steamship Lines.  The Minister of Transport 
says he no longer controls the St. Lawrence Seaway following 
privatization.  As for the Minister for International Trade, he 
has often been unable to answer our questions on the 
interventions of the Export Development Corporation.  When he 
finally did answer, it was some two years later, on the <I>Spirit 
of Columbus</I>. 
In this context, I would like to know who I should speak to 
in order to get a response, if not action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has not yet managed to explain why it is 
refusing to harmonize federal tax measures with those of Quebec. 
It has yet to explain why, by taxing the tax advantages of the 
shipbuilding industry, it is obliged to cancel the beneficial 
effect of the tax deductions offered by Quebec in order to 
stimulate this industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not explained why it does not deign to 
propose measures of greater benefit to shipbuilding.  It has yet 
to say why it is refusing to establish a real policy on 
shipbuilding, as all the representatives of the shipping 
industry have been asking it to do for months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I plan to continue my campaign in favour of a real shipbuilding 
policy, which I began a few months ago. 
I am very pleased to see that more and more business people, 
union leaders and politicians are taking up the cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly pleased at how this issue has brought people 
together.  Two examples are the coalition of opposition parties 
I formed on December 8 in Ottawa and the coalition of unions the 
Davie Industries union managed to get, two groups of 
stakeholders that are beginning to ask the government serious 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to urge people to send in the postcard 
calling for a genuine shipbuilding policy in Canada. 
Since no postage is required on letters to MPs, I particularly 
urge the residents of Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière and other 
citizens throughout Canada, in the maritimes and British 
Columbia, as well as in Quebec, along with the unions, to send 
it in.  We must show that Canadians are not happy with the 
national shipbuilding policy the Minister of Industry says he 
has and that he says he knows nothing about.  He is forever 
passing the buck to other ministers, and we never get an answer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
that the hon. member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière has 
given me the opportunity to speak to the subject of shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government acknowledges the important contribution 
the marine industry makes to our national economy.  As well, I 
must reiterate that the government currently maintains a generous 
package of measures which, in conjunction with provincial 
policies and sound industrial practices, benefit shipbuilders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures are:  a 33.5% accelerated capital tax allowance 
for Canadian built ships; a 25% duty on most non-NAFTA ship 
imports; domestic procurement on a competitive basis for all 
government shipbuilding and ship repair needs; Export Development 
Corporation financing for commercially viable transactions; and a 
very favourable research and development tax credit system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We acknowledge that despite this support the industry continues 
to face considerable challenges in international markets.  For 
instance, in December 1997, in an OECD workshop on shipbuilding 
policies, it was reported that a substantial overcapacity exists 
in the shipbuilding industry and that this overcapacity would 
grow to around 40% of the estimated world capacity by 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian shipbuilding sector went through a voluntary 
rationalization process that culminated in a more streamlined and 
viable industry. 
The government participated in this industry led process by 
contributing nearly $200 million between 1986 and 1993.  Through 
reorganizing and streamlining its operations over the past 
decade, the Canadian industry has been able to improve its 
productivity levels even with the forecast world overcapacity and 
has been successful in obtaining some international sales in 
specific markets, such as tugboats.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, substantial support has been provided to the 
shipbuilding industry in the past and we continue to support it 
through a variety of initiatives.  If the provinces wish to 
supplement our initiatives, as has been done by Quebec and Nova 
Scotia, they are free to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comments concerning the Minister of Finance made by the 
opposition and by the president of Davie Industries workers' 
union are completely false.  As is the case for all cabinet 
ministers, all such assets are placed in trust under the control 
of a trustee.  It is the trustee who has the final say. 
Consequently, there is no conflict of interest.
