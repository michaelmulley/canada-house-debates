<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to seek leave to introduce a 
private members' bill entitled an act to prevent the interruption 
by labour disputes of the orderly progress of grain from the farm 
gate to export and to amend the Canada Labour Code and the 
Public Service Staff Relations Act in consequence thereof.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to prevent work stoppages affecting 
the transportation of grain from the producer to the point of 
export by establishing a system of arbitration of disputes by 
final offer selection, a  mechanism that is very consistent with 
the collective bargaining process.
<P>
	I am very pleased that several of my colleagues have formally 
indicated to me their support of this bill. They are the members 
for Lisgar-Marquette, Vegreville, Okanagan-Shuswap,

	When I first raised this matter two weeks ago it had been 
found that 1.3 million salmon had mysteriously gone missing. 
No one could account for them. We were concerned at that point 
and asked for an emergency debate. Now 1.9 million more have 
gone missing.
<P>
	I know that the minister said there would be an investigation 
and he will report some time next year. Not only do members 
from the west coast want to debate this in the House but 
members from all sides do, knowing full well what happened on 
the east coast when the government was reluctant to take action 
and to provide strong leadership.
<P>
	It is a disaster. It is a crisis situation.
<P>

<P>
	The public confidence in terms of the ability to manage those 
resources has, for all intents and purposes, evaporated 
completely in British Columbia. For that reason, Mr. Speaker, I 
ask you to consider calling for an emergency debate on this issue 
later today.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This indeed is an important issue. The hon. 
member has seen fit to bring it before the House on two previous 
occasions. However, I would rule that his request does not meet 
all of the conditions for emergency debate at this time.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADAGRAINACT">CANADA GRAIN ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food)</B> moved that Bill C-51, an act to amend the Canada 
Grain Act and respecting certain regulations made pursuant to 
that act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased to introduce for second 
reading today this legislation to amend the Canada Grain Act. 
These amendments will contribute substantially to the 
competitiveness of our grain industry and the well-being of the 
many communities, families and individual Canadians who earn 
their livelihoods in this very important sector of the Canadian 
economy.
<P>
	As members of this House will be aware, the Canada Grain 
Act is administered by the Canadian Grain Commission. Under 
the act the commission is responsible for regulating the 
handling of grain in Canada and for establishing and 
maintaining standards of grain quality. The commission plays 
an essential role in maintaining the international reputation 
which Canada enjoys for high quality grain products.
<P>
	I therefore wish to take a moment as we begin this debate to 
acknowledge the hard creative work performed by commission 
employees from Prince Rupert, British Columbia to Baie 
Comeau. I would also like to thank commission staff for its 
contributions to the preparation of the amendments that I am 
bringing before the House today. In expressing these sentiments 
I am sure I am  speaking for all members who appreciate and 
understand the challenges which we as legislators place before 
the men and women who work in Canada's public service.
<P>
	I would be remiss if I did not also acknowledge the weighty 
contribution to this bill that has been made by Canada's grain 
industry. These amendments are the product of lengthy, detailed 
consultations throughout the Canadian grain industry with 
producers, grain industry executives and farm organizations 
which represent the full spectrum of that important industry.
<P>
	I want to outline the consultation process so members of this 
House can share the confidence that I have that the legislation 
we have before us today does represent the needs, the 
expectations and the views of the overwhelming majority of 
stakeholders from all sectors of our grain industry.
<P>
	In February, 1991 the Canadian Grain Commission initiated a 
review of licensing and security issues arising under the act. The 
commission circulated a discussion paper and held face to face 
consultations with the representatives of 45 organizations. 
These organizations represented grain producers, elevator 
companies, grain dealers and so on.
<P>
	Then in August, 1991 the commission circulated a policy 
proposal which was the subject of wide discussion throughout 
the grain industry. The grain commission met with the 
representatives of 57 organizations. This second round of 
consultations produced much useful feedback and resulted in a 
revised proposal being circulated in November of 1991. Each 
group that had participated in those earlier consultations 
received a copy and was asked for additional written comments 
and recommendations.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Based on the responses to this round of consultations the grain 
commission produced a revised proposal and circulated it again 
in February 1992. Additional suggestions were made in 
discussions with stakeholders that occurred during the 1992 
federal regulatory review process.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6478"> 6478 </A></B>
<P>
	The legislative amendments that I bring before the House 
today are rooted in this consultation process and form an 
essential part of government's general commitment to 
strengthening Canada's competitive position in world markets.
<P>
	For purposes of our discussion today I would group the 
amendments that we have before us in three broad categories. 
The first deals with enhanced competitiveness. The second deals 
with more protection for grain producers. The third is focused 
on new safeguards for Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	I would like to deal with the issue of enhanced 
competitiveness. The grains industry in this country is changing 
and the pace of change is accelerating. To remain competitive in 
global markets, markets in which Canada sells most of its grain, 
we need a regulatory and legislative framework which protects 
the shared interests of all of the stakeholders.
<P>
	At the same time it must assist individuals and groups within 
the industry to compete successfully, adding value where 
possible to their efforts. Our proposed amendments to the 
Canada Grain Act are designed with these concerns in mind.
<P>
	The Canada Grain Act will be amended to strengthen the role 
that quality plays in Canada's grains industry. This will help 
reinforce the many things we do in Canada which ensure that 
only the best grain varieties are developed, marketed and 
transported through our bulk handling system. This amendment 
affirms that as Canada's grain sector evolves quality will 
continue to be a cornerstone of the Canadian grain marketing 
strategy.
<P>
	Canada's commitment to grain quality will be strengthened in 
other ways as well. The definition of contaminated grain will be 
clarified and the responsibility of elevator operators for the safe 
handling of hazardous compounds and the safe disposal of 
contaminated grain will be clearly spelled out.
<P>
	As well, an amendment will confirm the commission's 
authority to set standards for the drying of grain. This is perhaps 
more important than first might appear. Because improperly 
dried grain often cannot be detected until it is actually processed 
the first sign of a problem in this area could be a dissatisfied 
customer, and that is obviously too late.
<P>
	This amendment provides the commission with another 
means by which to maintain Canada's reputation for grain 
quality. This translates into enhanced competitiveness for 
Canada's grains industry.
<P>
	In the spirit of removing unnecessary laws, process elevators 
will not be required to undergo weigh-overs. A weigh-over is a 
procedure in which an audit is conducted to verify tonnage in 
store by grade. Weigh-overs obviously serve a useful purpose 
when conducted at terminal and transfer elevators because in 
those instances the elevators are often handling grain they do not 
own. By contrast, process elevators own the grain they have in 
stock and therefore weigh-overs serve no useful purpose.
<P>
	A central objective of this government is to remove laws and 
regulations which have outlived their usefulness and this 
amendment supports that objective.
<P>
	As I announced in July 1994, the grain commission will no 
longer be required to set maximum tariffs for elevators. Elevator 
tariffs are the fees that grain elevator companies charge for their 
services. Government regulation of tariffs dates back to a time 
when producers were much less able to protect themselves from 
the setting of unfair prices. However, because producer owned 
or controlled companies now control the majority of elevator 
capacity in Canada, there is no need for government to continue 
to regulate tariffs on behalf of producers.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	This deregulation of maximum tariffs will proceed in two 
stages. First, during a two-year transition period, the 
commission will retain the authority to set tariff ceilings by 
order. I would not anticipate any significant problem with this 
process.
<P>
	In the current crop year terminal elevator operators were 
given the power by commission order to set their own elevation 
tariffs. For the most part, their increases were relatively minor 
and on the whole fair. This bodes well for the future and I am 
confident that allowing the market to function more freely will 
provide benefits to everyone concerned.
<P>
	At the same time, even after the two-year transition period 
the commission will continue to have the authority to deal with 
maximum tariffs if that should become necessary. During and 
after the transition period the grain commission will perform an 
ombudsman role, responding to complaints and seeking 
remedies.
<P>
	I wish to stress that this amendment arises from our 
commitment to regulatory reform, removing regulations that 
hinder the competitiveness of Canadian industry, and 
developing a regulatory regime which adds value to the efforts 
of Canadian enterprises to compete in international markets.
<P>
	Bill C-51 will remove the requirement that only public 
carriers transport grain interprovincially. This will benefit 
producers, providing them with transportation options that may 
help them to reduce some of their marketing costs. Other 
amendments will allow the grain commission to stipulate that 
electronic transmission of transactions may replace paper 
documents. This will save money and time for the grain 
commission and for the industry as a whole.
<P>
	I would now like to turn to the issue of protection for grain 
producers. The Canada Grain Act of 1912 established the 
Canadian Grain Commission in large measure to protect the 
interests of Canadian grain producers. This remains a central 
feature of the act, and several of the proposed amendments 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6479"> 6479 </A></B>
<P>
before us today are designed to maintain this protection 
function.
<P>
	They include granting authority to the grain commission to 
act against companies that illegally use Canada Grain Act grade 
names. The bill also includes provisions that require licensed 
grain dealers to use Canada Grain Act grade names in all of their 
transactions with producers, provisions to specify the way in 
which grade, dockage and moisture content are determined and 
recorded at the country elevator, and provisions to allow the 
suspension of licences of primary elevators where overages 
exceed allowable limits.
<P>
	Overages are discrepancies between the amount of grain an 
elevator has in store and the amount that it should have 
according to records of shipments and receipts. The 
amendments will also include provisions that confirm the 
authority of the grain commission to require operators to fully 
ensure the grain in their elevators.
<P>
	The current reporting requirements are not as effective as they 
should be under the law for determining the financial health of a 
prospective licensee. Therefore, this bill contains provisions 
that require prospective licensees to provide specified financial 
data which demonstrate their financial viability.
<P>
	I would now like to turn to the issue of enhanced protection 
for taxpayers under this proposed legislation. The amendments 
will provide such protection for the taxpayers of this country. 
Members will recall that in 1991 the Federal Court of Appeal 
ruled that the grain commission was liable for losses sustained 
by producers in the early 1980s when two licensees went 
bankrupt and their security posted with the commission did not 
cover their liabilities.
<P>
	As a result of this, Canadian taxpayers were required to pay 
more than $3.9 million, an amount equal to the difference 
between the security posted by the companies and their actual 
liabilities to grain producers.
<P>
	While the Federal Court of Appeal has obviously disagreed, it 
is the view of many in the industry that the Canada Grain Act 
was not intended to provide unlimited protection for grain 
producers in all circumstances.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	Unlimited business protection of the kind apparently 
envisaged by the Federal Court of Appeal judgment is unknown 
in virtually any other sector of our economy. Most producer 
organizations understand how it can lead some producers into 
making unwise business decisions.
<P>
	Therefore, while protection by security posted by licensees is 
one of the rights producers have under the act I believe, and the 
majority of producer organizations with which the commission 
consulted agree, that grain producers need to assume somewhat 
more responsibility for their own business dealings.
<P>
	While certain of our amendments give the commission more 
authority to deal with licensees whose security may be 
insufficient, other amendments place an onus on the farmer to 
help minimize his or her own risk. These  provisions include, 
first, an amendment that will provide by regulation protection 
for producers for a prescribed period from the date of delivering 
their grain to a licensee.
<P>
	If producers decline to accept payment for their grain within 
that specified period, they will not be eligible to be paid out of 
the licensee's posted security should that company ultimately 
fail. Based on consultations which the grain commission has 
conducted with producers and the industry the prescribed period 
will be 90 days. There will be a requirement that the farmer must 
notify the grain commission within 30 days of a failure to pay or 
default by a grain company.
<P>
	The amendments will also place a responsibility on the farmer 
to determine if he or she is in fact dealing with a duly licensed 
company. As only licensed companies must post security with 
the grain commission, claims will not be valid if the farmer is 
dealing with an unlicensed company.
<P>
	A provision will require the producer to obtain grain 
commission authorized documents from grain dealers and other 
grain commission licensees. The amendments will permit the 
commission to set percentage limits on security coverage. The 
commission would not however be able to use that particular 
regulatory power without governor in council approval. 
Currently coverage is 100 per cent. I expect this will remain the 
case for the foreseeable future.
<P>
	Finally, the amendments explicitly limit the ability of the 
Canadian Grain Commission to have the amount of security 
posted by licensed companies through the commission. This 
provision is designed to bring the protection enjoyed by 
producers more in line with security provisions common in 
many other areas. It is a bit analogous to the limits placed on 
what the government will guarantee depositors in a financial 
institution that fails.
<P>
	These provisions are not a cure-all. No legislation can ensure 
that grain companies will not make bad decisions. No law will 
prevent bankruptcies. Nonetheless, these amendments will 
place more responsibility with the producers for dealing with 
licensed, viable companies. As well these provisions will 
encourage producers to refrain from taking unnecessary risks 
when dealing with any company, licensed or otherwise.
<P>
	These amendments will reduce the risk which has been borne 
in the past by the taxpayer. As I said in my first introductory 
remarks this package of amendments was preceded by a series of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6480"> 6480 </A></B>
<P>
in depth industry consultations across the grains industry in this 
country.
<P>
	These consultations demonstrate conclusively that the 
industry has changed, strengthening our conviction that 
Canada's legislation has to respond to those changes. I believe 
the amendments before the House today have the support of the 
majority of participants in our grains industry. These 
organizations share my belief that these amendments will 
produce substantial benefits for producers, taxpayers and the 
grains industry as a whole. I recommend the amendments 
contained in Bill C-51 to the House for approval.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to participate this morning in this 
debate on Bill C-51, an Act to amend the Canada Grain Act.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-51, this bill to amend the Canada Grain Act we are 
debating this morning will not cause much of a stir. The 
proposed amendments are rather technical and are aimed at 
increasing efficiency in the administration and operation of the 
Canadian Grain Commission and the grain industry.
<P>
	The Canadian Grain Commission is responsible for the 
implementation of the Canada Grain Act. It is required to 
establish and maintain standards of quality for Canadian grain 
and to regulate the handling of grain in Canada.
<P>
	The bill before us has a triple objective: first, to improve the 
competitiveness of the grain industry; second, to ensure better 
protection for producers when they do business with grain 
dealers and big companies; and third, to protect taxpayers more 
adequately.
<P>
	Last Saturday, I had the chance to meet with greenhouse 
tomato producers in my riding, and one of them told me this 
story that I would like to share with you this morning. Here is 
how the story goes: tomatoes he sells 70 cents per pound to the 
supermarket and delivers himself because he handles the 
marketing are sold minutes later at the same location not for 79 
cents per pound, not for $1.39 per pound, but-listen to this- 
$2.39 per pound.
<P>
	So, this greenhouse producer said: ``You know, I have to work 
four months to grow my tomatoes before I can sell them at 70 
cents per pound, but all the owner of this supermarket has to do 
is to keep them in his refrigerator or display for 24 or 48 hours to 
make a net profit of $1.70 per pound''.
<P>
	Producers are sometimes believed to pocket the biggest share, 
but they are not the ones. In this case, there was no intermediary; 
this producer handles marketing himself, yet the tomatoes he 
gets paid 70 cents a pound for, the very same tomatoes sell for 
$2.39 per pound, just 24 to 36 hours later.
<P>
	Coming back to Bill C-51, in order to increase competition, 
the commission will no longer have to set maximum elevator 
charges. Such deregulation will come  about gradually however, 
and the commission will retain the discretion to set a ceiling 
through regulation. It will also have the power to investigate 
complaints and, of course, settle them. We are told that this will 
give elevator operators more flexibility in setting their prices 
based on market conditions.
<P>
	If there is a problem, the board reserves the right to set a 
ceiling. Producers must enjoy sufficient protection so that the 
time needed to handle their complaints does not push them into 
bankruptcy.
<P>
	Some of the amendments have aroused concern, however, 
since the regulations that go with the bill will have a very big 
impact on the bill itself. We hope that the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food will table the regulations in 
committee so that we can assess the impact of the bill before us 
this morning.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, it is unlikely that the deregulation provided for 
in this bill will lead to a rise in consumer prices. Let me explain. 
The Canadian Wheat Board pays producers based on the price it 
gets on the international market. The government for its part, 
after assessing the market outlook, sets a base price it is 
committed to paying to producers.
<P>
	In the last several years, the base price has been set at a very 
low level, which minimizes the government's obligation to 
reimburse producers in case sales collapse on the international 
market. When the international price is higher than the initial 
price, the board pays producers the difference. If the reverse is 
true, the difference is paid by the government. It should be 
pointed out that production or transport costs have no impact on 
the initial price level.
<P>
	In the event of a significant decline in the market price, 
producers will rely on the income support program that includes 
the Gross Revenue Insurance Plan and the Net Income 
Stabilization Account. If the market price remains stable but 
production costs rise, producers will dip into their Net Income 
Stabilization Accounts. This account is financed by producers' 
premiums. Up to 2 per cent of his gross revenue is matched by 
the federal and provincial governments and a further 20 per cent 
that is not matched can be added.
<P>
	The producer receives interest on the invested funds at 3 per 
cent above the market rate. He draws on his account if his profit 
margin is less than the moving average of previous years. As a 
result, the operators would have to overcharge considerably to 
lower the producer's profit margin; the producer could then 
draw on his stabilization account.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6481"> 6481 </A></B>
<P>
	It is therefore unlikely, but nevertheless, should it occur, 
taxpayers would have to supplement a drop in the producer's net 
income with matching payments. Deregulation also allows 
producers to use private rather than public transportation to take 
grain from one province to another. That is something new.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, let me now show you and this House how 
this everyday bill is a perfect example of the gulf between 
Quebec and the rest of Canada. Since most grain growers are in 
Western Canada, logically the associations representing them 
should be consulted about the impact of the bill before us, C-51.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	Out of curiosity, I went to find out what Quebecers are 
thinking. The producers who should be concerned, Quebec's 
grain growers, are not. The reason is very simple: they are 
mainly under provincial legislation. So Quebec producers again 
have to deal with two levels of government. For example, the 
primary elevators are in provincial jurisdiction, while the 
transfer and process elevators are in federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	The Government of Quebec has authority for everything 
concerning the domestic market, including the shipment of 
grain. Outside Quebec borders, federal jurisdiction takes over. 
There is a long list of such waste of time and money in every 
sector and department.
<P>
	In terms of the grain required to feed its cattle, Quebec is 70 to 
80 per cent self-sufficient. Here, I must pay tribute to the former 
Quebec Minister of Agriculture, my friend Jean Garon, with 
whom I had the pleasure of working on several occasions. By the 
time he left the agriculture department, in 1985, he had 
increased the province's self-sufficiency to over 80 per cent.
<P>
	The other 20 to 30 per cent comes from Ontario or the United 
States. These percentages clearly show why Quebec producers 
have concerns other than those addressed by this legislation. 
Their situation is completely and totally different. Since the 
federal government gives us so many opportunities to make 
suggestions, I will make one this morning: Why does the 
Minister of Agriculture not look at the problem experienced by 
maple producers, considering that 86 per cent of all the maple 
syrup on this planet comes from Quebec?
<P>
	The monies invested in that sector by his department are 
absolutely insufficient. In my riding of Frontenac, where 
exceptionally good quality maple syrup is produced in great 
quantities, producers are lamenting over the fact that their syrup 
is still being sold at the same price as ten years ago. Because 
there is a major surplus, they have no choice but to accept the 
price offered to them. Their latest idea to dispose of their stock 
is to sell maple syrup to be used in ice cream, in the form of 
maple sugar bits. This product is extremely popular right now in 
the U.S., in Canada and of course in Quebec. There is also maple 
syrup yogurt. I do hope, however, that nobody finds a way to 
replace maple sugar  or syrup by a substitute which will taste the 
same but will not be the real thing and may well not be much 
cheaper.
<P>
	I urge you, Madam Speaker, as well as hon. members in this 
House, to sample the cakes made with maple syrup by the bakery 
in Saint-Méthode. You have? Good. These are made with real 
maple syrup and not a substitute. Last spring, when I visited that 
bakery, they were proud to tell me that they had already used 500 
barrels of maple syrup.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Now, if the federal government would only look beyond what 
it is doing in Western Canada for farmers and realize there is a 
case for investing in research and development in Quebec. This 
morning I mentioned the maple syrup industry. There are other 
examples of areas where Quebec is well ahead of the other 
provinces or other countries. Milk production is case in point, 
since Quebec is responsible for 48 per cent of Canada's milk 
production.
<P>
	So why not invest more to develop the potential of a sector 
that already has an excellent record? We in the Bloc Quebecois 
have no objection to the measures being sought by Western 
farmers, and we have no objection to their excellent association 
supporting such measures. We have conducted consultations 
and checked our facts, and Bill C-51 appears to have the 
approval of Western farmers. Farmers in Western Canada are in 
the best position to know what is good for them. It is only fair to 
give them the tools they need to develop their potential.
<P>
	In turn, we would like to see the same respect shown for the 
choices Quebecers will make in this coming year. Let the people 
who know what is best for them decide what kind of future they 
want.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity, and I can 
assure the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food that all Bloc 
Quebecois members in this House will support Bill C-51.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the comments of both members this 
morning. I will address this bill on the basis that I agree with 
some points and feel very negative about others.
<P>
	The Canada Grain Act is administered by the Canadian Grain 
Commission which is the agency mandated to establish and 
maintain grain quality and regulate the Canadian grain handling 
system.
<P>
	I can support the main intentions of this bill as it aims at 
making our grain industry more competitive. We all want to see 
Canada build on its reputation as a producer and supplier of 
quality grain to the world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6482"> 6482 </A></B>
<P>
	It is important to remember that there are many important 
components that make up the grain industry and we should be 
sure that they are all working in top form to ensure the health and 
viability of this sector.
<P>
	For example, last year we had problems caused by disruptions 
in the grain transportation system. This year it looks like we are 
going to experience some of the same problems which are 
disastrous and detrimental to our industry. Clearly we have to 
learn to start taking problems for what they are and try to solve 
them from past experiences without jeopardizing the future or 
the well-being of the industry.
<P>
	Turning to the bill, I will outline some of its provisions. The 
Canadian Grain Commission will no longer be required to set 
maximum tariffs charged by grain elevators. Over time it is 
hoped that this will allow elevator operators to be more flexible 
and competitive in pricing their services while encouraging 
capital investment. This will also give grain buyers more 
authority to penalize people who put grain into terminals but do 
not move it quickly enough.
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	This amendment may solve a problem that was evident last 
year when the Canadian Wheat Board plugged elevators with 
grain for which there was not immediate buyers.
<P>
	With the current legislation, terminals do not have to wait for 
boards to sell. They can legislate increased premiums or tariffs. 
This will probably have a positive effect on the system. Cabinet 
through governor in council will have the power to reverse these 
amendments. It remains to be seen whether this amendment will 
give terminals any real power or whether the Canadian Wheat 
Board will continue to be protected by the government through 
the undemocratic governor in council process.
<P>
	I also wonder if the government in the future will invoke 
governor in council provisions to give more power to the 
Canadian Wheat Board and further regulate the industry.
<P>
	The legislation states that after the maximum tariffs are 
eliminated the role of the Canadian Grain Commission will be 
that of a conciliator in resolving tariff disputes. This raises the 
question that if there is a need to further define this role, how 
will this be accomplished? Will it be through legislation or 
through governor in council?
<P>
	The legislation allows for free movement within the western 
jurisdiction and within the eastern jurisdiction but not between 
the two jurisdictions. I wonder why there are these restrictions 
on interprovincial trade within Canada. As hard as it may be to 
believe, there are more barriers to trade between provinces in 
Canada than there are between countries in the European 
community. I really question the rationale that says there should 
be restrictions for grain movement within Canada.
<P>
	This summer we saw the first ministers sign an 
interprovincial trade agreement that actually did very little to 
promote free trade. It surprised me that when they had an 
opportunity to solve a problem that has to be resolved, they 
accomplished little, especially in the area of agriculture. This is 
all the more surprising when one considers that these 
restrictions are not imposed by us, by foreign governments or 
international regulations. These are pitfalls that we have set up 
for ourselves and which we have to be more determined to 
remove.
<P>
	By eliminating internal trade barriers we can remove the 
distortions in our markets and ensure that producers in this 
country have more control in setting prices instead of having a 
system where internal trade barriers ensure that trade prices are 
artificially inflated.
<P>
	This bill will also remove the requirement that only public 
carriers can transport grain interprovincially. This is a good idea 
that will hopefully allow producers to reduce their marketing 
costs by giving them more transportation options.
<P>
	The amendments in Bill C-51 also attempt to provide 
increased protection for grain producers. These include giving 
the Canadian Grain Commission authority to act against 
companies which illegally use Canada Grain Act grade names; 
requiring licensed grain dealers to use Canada Grain Act grade 
names in all their transactions with producers; specifying the 
way in which grade, dockage and moisture content are 
determined and recorded at the county elevator; authorizing the 
Canadian Grain Commission to suspend the licences of primary 
elevators where overages exceed allowable limits, which is very 
preferable; confirming the authority of the Canadian Grain 
Commission to require operators to fully insure the grain in their 
elevators; and, requiring prospective licensees to provide 
specific financial data which demonstrates their financial 
viability.
<P>
	Certainly increased protection for producers is something that 
should be pursued but there is always a danger that by adding 
more regulation the system is being weighed down more and 
more. We have to find ways to get protection for producers 
without getting into the way of how they conduct their 
businesses.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	There are also aspects of these amendments that will 
hopefully result in increased protection for taxpayers. Under the 
bill producers will have 90 days to seek payment for their grain 
after delivery to a licensee. If producers do not seek payment 
within that time period they will not be eligible to be paid out of 
the licensee's posted security. Then the companies go bankrupt.
<P>
	The farmer would also be required to inform the Canadian 
Grain Commission within 30 days of a failure to be paid by grain 
companies. The onus will be on farmers to determine if the 
companies they are dealing with are licensed by the Canadian 
Grain Commission.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6483"> 6483 </A></B>
<P>
	Since licensed companies must post security with the 
Canadian Grain Commission, claims will not be valid if farmers 
are dealing with unlicensed companies. The Canadian Grain 
Commission will be limited on its liability to the amount of the 
security posted by the licensee. It is intended to be similar to the 
limits placed on what the government will guarantee depositors 
if a financial institution fails.
<P>
	These are some of the bylaws I can support. As the House 
knows, I am no great friend of the Canadian Transportation 
Agency or the Canadian Grain Commission. Why is that so? I 
would like to remind the House that as a farmer and as a 
politician today I like to deal fairly with every individual.
<P>
	In May of this year the Manitoba <I>Co-Operator</I> published an 
article that read: ``Double standard claimed. The Canadian 
Grain Commission, guardian of the quality control system that 
makes Canadian grain exports the best in the world, tells 
farmers to do one thing but one of its assistant commissioners 
has been practising another. This commissioner has grown 
unregistered wheat for a whole year before it was internally 
licensed''. If that is not a double standard, if that is protecting 
the Canadian farmer, I cannot agree with the bill.
<P>
	When questioned one Domain area farmer said: ``How 
political was the decision not to register Grandin grain or how 
political was the decision to bring it in?'' When the wheat board 
commissioner, Mr. Murta, replied to it, he said: ``It is an 
indication of a system that almost got ahead of itself and you can 
see the result''.
<P>
	We were to have a grain commission to protect the quality of 
our grain and what did it do? It illegally allowed one of its 
assistant commissioners to bring in grain.
<P>
	When another farmer was asked how he felt about it, he 
replied: ``Although the first Grandin wheat came into the 
prairies illegally, one of the first farmers to import it says 
Agri-Canada officials told us how to do the paperwork. They 
told us we didn't have to use variety name. We could use lot 
number''.
<P>
	Is this the type of grain commission we want? Not I, not as a 
farmer. It bothers me when I see there will be no limits on 
storage costs. Will it really increase competition or will it allow 
big grain companies to fill their terminals and then charge 
farmers through the wheat board for these costs? There is no 
incentive for the wheat board to move that grain because I pay 
the costs, not the wheat board.
<P>
	One prime example is the situation at Churchill to date. As of 
Monday there were two ships sitting and waiting for grain. 
There is no grain available. Elevators in southern parts of the 
provinces are plugged. Boxcars are sitting idle. We do not need 
hopper cars to go to Churchill. Boxcars are sitting idle. 
Transportation costs to Churchill are from $10 to $20 per tonne 
cheaper than either to the west coast or to the east coast. There is 
no  incentive for the grain companies to move grain to Churchill 
because the terminal is owned by the government.
<P>
D (1105) 
<P>
	Last July I went to investigate the port, to have a look at it. A 
ship was due for arrival that took on 40,000 tonnes. That 
terminal with the capacity to store five million bushels had 
4,000 tonnes in it. Are those the regulations we are debating? Is 
that the type of system that is protecting farmers? I feel we are 
getting shafted.
<P>
	Why should we be worried? I received a letter last week from 
a seed cleaning plant which does not come under the rules of the 
Canadian Grain Commission. Through its expertise and 
incentive it developed a market for special crops. The seed plant 
was notified that it would have to become a grain dealer or an 
elevator with a licence. It would have to put up bonds. It would 
have to put on insurance. There will be extra costs for the small 
seed cleaning plant, of which there are hundreds in rural parts of 
the prairies. The operator told me point blank: ``If that is 
enforced upon me I will be shut down. There is no way I can 
compete with a UGG or a pool cleaning system. No way will I 
survive''.
<P>
	Is that increasing competition? I think it is decreasing it. Why 
are we doing it? Why are we continually allowing bureaucrats 
and government to enforce regulations or stipulations that hurt 
the small person?
<P>
	I would like to go a little further. I noticed in his opening 
remarks the hon. minister indicated that they wanted to save 
taxpayers' money. That is one thing Reform is always pushing 
for. We could very easily do so by removing some wheat board 
commissioners who were politicians, are drawing a gold plated 
pension plan and are still drawing a wage more than that of an 
MP in the House. If that is looking after the small guy, I do not 
want to be looked after. These grain board commissioners are 
lifetime appointments.
<P>
	I read in the new bill that the age limit will be removed. Why? 
Is 65 not old enough? Why would we want to increase the age 
until these grain commissioners finally die? That is the only way 
we will ever remove them and get people to represent farmers.
<P>
	It is not only that. Further in the bill I read that we are going 
now to give the commissioners the authority to set their own 
wage scale. They will not have to go to the cabinet or use an 
order in council. If that is saving taxpayers' money, I do not 
think I want to support the bill.
<P>
	How do I feel about the bill? It reminds me very much of a 
chicken farmer who is trying to protect his flock in the hen 
house. He is looking for a guard dog and finally somebody 
camouflages a fox and says: ``Here is a good guard dog. Set him 
in front of your door''. Not only are we being brainwashed or 
whitewashed with the guard dog; we are throwing him into the 
chicken coop and closing the door. The guard dog will have his 
meals any  time; he will have any one of the chickens he desires. 
I cannot support legislation like this.

<P>
	When I look at section 84 that deals with transportation of 
grain I see that it is to be deregulated. It will now require not 
only an export permit from the wheat board to move grain from 
province to province. It will also require documentation from 
the Canadian Grain Commission allowing farmers to transport 
their own grain. Does it make sense? To me it is more regulation, 
not deregulation.
<P>
	As a farmer and a new politician I did not think I would see 
democracy at the point I see it this morning. When I am told as a 
member of the House that I must accept what the government 
wants to do and I had better like it or else I will have nothing to 
say, I get very upset.
<P>
	I remind hon. members on the other side that come the next 
election this farmer-politician will not forget those kinds of 
actions. He will continually remind western farmers that this 
was how we were treated by hon. members across the way.
<P>
	We are going to go to our graves physically healthy. We can 
spend millions and millions in building pools and supporting 
hockey rinks, but we cannot support a grain transportation 
system; we do not have the funds.
<P>
	The other day I saw a news release stating that $4 million was 
to be spent in the city of Winnipeg for recreation by the 
government, but we cannot afford to upgrade the line to 
Churchill. We are going to starve healthy.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Prince 
Albert-Churchill River.
<P>
	I wish to add my voice to those supporting Bill C-51, an act to 
amend the Canada Grain Act. I do so for many reasons. As 
colleagues have noted, these amendments offer a multitude of 
benefits in terms of enhanced competitiveness for Canadian 
grain in world markets, better service to the industry, and 
protection for grain producers and taxpayers.
<P>
	I congratulate all involved for putting together such a 
comprehensive and useful package of legislation. I am 
impressed with the ways in which the bill reinforces and fulfils 
the original intent of the Canada Grain Act, 1912, while at the 
same time it adapts to many challenges posed by the 
international grain markets of the 1990s.
<P>
	Its original intent was and remains, to act in the interests of 
producers. It is on behalf of grain producers I wish to address my 
remarks today. To act on behalf of the grain producers it is first 
necessary to understand what they are. The process that led up to 
the drafting of the legislative amendments was one of lengthy, 
in-depth consultations with representatives of all facets of the 
grain industry.
<P>
	Prominent among those were grains producer organizations. 
These organizations through their  representatives told the 
Canadian Grain Commission to continue to protect the integrity 
of the Canadian grain handling system, to strengthen and to 
maintain the system that has given Canada the enviable 
reputation enjoyed worldwide for top quality grain.
<P>
	At the same time they said they needed flexibility to meet the 
new markets and challenges, to pursue new opportunities, and to 
adapt to rapidly changing conditions. While on the one hand we 
are maintaining and strengthening Canada's grain quality 
system, on the other hand we are removing restrictions which 
have become burdensome and counterproductive. With the 
foregoing in mind I will now outline the features of this bill 
which I feel most effectively accomplish these objectives from a 
producer's point of view.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	To protect the integrity of Canada's grading system which 
producers understand enhances the marketability of their grain, 
the act will amend to strengthen the concept that quality meeting 
the needs of the end users is central to Canada's grain handling 
system.
<P>
	This will help to reinforce the many unique things we do in 
Canada which ensure that only the best grain varieties are 
developed, marketed and transported through our bulk handling 
system.
<P>
	As Canada's grain system evolves over time this amendment 
will affirm that quality will continue to be the foundation of 
Canada's grain marketing strategy.
<P>
	Canada's commitment to grain quality will be strengthened in 
other ways. For example, the definition of contaminated grain 
will be clarified and the responsibility of elevator operators for 
safe handling of hazardous compounds and safe disposal of 
contaminated grain will be clearly spelled out. This works to the 
obvious benefit of the producers who will understand the ethical 
concerns and the marketing advantages of delivering a safe, 
wholesome product.
<P>
	As well, an amendment will confirm the authority of the 
commission to set standards for the drying of grain. This is more 
important because improperly dried grain often cannot be 
detected until it is processed. The first indication of concern 
would be a dissatisfied customer.
<P>
	This very point was brought up on September 22 at an annual 
meeting of the Ontario Wheat Producers Marketing Board in my 
riding of Lambton-Middlesex. When its primary customers, 
American producers along the south shore of Lake Erie, are 
demanding wheat with 13.5 per cent moisture content, there had 
better be a means of ensuring this standard.

	This amendment provides the commission with another 
means by which to maintain Canada's reputation for grain 
quality. It therefore contributes to enhancing the 
competitiveness of Canada's grain producers.
<P>
	This bill will remove the requirement that only public carriers 
transport grain interprovincially. This will benefit producers, 
providing them with transportation options that may help them 
to reduce costs. This provision coupled with the June 8 
announcement by the ministers of agriculture and transport to 
expedite changes to the Western Grain Transportation Act will 
ensure the foundation of a fair and effective delivery system for 
crops in all regions of Canada.
<P>
	Several other proposed changes to the Canada Grain Act 
speak directly to the opinions expressed by grain producers that 
the CGC continue to maintain the integrity of grain transactions. 
These include granting authority to the commission to act 
against companies which illegally use Canada Grain Act grade 
names; requiring licensed grain deals to use Canada Grain Act 
grade names in all of the transactions with the producers; 
provisions to specify the way grade, dockage and moisture 
content are determined and recorded at the county elevator; 
provisions to allow the suspension of licences of primary 
elevators where over usages exceed allowable limits.
<P>
	Over usages are discrepancies between the amount of grain an 
elevator has compared with what it should have based on records 
of shipment and receipts.
<P>
	Also included are provisions which clarify the authority of the 
commission to refuse licences to companies which it deems to 
be unreliable.
<P>
	These provisions fit well with others contained in the bill 
which require that grain producers take more responsibility for 
grain transactions. I believe this balanced approach reflects the 
basic value that is held by producers, the industry and this 
government, one that says we are all obligated to share in the 
risk and responsibilities. In doing so producers, the industry and 
all Canadians share in the benefits.
<P>
	Taken together, these amendments to the Canada Grain Act 
offer producers a comprehensive package of measures that 
support their efforts to work and to prosper in an increasingly 
competitive global grain market. For this reason I most heartily 
encourage members of this House to support this bill.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise to speak today in favour of Bill C-51, 
which contains amendments to the Canada Grain Act. This is a 
government of action. I am very proud of this government, 
particularly the actions and successes of the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
	I would like to commend the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food for his important role in the successful completion of 
the Uruguay round of the GATT talks.  For years the 
international community has been engaged in a grain subsidies 
war that has had a very negative effect on grain prices and 
therefore a very negative effect on Canadian farmers and the 
economy, particularly western Canada which is so dependent on 
grain.
<P>
	Canada had a much more limited treasury than our friends in 
Europe or the United States. As such we could not compete with 
the subsidy levels offered by those countries. Therefore, our 
minister had to fight hard at the GATT talks to reduce these 
levels of subsidies around the world and was successful in the 
pursuit of that endeavour.
<P>
	Over time we are going to see grain prices rise as these 
subsidies fall. We can all be very grateful for that. This is going 
to be good for farmers in my riding of Prince Albert-Churchill 
River and for all the farmers of Canada. That is something we 
can all be very happy about.
<P>
	In addition, our Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has 
shown negotiating skill and leadership in striking a good deal 
for Canadian farmers in the recent wheat export dispute with the 
United States. Limits on exports were obtained that are far 
above any levels of wheat export that we have seen in history.
<P>
	Second, we obtained an agreement that repressive trade 
sanctions contained in American trade law would not be 
implemented for a year. This will allow the GATT to become 
effective, thereby blocking the use of these heavy handed trade 
tactics in the future.
<P>
	These actions by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
typify the way this government deals with issues. The 
government identifies the problem. The government consults 
with all of the stakeholders who are affected by the issue and the 
government works hard with these stakeholders to fix the 
problem.
<P>
	In spite of this heavy agenda, the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food has not stopped there. Through the mechanism of 
actively seeking public input and the input of farmers and farm 
organizations, grain companies, all of the people involved in 
grain transportation and the grain industry, the minister has 
proposed effective amendments to the Canada Grain Act 
intended to improve the operating and administrative 
efficiencies of the Canadian Grain Commission and the grain 
industry.
<P>
	The world is changing. Technology is improving. The 
international marketplace is increasingly competitive and the 
deficit of the federal government and the protection of our 
taxpayers are things we all need to be concerned with. These are 
problems we must deal with. Our taxpayers, our farmers, all of 
us must be protected and looked after.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6486"> 6486 </A></B>
<P>
	Generally speaking the proposed amendments are quite 
varied but not insubstantial in consequence. Some of the 
changes are of a bookkeeping or tidying up nature, which change 
definitions contained in the act or change some of the 
translations to increasingly make the act more internally and 
externally consistent.
<P>
	Other changes give the Canadian Grain Commission the 
authority to establish by regulation, subject to cabinet approval, 
what constitutes a hazardous substance, which financial 
documents licensees must submit, the types of insurance an 
elevator must hold and how elevators must dispose of 
contaminated grain.
<P>
	New authority also has been given to the Canadian Grain 
Commission rather than the cabinet to establish allowances to 
be paid to members of grain appeals tribunals and grain 
standards committees. There is no doubt that Canada produces 
the best quality grain in the world. The international community 
recognizes this fact and when a choice is given it will pick our 
grains every time, provided we continue to be competitive and 
reliable suppliers.
<P>
	Amendments to the Canada Grain Act reiterate and recognize 
Canada's longstanding commitment to grain quality. Quality is a 
very important factor in the marketability of our grain. We must 
continue to do all we can to maintain that.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	The amendment also gives the Canadian Grain Commission 
the authority to establish by regulation, subject to cabinet 
approval, the time limit for realizing on security posted by 
licensees with the Canadian Grain Commission and provides a 
limit of 30 days to the time following the default on payments 
that a producer has to claim on CGC held security.
<P>
	Also the amendments provide the authority to establish by the 
Canadian Grain Commission, subject to cabinet approval, a 
percentage limit on the value of the claim against the grain 
commission held security. The amendments make clear that the 
Canadian Grain Commission is only liable to producers who 
deal with Canadian Grain Commission licensees and who obtain 
the prescribed documents upon delivery of their grain only up to 
the amount of security posted.
<P>
	These provisions among other things provide certainty and 
security for the taxpayers of Canada as well as the farmers of 
Canada. During the recent consultation held with all the 
stakeholders who have an interest in grain transportation it 
became apparent that in order to achieve reliability of supply 
and to keep intact Canada's well-deserved reputation as a 
reliable supplier of grain products, the Canadian Grain 
Commission requires the flexibility to eliminate the 
requirement of establishing maximum elevator tariffs.
<P>
	In all probability these amendments will ensure that grain will 
keep moving through our ports and on to our ships and will save 
the payment of demurrage fees that  have been paid in the past 
when we have seen a lot of ships sitting in harbour empty and not 
moving our grain.
<P>
	We all want to have payments made to keep the grain moving. 
This is a very progressive action. In addition to this we have the 
safety valve that the commission still maintains the authority to 
impose maximum tariffs if necessary.
<P>
	Other amendments to ensure balanced enhanced 
competitiveness, better financial security, more protection for 
taxpayers and greater operational flexibility for the Canadian 
Grain Commission are contained within the legislation.
<P>
	I wish to commend our minister of agriculture for bringing 
forward these amendments to ensure the continued success of 
the Canadian agricultural industry. I think the hallmark of this 
government and our minister of agriculture is that when there is 
a problem we move to fix it and our government will continue to 
support our farmers and our taxpayers by sensible regulation, of 
which this is a fine example.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I enjoyed that speech very much. It sure makes me feel 
better to know how good things are on the farm.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member whether he is aware that under 
the free trade agreement article 705(5) clearly stipulates that 
there cannot be a cap put on imports unless there is excessive 
production by new farm programs. This was very well known by 
the Liberal government in the free trade agreement it signed.
<P>
	About a week before this wheat deal was signed I heard 
someone on that side say, I think it was the hon. minister of 
agriculture, that no deal is badder than a bad deal. I wonder if he 
would comment on those statements.
<P>
	Also, could he give us an indication on the action taken on the 
transportation problems, such as back-tracking, if that is the 
rate of movement we will see from this government, whether it 
is going to resolve problems as fast as it has up to now because it 
is sure encouraging?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Madam Speaker, I wish to thank the hon. 
member for his questions.
<P>
	The deal reached by the minister of agriculture concerning the 
wheat dispute with the Americans is an excellent deal for 
Canada. If we look back at the historic relationship and the 
historic levels of wheat exports to the United States Canada 
came out of this negotiation very successfully.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	First, the minister ensured this very high level of continued 
export, well above the historic levels. However, in addition to 
this, and most significantly, the minister of agriculture achieved 
a moratorium from both countries in future trade action which 
could have very detrimental effects on the grains industry in 
western Canada. This delay allows the GATT provisions to come 
into force and prevents the American government from 
implementing  these very draconian, heavy-handed trade 
provisions in the future. As an interim step this was an excellent 
result 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6487"> 6487 </A></B>
<P>
obtained by the minister of agriculture and he should be 
commended.
<P>
	With respect to the hon. member, the minister of agriculture is 
doing a lot of things to ensure that the grain transportation 
system is improved. Some of the examples of this are in this bill. 
The government is going to continue to support the farmers of 
western Canada. When we hear statements from the leader of the 
hon. member's party saying there are too many farmers in 
western Canada, let me say that the Liberal Party does not agree 
with that. We ask that hon. member to retract the statement he 
made about two years ago in Halifax. That is the kind of support 
they get from across the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to hear that the member for Prince Albert-Churchill 
River still believes that his government is acting on behalf of 
farmers.
<P>
	It seems to me that this bill and its two companions which 
were introduced this fall have made a fairly sizeable shift 
toward dealing with the agri-food and the agri-business side of 
agriculture in providing protections and provisions for their 
needs sometimes at the expense of the farmer.
<P>
	Just as a brief illustration of that, I wonder if he would explain 
to us, since he raised it in his speech, how open-ended fees being 
set by elevators in terminals are a help to farmers. How is it a 
help to a farmer to deliver grain to an elevator for use at the 
terminal and find out that the fees have been changed after he 
gets the product into the system?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Madam Speaker, with respect to the fees that 
will be charged, first, open competition at the ports for different 
shippers is going to ensure that the rates charged are reasonable. 
However the grain commission retains the ability to regulate 
this issue.
<P>
	Does the hon. member believe that it is wise for farmers to pay 
for ships to sit empty and have grain not move or does he believe 
it is wise to pay and have the grain move so that we continue to 
be a reliable supplier of grain to all our world markets?
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-51 because this bill 
impacts directly on an industry that is very dear to myself and 
my family, having been part of this industry all of my life.
<P>
	After studying this legislation, generally, with only a few 
exceptions, there is little about it that I would not support. This 
is not because it is outstanding or comprehensive legislation. 
Far from it. My first impression from reading the bill would be 
that the minister instructed his bureaucrats to introduce some 
kind of legislation that would demonstrate the government's 
commitment to agriculture, but certainly not to introduce 
anything that might be controversial or  innovative or new, but 
something that could be demonstrated to Canadians as their 
commitment to our industry.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	This bill ratifies for the most part what already exists and 
makes a few minor procedural changes, in spite of the fact that 
the grain producing sector of this industry has been in crisis and 
has been struggling to undergo a very basic restructuring for the 
last number of years because of extremely depressed prices 
caused by an American-European trade war and a severe world 
recession.
<P>
	This fundamental restructuring has taken a terrible toll on 
countless families that were involved in the production of grains 
and oilseeds, particularly those producing for the export market. 
Many of my neighbours have lost their homes, their families and 
lifetimes or even in some cases, several lifetimes of work.
<P>
	Those who have managed to stay in the industry by 
consolidation, refinancing or off-farm income have been asking 
government for some time to provide the same kind of basic, 
fundamental restructuring of the regulations and services 
governments provide to the industry.
<P>
	Regulations are needed governing the transport and 
marketing of their crops to provide more flexibility and choices 
to meet the needs of this new high volume, low margin market 
environment of today. What does the government offer this new 
generation of farmers? Nothing but do-nothing status quo 
tinkering with the obsolete ideas of yesterday.
<P>
	Bill C-51 moves to remove the onus of responsibility from 
the government to the seller to investigate the integrity of those 
buying and selling grain. That in itself could be the proper 
direction to move but only if those regulations are followed and 
adhered to strictly and not as was done by the former agriculture 
minister when a number of producers with close connections to 
him got in trouble and the minister quickly moved to bail them 
out at great cost to taxpayers.
<P>
	If that is how these regulations and procedures count then it 
really makes little difference whether they are there or not. It 
also deregulates the elevator industry to operate in an open 
market environment.
<P>
	These initiatives would be acceptable also if at the same time, 
farmers were free to sell their crops where and how they chose 
to. Twenty years ago there would have been substantive benefit 
in the deregulation of elevator tariffs when almost all of the 
crops moved through the primary elevator system to market. 
This certainly is no longer the case now.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6488"> 6488 </A></B>
<P>
	Another disturbing trend we see in legislation coming from 
the government dealing with agriculture, as dealing with all 
other sectors in our economy, is the movement to consolidate 
decision making authority in the cabinet. This trend is obvious 
in the bill in clauses 2, 4, 9, 15, 33 and 35 and is an affront to this 
House which was elected to represent the interests of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	This trend should be of concern to all Canadians in all sectors 
but it should especially be troubling in this particular sector, the 
grain industry. I remember well an earlier Liberal Prime 
Minister referred to just yesterday by a member of the 
government as the greatest prime minister in Canadian history.
<P>
	Many of those sitting in the benches opposite were also 
members of this earlier government. This Prime Minister in my 
opinion did more to destroy Canadian unity than anyone has 
before or since. As I said, I well remember the arrogant disdain 
that this Prime Minister had for Canadian grain farmers. We all 
remember the infamous Trudeau salute to western grain 
farmers.
<P>
	The present Liberal government shows more and more of the 
same arrogant disdain toward those who are asking for real 
change and an open response of government. While there was 
little reference to the concerns of agriculture in the red book, 
there was a commitment to open, effective government.
<P>
	If there really is a commitment to Canadians, why do we 
continually have to deal with these do-nothing, go-nowhere 
bureaucratic tinkering pieces of legislation? Why are we not 
dealing with these minor adjustments as part of a comprehensive 
plan to restructure regulations dealing with the licensing of new 
crop varieties, the bottlenecks in the grain transportation sector, 
the restrictive marketing policies of the Canadian Wheat Board 
and the free flow of agricultural products anywhere in Canada?
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	To demonstrate briefly some of the things that I have tried to 
talk about and tried to demonstrate, earlier this year, back in 
April, a group of producers in my area were attempting to 
receive an experimental licence to grow a variety of hemp used 
to produce industrial fibre. These varieties have been long 
grown in France and Britain and to some degree in the United 
States because the hallucinogenic quality of this particular 
product no longer exists and has been removed from the product.
<P>
	I believe we have an opportunity to get in on the ground floor 
of the development of a new crop with terrific potential for the 
production of industrial fibre. One acre of hemp is capable of 
producing as much fibre as four acres of trees and this one acre 
can do it on a yearly basis where it takes some 70 or 80 years to 
produce the kind of growth in our forests to produce that kind of 
fibre.
<P>
	In an attempt to assist this group I approached the minister 
and he responded to me in a letter received some two and a half 
months after my initial approach on  the subject. In his letter he 
says: ``The information you provided presents a strong case for 
the exploration of the commercial production of hemp as a 
source of industrial fibre''. Further on he says: ``The legislation 
currently before Parliament would have enabled the minister of 
health to license growers of hemp for industrial purposes''. 
Further on he says: ``Bill C-7 would provide the foundation for 
the legal framework that would allow for the exploration of 
hemp as a source of industrial fibre''.
<P>
	Not having realized there was this huge potential in Bill C-7 I 
went to the bill and examined it very carefully to see where this 
provision could be. I failed to find any implication that would 
show me where this might happen. Being confused I contacted 
the offices of the Minister of Health who was sponsoring the 
bill. I contacted the Solicitor General's department and the 
justice department. All three departments assured me there was 
absolutely no provision in Bill C-7 that would deal at any level 
with the production of industrial fibre from hemp.
<P>
	We are at a stalemate and seem to be at a dead end in our 
efforts to get Canadian agriculture involved in the development 
of a crop with huge potential for income and a crop that could 
displace some of the lower income producing crops that have 
traditionally been grown on the prairies.
<P>
	Not only was the minister not prepared to help this group he 
did not understand the issue or in fact western Canadian farmers 
at all in their mission here. This is so typical of what we get time 
and time again. If the government, as we heard a few minutes 
ago, is going to be the protector of Canadian agriculture and to 
try and bring back some of the strength and financial equity to 
our industry which is so important to Canadians, we certainly 
have not seen any demonstration of that, at least to this point 
with the legislation we have been dealing with.
<P>
	I encourage the government, as a new government in the first 
year of its mandate to bring forward some new initiatives, some 
real changes, and to listen to the industry that has been asking 
for these changes instead of this tinkering and do-nothing stuff 
we have seen to this point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Point of order, Madam Speaker. Pursuant to 
Standing Order 43(2) I wish to indicate to the House that 
members of the government party will from here to the end of 
the debate on this particular item be dividing their time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Madam Speaker, first of all to the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois and Reform I would like on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6489"> 6489 </A></B>
<P>
behalf of the minister to extend apologies that he could not 
remain for the debate on this bill because of cabinet duties. He 
assured me he will be reading your comments.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to clarify a couple of things for the Reform Party 
today. The member for Lisgar-Marquette made some 
comments. Since we could not comment at that time I would like 
to do so now. The member made reference to Grandin wheat. I 
would point out to the member that soon after taking office this 
government consulted with the industry. It felt that Grandin 
wheat was not going to improve the quality of the great 
Canadian product we sell. It did not grant a licence to that 
variety of wheat.
<P>
	There was reference to an assistant commissioner who had 
some dealings with that. I would clarify for the member that that 
person is no longer an assistant commissioner of the Canadian 
Grain Commission.
<P>
	I find this passing strange and I would like to have some 
comments from the member for Athabasca at this time. As the 
great free enterpriser that the Reform Party sees itself, I find it 
interesting that it has some concern that we as a government 
want anyone who is dealing with it, people who are buying 
grains from Canadian farmers to have licences and the support 
or the bonding or whatever term should be applied to it in order 
to protect Canadian farmers.
<P>
	That is one of the duties we have. If it was a producer in one of 
their ridings who was found to be dealing with someone who was 
not bonded, I wonder what their feeling would be on that.
<P>
	In closing, I would make one further clarification for the 
Reform Party members. The member for Lisgar-Marquette 
said that commissioners are appointed for life. That is not the 
case. They are seven year appointments. Assistant 
commissioners are five year appointments. I just wanted to put 
that clarification on the record.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chatters:</B> Madam Speaker, I will respond briefly to the 
point about the requirement for licensing and bonding through 
the Canadian Grain Commission. Certainly I support those 
initiatives. They are more important now than ever before in our 
industry. Some years back when most of the grain produced in 
the industry went to the primary elevator system and most of 
that primary elevator system was owned and operated by 
producer managed or controlled elevator companies, those 
regulations were less important.
<P>
	Today with a proliferation of grain dealers popping up around 
the world every day that protection is more important now than 
ever before.
<P>
	I do have some concerns as to why now when it is so much 
more important than ever before the government moves to put 
the onus on the farmer rather than on the Canadian Grain 
Commission to identify those who are licensed and bonded 
properly. Certainly I support that particular initiative and I think 
most producers would.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I wish to speak in support of Bill C-51, an act to amend 
the Canada Grain Act.
<P>
	Bill C-51 contains a variety of necessary changes to the 
Canada Grain Act. I believe that producers, the grain industry 
and Canadians in general will find measures to address their 
specific concerns.
<P>
	The aspects of Bill C-51 that I wish to comment on are those 
which enhance the international competitiveness of Canada's 
grain industry. Canada is a trading nation and competitiveness is 
essential.
<P>
	In the world of free trade that we see before us, our ability to 
compete will directly affect our capacity to sustain and improve 
the living standards of Canadians. Few Canadian industries 
depend on international trade more than our grain industry. 
Every year we export 25 million to 30 million tonnes of grain, 
more than half our annual production. In wheat and barley we 
rank second among the world's top exporters. In other grains, 
canola and flaxseed for example, we are world leaders. There is 
no question that we depend on our trade for continued help to our 
grain industry. Our grain industry's success is central to the 
health and well-being of rural communities throughout western 
Canada especially.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Part of the role of government in this regard is to create a 
regulatory environment that adds value to the efforts of 
Canadians to create, to produce and to compete. This includes 
developing new laws that support our shared interest and also 
includes removing laws which no longer are useful or 
purposeful.
<P>
	An important initiative contained in Bill C-51 concerns the 
deregulation of maximum elevator tariffs. Elevator tariffs are 
the fees that grain elevator companies charge for their services. 
They cover the cost of handling, storage, cleaning and the drying 
of grain. Under the current Canada Grain Act, the Canadian 
Grain Commission is required to regulate elevator tariffs by 
establishing maximum allowable levels. As well, companies are 
required to provide 14 days notice of any change they wish to 
make to these tariffs.
<P>
	Bill C-51 will remove the requirement that the CGC place a 
ceiling on tariffs. Companies will be allowed to adjust their 
tariffs without giving prior notice to the CGC.
<P>
	Critics of this legislation may charge that the government is 
abandoning producers, exposing them to excessive charges by 
elevator companies. However, a close examination will 
demonstrate that regulation of tariff maximums is no longer 
needed and that ample safeguards exist to protect producers 
from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6490"> 6490 </A></B>
<P>
excessive charges. Government regulation of tariffs dates back 
in time to when producers were less able to protect themselves 
from the setting of unfair prices. However, because producer 
owned or controlled companies now control the majority of 
elevator capacity in Canada, we  believe that there is less need 
for government to regulate tariffs on behalf of producers.
<P>
	On the west coast, producer owned or controlled companies 
own 54 per cent of terminal capacity. At Thunder Bay the figure 
is 75 per cent. It stands to reason that these companies will act in 
the interests of producer owners by offering competitive prices. 
With no competition there will be no need for government to set 
prices.
<P>
	Even though we are confident that elevator companies will 
behave responsibly, Bill C-51 contains numerous safeguards for 
producers. Deregulation of maximum tariffs will proceed in 
stages. Initially, the commission will retain the authority to set 
tariff ceilings by order of a two-year transition period. After this 
transition period, the commission will continue to have 
authority to set maximum tariffs by regulation if needed. During 
and after the transition period the CGC will perform a mediation 
role responding to complaints and seeking remedies.
<P>
	Based on the responsible behaviour of the companies 
involved, we have reason to be optimistic in the current crop 
year as terminal elevator operators receive power by 
commission order to set their own elevator tariffs. For the most 
part their increases were minor and on the whole, very fair. This 
augurs well for the future. I am confident that allowing the 
market to function more freely will provide more benefits for 
all. These benefits will include more capital investment by 
elevator companies and a more flexible, competitive elevator 
industry.
<P>
	I should note that regulation has not prevented a high tariff 
system. For example, for a variety of reasons, U.S. rates which 
are less regulated are lower than Canada's.
<P>
	This amendment arises from our commitment to removing 
regulations which restrict the competitiveness of Canadian 
industry. Bill C-51 contains other similar initiatives. For 
example, process elevators will no longer be required to undergo 
weighovers. A weighover is an audit conducted to verify that the 
weight and grade of grain stored by an elevator corresponds with 
what is recorded. Weighovers help maintain the integrity of 
grain transactions when conducted at a terminal and transfer 
elevators because in those instances the elevators are often 
handling grain they do not own. However, process elevators own 
the grain they have in stock. Therefore weighovers saddle them 
with an unnecessary cost and thus hamper their 
competitiveness.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	Earlier I spoke of the need for laws which add value to the 
efforts of Canadians. I said that this involves removing 
unnecessary obstacles such as maximum tariffs and weighovers 
at process elevators. It also means that new laws are required 
from time to time.
<P>
	In the context of Bill C-51, there are provisions which 
strengthen the role equality plays in Canada's grain industry. As 
well, Bill C-51 sets out the responsibility of  elevator operators 
for the safe handling of hazardous compounds and the safe 
disposal of contaminated grain. It confirms the CGC's authority 
to set standards for the drying of grain. All of these measures 
add value to Canadian grain and serve to enhance our 
competitiveness in the world.
<P>
	In conclusion, Bill C-51 is the product of lengthy, detailed 
discussion with stakeholders throughout the grain industry. 
Producer organizations played a major role in these 
consultations as did elevator companies, processors and 
marketers. Because Bill C-51 reflects a broad industry 
consensus I believe it deserves the support of all members of 
this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to express my support for Bill C-51, an act to amend 
the Canada Grain Act.
<P>
	Bill C-51 has much to commend it. It addresses the need for 
regulatory reform. It introduces necessary protections for 
producers and taxpayers and it gives the Canadian Grain 
Commission more of the tools it needs to do the job on behalf of 
producers, the grain industry and Canadians in general.
<P>
	There are many aspects of Bill C-51 worth commenting on. 
The one I wish to speak on however is the strengthened emphasis 
on grain quality.
<P>
	We depend very heavily on international trade. As my 
colleague has mentioned, we export from 25 million to 30 
million tonnes of grain per year, more than half of our annual 
grain production. It is difficult to overstate how crucial grain 
quality is to our success in international markets. No other 
factor is as central to Canada's impressive international 
marketing record.
<P>
	When we consider some of the disadvantages Canadian 
producers face it is easy to see why quality has emerged as our 
marketing edge. Our producers must move grain farther to 
export locations than any of our competitors in other countries. 
Our harsh climate works against high yields. Our tax base is 
smaller than those of competing countries and we cannot play 
the export subsidy game and win. We are left with the quality of 
our product, a card that Canada plays with great effectiveness.
<P>
	With approximately 20 per cent of the global market, we are 
on average the world's second largest wheat exporter, ahead of 
the European Community, Australia, Argentina and everyone 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6491"> 6491 </A></B>
<P>
else. We are surpassed only by the United States. We are second 
in barley, accounting for over 30 per cent of the world market. 
We command over 40 per cent of the world's canola markets, 
almost as much as is exported by all the countries of western 
Europe combined. We are unique in that we are the only major 
exporter of that product.
<P>
	We lead the world in flaxseed exports that account for over 70 
per cent of the market. Canada's refusal to compromise on 
delivering cargoes of uniform consistent quality has served us 
well. As the CGC plays a pivotal role in Canada's grain hauling 
system, I am pleased to see provisions in Bill C-51 that 
reinforce this marketing strategy.
<P>
	For example, there is a provision allowing the CGC to set out 
methods, visual or otherwise, for determining the 
characteristics of the grain for purposes of meeting the quality 
requirements of purchasers of grain. The significance of this 
amendment is that it gives the commission the authority to 
specify procedures for determining the quality of grain so that 
the industry can deliver the quality desired by the end users.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	With the commission's considerable expertise in grain quality 
assessment this amendment positions the CGC to ensure that 
emerging procedures and technologies meet end user needs and 
increase returns to producers.
<P>
	Another provision of Bill C-51 confirms the CGC's authority 
to specify the correct handling and treatment of grain and 
hazardous substances in grain elevators. This provision 
strengthens Canada's commitment for safe, wholesome food 
and to environmentally sustainable practices.
<P>
	Finally, Bill C-51 confirms CGC's authority to set grain 
drying standards. The commission has paid careful attention to 
this issue over the years because improper drying seriously 
harms grain quality. Often the damage is not visually apparent 
and problems are only detected when the grain is processed. The 
commission has worked hard to educate producers and others on 
the proper techniques. This provision will give the CGC more 
authority to move in this area.
<P>
	There are some who believe that Canada over emphasizes 
grain quality. In a hungry world they argue Canada need not 
place as much emphasis or effort as it does on ensuring that 
Canadian grain meets the high standards it is known for.
<P>
	I believe quality will become more important than ever 
before. With the ratification of the GATT tariff walls will soon 
be falling around the world and subsidies will melt away. To 
maintain their position our wealthier competitors in Europe and 
the United States will have to become more quality conscious, 
more like Canada if they want to compete. Already we are seeing 
signs they are beginning to understand this.
<P>
	I will conclude with the words of one of Canada's grain 
customers spoken at Grain Vision'93, an international 
symposium that the Canadian Grain Commission held last year: 
``The current Canadian system of utilizing quality to link all 
aspects of business to achieve the marketing strategy of 
exporting at a premium 80 to 90 per cent of total wheat crop is 
now unique in the world. If you begin to implement changes for 
short term volume goals the end result will all too quickly be a 
situation  where you become just another `me too' supplier of 
which the world has all too many at present''.
<P>
	This sentiment was echoed by speaker after speaker at this 
conference. More tellingly, their appreciation of Canada's 
quality system is illustrated by their continued purchases of 
Canadian grain.
<P>
	Bill C-51 strengthens Canada's grain quality system. For this 
reason alone it deserves our support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, it certainly 
gives me pleasure to enter into the debate on the Canada Grain 
Act, Bill C-51.
<P>
	It is the second opportunity I have had in this assembly to 
speak on one of the agricultural bills, the former being Bill C-50 
which we debated last week.
<P>
	In Bill C-50 we took in this House steps that would increase 
producer control over agricultural research. When we look at 
Bill C-51 in comparison it is a bill that grants the Canada Grain 
Commission greater operational flexibility and promotes 
enhanced competitiveness in the grain industry. Those are 
certainly both worthy objectives to support for an entity that is 
responsible for a very important aspect of our grain industry in 
this country. It is important to give it those kinds of 
responsibilities.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party will be supporting this bill today as 
we did with Bill C-50. We will also take the opportunity in these 
debates to outline some of our broader concerns about where 
agriculture is headed in Canada. In particular, we would like to 
emphasize that government created boards and agencies like the 
Canadian Wheat Board, which were originally designed to assist 
and help the Canadian farmer, are becoming an entity, 
increasingly becoming an impediment to the free market 
system. They should come under scrutiny and review at this 
time.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Since the details of Bill C-51 have already been discussed and 
thoroughly enumerated in this House, I will make one or two 
quick points about one feature of the legislation before taking 
this opportunity to broaden my focus on other subjects relative 
to agriculture in Canada.
<P>
	The aspect of Bill C-51 that I wanted to comment on was the 
provision which removes some of the interprovincial trade 
restrictions faced by farmers. Clause 25 repeals the restriction 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6492"> 6492 </A></B>
<P>
of transporting grain from one province to another and repeals 
the restrictions on transport of grain by public carriers.
<P>
	The measure is a step in the right direction, but one has to ask 
a very important question at this time: Why should there be any 
restrictions on trade within Canada at all at this point? Why can 
we not have open boundaries and free movement in this country 
where all Canadians should share and have equal opportunity? 
That is an important issue that must be addressed not only by 
this federal government but by each of the provinces as we work 
together to enhance the agricultural industry.
<P>
	There are more barriers to interprovincial trade in Canada 
than there are barriers to trade between the nations of the 
European Community. That has already been mentioned by one 
of my colleagues. What is the rationale for the Canada Grains 
Commission to have any restrictions for grain movement to and 
from Canada enshrined in this legislation?
<P>
	For that matter, why are Canadian farmers being prevented by 
the Canadian Wheat Board from taking full advantage of the 
international trade opportunities created by the signing of GATT 
or NAFTA? Should the Canadian Wheat Board not also be 
forced to eliminate some of the restrictions that it is placing now 
on farmers?
<P>
	I said in the House the other day that we should raise some of 
those restrictions for the farmers so they can enter into a freer 
trade market or determine their own markets. There should be 
certain restrictions or a certain framework placed on the farmers 
if and when they wish to deal through the Canadian Wheat Board 
on some certain aspects at a future time.
<P>
	As farmers we cannot have our cake and eat it both with a 
board that is created by government and also by utilizing the free 
market. There must be a trade off when we have that kind of 
opportunity.
<P>
	Reformers have already made it clear that there is a need to 
reform the Canadian Wheat Board. However, this is just one 
example of the agricultural issues that need to be addressed in 
this assembly.
<P>
	When considering the agricultural sector, it is important to 
note that on the major questions of the day, it is the farmers who 
are leading. We heard that very clearly from the minister in his 
presentation earlier to this assembly. The legislation before us 
has been farmer directed, farm organization directed and I 
certainly appreciate that.
<P>
	We often find in this circumstance that we as government 
scramble to keep up with some of the farm attitudes. This is 
certainly very typical in the discussion regarding the Canadian 
Wheat Board at the present time.
<P>
	I looked at an article in the <I>Financial Post</I> that talked about 
the direct sales of grain to American markets that are classed as 
illegal under the Canadian Wheat Board at the present time. 
Those sales to the American markets now represent about 20 per 
cent of the total volume of Canada's grain exports to the U.S.
<P>
	We can only hope that this massive display of somewhat civil 
disobedience on the part of Canadian wheat farmers will 
convince the government that changes must be made to the 
practices of the Canadian Wheat Board. Again, it is a situation in 
which farmers are leading, finding markets, maintaining their 
economic stability as farmer but we as government have not 
looked at the circumstances and reacted in a positive way.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	The trend is similar with the restrictions on the movement of 
grain from east to west and on the government's reluctance to 
create a continental barley market. In both instances, fed up 
farmers have decided not to wait around for the government to 
make changes. They are going ahead and doing it themselves. 
Then, as a government, we are reacting. As an assembly here we 
must get ahead of the circumstances and be able to respond to 
the farmers when they see that there is a need.
<P>
	In this latest example, I read with interest that the minister of 
agriculture has now promised the Canadian grain farmers a 
chance to debate the future of the Canadian Wheat Board at a 
special forum to be held this fall. I commend him for that.
<P>
	I also encourage him to go one step further and hold a 
referendum on the issue of the Canadian Wheat Board's selling 
monopoly. It is clear that Canadian agriculture has changed a 
great deal since 1912 when the Canadian Grain Commission was 
established.
<P>
	This next decade will be a crucial time for the agricultural 
sector. As farmers prepare to make the adjustments required by 
GATT and free trade, they need a government prepared to assist 
them and help them gain the competitive edge to compete in an 
increasingly global marketplace. That is the environment in 
which we must prepare ourselves, the global marketplace. It is 
not just Canada. It is not just the United States. It is the global 
marketplace in which we work as farmers today.
<P>
	Reform has worked hard to create a comprehensive and 
balanced agricultural strategy capable of supporting the needs 
and challenges of the 21st century. We intend to elaborate on 
those in this assembly.
<P>
	The Liberal government on the other hand-I look at this with 
some disappointment-seems to be moving from one crisis to 
another and legislation that comes before this House seems to be 
motivated through the public service, albeit a point of view by 
the farmers or farm organizations rather, than from the 
legislators of this assembly.
<P>
	I look at Bill C-50 and Bill C-51 and they are good pieces of 
legislation in their own right but not in the broader context of 
what we have to do as leaders in the agricultural field. They are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6493"> 6493 </A></B>
<P>
modest pieces of legislation which only seek to fine tune and 
present some of the parts of an agricultural regime.
<P>
	When will the government respond to growing pressures 
originating both within and outside Canada and bring forth the 
major broader legislative initiatives that are necessary for the 
farmers of this country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the hon. member opposite. I 
commend him for having the wisdom to support Bill C-50 and in 
supporting Bill C-51.
<P>
	As he went through his presentation we came to a summary. In 
the summary on one hand he wants to allow the farming industry 
and farmers in general to have some input into the direction that 
we are to go and we are committed within the red book to 
maintain the process that we support the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	We have here an opportunity on behalf of the member to say 
why does the government not just go through and hold a 
referendum. What I would like to know from the hon. member 
opposite is would he not sooner have that total input from the 
farming community and say: ``In our opinion there should be a 
referendum and we would like you to move in that direction''?
<P>
	As it is now, he is saying government, back off. I support that. 
We have to. Some of our comments in Bill C-51 are directed in 
that response. I would like to know how we can as a government 
move through and hold a referendum when we are at this point 
allowing the opportunity for the farming community through the 
minister of agriculture to have it place its input before us before 
we would start with the legislation.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, in short, the 
minister of agriculture has not made it clear to farmers, 
particularly western farmers and those under the Canadian 
Wheat Board, that a referendum is a possibility and an option. It 
is not clear that it is there.
<P>
	It would be good if the government made a statement that 
there would be a referendum, that in the preamble or in 
preparation for the referendum there would be major hearings 
and major submissions to the standing committee on agriculture 
of the House to determine what the question would be, the 
content of the question, and what the implications of the answers 
would be following the referendum.
<P>
	At the present time we are unsure of the sequence and the 
pattern of commitment of the government. If it would make the 
commitment we could move ahead.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise to 
speak in support of Bill C-51, a bill to amend the Canada Grain 
Act. The bill has many positive measures that will contribute to 
the prosperity and competitive advantage of farmers and indeed 
all Canadians.
<P>
	The aspects of the bill I intend to address are the amendments 
that will remove the obligation of government to establish 
maximum tariffs for services performed by primary transfer and 
terminal elevator operators.
<P>
	For the benefit of members who are unfamiliar with the grain 
industry, a tariff is a charge assessed by an elevator company for 
services such as handling, cleaning of grain, storage and drying 
of grain. As the Canada Grain Act is now written, the Canadian 
Grain Commission is required to establish by regulation the 
maximum allowable tariff for each elevator service. If an 
elevator company wishes to change its tariff, it must give the 
commission 14 days of notice. If it wishes to offer a new service 
it cannot provide it until the commission has established a 
maximum tariff for the new service.
<P>
	These laws date from an era when farmers had few marketing 
choices and farmer organizations were relatively weak. In the 
early decades of this century these provisions made sense 
because elevator companies were not always as scrupulous as 
they should have been. Farmers were vulnerable so these 
changes were brought in at an appropriate time for protection. I 
know all members of the House continue to support them.
<P>
	In the grain industry of the nineties however this kind of 
government intervention, as I know the Reform Party would 
agree, provides no measurable benefit for producers as it places 
unnecessary obstacles in the path of grain companies.
<P>
	These are not merely my opinions. They reflect the advice the 
commission received from the grain industry and producer 
groups during the 1992 grains and oilseeds regulatory review. 
As the minister said this morning 57 groups were consulted. In 
addition we received written responses. The government shares 
the perspective of those representative groups.
<P>
	If the key participants want this change who are we to deny 
them? We will go along with it. We have concluded that 
regulating elevator tariff maximums is not in the best interest of 
the grain industry. We believe that removing maximums will 
encourage increased urgently needed capital investment by 
elevator companies. We are therefore confident the measures we 
are proposing today would result in a flexible, more competitive 
elevator industry.
<P>
	What are the changes we are proposing? First, the obligation 
that the Canadian Grain Commission set maximum elevator 
tariffs will be eliminated. Elevator operators will be able to 
decide for themselves how much they will charge for their 
services. As well, while we will still require elevator companies 
to file their tariffs with the commission, the requirement to give 
14 days notice of the change they wish to make in their tariffs 
will be removed. This will allow elevator companies the same 
freedom enjoyed by other businesses, other farm groups and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6494"> 6494 </A></B>
<P>
agri-groups, namely the freedom to adjust their prices quickly 
to respond to local market conditions.
<P>
	We have discussed these notions with respect to the wheat 
board and other kinds of institutions in place for the Canadian 
grain farmers. This is the way to respond to those niche market 
needs. We have that in the particular bill. As well, operators will 
no longer be required to charge the same tariff at all of their 
elevators. This will allow them more flexibility in rate setting.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	We will not be making these changes overnight. Again, on the 
advice of producers and acting with due prudence with the grain 
companies, we recognized the need for a transition period. For a 
two-year period, the Canadian Grain Commission will retain 
the power to set maximum tariffs by order, if situations arise 
where the tariff charged is excessive. Those checks and balances 
are there. Those protections are there for members of the House 
representing grain farmers in their areas who are concerned 
about drastic changes that may not have the policy outcomes we 
intend.
<P>
	When the two-year transition period has concluded, the 
commission will still exercise its power to investigate 
complaints. It is hoped that problems which may arise after the 
two-year transition period has ended will be resolved through 
discussion and moral suasion. We want to bring the people back 
to the table again to discuss any concerns and glitches that may 
still be evident in the policy.
<P>
	Nevertheless government will retain the power to intervene if 
intervention is required. The commission will continue to have 
the authority to reimpose maximum tariffs subject to the 
approval of the governor in council if circumstances so warrant.
<P>
	Inevitably in a situation like this one the first question to be 
asked will be: How will the measure affect the producer? All of 
us in the House today engaging in this debate have those 
interests firsthand.
<P>
	Protection of the interests of grain producers remains one of 
the most primary purposes of the act. The government has 
introduced numerous amendments to the act which will benefit 
producers. This particular amendment is no different.
<P>
	How are producers protected in a deregulated tariff 
environment? First an important point I want to stress 
particularly for the members of the Reform Party, and I speak in 
terms of Manitoba. They have their own producer owned or 
controlled elevator companies to protect their own interests. I 
am referring to such companies as the United Grain Growers. 
Manitoba Pool Elevators with 18,000 members in that province 
own the elevators. The interests of elevator owners and the 
interests of farmers are one and the same. We are not going to 
have the kind of subjugations and conflicts of interest leading to 
taking advantage of producers bringing their products to the 
elevators if we have that kind of producer involvement at the 
elevator door.
<P>
	It is the same for the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool and the 
Alberta Wheat Pool. We do not believe for one  moment that 
farmers will allow-and I have full confidence they will 
not-their own companies to take advantage of them. Producer 
owned co-operatives are formidable players in the grain 
industry. At Thunder Bay, for example, 75 per cent of the 
terminal capacity is operated by producer owned or controlled 
companies.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague from Saskatchewan had mentioned 
earlier, on the west coast producers own 54 per cent of that 
capacity, the majority holders. In the interests of their producer 
owners these companies will maintain downward pressure on 
tariffs, forcing privately owned companies to compete. 
Moreover most producers will have choices they did not have in 
1912 when the Canada Grain Act was passed. If they did not like 
what one company was charging they would take their grain to 
another. Allowing opportunities is the secret to that competitive 
advantage and open market competition. Competition will keep 
the rates in line and in some cases, I am convinced, will reduce 
them.
<P>
	If the grain producers' own companies in the competitive 
marketplace are not able to set fair prices, the Canadian Grain 
Commission is still there to investigate. The commission will be 
able to limit tariffs and will retain the right to set maximum 
tariffs by regulation. This right will only be exercised, however, 
in extreme situations.
<P>
	Members can rest assured that even in a deregulated tariff 
environment the Canadian Grain Commission will have the 
legal tools to defend the interest of grain producers whether in 
Lisgar-Marquette, Provencher or Brandon-Souris, important 
Manitoba ridings with grain producers.
<P>
	In conclusion, I encourage members to support the legislation 
and I thank those who support it. It offers significant 
opportunities for grain farmers to become more competitive. At 
the same time it retains appropriate means to protect the fair 
interests of grain producers should these interests be threatened.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the remarks of the hon. member. I have two questions 
on the many arguments he made.
<P>
	He said that the problem of the grain companies having 
difficulty setting tariffs for new services was now to be resolved 
by simply not having them report these services to the grain 
commission and that it would be completely deregulated. I 
wonder if he would give the House some idea of what the new 
services might be that would require charges that are not being 
made now.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6495"> 6495 </A></B>
<P>
	The second matter that got my attention was his argument that 
unlike at the turn of the century grain companies are now quite 
scrupulous in their dealings with their customers and their farm 
deliverers. I remind him that a number of grain companies 
operate internationally. Those operating in both Canada and the 
United States, as an example, each year have been found to be 
shorting customers on weight, delivering the wrong grades, 
shorting farmers on payments and so on.
<P>
	His faith in the modern day elevator company is really one of 
having faith in a very good policeman, namely the Canadian 
Grain Commission which will be backing off and not be 
patrolling the neighbourhood so fully. Many grain companies 
may find it much easier to revert to the practices they engage in 
outside Canada as soon as the grain commission backs off. 
Would the member comment on those two items?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Iftody:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for those 
helpful comments.
<P>
	I would like to respond as quickly as I can to the second one 
first. On his question of companies shortchanging producers, I 
do not have any facts to that effect. I have never seen any 
documents or heard any representations from farmers in 
Provencher in support of those rather surprising statements.
<P>
	I refer the hon. member to a phone call I made this morning to 
the Manitoba Pool Elevator. I asked: ``How many members do 
you have? What kind of support do you have in Manitoba?'' 
They have 18,000 members. I assure the hon. member that I have 
faith in the good judgment of those members to make decisions 
and to keep an eye on those institutions which respect their best 
interests.
<P>
	In terms of the service charges I would say the same. In terms 
of new service charges and outcomes from these policy changes 
which will be reviewed in two years, I believe the members will 
have that input. I assure the hon. member we will not allow grain 
companies to run away unchecked, at a complete arm's length 
from their producers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am wondering if the hon. member for Provencher 
would comment on the pools going toward public companies or 
corporations. UGG is finished with them. They are public 
corporations now. The shareholders do the voting and the 
directing.
<P>
	It is of interest to me that one director of the Manitoba pool 
was very upset that the Canadian Grain Commission lacked the 
support of an independent inquiry into the Winnipeg Grain 
Exchange, the commodity markets. The Canadian Grain 
Commission is supposed to regulate the commodity exchange. 
Why has the government not supported an independent inquiry 
into the operation of the commodity exchange?
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Iftody:</B> Madam Speaker, again, if there was a question of 
impropriety with respect to those responsible in either the 
handling of grain or trading in this commodity, I find these 
suggestions a bit surprising.
<P>
	I just want to say to the hon. member for Lisgar-Marquette 
that I am sure the crown and the minister represent the interests 
of farmers. If there is any impropriety or any evidence of it, if 
this member has received any facts or actual information to 
support that from this particular gentleman, I would be pleased 
to pass it on to the minister of agriculture and conduct an 
investigation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of Bill C-51. The purpose of Bill C-51 is to update and 
modernize the Canada Grain Act as outlined by the hon. minister 
of agriculture.
<P>
	These amendments will put more responsibility on the 
shoulders of the users of the grain system, the producers, the 
grain dealers and the elevator operators.
<P>
	We in the government know that we must learn where to 
regulate and where not to regulate. It is shown that in this bill we 
will regulate to improve the quality and protection of the 
producers, but we do not wish to regulate the exact pricing of 
services or in any way restrict the marketing of grain.
<P>
	Part of this legislation is designed to renew and enhance our 
commitment to a quality product. Canada has built a reputation 
as a supplier of consistent and uniform quality grains. This 
reputation has served us well in our marketing of grain around 
the world. Buyers expect top quality when dealing with 
Canadian grains. We should give them no less.
<P>
	The bill clearly defines the commission's role in setting 
grades and grade names as well as methods of determining such 
grades. This gives the commission the solid ground to actively 
improve the consistency of Canada's grain grades.
<P>
	The legislation also removes the requirement for the 
Canadian Grain Commission to set maximum elevator tariffs. 
This will allow market pricing of those services that the 
commission feels will benefit from market pressure. Also 
removed from legislation is the requirement that an elevator 
operator give the commission 14 days' notice of a change of 
tariffs. This will allow operators more flexibility in dealing with 
the changing pressures of the market.
<P>
	To address concerns about excessive charges, the Canadian 
Grain Commission will have the right to establish maximum 
tariffs by order for the next two years. If an investigation of a 
complaint from an elevator user finds that a particular tariff is 
not justified, the commission may set maximums. The Canadian 
Grain Commission also has the ability to set tariff maximums

<P>
through regulation if elevator operators set tariffs at excessive 
levels.
<P>
	The government notes as well that the majority of primary and 
terminal elevators are owned by the producers themselves 
through the various wheat pools. The government does not think 
it necessary to protect western grain farmers from themselves.
<P>
	The legislation improves protection to grain producers by 
authorizing the commission to require additional security from 
dealers and elevators as is determined by the commission. This 
ability improves the protection to the growers to help ensure that 
they will be paid for their produce.
<P>
	The legislation protects Canadian taxpayers from footing the 
bill when a grain dealer or elevator goes bankrupt and does not 
have enough security placed with the commission to cover 
amounts owed to producers. When the posted security is not 
enough to cover its debts, the creditors will be paid on a pro rata 
system, which is the fairest way of dealing with such a problem. 
The taxpayers of Canada should not be paying for the bad 
business practices of an operation.
<P>
	The legislation improves the Canada Grain Act provisions to 
facilitate the movement of grain interprovincially and for 
export. The amendments simplify the regulations governing the 
transport of grains. It removes regulations controlling transport 
of grains wholly within the western or eastern divisions. Public 
carriers are required when shipping grain between divisions and 
in or out of the country.
<P>
	I encourage our members to support this legislation. We wish 
to support our grain growers and facilitate the sale and 
disposition of their product. I think this legislation achieves that 
end.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is good to again be able to talk about 
agriculture here in the House. We are dealing with Bill C-51. It 
is a bill to deal with the Canadian Grain Commission and its 
powers.
<P>
	On the whole, Bill C-51 is a good starting point for improving 
the agriculture industry in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	Parts of the bill give me cause for concern. I will outline those 
areas in more detail later. There are some positive aspects to this 
legislation and I would like to briefly touch on them.
<P>
	First and perhaps more important, the bill places the onus on 
farmers to ensure that they are dealing with a duly licensed grain 
company. This bill makes it clear that the Canadian Grain 
Commission and therefore the Canadian taxpayer is only liable 
to cover claims from duly licensed companies.
<P>
	This protection lets farmers know exactly where they stand as 
well as protecting taxpayers from unreasonable expenses. 
Canadians have paid up in the past for claims coming from 
unlicensed companies and I am glad to see that this protection 
will be included in the act.
<P>
	There are those who would argue that the language in clause 
13 of this bill may still leave some doubt as to which claims are 
to be paid. Therefore I would encourage and support any 
strengthening of the wording during the committee stage that 
would ensure taxpayer protection from unlicensed claims.
<P>
	I had a case in my constituency prior to the election where a 
seed cleaning company ceased to do business and left many 
farmers out on a limb. It was a very messy situation. There were 
accusations of political involvement and patronage. Certainly 
we do not want to hear those horror stories repeated in the 
future.
<P>
	Clause 12 of the bill allows the Canadian Grain Commission 
some latitude when deciding whether or not to close an elevator 
having financial or cash flow difficulties. This is a positive step 
for farmers. Many have been caught by an insolvent elevator 
company or seed cleaning company in the past.
<P>
	The bill also provides for better financial protection for 
farmers by making them responsible for obtaining adequate 
security for grain shipped to an elevator and for ensuring that the 
grain name and amounts shipped is on the ticket.
<P>
	The bill brings the protection offered to farmers more in line 
with security provisions common in other financial areas. 
Farmers have long been saying that they do not want special 
treatment, they only want a fair shake the same as other small 
businessmen. This bill moves, however slightly, in that 
direction.
<P>
	Farmers will be pleased to see that there is some movement on 
the issue of interprovincial trade flexibility. Of course in good 
Liberal style, this is done as a half measure. The bill only allows 
for flexibility within the western wheat block and within the 
eastern wheat block. It does not go nearly far enough in 
removing interprovincial barriers to trade. Perhaps more 
important, the bill does not address the issue of trade with the 
United States at all, a bone of contention which the current 
Liberal government has not been prepared to deal with in a 
positive manner.
<P>
	The bill would solidify and enforce the use of common grade 
names. This too is welcome news for producers. There will be 
much less confusion about the quality of grain shipped to an 
elevator.
<P>
	As I stated at the outset of my remarks, the bill does have 
some positive aspects. However, there are some very serious 
problems with certain parts and clauses of the bill on some very 
important issues that are entirely ignored by this legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6497"> 6497 </A></B>
<P>
	In the bill an increasing amount of decision making is being 
placed in the hands of the governor in council. We are aware that 
this is a formalized constitutional body through which the 
cabinet exercises executive power.
<P>
	If members would study the bill they would see that clauses 2, 
4, 9, 15, 33 and 35 all move powers into the hands of the 
executive, into the hands of the cabinet. This extensive power 
grab on the part of the government directly contradicts the 
commitment to a more open and democratic government 
promised in the now infamous red ink book.
<P>
	In taking so much power away from the legislators and 
producers and giving it to cabinet to exercise in the form of 
orders in council, the government is doing the opposite of what 
farmers want. Agricultural producers have been consistent in 
saying that farming boards and institutions should be 
democratized and accountable. Moving more power and 
decision making behind closed doors and off the public record is 
continuing to be counter to the will of Canadian farmers.
<P>
	A good example of this power grab can be found in clause 34. 
This clause allows cabinet to approve and define all regulations 
not specifically contained in the act. This is tantamount to 
Parliament passing blank cheque legislation allowing the 
minister to fill in the blanks later.
<P>
	This seems to be a mindset of the Liberal government. Do not 
deal with the issues, allow the bureaucrats and the cabinet to 
make up the rules as they go. History teaches us that we get into 
trouble when we follow this procedure. We should learn lessons 
from the previous Tory government that authorized the 
establishment of a continental barley market through an order in 
council rather than bringing it to Parliament as it should have for 
a decision in the House that is elected by the people. Had 
Parliament been able to deal with that issue the matter would 
have been resolved one way or the other and producers would 
not be struggling and demanding a plebiscite and action on the 
part of the government at this date.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	The bill demonstrates once again that this minister of 
agriculture is a bureaucrats' minister, not a farmers' minister. 
Not only does cabinet take powers from Parliament but the 
bureaucracy also gets a whole raft of new authority.
<P>
	For example, the Canadian Grain Commission would now 
have the power to set the salaries of the western and eastern 
standards committees and the grain appeal tribunal. I would 
suggest it is not a common practice for bureaucrats to set their 
own salaries, at least it should not be. Not only do these people 
have the power to set their own pay but they also are often 
patronage appointments as well.
<P>
	The standards boards, while expensive and patronage filled, 
are only advisory. This means that the minister may ignore their 
recommendations in any case.
<P>
	It will be interesting to see how the salaries of these advisory 
patronage committees change as a result of this bill. Of course, I 
suppose they are watching what happens in this House where 
MPs set their own pay and pensions. Perhaps they are saying that 
if parliamentarians are going to play that game we want to play it 
and we demand to be able to play it as well.
<P>
	My concern is that one of these days Canadian taxpayers are 
going to start fighting back by saying that if MPs set their own 
salaries, if bureaucrats set their own pay, then perhaps we will 
decide how much we are going to pay in taxes whether the 
government demands it or not.
<P>
	It would seem in many ways the bill is designed to protect the 
bureaucratic empire from the changes that are coming to the 
industry. I want to refer for a few moments to the special crops 
or pulse crop initiative that is changing the way the industry 
operates, particularly in my province of Saskatchewan.
<P>
	As the minister knows many farmers have been diversifying 
crops over the past few years as a way of remaining viable and 
competitive. This diversification has been a boon to the 
agriculture industry. Many farmers have remained in a viable 
position because they have diversified and tried some 
non-traditional crops such as peas, lentils, canary seed, mustard 
seed, and many others. This industry has flourished and 
prospered without massive government intrusion, regulation 
and control. Perhaps it has prospered because of little 
government involvement. I know many farmers believe so.
<P>
	An example of a crop being developed and becoming a major 
staple in the prairies is canola which was an experiment a few 
decades ago. This year canola is one of the main cash crops in 
the prairie region and we believe-I know I believe and I am 
sure my Reform colleagues believe-that these other crops can 
be expanded and provide much income to producers if again 
government does not interfere and place too many regulations 
and restrictions in the way of development of these new 
commodities.
<P>
	Groups of farmers, in consultation with all the players in the 
industry from the pools, the wheat board, and everyone else 
have spent years developing pulse crop initiatives.
<P>
	The minister has had a copy of that initiative for quite some 
time and even so he has chosen not to include the speciality of 
pulse crops in this legislation. It is expected, and rumour has it, 
that some legislation dealing with these crops will be introduced 
a year or year and a half from now.
<P>
	In light of the enforcement provisions of Bill C-51, what does 
the minister expect will happen to this vital industry in the 
interim? A lack of legislation for special crops, combined with 
the witch hunt under way by the Canadian Grain Commission to 
licence and control the special seed cleaning and distribution 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6498"> 6498 </A></B>
<P>
sector will  potentially have a devastating effect on agriculture 
as a whole.
<P>
	With the provisions of Bill C-51 only to pay claims from duly 
licensed companies, the current push on the part of the Canadian 
Grain Commission to licence and audit pulse crop companies 
can only be interpreted as a move to push many of the small 
companies out of business. This would lead to a monopolized 
industry with the bureaucrats comfortably in control.
<P>
	The farmers want the pulse crop sector left the way it is. The 
customers want the sector left the way it is. Everyone wants a 
free market pulse crop sector, apparently that is everyone except 
senior agriculture mandarins.
<P>
	Because pulse crops are not grown in quantities comparable to 
grains such as wheat, barley or canola, the cleaners and handlers 
of these commodities are much smaller operations. The cost of 
Canadian Grain Commission licences, bonds, and audits can run 
anywhere from $20,000 to $30,000 every year. This would 
unnecessarily force most of the operators out of the specialty 
crops sector at a time when the sector should be expanding and 
should be strengthening.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	I am very concerned that this legislation does not adequately 
protect those operators and the producers who deal with them. It 
is a serious flaw in this bill. I am concerned that a wait of 12 to 
18 months or however long it takes the minister to bring in 
legislation to deal with that sector may be too late and drive 
many of them out of the industry.
<P>
	The absence of this pulse crop legislation makes Bill C-51 a 
farmers versus the bureaucrats bill with regard to pulse crops.
<P>
	I challenge the minister to show it ain't so. If he can do so, I 
would be one of the most pleased people in this House. I call on 
him to bring in the kind of legislation that works for farmers, not 
just measures that protect and enhance the jobs of his senior 
bureaucrats.
<P>
	Although this bill contains some very positive aspects it is 
legitimate to ask why the minister would introduce legislation 
that makes the government mandarins more comfortable and 
secure while making the farmers wait at least another year 
before moving on issues that they really care about.
<P>
	This bill is a good place to start but there is a lot of work that 
needs to be done at the committee level to make it good 
legislation.
<P>
	I would hope that the minister can solve his in house power 
struggle soon so that farmers can get some movement and 
government action on the issues they care about.
<P>
	It is quite interesting to note that in the life of this Parliament, 
now almost one year old, that not many steps or perhaps no steps 
have been taken by the minister or  his government to put 
producers in the driver's seat in their own industry.
<P>
	If there is one thing I know from being a producer it is that 
they are not afraid to take responsibility and they are not afraid 
to make decisions and by and large they make very good 
decisions. Often it is government through order in council 
decisions, through legislation that is incomplete such as Bill 
C-51 that has been a hindrance to the industry rather than an 
asset.
<P>
	I encourage the minister to review his legislation with a view 
to seeing what he can do to put producers in charge of their own 
industry so that they can be adequately able to make decisions, 
to take steps to strengthen their industry without being hindered 
by the government that is supposed to represent and serve them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Madam Speaker, I welcome 
the opportunity to speak on Bill C-51, amendments to the 
Canada Grain Act.
<P>
	It is important at the beginning to put into perspective the role 
that the Canadian Grain Commission has played in terms of 
Canada being seen as the reliable supplier of high quality grains 
in the world.
<P>
	The combination of the Canadian Wheat Board as the single 
desk selling agency for export wheat and barley and the quality 
control and inspection system and watchdog capacity of the 
Canadian Grain Commission has worked extremely well in 
Canada's interests and in the interests of Canada's primary grain 
producers.
<P>
	The key selling point for grains out of Canada in the 
international marketplace has been certainly our quality control 
system. Millers around the world know that when they buy 
Canadian wheat they are going to get high quality grains that 
they can blend in with other countries' products and still have a 
reasonable quality of bread.
<P>
	The Americans, on the other hand, the system that some of our 
colleagues in this House on the other side want to emulate, are 
looked upon by the world as a residual supplier of grain. They 
are used in terms of setting the price worldwide but they are a 
residual supplier, a supplier of last resort because they do not 
have the quality control system that we have in this country that 
is made possible because of some of the regulations of the 
Canadian Grain Commission that we have in this country.
<P>
	This bill's objective is to maintain that support for quality 
grades and inspection. However, we have to be constantly aware 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6499"> 6499 </A></B>
<P>
of the danger in terms of our legislative processes of knuckling 
under to those who believe that cost cutting should be all that 
matters.
<P>
	The principal concern of the federal government on this issue 
of inspection and quality control are two elements key to the 
security of our export markets, quality and inspection.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	When appearing before the agricultural committee, Dennis 
Wallace, executive director of the commission made the 
following comment: ``We are looking at streamlining, weighing 
and inspection that will move at the pace the industry sets and 
our comfort that we can sustain the standard of quality in the 
process. In our view quality has not been affected by the steps 
we have taken to this point''. That is an important point.
<P>
	We must ensure on this side of the House and as the 
government that we maintain those standards that have been so 
true and beneficial to the Canadian grain industry.
<P>
	I had hoped that I would have time to indicate to the House 
some of the dangers within the system because several of the 
groups that have come before the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture, the Public Service Alliance of Canada for one, 
outlined some of the problems that have happened at Thunder 
Bay. They provide a good example of the dangers that can 
happen to quality control in the grain system if we do not have a 
strong, dedicated agency like the Canadian Grain Commission 
with strong regulations behind it to protect the interests of 
producers and the interests of the grain industry.
<P>
	I do not have time to quote that evidence but I would refer 
members of the House to the April 26, 1994 submission of the 
Public Service Alliance outlining some of the dangers of quality 
control.
<P>
	We must ensure as a government that the security of a 
regulatory and inspection system is maintained, that the future 
of either downsizing or efforts to promote competitiveness do 
not result in a loss of our competitive position which is based 
upon production and exports of the highest quality standards of 
grain in the world.
<P>
	There has been a lot of talk by members on both sides of this 
House on the questions regarding clause 14. Under clause 14 the 
Canadian Grain Commission will no longer be required to set 
maximum tariffs charged by grain elevators.
<P>
	This is a point that, to be honest, is open to question for me. 
We will certainly have an interesting debate at the agricultural 
committee on this point. There are a number of questions that 
need to be raised.
<P>
	I do not believe for a moment that we can depend on the 
co-operative movement or the pools to protect producers' 
interests. I have been involved in that industry out west for a 
number of years and the co-operative movement, the pools, 
when they are making decisions in the kind of international 
arena we now face have to weigh in their own minds whether 
they are making a decision in terms of their corporate business 
interests and the bottom line as a corporation or making a 
decision in  their membership's interests as a co-operative. 
Therefore, I believe there need to be some government 
safeguards in terms of protecting primary producers' interests, 
and certainly we will debate that at committee level.
<P>
	Other questions need to be raised. Some clarification is 
needed of the ombudsman like role the commission will 
perform. Under what circumstances will it be able to intervene, 
what powers will the commission have to act upon complaints, 
and under what authority? Under what circumstances will the 
commission be able to set maximum tariffs by regulation if 
needed?
<P>
	An important point in the bill and one I strongly support is 
that if there is a danger there the Canadian Grain Commission 
can step in and impose maximum tariffs if the grain industries, 
the companies or the trade is abusing the system set in place.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	I raise those points because I think this is the place, the House 
of Commons, in this arena and at the committee level, for good, 
strong, informed debate on the facts so that we can come up with 
better decisions in the end.
<P>
	I recognize that my time is getting short. I have heard from 
members opposite talking about competition. We have to look at 
that infrastructure in western Canada where the Canadian Grain 
Commission operates and recognize that more and more in those 
small community towns with elevators that there is less and less 
competition between grain companies.
<P>
	Grain companies are now consolidating their system. Because 
you are going to gain a lower tariff rate at one elevator does not 
necessarily mean that you are going to haul to that elevator 
because it may be 50 or 100 miles away and you would lose all 
you had saved or more by hauling that distance.
<P>
	We have to be very careful in making these decisions to ensure 
the kind of international arena we are entering into, the kind of 
consolidation that is happening, especially in western Canada, 
and the impact that may have on primary producers if there is 
not a very strong Canadian Grain Commission in place to protect 
the interests of primary producers and the interests of the 
country in terms of the grains we sell.
<P>
	Let me conclude by saying that the Canadian Wheat Board 
and the Canadian Grain Commission have served this country 
well in the past. I believe they can in the future. I look forward to 
maintaining those kinds of standards and see that Canada 
remains the kind of reliable supplier of grains that we have been 
in the past.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I must thank the hon. member for that speech. I do 
agree with him once in a while on certain areas.
<P>
	I know he is a very good and efficient operator and does 
probably employ people and pay their wages. Does he not think 
that when I as a farmer pay 92 per cent of the grain commission's 
wages I should have some input into who these people are? I 
would feel a lot more comfortable if I as a farmer had some input 
into who these people were and how they were working. The 
people employed on an operation are really the backbone of the 
operation because management depends on them. I wonder 
whether the hon. member would respond to that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Madam Speaker, I did have some figures. I 
believe you are correct, Mr. Hoeppner, in the figure you indicate 
in terms of how much-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> May I remind the hon. 
member that we do not address members as mister, we use the 
riding, which is Lisgar-Marquette.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> My apologies, Madam Speaker. I believe the 
figures by the hon. member are correct. Members opposite often 
talk about user pay on that side of the House. Canadian society 
as a whole gains from many of these institutions, the Canadian 
Grain Commission, some of our inspection standards in the meat 
and horticultural industries as well. I do not believe producers 
should pay the full shot.
<P>
	To the member opposite, in terms of farmers having a say in 
the Canadian Grain Commission, they do through their primary 
producers as well as through the Canadian Wheat Board 
Advisory Committee which is an elected body in 11 districts in 
western Canada. They advise the wheat board, they should 
advise and I am certain they do, at least the ones I talk to, advise 
the minister in all matters related to grain including this issue in 
terms of grades, standards and regulatory controls.
<P>
	There is input at the moment through the Canadian Wheat 
Board Advisory Committee and through members elected in this 
House directly to the minister who is responsible for the 
Canadian Grain Commission.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFEXTERNALAFFAIRSACT">DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (for the Minister of Foreign Affairs)</B> 
moved that Bill C-47, an act to amend the Department of  
External Affairs Act and to make related amendments to other 
acts, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to 
rise today in support of Bill C-47, an act to amend the 
Department of External Affairs Act.
<P>
	Our government made a commitment when we were sworn 
into office to change the name of the Department of External 
Affairs to the Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade. This change in title is a recognition of the changes of the 
department's mandate that have occurred over the 85 years since 
its inception.
<P>
	The Department of External Affairs was created in 1909 by 
Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier to conduct Canada's foreign 
policy. Since then the mission of the department has adapted to 
reflect Canada's growing role on the international stage.
<P>
	During World War I for example, Canada played an important 
role internationally as part of the allied forces and a member of 
the imperial war cabinet. By the end of the war, Canada was 
emerging as a fully independent nation. This maturation was 
reflected in changes to the fledgling department.
<P>
	In the 1920s under the leadership of Dr. O. D. Skelton, the 
Under-Secretary of State for External Affairs, and Counsellor 
Loring Christie, the department began to evolve into its current 
structure and the Canadian diplomatic corps was formed.
<P>
	The second world war contributed further to the growth of the 
department. Canada became an active world player. We were a 
founding member of the United Nations and a full participant in 
such other international organizations as the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization, NATO; the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade, GATT; the International Monetary Fund, the World 
Bank and, of course, the Commonwealth.
<P>
	In more recent years, Canada has steadily increased its role in 
world affairs and joined additional organizations such as the 
G-7, the group of seven major industrialized nations, La 
Francophonie, and the Organization of American States, the 
OAS.
<P>
	The department contributes significantly to this role, 
fulfilling its mission to portray, promote and defend the 
interests of Canada, to improve Canadians' awareness and 
understanding of the world and to serve Canadians at home and 
abroad.
<P>
	Bill C-47 will amend the External Affairs Act to change the 
legal name of the department and the titles of its ministers and 
senior officials. Under this act, the Secretary of State for 
External Affairs becomes the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The 
title of the Minister for International Trade remains unchanged. 
The title of the junior minister, the Minister for External 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6501"> 6501 </A></B>
<P>
Relations, will change to become the Minister for International 
Co-operation.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	Senior official titles currently including the term 
under-secretary will reflect ministerial changes, thus the 
Under-Secretary of State for External Affairs will become the 
Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, referred to as the DM for 
foreign affairs.
<P>
	Bill C-47 makes no substantive changes to the structure of the 
department. Rather the change in name affected by this 
legislation reflects the current mandate of the department.
<P>
	I would like to add a few words about the roles of the two new 
positions not written into the act but important to the 
development of Canadian foreign policy. These are the positions 
of Secretary of State for Latin America and Africa, and I see the 
secretary of state listening very attentively to what I am saying, 
and of course the Secretary of State for Asia Pacific.
<P>
	The secretaries of state have proven to be invaluable 
contributors to Canada's foreign policy. They travel and meet 
widely with leaders in many countries where Canadian foreign 
policy interests are being pursued. I know how active they are in 
liaising with the diplomatic corps here in Canada. They 
complement the work of the minister very effectively.
<P>
	Let us not forget the role of the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, a position also not incorporated in 
this act but a very important role to represent the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs in his absence when he is out representing 
Canada in his many, many duties. I know personally what a 
heavy role that minister plays. Therefore the roles of secretaries 
of state and parliamentary secretary are very helpful to the 
minister and to the department.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To conclude, I say that the object of the bill is very clear. It is 
simply to make sure that our presence abroad and in 
international organizations reflects today's reality.
<P>
	In our history, we went from colony to dominion and finally 
independent nation. The new title of Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade makes this evolution official.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak on Bill C-47, an Act to amend the Department 
of External Affairs Act and to make related amendments to other 
Acts.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate my 
colleague, the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, for his excellent remarks. As he pointed out, the 
purpose of Bill C-47 is to change the name of the department 
from the Department of External Affairs and International Trade 
to the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. In 
fact, the purpose of the Bill is to update the name of the 
department and of some of its officers with respect to the 
existing administrative structure.
<P>
	With your permission, I would like to recall a number of 
historic reasons for making what we feel is an appropriate 
change of name.
<P>
	From 1867 to 1909, Great Britain retained overall 
responsibility for Canada's external relations, and it was Great 
Britain, as it were, that declared war on behalf of Canada in 
1914, as Canada did not have its own ambassadors at that time.
<P>
	In 1909, as the parliamentary secretary pointed out, Canada's 
own Department of External Affairs was created. It was headed 
by a secretary of state for external affairs, a position that had 
already been created in 1868. But actually, the prime minister 
continued to be largely responsible for this department. It is 
interesting to note, incidentally, that when it was created the 
department had five employees and, in 1911, no more than 15.
<P>
	On April 1, 1912, the Department of External Affairs was 
placed under the direct jurisdiction of the prime minister; it 
concerned itself essentially with the Canadian government's 
relations with other dominions of the British Crown, whence the 
use of the term ``external'' to describe something that was not 
completely foreign. And this is the term that has remained.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Just before the outbreak of World War I, Canada was 
represented abroad, outside British dominions, by one office in 
Washington, with a staff of nine, one high commission in 
London, with a staff of eleven, and one general commission in 
Paris, with a staff of eight.
<P>
	After the war, Canada's international status gained 
recognition through battle exploits of Canadian troops at Vimy 
for example. In 1923, Canada signed its first treaty as an 
independent state, the Halibut Treaty, and sent diplomatic 
representatives abroad. In 1931, as we know, Canada officially 
became an independent state under the Treaty of Westminster, 
which conferred complete independence to Canada.
<P>
	The 1935-39 period is considered as a period of growth for 
the Canadian foreign service and one during which several 
countries established diplomatic representation here in Ottawa. 
In 1939, it is as an independent state that Canada declared war 
upon Germany and other Axis powers.
<P>
	The foreign policy of Canada, one of the founding members of 
the United Nations, enjoyed new growth after the Second World 
War, particularly in 1946, with the appointment of the first truly 
independent secretary of State, and the passage of the Canadian 
Department of External Affairs Act. The same legislation is still 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6502"> 6502 </A></B>
<P>
in effect today, except for minor amendments made from time to 
time since then.
<P>
	During the 1960s, efforts started to be made to bring the 
various programs relating to trade and commerce under the 
purview of External Affairs. In 1983, the position of Minister 
for International Trade was created as well as that of Minister 
for External Relations. Over the years, various programs such as 
that of the export market development board came under the 
jurisdiction of the Department of External Affairs, while others, 
like that of the Grain Marketing Office, were transferred to other 
departments.
<P>
	Today, we have before us in this House Bill C-47, a bill 
which, as I mentioned earlier, changes the name of the 
Department of External Affairs for that of Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade.
<P>
	As we speak, the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade employs over 4,000 Canadians and nearly 
5,000 locally-engaged staff around the world. Thinking back to 
the rather modest beginnings of the department that I described 
earlier, we can see that it has come a long way.
<P>
	Naturally, we intend to support this bill because, as the hon. 
parliamentary indicated, we believe the time has come to update 
the name of this department because, in its present form, it 
evokes the dominion status Canada had for so many years. The 
wish could also be expressed to see the government go ahead and 
eliminate the last traces of this colonial era by abolishing 
plainly and simply the other place, an institution which is a 
glaring anachronism and does not suit the Canadian reality at 
all. The government of Canada could also have used this 
opportunity to make progress on the political and constitutional 
status of Canada.
<P>
	I think that this bill is also appropriate, given the foreign 
policy review aimed at updating Canada's present one. We, 
however, have three reservations about this bill which are far 
from trivial, to say the least.
<P>
	First of all, we deplore the fact that the minister did not take 
this opportunity to put some order into all the positions that have 
not been filled since the Liberals came to office. I am referring 
specifically to clauses 4, 8(2) and 9 of the bill, under which the 
government may appoint-again, since the Liberals came to 
office, and even before in some cases-a Minister for 
International Co-operation, Associate Deputy Ministers as well 
as a Co-ordinator, International Economic Relations when these 
positions are vacant.
<P>
	In fact, the positions that remain unfilled would allow the 
government to distribute them as it sees fit. If these positions are 
useless, they should simply be abolished. Such is the case with 
the position of Minister for International Co-operation, 
formerly the Minister for External Relations, which is now 
vacant. If the government does not find any use for it, it should 
simply abolish it instead of putting it aside for highly partisan 
appointments.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	We also think that CIDA, whose mandate is rather vague, 
should have its own constituent act governing its activities as an 
independent body. Such an act would give the minister 
responsible for CIDA a clear and unequivocal mandate. It 
would, of course, also prevent financial and human resources 
from being wasted.
<P>
	My third reservation concerns clause 7, subsection (3). If I 
may, Mr. Speaker, I will now read this clause: ``The Minister 
may develop and carry out programs related to his powers, 
duties and functions for the promotion of Canada's interests 
abroad, including the fostering of the expansion of Canada's 
international trade and commerce and the provision of 
assistance for developing countries''. We think it is 
inappropriate for the minister to link Canada's commercial 
interests with development assistance so explicitly and so 
directly in the same clause.
<P>
	We recognize, of course, that development assistance 
provided by Canada works in favour of Canada's political 
interests at the international level. But keeping development 
assistance together with international trade in the same clause 
can be confusing and suggest that the government again intends 
to continue to favour tied aid. In this regard, I think that we 
cannot allow these two items to be together in the same clause of 
the bill.
<P>
	In conclusion, of course we will support this bill, bearing in 
mind that we have these three very serious reservations which 
we would like the government to take into consideration in the 
process leading to the adoption of this bill. As I just said, this 
bill is part of a historical process which unfortunately has taken 
too many years.
<P>
	I think it was high time for the Canadian government to 
update the name of the Department of External Affairs and the 
Department of International Trade to make it a real Department 
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. Unfortunately, as I 
just said when I was talking about our reservations, we regret 
that the minister did not take this opportunity to make some 
adjustments that would have made the department even more up 
to date.
<P>
	I think that the goal which the government is pursuing with 
this bill is bringing this department up to date. So it is rather 
disturbing and surprising to see that the government wants to 
keep in this bill some positions of questionable usefulness, 
given that they are still vacant even as we speak.
<P>
	I end my remarks here. We will certainly have the opportunity 
to talk about them again in subsequent debates.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the 
Reform Party's international trade critic it is a pleasure for me to 
speak today on Bill C-47 and its implications for a modernized 
and revitalized Department of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	This bill does not make any huge changes. It changes the name 
of the Department of External Affairs to the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade and it changes the titles 
of ministers and the deputy ministers to reflect the new name of 
the department.
<P>
	I suppose the name change is intended to ensure that the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade reflects 
the needs and values of Canadians in the 1990s. However I 
wonder whether changing the name of the department is 
necessary and whether the cost of doing so can be justified. I 
know that printing 4,000 new sets of business cards and redoing 
all the stationery does not amount to a monumental cost in the 
larger scheme of things, but the taxpayer expects a new standard 
of efficiency in government and this does seem to be frivolous.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	The Department of External Affairs has operated for some 10 
years with international trade as one of its components. It is 
suddenly necessary to add the long phrase of international trade 
to the name of the department. Why is this?
<P>
	Why after so many years of operating just fine as external 
affairs do we now need the title of foreign affairs and 
international trade? What if in its wisdom some future 
government decides to move the international trade component 
back to the industry department? What if one day a crown 
corporation is formed to take over the trade promotion? What if 
that function is privatized altogether? Do we then have to go 
through this exercise all over again?
<P>
	Changing the way trade promotion is handled is not 
inconceivable. Just this morning the <I>Globe and Mail</I> carried an 
article stating that a group of business people says Ottawa could 
save nearly $117 million a year by concentrating its trade 
promotion efforts on smaller companies ending duplication and 
tying trade to aid. The article goes on to quote the chairman of 
the International Business Development Review to say that it 
would require courageous decisions to wean business off trade 
support initiatives but the federal government would be 
surprised by the positive response from an overtaxed 
population. I encourage the minister to look at these options and 
explore this further.
<P>
	Let us talk a bit about what Canadians do want from their 
department of foreign affairs as it is now going to be known. The 
foreign policy joint review committee heard many 
representations from Canadians. The resulting report will guide 
the department to restructure as necessary and to address those 
concerns and set Canada's future foreign policy.
<P>
	Specifically Canadians told us of the need to restructure 
CIDA and to make it more accountable and more focused in its 
approach to development assistance. They told us of the need to 
more clearly define the criteria for Canada's participation in 
future peacekeeping operations. They told us that 
non-government agencies, NGOs, can play a larger role in 
Canada's foreign aid delivery and development. They told us 
that the need for Canada is to aggressively seek to develop the 
fast growing Asia-Pacific area for trade. There were many other 
suggestions and recommendations but we will have to wait for 
the report to hear them all.
<P>
	We know for certain however that Canadians want economic 
security and that over two million Canadians depend on 
international trade for their jobs. For every $1 billion in new 
exports 11,000 new jobs will be created. Therefore the 
Department of Foreign Affairs must do its utmost to make sure 
that Canadian business succeeds in the international 
marketplace.
<P>
	In 1993 Canada exported $181 billion worth of goods and 
services totalling 30 per cent of our GDP. To see this number 
increase Reform would like to see Canada be a strong advocate 
for free trade or freer trade worldwide. We have made some 
important steps in this direction and I give this government 
credit for that.
<P>
	One of the most important vehicles for this will be the world 
trade organization which will soon be in place as a result of the 
GATT negotiations. It is vital that Canada help this organization 
to be successful. Canada must take a leadership role in the new 
WTO in making this rules based organization work. We must 
continue to strive for further trade liberalization in the second 
round of negotiations in agriculture at the GATT or WTO in six 
years time. Canada must actively pursue new free trade 
agreements which could enhance our international trade 
position.
<P>
	Of special interest to Canada would be the rapid and 
successful expansion of NAFTA. When reviewing potential new 
members Canada should encourage our current partners, the 
U.S. and Mexico, not to drag their feet in these negotiations. In 
the long term the expansion of NAFTA will help us all. Canada 
is a trading nation. We need to develop this further.
<P>
	Of principal interest to Canada however will always be our 
trading relationship with the United States which currently 
accounts for about 75 to 80 per cent of Canada's two way trade. 
This strong relationship with the United States has allowed 
Canada to become the seventh largest trading nation in the 
world, even though we are only 31st in terms of population size.
<P>
	While Canada must always strive to diversify in the area of 
trade so that we do not remain dependent on our neighbour to the 
south for our prosperity, we must recognize that the Canada--
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6504"> 6504 </A></B>
<P>
U.S. trade relationship is something which needs to be 
encouraged and promoted to the fullest.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	Beyond nurturing our trade relationship with the United 
States, the Department of Foreign Affairs must always strive to 
carve out new markets for Canadian international trade. Its job 
is to tap into emerging growth markets throughout the world and 
make sure Canadian business can get its foot in the door and go 
on to develop a comparative advantage over our competitors.
<P>
	One of the most exciting new growth markets for Canadian 
trade, as I have said, is the Pacific rim which within five years 
could represent 40 per cent of total global consumption of 
exports. Obviously the Department of Foreign Affairs should do 
its utmost to make sure that Canada remains an active and 
successful player in the region.
<P>
	To date we have had some success. Japan is already our 
second biggest trading partner and purchases more Canadian 
exports than the U.K., Germany and France combined. In 
addition, China has the fastest growing economy in the world. 
With its huge population it is predicted that by early in the next 
century China could be the second largest economy in the world.
<P>
	As has already been mentioned, Canada has a significant 
stake in expanding trade within our hemisphere, preferably 
through the NAFTA. It has already given Canada unprecedented 
and preferential access to Mexico's growing market of over 85 
million consumers. Other countries such as Chile have 
demonstrated a very real desire to join this agreement. Canada 
must ensure that we are a leader in the area of NAFTA accession 
otherwise the Americans will take this leadership role and will 
dominate the agenda and look after their own trade interests.
<P>
	The Department of Foreign Affairs should make sure 
Canadians remain well represented by acting as a leading force 
in defending Canadian interests and values. In order to 
successfully fulfil this task, foreign affairs should seriously 
consider reallocating its resources in order to optimize this 
important trade promotion task. This will require some tough 
decisions, including the withdrawal of resources from regions 
that do not represent growth markets for Canadian trade. Also in 
these countries where we have primary diplomatic and consular 
missions we should investigate cost cutting measures.
<P>
	Our dealings with other countries of course must be on many 
levels and not just on those involving trade. Canada has a very 
special role to play in the area of international affairs because of 
our proud tradition of acting as an honest broker for dispute 
resolution and effective multinationalism. Canada must build 
upon this tradition and promote our position as a respected and 
effective middle power. With our capabilities, record of 
innovation and energetic use of diplomacy, many countries 
expect a special contribution from Canada in the area of 
international affairs. We should be proud to provide this service.
<P>
	While Canadians will always want us to promote this positive 
middle power image, they also want us to live within our means. 
Therefore, Canada must aim for a foreign policy which is 
proactive, effective and fiscally responsible. This means that we 
must get our own fiscal house in order. We must concentrate on 
reducing internal trade barriers and generally reduce the cost of 
doing business here at home so that our companies can be more 
competitive in the world marketplace.
<P>
	Whether acting as a catalyst for positive international change, 
a facilitator working to bring parties to an agreement, or 
mediators to defuse international conflict, the Department of 
Foreign Affairs must also strive to be a world leader in 
everything it does.
<P>
	One area where Canada is already a leader is in our dealings 
with the United Nations which turns 50 years old this year. 
Improving the success of the UN is an important task for 
Canada. There are many ways to improve and overhaul it in the 
21st century. I suggest there are several areas Canada should be 
looking at which would improve the efficiency, accountability 
and effectiveness of the United Nations.
<P>
	First, rules that force countries to pay their UN dues must be 
enforced. Otherwise the UN will always be ineffective and all 
other reform will go for naught.
<P>
	Second, the newly appointed UN inspector general must be 
given a wide mandate to rein in overspending, duplication and 
waste.
<P>
	Third, an early warning system should be set up to pre-empt 
disastrous international conflicts and environmental 
degradation.
<P>
	Fourth, an international court should be established through 
the UN to punish international criminals who currently use 
national borders and weak international co-ordination to avoid 
being punished.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Fifth, the structure of the UN Security Council and the veto 
powers of its permanent membership should be reviewed. 
During the review Canada should be considered for permanent 
membership because of its longstanding service and dedication 
to the United Nations and peacekeeping.
<P>
	For any of these reforms to work it is necessary that the 
Department of Foreign Affairs play an effective role both behind 
the scenes and by publicly setting the agenda for change.
<P>
	In conclusion, while the Reform Party was elected on a 
domestic agenda we realize we must be able to present a credible 
foreign policy and develop a good working relationship with the 
Department of Foreign Affairs. I would therefore like to express 
my support for the bill, not as a housekeeping measure to be 
dealt with quickly but as a sign of a new dynamic and efficient 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6505"> 6505 </A></B>
<P>
Department of Foreign Affairs. There will be support for 
Canadian interests and values into the next century.
<P>
	While the Reform will have plenty more to say in the area of 
foreign policy in the coming session, I hope I have illustrated 
some of the points we think are important for the department.

	The House resumed from September 30 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-52, an act to establish the Department of 
Public Works and Government Services and to amend and repeal 
certain acts, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak on 
Bill C-52, known as the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services Act. It serves the purpose of bringing 
together or consolidating four former common service agencies 
of the federal government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
These are the former departments of Public Works and Supply 
and Services, as well as the Government Telecommunications 
Agency.
<P>
	The new department will play an essential role in that it will 
allow the federal government to effectively increase the 
efficiency of its operations. This grouping of important services 
under a single authority with consistent policies and a 
co-ordinated long-term approach will allow us to provide better 
service to the federal administration as a whole and, 
consequently, to Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	The government is firmly committed to offer all Canadians a 
fair, efficient, innovative and accessible administration.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians are aware that overlap, duplication and poor 
co-ordination have contributed to the tax burden they must all 
bear. Canadians expect and demand that we take every measure 
possible to streamline our operations, reduce administrative 
costs, cut out red tape and improve our service delivery in 
implementing government programs.
<P>
	The creation of a new Department of Public Works and 
Government Services responds directly to that challenge. It will 
provide more effectively than ever  before a central focus for the 
provision of a wide range of services that contribute in a vital 
way to the efficient operation of some 150 government 
departments and agencies.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is not to table new policies but to set 
up a structure which, thanks to the synergy and dynamics 
generated by the new organization, will help us streamline 
government services to Canadians and improve their 
effectiveness.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The new department is a major service element of the federal 
government. At the time of amalgamation it was comprised of 
18,000 employees based in 200 locations across Canada and 
with an annual budget of approximately $4 billion. The range of 
services is extensive, including providing telecommunications 
and professional and technical informatic services to 
departments and agencies; acting as the chief contracting agent 
of the federal government; ensuring value for money through a 
procurement process that is open, fair and competitive; issuing 
some 200 million payments annually by cheque and direct 
deposit as part of the receiver general's responsibility; giving 
the government a full range of communication services, 
including publication of thousands of titles annually; providing 
consulting and auditing services on a fee for service basis; 
handling most of the architectural and engineering services 
needed by the government as well as providing a wide variety of 
realty services; and, my personal favourite, providing 
translation services for the Parliament and the public service for 
which we in the House are grateful. It also provides for the 
disposal and sale of crown assets. These are just the highlights 
of the many and varied services offered and provided by the 
department.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	To fulfil its mandate effectively, Public Works and 
Government Services has to establish close and productive 
working relationships with a number of varied interests, most 
notably those who do business with the Government of Canada, 
the many departments and agencies of government that depend 
on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6506"> 6506 </A></B>
<P>
Public Works and Government Services for its services, and the 
Canadian public that wants and expects fast efficient delivery of 
government services.
<P>
	We must remember the federal government is by far the 
largest purchaser of goods and services in the country. Annual 
federal procurement, exclusive of crown corporations, is in the 
order of $16 billion. Public Works and Government Services is 
responsible for the orderly processing of about 65 per cent of the 
total or $10 billion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There is no doubt that this more global approach regarding 
government procurement will benefit all Canadians concerned.
<P>
	Indeed, it will allow us to implement better co-ordinated and 
standardized methods and policies, to use state-of-the-art 
technologies enabling us to streamline existing procedures, and 
to give eventual suppliers a more precise idea of who they are 
dealing with.
<P>
	Initial reaction to this amalgamation process has been 
positive. It will be even more so once legislation is passed and 
the new department's structure is farther advanced.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our government has stressed again and again that the 
operations of government must be responsive and geared to 
action and results rather than to the bureaucratic process to 
which some members on the opposite side often refer.
<P>
	This is very true of the central services provided by the new 
department. I believe it will be better equipped to develop 
stronger, more responsive relationships with its client 
departments in its new formation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Direct benefits of this amalgamation, for the government but 
particularly taxpayers, are quite remarkable. Already, 
overlapping, which the Bloc Quebecois constantly talks about, 
and duplication have been significantly reduced everywhere in 
the department, and the streamlining of operations is well 
underway.
<P>
	Taking into account operational reviews and related 
recommendations, as well as the new systems to be 
implemented and the amalgamation itself, the estimated savings 
over five years should total approximately $180 million.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The overall staff requirement will be reduced by more than 20 
per cent, from 18,000 at the time of amalgamation to about 
14,000 at century's end. Specifically the administrative services 
of the component groups in the new departments have already 
been consolidated and this will result in savings of some 500 full 
time positions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to point out that all these savings will be made by 
eliminating duplication, streamlining systems and making 
increased use of state-of-the-art technologies such as 
infometrics.
<P>
	I can assure you that these savings will in no way diminish the 
quality of service currently provided to the department's clients 
and to Canadians in general.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Regardless of the structure of joint services, efficiency will 
always be the key to success. In that regard, we must reduce 
overlapping and duplication everywhere in government 
operations and we must become a centre of excellence striving 
to develop new methods and technologies to deliver services.
<P>
	The net result will be savings to taxpayers, a one-stop service 
centre for existing departments, a special expertise accessible 
from anywhere within the government, a single-window service 
for suppliers and entrepreneurs dealing with the 
government-this single-window concept is important, because 
that is all the opposition talks about these days-and, more 
importantly, an improved ability on the government's part to 
serve Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the current climate of fiscal restraint the pursuit of 
efficiency and economy in government operations is clearly not 
a luxury. It is an absolute necessity. Bill C-52 which will 
integrate the majority of all common services into one 
department will help us operate more efficiently and deliver the 
best we can to our clients.
<P>
	I hope all members will join me and this side of the House in 
supporting this innovative legislation. Much has already been 
achieved, and with the passage of the bill we could move 
forward with confidence in further streamlining and improving 
the operations of the federal government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérald Asselin (Charlevoix):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity today to speak on Bill C-52. Perhaps I 
may mention that during my 14 years as a municipal councillor 
in Baie-Comeau, I was Chairman of the Public Works 
Commission.
<P>
	The responsibilities of a municipal councillor are similar to 
those of a member in this House. A councillor is expected to 
administer taxpayers' money, and the same applies in the 
federal government. Members of this House have to make sure 
that government revenues raised through taxes are properly 
administered, in the name of openness.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6507"> 6507 </A></B>
<P>
	Increasingly, politicians are losing their credibility, and they 
are finding it harder to field questions from their constituents 
about contracting out, privatization, transparency and a host of 
similar questions.
<P>
	In my speech I intend to discuss Bill C-52, but mainly as it 
concerns contracting out, privatization and how the government 
should take advantage of this opportunity. Bill C-52 is an Act to 
establish the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services, which will also include communications and 
translation.
<P>
	In fact, this legislation goes back to the 1870s, and it does not 
give the government or the minister any additional powers. 
However, we in the Bloc Quebecois would have expected this 
bill to give the minister additional monitoring and 
administrative powers, and that the Liberal government, as it 
promised in the red book, should at least have tried to provide 
some transparency in this bill by legislating structured 
parameters for administration and control, thus enabling it to 
make future decisions based on the principle of openness and a 
clear knowledge of the facts.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	As the old saying goes, if you want something done, you are 
better off doing it yourself. I wish the government would tell us 
how much it saves by contracting out, and by privatizing federal 
services. If the past is any indication, I think there is some cause 
for concern about the future, when we consider the disgusting 
case of Pearson Airport, the only profitable federal airport in 
Canada.
<P>
	Of course, the federal government wants to get rid of some of 
its facilities that no longer make a profit, mainly in Quebec. 
However, if the federal government cannot turn a profit with 
them, it is doubtful whether municipalities, regional 
municipalities or regional economic partners would be more 
successful.
<P>
	There are plenty of federal facilities in my riding. We have 
airports in Baie-Comeau, Forestville and Charlevoix. There are 
about 20 federal wharfs in my riding. Some wharfs are still 
operational, but many have been declared redundant by 
Fisheries and Oceans, Transport Canada and Public Works.
<P>
	I am also concerned about contracting out, and by the 
Department of Transport's plans for privatizing railway and 
marine transportation, as well as airport facilities. In my riding, 
there is a company called Sopor, that carries goods for Reynolds 
and Quno to the South Shore. Sopor plays an important role in 
the region's economic development and is particularly useful as 
a carrier, shipping Reynolds aluminum products and Quno 
newsprint throughout the world.
<P>
	Also, in the transportation industry, contracting out or 
privatization means we are not in a position to develop the 
railway line between Quebec and Pointe-au-Pic, because the 
line will be transferred very shortly to the private sector. It is 
taking forever to settle this matter. Furthermore, we are still 
waiting for the tourist train  from the central station in Quebec 
City to the Casino in Charlevoix to come through.
<P>
	Contracting out should mean better quality and better services 
at a better price. I am not saying I am against contracting out, but 
what I want from the government, the department and the 
committee is some proof that contracting out or privatization is 
cost-effective for the government.
<P>
	As you know, the government is obliged to call public tenders 
for all contracts exceeding $25,000. In the case of contracts 
between $2,500 and $25,000, the department can award 
contracts, even by invitation. Of course, within the departments 
there is some flexibility for contracts up to $2,500.
<P>
	In this House, the Bloc Quebecois has been blasted regularly 
by various ministers, who have claimed that it often criticizes 
but never proposes solutions. I can tell you that, in the context of 
Bill C-52, the Bloc does offer very substantial alternatives, so 
that greater control can be exercised and the government can 
demonstrate more transparency.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	To ignore the solutions put forward by the Bloc Quebecois is 
to prevent reductions in program expenditures and the deficit as 
well as prevent finding ways of providing services to the 
Canadian public in an cost-effective and efficient fashion.
<P>
	At a recent meeting of the government operations committee, 
I asked the minister responsible: ``Do you undertake, before this 
committee, to identify clearly the needs for a department, 
develop solid specifications and estimates, launch a fair public 
tendering process, call for public tenders and have a bidders 
report produced, evaluate tenders openly, receive a 
recommendation through the deputy minister and, following 
this process, accept the lowest bid that complies with the 
specifications established by the department?'' And the answer I 
got was ``no''.
<P>
	How can a department or a minister claim to be transparent 
while refusing to accept the lowest bid, that meets all 
requirements? The minister is setting himself up to be 
criticized, sometime down the road, for favouring a friend of the 
government or a person who attended at some point in time a 
dinner at $1,000 a setting.
<P>
	The issue of transparency was raised in the government's red 
book and during the election campaign. Transparency must be 
more than just part of a campaign platform. It must last 
throughout the government's mandate. Every department is very 
interested in good management. Our job, as politicians, as 
members of this House, is to demonstrate our willingness to earn 
as much credibility as possible from our constituents in each of 
our ridings.
<P>
	Does the current contracting-out policy save us money? If so, 
how much do we save and how are these savings achieved? What 
are the major pros and cons of contracting out? Some 
drawbacks, such as poor quality, have been revealed. 
Increasingly, there are concerns about the protection of the 
confidentiality of certain documents.
<P>
	Other questions come to mind. What constitutes acceptable 
justification for contracting out? How many civil servants have 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6508"> 6508 </A></B>
<P>
been put on a shelf? Will their numbers keep growing? In short, 
many questions remain unanswered.
<P>
	It seems to us that contracting out is expensive. More and 
more contracts are let, while no one has been laid off in the 
Public Service. Job safety in the Public Service, the case of this 
Communications Canada Group that used up funds left over at 
the end of the year so that its budget would no be cut the 
following year, the privatization of Pearson International 
Airport, these are cases that should convince the government to 
support the amendment put forward by the Bloc Quebecois and 
to vote against the bill, if that amendment were not adopted.
<P>
	In the National Capital Region, 79 per cent of federal 
government services are provided by temporary personnel. It is 
reported that, in the NCR alone, $64.4 million were devoted to 
temporary assistance in 1993, while thousands of full-time 
employees were declared surplus. This is a ridiculous approach 
as well as an exercise in squandering public funds.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	In 1992-93, a full-time government secretary made $24,000 
plus benefits, while a temporary personnel agency charges the 
government $36,000 per year or $20 an hour for secretarial 
services.
<P>
	I wish to give a few examples of what the federal government 
used to pay versus today's contracting-out costs.
<P>
	A government mechanic made $16 an hour, while the agency 
charges the government $26 an hour. A plumber working in 
maintenance for the federal government earned $18 an hour, 
while an agency charges $26 an hour. A carpenter working in 
maintenance for the federal government made $17 an hour, 
while an agency charges $25 an hour for the same services.
<P>
	It is not true that contracting out saves on space and 
equipment. In the national capital, hundreds of contractors work 
in federal government offices and use the equipment and 
facilities paid for by Canadian and Quebec taxpayers.
<P>
	It is time to stop this waste. In 1991, contracting out in the 
public service cost $5 billion. Between 1984 and 1985 and from 
1992 to 1993, these costs rose by 7.5 per cent on average 
compared with 5.3 per cent for other government operating 
expenditures.
<P>
	According to a recent report, contracting-out costs 
amounting to $2.9 billion in 1984-85 rose to $5 billion in 
1992-93, about twice as much. I will resume my speech after 
Question Period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to 
the comments made by the hon. member and his colleagues. 
They always talk about duplication, waste and transparency.
<P>
	In this respect, I think that the federal government has made a 
considerable effort to open up the process. In fact, we have an 
Open Bidding Service or OBS whereby even opposition 
members, small entrepreneurs and big businesses are invited to 
bid on federal government contracts, in order to provide 
services to businesses in your ridings.
<P>
	I can even give some examples. In my riding of 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, fishermen often submit 
tenders to provide various services to the federal government. 
For instance, bids have been solicited for providing CIDA with 
cases of herring. So I can tell you this: Because of the quality of 
their products and their competitive prices, Magdalen Islands 
fishermen got-

centralizing federalism are on the move again. These ghosts 
which we had hoped to see disappear forever are supposedly 
preparing to cut $2.3 billion in transfer payments to the 
provinces for post-secondary education so that the federal 
government can meddle further in this field of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction.

	Why does this government want greater visibility for what it 
does in fields of exclusive provincial jurisdiction? Does the 
federal government want to give the impression that it is in a

<P>
	Celiac disease is a medical condition in which the absorptive 
surface of the small intestine is damaged by gluten, a common

minerals vital to growth and normal health.

goods containing any source of gluten whatsoever.

stronghold for 82 years. The provincial Liberals have called the 
seat their rock of Gibraltar.
<P>
	The margin of victory, 1,364 votes, is clearly an incredible 
win for the Conservative Party. The people defeated the 
provincial Liberals because they have not improved the 
economy, their policies are hurting our job creation and they are 
just not listening. The people have spoken and have said enough 
is enough.
<P>
	The Conservative Party is alive and well in New Brunswick 
and the rock of Gibraltar has fallen.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government's review of social policy should be accompanied by 
a review of the policies which really caused the deficit. Social 
spending in Canada is not out of line with what is spent in other 
developed countries. It is how we finance that spending that 
needs a hard look.
<P>
	On the revenue side, successive Canadian governments have 
given up billions of dollars in the form of tax breaks of one kind 
or another, starting with John Turner's budgets in the 
mid-1970s. On the monetary policy side, a policy of high 
interest rates combined with a diminishing of the role of the 
Bank of Canada in the financing of Canada's debt has led to a 
deplorable dependence on foreign lenders and bond holders.
<P>
	Of course on the economic side, the so-called free trade and 
free market fetish has destroyed hundreds of thousands of jobs 
and stressed the social system designed for less stupid economic 
policies.
<P>
	The government would do well to look at these things rather 
than blaming social programs and/or their recipients for our 
fiscal problems.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the federal government's refusal to compromise, in the 
case of the Team Canada trade mission to China, is leading 
straight to a useless confrontation between Ottawa and the new 
government in Quebec. Yesterday, the Prime Minister again 
stubbornly refused to let Mr. Parizeau send one of his ministers 
instead.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not realize that Mr. Parizeau, who 
has just been elected with a mandate to put Quebec back on 
track, has more pressing priorities than spending 15 days with 
him in China?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when we discussed these plans in December among first 
ministers, it was decided we would work together, and the 
Premiers said it was a very good idea for those who were able to 
do so to accompany me on this trip.
<P>
	At the time, we thought about three or four would be coming 
along. Since then, there has been a lot of interest from the 
business community, and there will be a large number of people 
on this trip, including quite a few from Quebec.
<P>
	During the summer, some Premiers who thought they would 
not be able to come had asked to be replaced. They were told that 
those who could would come along and as for the others, it was 
just too bad. In any case, this is a Canadian delegation that will 
include a large number of business people. There will be twice 
as many as we had planned. Canada, Quebec and the other 
provinces will be represented by the business people on the trip 
and by the Prime Minister of Canada, who also happens to be a 
Quebecer.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if we look at this logically and ignore the politics, it is 
hard to explain the Prime Minister's stubborn attitude. Could it 
be that after being forced to pay the bill for Charlottetown, 
which he had refused to do, for no good reason, he is now trying 
to turn around and show English Canada that he can hold his own 
against Quebec's demands, even if they are legitimate?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6513"> 6513 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Leader of the Opposition should explain that the trip will 
involve only five or six days in China, not two weeks. After that, 
I am going to Hong Kong, then to the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation Council conference in Indonesia and, finally, to 
Vietnam. The business part of the trip is the visit to China, which 
will take three or four days. This is to create jobs. I am prepared 
to co-operate with all governments. As for the money we paid 
last week, we made sure that the promise made to Quebec was a 
genuine promise. I made that decision very carefully.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition should have the courtesy to rise 
in the House and thank me for reversing the decision of the 
previous government, which did not want to pay. This was a case 
of Mr. Mulroney having said something in private but never 
having mentioned it, nor did Ms. Campbell, to the Conservative 
government at the time. I dealt with the problem. I am not afraid 
of how English Canada will react, on the contrary. All Canadian 
editorial writers approved what we did, with very few 
exceptions. The rest felt that we made the right decision. If 
people want to criticize me for being careful to avoid turning 
this into a controversy, I accept that criticism, but I can never be 
too careful with taxpayers money.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister better not think he can silence the 
Bloc just because he paid Quebec the money it was due, and very 
reluctantly at that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister not see that his obstinacy will 
seriously undermine the credibility of Canada's commercial 
delegation to China by excluding the two governments of 
Ontario and Quebec which represent more than 60 per cent of the 
Canadian population?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are not excluding anybody. It is a federal initiative. I am 
leading the delegation. I have offered provincial premiers to 
come with me.
<P>
	At the beginning there were very few who thought they could 
come along, but enthusiasm has developed over the months with 
a growing number of business people coming from all over 
Canada. There is a large delegation of Quebec business people 
coming who have confidence. They want to be with me to work 
and create jobs for the people of Quebec. I am sorry the premier 
of Quebec and the premier of Ontario cannot come. They are not 
obliged to be there because I am going there representing all 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> I would be delighted to 
represent the interests of the Bloc Quebecois as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister's natural talent for generating conflict  between the 
federal government and the government of Quebec has been in 
evidence for some time now. When he is not sticking his nose in 
someone else's jurisdiction, he is putting his foot in it.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister of Canada not realize that by 
choosing who must represent the governments of Quebec or 
Ontario, he is interfering directly in an area of responsibility 
exclusive to the heads of these governments, and that it is none 
of his business?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last December the provincial premiers and myself reached an 
amicable agreement to work together. I invited them to come 
with me. Several of them said: ``We would like to, but we 
cannot''. Some of them called me to ask if they could send a 
representative and I told them they could not, because it had 
been agreed that the heads of each of these governments would 
be attending. So, I was not seeking confrontation. It is a 
Canadian delegation; the premiers have been invited and those 
who can are coming, and those who cannot are not.
<P>
	I have been accused of provoking the provincial government, 
and yet the Minister of Finance, for example, is looking for ways 
to replace the GST and is seeking the co-operation of the 
provinces. But the government of Quebec has already said that it 
will not take part. When the Minister of Natural Resources, at 
the request of members of the Bloc Quebecois, attempts to do 
something for Canada's forestry development program, the 
Quebec Minister of Forestry refuses to attend the forestry 
ministers' conference in New Brunswick. Yet some very nice 
people show a willingness to work with the federal government. 
Last week, the premier of Quebec said that his sole objective in 
the months to come was to derail the federal machine.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, what we are 
talking about right now is the conduct of the Prime Minister of 
Canada.
<P>
	My question is as follows: In requiring the premier of Quebec 
to bow to his diktat, does the Prime Minister not realize that he is 
heading towards an inevitable and pointless confrontation with 
the government of Quebec, given that the real objective, the 
unspoken objective is to isolate the sovereign government of 
Quebec and exclude it from his federal mission?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
frankly, this is an exaggeration. The decision not to allow 
substitutes was taken last December. There was a Liberal 
government in power at the time, and I wish this had not 
changed. I did not pick the election date, and if the premier of 
Quebec is unable to leave Quebec for a few days to come to 
China with us, then Quebecers should tell themselves that we 
will be ably represented by Quebec businessmen and by a 
<P>

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is interesting 
in this House that the government and the Bloc fight over who is 
going on a trip when the finances of this country are in grave 
difficulty.
<P>
	The finance minister has indicated in this House that the 
savings from the social policy review would go toward reducing 
the deficit. The Deputy Prime Minister has said that the savings 
from the social policy review would not go toward reducing the 
deficit.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister indicate to this House whether the 
savings from the social policy review will go to reducing the 
deficit, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the member will have his answer in reading the document.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, just last 
Thursday in this assembly the Minister of Finance said the 
savings from the social policy review would go to cut spending 
and indicated that to this assembly.
<P>
	Would the Prime Minister indicate whether that is the policy 
of the government? If it is not it should be made clear to 
Canadians here today.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see the avid 
interest of the hon. member in the matter of social reform.
<P>
	I would say it comes about nine months too late because the 
fact of the matter is we set out very clearly the fiscal parameters 
as applied to the social reform program in the February budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government does not want to tell the Canadian people where it 
stands on this issue and whether it is ready to face its 
responsibilities.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance indicate whether his economic 
statement which I understand is to be released in mid-October 
will advise the Canadian people that the government has enough 
courage to reduce spending in social policy areas to deal with 
the deficit of this nation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, there have been a number of statements 
from the government. They have been very consistent on the fact 
that we regard social security reform as a means of making this a 
more cost effective and efficient country and of delivering 
services to Canadians in by far the most efficient way possible.
<P>
	We also understand the pressures that are on us. I would 
quote, for instance, from the minister of human resources when 
he referred the other day to the massive debts that must be 
reduced.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	Then he said that if we do not accept that reality we are going 
to have the bond dealers in New York dictating our social policy. 
The one difference between that side of the House and this is that 
we understand that our economic and social sovereignty is in 
doubt and we are not going to let anybody dictate to us the 
direction that this country ought to take.

Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	The minister is preparing to table nothing more than a 
discussion paper tomorrow, while he had promised to come up 
by last April with a plan of action setting the course for 
government social program reform. In addition, because of 
objections raised by several provinces, this reform project is 
already far behind schedule.
<P>
	Will the minister not recognize that tabling a mere discussion 
paper only confirms his failure to develop a real plan of action 
setting the course for government social program reform?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr.

namely to cut $4 billion in transfer payments to the provinces 
and benefits paid to individuals?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic

really propose.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
immigration minister's so-called public consultation process is 
now over.
<P>
	I trust that in addition to special interest groups the minister 
has consulted with Dr. Don Devoretz, a leading immigration 
expert, who says that the family reunification policy has 
lowered the success of today's immigrants.
<P>
	Is this minister committed to acting upon the will of 
Canadians as expressed in poll after poll as well as the findings 
of experts? Will he substantially reduce the level of immigration 
in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
</B><B>Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, not only was Don Devoretz an 
invited guest at our two-day conference, he was also a member 
of a working group. We looked very seriously at the work that he 
has been able to generate in British Columbia. He is certainly a 
leading advocate in terms of some of the economic ties with 
immigration.
<P>
	It should also be noted that he said very clearly that 
immigration helps this country and that when one looks at the 
tax system, and these are his words, immigrants have paid more 
into the tax system than they have taken in social benefits.
<P>
	When we reflect on some of the things that he has said, we can 
adjust this to everything he has said.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, if we look 
specifically at the report perhaps part of this was taken out of 
context.
<P>
	The minister's own employees have called for lowering the 
numbers in two separate reports. So have his government 
backbenchers. Ontario's NDP government has sent a very strong 
message to either cut the numbers or double the integration 
grants.
<P>
	Will this minister admit that he perhaps is not listening to 
anybody, not the experts, his backbenchers nor the civil servants 
or even other governments and certainly not to Canadians in 
general. His million dollar immigration consultations have been 
a farce.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, maybe the member should wait 
until the government announces the levels on or before 
November 1 and then perhaps accuse the government of not 
listening or not acting.
<P>
	I would tell the hon. member that the consultation process has 
never ever been as open as the one that we have been engaged in 
for the last eight months. Never before have thousands of people 
been involved rather than 120. Never before have 30,000 
information kits been distributed.
<P>
	The process that we embarked upon was taken seriously and 
has yielded a lot of good results that will help this government 
and not hinder when we present those levels in this Chamber.

<P>

that some observers call reactionary, outrageous and odious.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

would not make specific comments or suggestions about the 
budget before tabling it. I think it is the fifth time the hon.

he can accuse me of wanting to fuel the uncertainty.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
Minister of Finance not realize that by thinking of taxing 
RRSPs, he gives a clear signal that he has chosen the option of 
raising taxes instead of doing what everyone expected of him, 
that is, cutting government expenditures?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> I have a

<P>
	Taxpayers are tired of paying for endless legal aid appeals to

extending the forestry sub-agreement has nothing to do with 
whether Quebec is present at a negotiating table; this

forgotten, he should ask his minister responsible for regional 
development in Quebec, to whom I address my question.

	Following the closure of military bases, the Maritimes

question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	The recent offer of CP to purchase the CN Rail network in 
eastern Canada has raised some major concerns. This is 
primarily because CP has already abandoned much of its routes 
in eastern Canada and indeed is competing with Canadian 
National Rail with its own D and H line which runs from New 
York City to Montreal.
<P>
	Given this track record, what assurances can the minister give 
that this or any other offer will not lead to the abandonment of 
this main rail line which is so crucial to economic development 
in places like Moncton, the port of Halifax and indeed all of 
eastern Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my hon. colleague would know that if the unsolicited offer from 
CP Rail was accepted by the government it would have the effect 
of privatizing all rail activity east of Winnipeg. That is why the 
government recognizes that we have to look at the unsolicited 
bid from CP Rail on a businesslike basis. It also involves a very 
serious policy question. That is one of the reasons why we have 
asked members on the government side of the House to look into 
other options including the commercialization of CN with 
employee participation.
<P>
	As a fundamental part of government policy we recognize that 
it is absolutely essential to have a rail line from Halifax to 
Vancouver. That is the policy the government will pursue.

	The answer to that question clearly is justice. In Bill C-44 we

refugee process and put them to immigration inquiry. Thus far,

	I would ask hon. members to please be considerate of one 
another and not let these questions or answers degenerate into 
simply name calling. I will permit the  hon. minister to continue 
his answer but I would like him to consider perhaps lowering the 
tone just a little bit as we go along.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the member is interested in facts, 
the facts are these. This individual came to this country 
illegally. In April of this year we started an immigration inquiry. 
The adjudicator agreed with deportation but disagreed with 
detention. We appealed that decision on detention to the Federal 
Court.
<P>
	Yesterday the Federal Court quashed the decision of the 
immigration adjudicator and set another immigration 
adjudication hearing today so that we can seek that detention.
<P>
	The government has acted and acted properly.

August, Expro, located in Valleyfield, laid off about 150 
employees. That company, which specializes in explosives, lost 
a big contract in the U.S., as military markets were collapsing all

<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr.

true conversion strategy, more than 10,000 jobs are in jeopardy 
in the Montreal region? What is he waiting for to take action, as 
his government promised to do in the red book? We need a real 
industry conversion strategy and this is what my speech was all 
about.

on the appropriate role of government, not only to create an

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
during his imaginative, if not wholly accurate, oration on the 
Pearson development contract delivered during the recent 
debate on amendments to Bill C-22, the Minister of Transport 
stated that the contract on terminals 1 and 2 was not a good deal; 
then he went on to misquote my position during question period 
yesterday.
<P>
	If the minister thinks the current contract, which would have 
seen $750 million of private sector money that the government 
does not have spent on development of terminals 1 and 2 was not 
a good deal, would he please tell the House and all the Pearson 
airport users operating in unacceptable facilities what 
alternative plan he has that will quickly get them into acceptable 
facilities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in time truth will out. Obviously what we have here, as we deal 
with Bill C-22, are not Tories in sheeps'clothing, but in wolves' 
clothing. The hon. member knows we quoted from his press 
conference where he said there is nothing wrong with the 
Pearson deal.
<P>
	The Reform Party and the transportation critic for the Reform 
Party are in the minority of about 35 people in the entire nation 
who think the Pearson deal was a good deal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we do not know one way or the other because the Liberals are 
covering the whole thing up.
<P>
	The minister's national airport program will take until 1997 to 
establish, at which time the process of funding and constructing 
the now overdue rebuild of terminals 1 and 2 at Pearson will 
start.
<P>
	Can the minister honestly tell the House and the users of 
terminals 1 and 2 that it is okay to wait until the next century for 
facilities needed now, or alternatively tell the  House where the 
high spending Liberal government is going to get another 
three-quarter to one billion taxpayers' dollars to spend on an 
airport it ultimately wants to privatize?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is unbelievable that in the same question the hon. member 
talks about the free spending or high spending Liberal 
government and asks where we are going to find the money.
<P>
	The transportation critic has just said that he does not know 
whether it is a good deal or not. As a matter of fact he said, ``do 
not know one way or the other''. That, Mr. Speaker, I believe.
<P>
	One thing we will make sure of is that while the members of 
the Reform Party do not know one way or another whether 
paying $445 million to the consortium is a good deal or not, we 
know it is not and we are going to make sure that the bill goes 
through in the other place one way or another.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, according to 
the immigration minister, a quarter million immigrants into 
Canada is no problem. But the Minister of National Revenue 
knows that there are a group of people who have come into 
Canada, the so-called astronaut families, who establish 
residences of convenience here and then avoid paying taxes.
<P>
	Because these people are giving a bad name to the honest, 
upright, upstanding immigrants who make the majority of 
immigrants, what is the minister going to do to resolve this 
situation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we certainly do not attempt to target any particular 
group, be they from any particular part of the world or living in 
any part of Vancouver.
<P>
	I would suggest to the hon. member that we are, as he knows 
from press reports, continuing to follow up any leads or 
information we may have of any individual, whether from that 
particular group or any other to make sure they pay their fair 
share of taxes.
<P>
	I have made it perfectly clear in the House on many occasions 
that we intend to make sure that taxes are paid and we have a 
level playing field in Canada.
<P>
	With respect to the question of people who live in Canada and 
work overseas, I believe a provincial court judge in Vancouver 
on Monday of this week gave a decision which found a person 
guilty and I believe charged him some $140,000 in fines and 
evasion of taxes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is the 
wonderful world according to the Liberal front bench. The 
reality is that with a quarter of a million people coming into

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Interestingly, most of the calls I have had in recent days about this issue have

immigrants?

Canada has too many immigrants. We could equally take his 
question as being that the Minister of National Revenue has too 
few inspectors and auditors.
<P>
	We carry out as best as we can efforts to make sure that all 
Canadians, regardless of where they come from, obey the law 
with respect to paying their taxes. It is vital to do this to make 
sure that people generally throughout Canada recognize that it is 
a fair system and that there are not free loaders getting away 
with taking services and not paying their share. We do this 
regardless of whether people happen to be immigrants, recent 
immigrants, or whether they happen to be Canadians of

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALLAWAMENDMENTACT,1994">CRIMINAL LAW AMENDMENT ACT, 1994</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (for the Minister of Justice)</B> 
moved that Bill C-42, an act to amend the Criminal Code and 
other acts (miscellaneous matters), be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to be able to debate the second reading motion of Bill C-42. Bill 
C-42, an act to amend the Criminal Code and other acts 
(miscellaneous matters), is not to be confused with Bill C-40, 
the 1994 miscellaneous statute law amendment bill passed by 
the House on June 20. It was concerned with a variety of minor 
technical amendments to correct anomalies, inconsistencies and 
errors in federal statutes and to repeal provisions that have 
expired, lapsed or otherwise ceased to have effect.
<P>
	That bill also made amendments of a minor, 
non-controversial and uncomplicated nature to a number of 
statutes. The bill we are concerned with today, which if passed 
this year will be known as the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 
1994, focuses mainly on the Criminal Code but also contains 
some amendments to the Canada Evidence Act, the 
Contraventions Act, the Mutual Legal Assistance and Criminal 
Matters Act and the Supreme Court Act.
<P>
	While some of the proposed amendments might be considered 
technical, many are more significant and will result in 
improvements to our criminal justice system. A bill such as this 
one is long overdue.
<P>
	Historically this bill and ones like it were introduced on a 
regular basis. However the last such bill was introduced in 1985. 
The Minister of Justice intends to return to the previous pattern. 
He anticipates bringing forward a second bill of this nature once 
Parliament has dealt with this one.
<P>
	The primary source for most of these amendments is the 
criminal law section of the Uniform Law Conference of Canada. 
The section is composed of delegates from each province, 
territory and the federal government and includes crown and 
defence lawyers. At annual meetings of the Uniform Law 
Conference, the section considers resolutions calling for 
amendments to the Criminal Code and other relevant statutes.
<P>
	The other amendments in the bill originated from suggestions 
of the former Law Reform Commission of Canada, various 
judges, members of the bar, and federal and provincial 
departments and officials. These amendments, taken as a whole, 
represent significant changes to the criminal law aimed at 
increasing the efficiency of the justice system to the benefit of 
every Canadian.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	When the Minister of Justice recently wrote provincial and 
territorial colleagues about the bill, he noted that each proposal 
fell within one or more of the categories said to be generally 
encompassed by the Uniform Law Conference resolutions.
<P>
	In short, these seven categories cover proposals directed at, 
first, enhancing public confidence in our criminal justice 
system; second, making the Criminal Code provisions more 
efficient and more effective; third, implementing or achieving 
compliance with court decisions; fourth, filling perceived gaps 
in the Criminal Code; fifth, taking advantage of the advances in 
computer, communications and video technology; sixth, 
improving court procedures; and, seventh, ensuring greater 
fairness to the participants in the procedural process.
<P>
	These categories illustrate laudable criminal law policy 
objectives and encompass the major themes of the bill. To date, 
the response we have received from the provinces to these 
proposals has been very positive.
<P>
	I emphasize that the overall effect of these proposals will 
result in a more cost effective system of criminal justice while at 
the same time maintain or even improve the fundamental 
fairness of our justice.
<P>
	The amendments to the Criminal Code are mostly procedural. 
Their cumulative effect will be to modernize procedure to make 
the Criminal Code more effective and more efficient. Procedural 
proposals range from permitting the Attorney General of 
Canada to take over private prosecutions for offences under 
federal legislation other than those under the Criminal Code, to 
proposals permitting the greater use of telephone, video 
technology and fax for certain procedural matters.
<P>
	Under these amendments, authority would be given to permit 
judges to finish trials in progress on appointment to another 
court. When a judge has to be replaced during the trial for other 
reasons it would be possible for a new judge to carry on without 
having to start over again in appropriate cases of course.
<P>
	These particular proposals should help in maintaining public 
confidence in our criminal justice system. They will also ensure 
greater fairness to participants, particularly the victims and the 
witnesses.
<P>
	Other changes are aimed at making it easier for trial and 
appeal courts to establish rules of court. It will be easier to 
adjourn certain procedures when a judge is not available and it 
will be possible to arrange for a trial date upon committal after a 
preliminary hearing.
<P>
	Changes to the Supreme Court Act would make it easier for 
the court to manage its workload and to remand cases to lower 
courts for further proceedings when that would be just in the 
circumstances.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6521"> 6521 </A></B>
<P>
	Some proposals are directed at making improvements in the 
way in which some evidence issues are handled. For instance, 
several amendments would permit evidentiary proof by way of a 
certificate, thereby avoiding the need to require individuals to 
appear in person to testify. Other changes are directed at the 
manner in which evidence is to be obtained abroad and at 
ensuring that any such evidence is more readily admissible in 
Canadian proceedings.
<P>
	Some amendments are aimed at increasing the use of 
technology, for instance permitting the use of a fax machine in 
limited circumstances. Another section would allow a person to 
appear by closed circuit television in some portions of a 
preliminary hearing.
<P>
	A number of the proposals relate to arrest, pretrial release and 
other matters involving police practices and procedures. For 
instance, a significant improvement in the use of policing and 
court resources will be achieved by permitting police to release 
an arrested person on certain conditions restricting their liberty 
rather than as is now the case, having only the choice of 
releasing unconditionally or detaining an accused in custody 
until a hearing before the justice of the peace could be arranged.
<P>
	Greater fairness to accused persons will be achieved through 
reducing unnecessary pretrial custody. Police will be able to 
spend more time on the beat preventing crime or detecting 
offenders rather than waiting in the corridors of courtrooms.
<P>
	Perhaps the most significant changes which will contribute to 
a more effective and efficient criminal justice system are 
directed at trial procedures applicable to certain offences. The 
choice of trial procedure, summary conviction or indictable, 
would be given to the crown for the present indictable offences 
of assault causing bodily harm, unlawfully causing bodily harm 
and uttering threats to cause death or bodily harm.
<P>
	The summary conviction maximum term of imprisonment for 
these offences as well as for the basic sexual assault offences 
would be 18 months instead of the normal six months for 
Criminal Code summary conviction offences.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	This will relieve court congestion in the superior courts, 
reduce the strain on witnesses, particularly victims, and help 
contain the time needed to deal with many court cases to time 
periods required by the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms. The changes will also send a strong signal to judges 
that significant punishment might be in order even for the minor 
instances of violent offences.
<P>
	Similar benefits will be achieved by raising the monetary 
limit for theft and other property offences to $5,000 from 
$1,000. This is being done so that many more common offences 
related to property will be kept in the provincial court system, 
eliminating the need for  preliminary hearings and jury trials for 
cases which rarely attract imprisonment.
<P>
	There are proposals aimed at removing obsolete provisions or 
filling gaps created by changing circumstances. Gaps which 
presently exist with respect to publicity for certain pretrial 
proceedings would be closed.
<P>
	It is important that the rights of accused persons to a fair trial 
before an impartial jury not be compromised by premature 
publicity of information which may or may not be relevant in 
admissible evidence.
<P>
	The rights of witnesses and victims also require protection 
from the needless public disclosure of personal information. A 
prohibition would be created to ensure that sensitive material 
disclosed to the accused for the purposes of making a full answer 
in defence is not made public except for that purpose. This will 
serve to maintain the balance of interest between the right of the 
accused to a full answer in defence and the confidence that the 
public needs to encourage co-operation in criminal 
investigations and prosecutions.
<P>
	The bill also seeks to enhance preventive measures already 
found in our law by proposing several changes aimed at making 
the peace bond process more effective. These changes will also 
ensure greater fairness to those participants in the criminal 
justice process who are in fear of threatened violence.
<P>
	A peace bond is an undertaking given by a person on the order 
of a justice to be of good behaviour for a period of up to 12 
months. It is a way of preventing a crime or, more important, the 
acts of violence constituting the crime from happening.
<P>
	Their effectiveness will be improved by making violation of 
peace bonds punishable on indictment as well as on summary 
conviction, and by obliging justices to consider imposing 
specified conditions such as staying away from or prohibiting 
contact with the complainant. Police and others will also be able 
to apply for peace bonds on behalf of persons who are at risk of 
harm.
<P>
	According to Statistics Canada's national survey on violence 
against women in 1993 three in ten women currently or 
previously married in Canada have experienced at least one 
incident of physical and sexual violence at the hands of a marital 
partner. Almost one-half or 45 per cent of wife assault cases 
resulted in physical injury to the woman. The survey also 
showed that one-third of women who were assaulted by a 
partner feared for their lives at some point during the abusive 
relationship.
<P>
	It is also important to indicate that children witnessed 
violence against their mothers in almost 40 per cent of the 
marriages with violence. According to the same survey, the 
police were only informed of about 26 per cent of wife assault 
cases.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6522"> 6522 </A></B>
<P>
	These figures show there is a large number of women who are 
victims of various forms of assault. These provisions are 
important tools in trying to cope with domestic violence and will 
help implement one of the red book commitments to work 
effectively in keeping abusers away from women and children.
<P>
	We have to start thinking of using our criminal justice system 
to prevent crime from happening rather than, as is more often 
the case now, picking up the pieces which are all too often the 
shattered remnants of human tragedy.
<P>
	It is clear that the bill covers a wide range of matters and I 
have only touched on a small number of the matters dealt with in 
the over 100 clauses the bill contains. Many of the provisions 
are quite technical and may not attract attention in the course of 
debate, but together with those already outlined they are all 
aimed at improving the administration of criminal justice in 
Canada and at enhancing the confidence the public must have in 
our criminal law.
<P>
	Efficiency of operation combined with effectiveness of 
operation must be enhanced in our administration of justice. It is 
our job as legislators to seek ways to improve our administration 
so that even better service is given to the Canadian public.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	I am confident all the members of this House will be satisfied 
with the common sense benefits this bill provides. This bill is 
long overdue. It contains provisions which should be put in 
place as soon as possible. I very much hope it can be treated in a 
non-partisan manner and that it will be considered by the 
committee carefully but quickly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege to speak on Bill C-42. This bill contains 
over 100 amendments to the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Certainly we know that crime is a national issue in the press 
these days. During the election constituents told me they wanted 
to see the Canadian government toughen up our criminal justice 
system and make it work for them rather than just seemingly for 
the criminal.
<P>
	Canadians refer to the justice system as their criminal justice 
system because they own it. However many times in this House I 
have heard members of Parliament speak as if they were the only 
ones who had the expertise and they were the ones who were 
going to make the changes to it without wide consultation, 
without having broad political support or without really being 
accountable to the community.
<P>
	I do ask: Does the application of the Criminal Code in present 
day represent mainstream Canadian values?
<P>
	The spirit of this bill must be tied into Bill C-41 which is still 
at second reading stage. Canadians say they want to feel safe on 
their streets. Last week for example over 3,000 people turned 
out in Coquitlam, British Columbia  to voice their concerns and 
frustrations over the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	Canadians are serious about protection. They are serious 
about appropriately denouncing crime. Newspapers are filled 
with reports of criminal activity. The public wants to know what 
can be done to curb what they see as an unacceptable level of 
crime.
<P>
	We cannot wait around for crime to get out of control before 
we make changes. We must do what the public wants now. The 
Reform Party wants changes. We must remember that change 
begins with the recognition that a problem exists.
<P>
	When I went through the bill I came across several interesting 
things I could not pass without making some comment. Bill 
C-42 is an acceptable bill but is far from being a perfect or great 
one. Some amendments will indeed strengthen the Criminal 
Code. However, Bill C-42 does frustrate me in parts.
<P>
	For example, clause 28(3) of the bill states ``everyone who 
commits a theft in relation to property, the value of which 
exceeds $5,000''. This amendment would replace the word 
``one'' with the word ``five''. If we were to look back to previous 
Parliaments with respect to this Criminal Code section we 
would find some very interesting things.
<P>
	In 1954 the dollar indicated for theft over and theft under was 
$50. If someone were to be convicted of theft over $50 the 
punishment was an indictable offence. Consequently for the 
theft under $50 the punishment was a summary conviction. The 
next time this section was changed was in 1975 when any theft 
over $200 was an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment 
for up to 10 years.
<P>
	The law as we know it today was amended in 1985 to $1,000. 
The punishment is an indictable offence and liable to 
imprisonment for up to 10 years for any theft over $1,000. For 
anything under $1,000 the punishment is a summary conviction.
<P>
	The increase since 1954 certainly is amazing. From $50 to 
$200 is an increase of 400 per cent; $200 then to $1,000 is a 500 
per cent increase; and $1,000 to $5,000 is again a 500 per cent 
increase. However in the 40 years that have passed it has totalled 
an increase of 10,000 per cent.
<P>
	This is a softening of the law. If we were to use history as a 
benchmark I suppose the next amendment would make it 
$25,000. Incredulous. Someone could then steal all the furniture 
in my house and only get away with a summary conviction. This 
is not acceptable.
<P>
	Property crimes in Canada have historically accounted for 
most Criminal Code offences. In fact in 1990 thefts over and 
under $1,000 comprised over two-thirds of all property crimes 
reported to the police. A StatsCanada report in 1990 indicates 
that all property offence categories recorded increased in 1990 
over the previous year, including a 13 per cent rise in thefts of 
motor  vehicles, a 9 per cent rise in break and enters, 8 per cent 
in possession of stolen goods, 8 per cent in theft over and under 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6523"> 6523 </A></B>
<P>
$1,000 and 7 per cent in frauds. Interestingly enough this was 
the seventh consecutive year that an increase was recorded for 
theft of motor vehicles. In 1992 there were 823,748 theft under 
incidents reported in Canada. That made up almost one-half of 
all property crime for that year.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	If the government now raises the dollar limit for theft under 
the numbers will increase and theft over will decrease, one 
would expect. What we will hear from the Liberals then is that 
serious thefts of crime are on the decrease, but are they really? I 
would not think so. If the same logic of thinking is to be 
followed, why not raise the limit to $100,000 if you really want 
to lower one area of the published crime rate? Instead of trying 
to create a deterrent for the crime the government is making this 
into a game of shuffling statistics.
<P>
	The area of concern is the theft over category. From 1986, one 
year following the dollar cut off being raised to $1,000 until 
1992, theft over had increased by 9 per cent. I am sure the 
government of the time felt that by raising the rate from $200 to 
$1,000 would help curb published property crime rates. Today 
with Bill C-42 the government hopes that by raising the limit 
from $1,000 to $5,000 this increase will help curb property 
crime rates in 1995 and beyond. The government should take a 
careful look back at history to see how things failed before 
charging ahead with only a hope that it is going to work.
<P>
	The government should keep the dollar amount at $1,000 and 
continue with the same consequences therein. Strangely enough 
if a person were to go out today and steal a 28-inch television 
and a hi-fi VCR from an electronics store, they would be 
charged with an indictable offence and subject to a maximum of 
10 years in prison. Consequently, if that person were to steal the 
same merchandise following the passage of this bill, their 
sentence might only be a summary conviction with a possible 
maximum of 18 months in prison. I would call that a reduction in 
the sentence and a softening of the law.
<P>
	The government is telling criminals everywhere and the 
message is clear: ``Here is your grand opportunity. Go and steal 
some big ticket items and we will barely slap you on the wrist''. 
Getting softer with criminals is not going to reduce the crime 
rate. It sends the wrong message out to the community.
<P>
	Capacity creates its own demand. In other words a legal 
vacuum is all too soon filled with the negative potential of 
human nature. The government wants the public to think it is 
getting tough with crime. However, when you look closely at 
this legislation you can see where the Liberal agenda is off the 
rails.
<P>
	Bill C-42 proposes dual procedure offences that would allow 
the crown prosecutor to have the option to deal  with a case 
either as an indictable offence or as a summary conviction. For 
example, assault causing bodily harm, unlawfully causing 
bodily harm, and uttering threats to cause death or bodily harm 
are all currently indictable offences, but if the crown so wishes it 
may change them to summary convictions under this bill.
<P>
	I want to point out something I caught in the news release by 
the Minister of Justice when this bill was first tabled in the 
House. He was referring to the reasoning behind the dual 
procedure clause and the option. He stated that typically, a 
summary conviction procedure is quicker, more straight 
forward and involves less stress and inconvenience to victims 
and witnesses. If someone is assaulted and bodily harm is 
involved, am I to understand the minister believes the victim 
would rather see the offender get a light summary conviction 
and be out of jail in no time or perhaps no jail sentence at all 
rather than see real justice take place and make sure that the 
offender stays behind bars for a good long time?
<P>
	Currently a summary conviction in the Criminal Code has a 
maximum penalty of six months in prison. Bill C-42 raises that 
maximum sentence to 18 months and for this I applaud the 
government. This harsher sentence will surely help to stop some 
of the crime that is plaguing our cities and towns. It provides the 
court with greater latitude for severity. Therefore the bill does 
have some valid amendments. As Her Majesty's loyal 
constructive opposition and alternative it is our duty to analyze 
the entire bill and to point out areas of concern as well as areas of 
support.
<P>
	On a different note, we see technology changing before our 
eyes each and every day. I used to think the fax machine was an 
amazing tool until personal computers came along. Now I 
cannot believe how compact they have become. Sending a letter 
through the mail system was certainly the fastest and most 
efficient way to get a document from one place to another until 
E-mail and the information superhighway entered the 
workplace. We have to adapt to keep up with technology in order 
to remain effective.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-42 proposes that fax machines and closed circuit 
televisions be allowed at certain portions in hearings. This will 
surely help to lessen the cost of flying in witnesses from all parts 
of the country in order that they can attend a hearing. With 
closed circuit television, a witness can attend a hearing, be part 
of it even if they are a thousand miles away. This will cut costs 
and for that the government has done something correct. Now if 
it would only cut costs across the board, we would all be in better 
shape, would we not?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6524"> 6524 </A></B>
<P>
	As a justice professional I have spent a great amount of time 
in the courtroom. A person giving evidence usually has had a 
choice of going to the witness stand either on oath or 
affirmation. However in seeing it firsthand so many times it was 
apparent that many were confused as to how to give evidence on 
this affirmation option. With this bill the affirmation is now 
clarified in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	In another section there is a clause in this bill that would allow 
the police to obtain a warrant for a blood sample up to four hours 
following an accident. The current time period is two hours and 
this by no means is long enough. In speaking with police officers 
it is apparent they are inundated with logistics following an 
accident. If the person involved in an accident is unconscious 
but suspected of a blood alcohol level above the legal limit, the 
officer with the increase in time to four hours will have 
sufficient time to obtain a warrant in order to have a blood 
sample taken.
<P>
	Drunk driving is a serious problem in Canada. Groups such as 
Mothers Against Drunk Driving, better known as MADD, will 
certainly be happy with this provision amending the code. I see 
this as a good amendment to the Criminal Code one which 
reflects the current community mood.
<P>
	There is one amendment that I would have especially liked to 
have seen in Bill C-42 but I did not find it. That is the 
development of a national registry of DNA samples taken from 
persons convicted of a serious crime. That serious crime could 
be first degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, child abuse, 
sexual offences, and so on, indictable offences.
<P>
	The idea of banking information is not new. Under the 
Identification of Criminals Act and the Canada Evidence Act 
police have been banking fingerprint information and have used 
it extensively to track down possible suspects. Fingerprints are 
fundamental to the operation of the justice system and similarly 
then so should be DNA typing.
<P>
	DNA typing has been used in the United States and is gaining 
notoriety in such cases as the one involving O.J. Simpson. With 
the exception of red blood cells, all cellular material in the 
human body can be typed for example, white blood cells, root 
hair, saliva, semen, skin and even bone. Since DNA is 
essentially the same from cell to cell, any part of the body can be 
compared to another part of the same body. With only minute 
samplings needed a police investigator is able to identify a 
victim much easier and therefore have a much more certain tool 
pointing to a suspect. Such hard evidence can defend as well as 
convict.
<P>
	We want to create laws that will also save money as the justice 
system is overburdened and this could be one of them. Police 
investigations are extremely costly to the public purse and are 
very time consuming. With over 100 amendments in this bill the 
government passed over something that would have really aided 
the law  enforcement officials to do a better job and to help 
protect the public.
<P>
	In the United States, 21 states have enacted legislation to 
permit DNA banking in various degrees. In addition, seven other 
states have introduced bills dealing with this very issue. The 
American National Academy of Science stated that if DNA 
profiles of samples from a population were stored in computer 
databases, DNA typing could be applied in crimes without 
suspects. Investigators could compare DNA profiles of 
biological evidence samples with a database to search for 
suspects.
<P>
	A British royal commission pointed out that a data bank 
would also enable unsolved earlier offences where DNA 
evidence had been found but not linked with the offender to be 
cleared up if DNA samples taken from a suspect in connection 
with a later offence matched the evidence found at the scene of 
an earlier crime.
<P>
	If this government is serious about solving crime and bringing 
forth justice it will not sit idle and wait for the world to leave 
Canada behind in the dark ages of technology. We can demand a 
blood sample for impaired driving but we cannot do that for rape 
and murder. This does not make sense.
<P>
	Another tough penalty I am encouraged to see in this bill is the 
increase in punishment for those who fail to remain at the scene 
of an accident. Currently the maximum is two years and this is 
quite unacceptable. An amendment in Bill C-42 will make it a 
possible five years.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, this bill missed the mark in several areas. The 
over and under dollar value is way too high and is out of sync 
with what Canadians expect of the justice system. This is clearly 
a scheme by which the government wished to perhaps lower the 
crime rate in its published statistics. For example, dual 
procedures will only cause more criminals to walk the streets 
sooner and lawyers to get more of their clients through the 
courts. This is a clear softening of the law.
<P>
	The biggest miss of this entire bill is its failure to include the 
national registry of DNA samples. The Minister of Justice has 
previously stated many of these changes, referring to 
amendments in Bill C-42, will lead to significant costs and time 
savings for the administration of justice and will assist the law 
enforcement officials to do their jobs effectively.
<P>
	That is what he is claiming. My only remark to this would be 
does the minister really understand what law enforcement 
officials could use to save time and money? If he did then he 
certainly would have included DNA as a registry in Bill C-42 or 
Bill C-41.
<P>
	We will support this bill at this stage. As a Reform member of 
Parliament I am committed to being the constructive alternative 
to the government. This bill has some amendments that will 
strengthen the Criminal Code. Again, the government has to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6525"> 6525 </A></B>
<P>
understand that victims of crime want to feel protected by the 
code  because right now it seems that the only person who is 
protected is the offender.
<P>
	For example, this week we have heard more cases going the 
wrong way in the community's eyes because of technical 
problems with the law. I encourage the government to bring 
forward more amendments, to give some of the many private 
members' bills a chance and give them an appropriate assent if it 
is unable to bring forward bills of its own.
<P>
	During committee of the whole I will be moving an 
amendment to hold the line of the current standard in the 
Criminal Code. I hope our constructive help will be recognized 
by this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am not going to make a speech. I want to clarify a few 
of the points that were brought up in the speech by the hon. 
member for New Westminster-Burnaby.
<P>
	First, with respect to the hybrid offences where it can be 
summary or indictable, in some cases the reason we want to have 
hybrid offences and proceed in a summary conviction is that the 
courts will not convict certain offenders on indictable offences. 
It is quite true that in many cases charges are not even brought 
where there are indictable offences, whereas if there were 
summary offences we would at least get the cases to court to get 
a conviction.
<P>
	It remains with the judge as to the penalty. The fact of the 
matter is it may be a reduced penalty but in many cases a reduced 
penalty is better than no penalty at all. We want to have that 
flexibility.
<P>
	With respect to the increase in the maximum on property 
offences from $1,000 to $5,000 that could be heard in provincial 
courts, it is the opinion of the Minister of Justice and myself that 
we want to have more of these cases heard in provincial court. 
They can be done more quickly. We have the expertise and the 
provincial court judges to hear them.
<P>
	Because we are increasing from $1,000 to $5,000 does not 
mean there is going to be five times more work for the provincial 
court judges. There is going to be an increase, but there is going 
to be a corresponding decrease in the higher courts in the 
country. We feel it is going to be more efficient. We are going to 
have the same high level of justice. It is going to be less costly.
<P>
	The other point concerns the national registry on the DNA. 
The hon. member makes a very good point. However, the reason 
it was not included is that there is a discussion paper now 
circulating on DNA. The Minister of Justice promised to give 
until November 20 for submissions on this discussion paper.
<P>
	He is undertaking that new legislation will be brought 
forward, if not by the end of the year then early in the new year. 
This whole question of a registry is being reviewed along with 
other questions on DNA.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	At this point I would like to move that we now move into 
committee of the whole. I think we will have unanimous 
agreement among all parties to proceed that way.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and, by 
unanimous consent, the House went into committee thereon, Mr. 
Kilger in the chair.)
<P>
	On clause 2:
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Chairman, on a point of order. I think you 
would find consent to call clauses 2 to 19 as a block. I think they 
could all be carried at once. If you could call clause 20 we might 
deal with that.
<P>
	<B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B> Is there consent to include 
clauses 2 to 19 and ask that they be carried?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	(Clauses 2 to 19 inclusive agreed to.)
<P>
	On clause 20:
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, I am going to be making a motion. I will move the 
motion first and then speak to it. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That clause 20 be amended by striking out the word ``five'' and substituting 
the word ``one'' and in paragraph (2) by striking out the word ``five'' and 
substituting the word ``one''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	He said: Mr. Chairman, the division between what is 
commonly known as theft under and theft over has been a 
demarcation in the courts which really sends a message to the 
community. It was not that long ago when theft under and theft 
over was $50. We then moved it to $200. Now in the percentage 
increase we are operating with the division of $1,000. I can just 
imagine the message that is going to send to my community 
when theft under procedures are going to be dealt with by theft 
under $5,000.
<P>
	I can understand from the criminal justice administrative 
point of view the desirability of perhaps doing this to alleviate 
the procedures of proceeding by indictment, but it is not just the 
experts who own the criminal justice system. There is the 
educative role of the symbol of the message that the law sends to 
the community as to what is acceptable and what is not 
acceptable. This amendment seems to be out of sync with the 
community mood and what is appropriate at this time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6526"> 6526 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not hear anything in the community that is suggesting that 
we have a real problem in the courts at this point that we must 
make this significant move from theft under $1,000 to theft 
under $5,000.
<P>
	I question the basis as to what problem it is trying to solve. 
However, I also point out the serious message that it sends in a 
softening of the law to the community. I hope to hear from other 
members on this point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, I understand what the hon. member for New 
Westminster-Burnaby is saying. There is a concern among the 
public about crime, all types of crime at the present time. The 
public wants justice. It wants the justice system to react and deal 
with crime.
<P>
	I do not want to say that property crime is not significant 
because it is extremely significant. Right now, however, the 
main concern is violent crime with a great many people in our 
cities. They want to make sure that our system can deal swiftly 
with violent crime.
<P>
	If we move theft under $5,000 to the provincial courts as 
opposed to theft under $1,000, as is the situation now, that is not 
going to diminish justice in any way. All it is going to do is take 
some cases which are now tried by the superior courts and have 
them heard in the provincial courts.
<P>
	The provincial court judges right now are of an excellent 
calibre. The cases can be brought forward more quickly. Justice 
is dealt with more expediently. As a result, there is less cost to 
the system and the decisions and results are equally good.
<P>
	I honestly feel that we are not diminishing the calibre or 
quality of justice by this provision.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, I would like to make sure I understand the 
government's amendment which increases the amount from 
$1,000 to $5,000 and, consequently, the Reform Party's 
amendment. Does the amendment mean that all theft under 
$5,000 can be dealt with summary conviction?
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Chairman, theft under $5,000 can be 
dealt with by indictment but under the jurisdiction of the 
provincial court judge.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> But that is after the amendment. Today, 
theft of $4,500 is not dealt with by summary conviction.
<P>
	What is the impact of this amendment, in the context of this 
bill? We may not have the same understanding of the 
amendment, since one member says yes and the other member 
says no. We are on clause 20.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Chairman, the purpose is to move more 
of the cases of theft into the provincial court system and away 
from the superior court system. That is not to say that because 
we are going from $1,000 to $5,000 we are going to increase the 
theft cases in the provincial court system five times. Nor are we 
going to say that we are reducing the penalties because it is 
going to a provincial court. This discretion remains with the 
pertinent judge sitting at that particular time.
<P>
	What we are saying is that these cases can be tried very 
competently under the provincial court system and that it is 
really more efficient to do so without any reduction in the 
quality of the justice dispensed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, if we move cases from the superior court to the 
provincial court, would we not just be increasing the workload 
of the provincial court and what would happen to the cases 
already in provincial court? Would we decide then that we are 
not going to prosecute even more cases? Does it not just move 
the bell curve that far over that we are not going to bother 
prosecuting these cases?
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Speaker, these changes have been 
dialogued with the provinces for their approval and their 
consideration.
<P>
	The fact is that in the provincial court system, the preliminary 
documentation, the waiting periods are not as long as they are in 
the superior court system. This will free up some time in the 
superior court system. It will in some cases add to the provincial 
court system, but in the opinion of the Department of Justice and 
the provincial authorities of the attorneys general departments 
and ministers of justice provincially it is not going to be a 
problem and add that much that the provincial court systems 
will be overloaded.
<P>
	It will allow more time for the superior courts to hear cases of 
theft involving larger amounts and violent crimes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Mr. Chairman, there is no 
doubt that this is going to reduce the offence. It is going to 
reduce the offence for what now amounts to theft over $1,000.
<P>
	The summary conviction provides for a maximum sentence of 
18 months. If we move up to $5,000, offences that today are 
punishable by indictment with as I understand it a maximum 10 
years imprisonment are now going to be subject to an 18 month 
prison term if they get the maximum under the provincial court 
system.
<P>
	There is no question that this is softening the law. I would 
object to a softening of the law. We are now moving into an area 
where we are going to be subjecting people convicted of theft to 
a lesser penalty potentially. It is simply there. It is in the writing. 
What alarms me is what I heard my hon. colleague say before we 
entered committee of the whole, that one of the reasons we are  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6527"> 6527 </A></B>
<P>
moving to this situation is because the courts were not 
convicting because it was an indictable offence.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Now, if that is wrong-
<P>
	<B>The Assistant Deputy Chairman:</B> I wonder if the hon. 
member for Crowfoot would finish his remarks and then I will 
see that the parliamentary secretary responds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, I would like the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Justice to comment on that. If my 
understanding is incorrect, and I hope it is, the reason the courts 
are not convicting is because they do not want to convict a 
person charged with theft for an indictable offence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Chairman, I was referring to another 
point that the hon. member for New Westminister-Burnaby 
made in his speech. He talked about the hybrid offences, the dual 
offences of summary or indictable, that the charges could be 
either summary or indictable which did not relate to this 
particular provision at all. This was a general comment as I 
understood it that in some cases in certain areas where there is 
not a conviction, the judge will not convict somebody on an 
indictable offence for an offence they feel is not serious enough 
to warrant a conviction as an indictable offence whereas if we 
give the choice of summary or indictable and proceed 
summarily, the judge will be more predisposed to giving a 
conviction on that.
<P>
	The other point the hon. member for Crowfoot made related to 
the change from the superior courts to provincial courts in 
certain cases of theft. Granted the situation now is 10 years 
maximum, but they are not awarding 10 years for theft under 
$5,000. Now under the Criminal Code they would get a 
maximum of two years and two years is penitentiary time. I 
cannot imagine any judge giving two years for theft under 
$5,000 because it means that person goes to penitentiary. I just 
do not think any judge is going to do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, am I correct in assuming that 
what the member has said is that judges are not going to 
determine guilt based upon the evidence? They are going to 
determine guilt based upon whether it is a summary conviction 
or proceeding by way of indictment. I need to have that clarified. 
If I heard him right that is exactly what he said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Chairman, when I am speaking of 
summary and indictable, I am talking generally. There are 
sections in the Criminal Code where the charge is proceeded 
with summarily or as an indictable offence. In some cases the 
spectrum of the case can range but not to what one would 
consider a serious crime. If there is just a way of proceeding as 
an indictable offence the judge is going to say: ``If I proceed as 
an indictable offence, the penalty I have to give is going to be far 
too serious for the crime''. Therefore in certain sections of the 
Criminal Code there is the choice of proceeding summarily or 
on an indictable offence.
<P>
	It is not left to the judge. It is how the case is laid, either as a 
summary conviction or as an indictable charge. The judge does 
not have the discretion. That is decided before it goes to court. It 
is just a means of asking how best to get a conviction. It is left 
with the crown prosecutor's office to determine the best way to 
proceed. Do we try for the higher sentence and end up with 
nothing or should we go summarily and at least be sure we are 
going to get a conviction?
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Mr. Chairman, certainly the conviction ought to 
be based upon the evidence. In every courtroom that I have ever 
appeared in the guilt was determined by the evidence, not by 
way of proceedings, whether it was summary conviction or 
indictable. This is the point I am making. I do not want to hang 
the proceedings up on this point, but the hon. member is saying 
this clearly. He said three times that it is going to matter to the 
judge in terms of determining guilt whether it is by way in which 
the court is proceeding, by summary or by indictment.
<P>
	What I am pointing out is that the courts in this land have 
always determined guilt based upon the evidence, not based 
upon procedure.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Chairman, we always determine guilt 
upon the facts of the case. They have always determined 
sentence based on the facts of the case too. If the facts of the case 
are such that a stiff sentence is not merited, they are going to 
have a problem. If there is a choice, you can go summarily and 
the judge can see a fitting sentence in the summary conviction 
that meets the process of the justice system and the interests of 
society because one gets a conviction and a sentence that is 
going to be fair.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, this is getting very complicated. I simply want to 
know whether raising the amount from $1,000 to $5,000 would 
entail any changes in the procedure before the courts. Is it a case 
of evidence or evaluating whether we have a theft of $1,000 or 
$5,000?
<P>
	My second point is, when you talk about provincial court and 
superior court, one of the consequences-and that is what my 
question was about earlier-one of the consequences is that a 
person accused of theft under $5,000 could not ask to be tried by 
judge and jury or by a judge alone in Superior Court. He will 
immediately be processed by provincial court; in Quebec, that is 
the Court of Quebec. Is that correct? Yes, thank you.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Chairman, that is correct.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway):</B> Mr. 
Chairman, currently under the summary convictions provisions, 
the maximum is six months in jail. You have told the 
government that you are going to proceed to make it 18.
<P>
	In the provincial courts they always can proceed on the 
indictment and handle the more serious charges but I see that the 
principle here is to take away the options of the accused to elect 
to go to a superior court.
<P>
	In these situations as practice has it, these theft offences are 
usually cumulative. Generally the information is multi charges 
against an offender. To limit this dollar amount related to 
summarial procedure is going to really hamstring a judge in 
being able to give the latitude of sentence required.
<P>
	We feel that there is really no current problem in the justice 
system that is reflected in this change, that it sends the wrong 
message to the community and that we are looking for 
substantive justification of why this clause is here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Mr. Chairman, in cases of a series of small 
offences, the sentences can be imposed consecutively so that 
there could be higher penalties for more than one offence, so that 
is still there.
<P>
	The hon. member is right that the choice is not there but we 
have no intention of changing the penalties. We are going to as 
agreed keep the situation the way it is. There is still the 
possibility of higher sentences in a series of small offences if the 
judge chooses to sentence the person for each offence 
consecutively.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Mr. Chairman, I would also like the 
parliamentary secretary to address the issue of the symbolism of 
the law as to its educative role in the community for general 
deterrence to operate.
<P>
	The potential sentence that can arise or if it be a consequence 
of an offence is directly related to how serious the community 
should look at that offence.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	For example, for breaking and entering a dwelling house, the 
maximum is life in jail. We know that life in jail is not very often 
given for breaking and entering a dwelling house. However it is 
a symbol of how serious that charge is to be taken.
<P>
	Regular theft, which is so pervasive in the justice system, is 
one of the most common offences before the courts. We think 
that to change the boundary sends the wrong message and 
undermines the operation of general deterrence.
<P>
	I would like the parliamentary secretary to address that larger 
issue rather than the technical issues of looking at the offender 
and whether they will be able to elect or not to go to the higher 
court, but to first of all justify what is the problem that he is 
trying to solve with this provision  and how is that going to 
undermine the operation of general deterrence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacLellan:</B> Yes. In fact, Mr. Chairman, we feel just the 
opposite. This is going to aid the general deterrence because it is 
going to need a more speedy process of justice and we are going 
to be able to bring the accused before the courts more quickly.
<P>
	Also, at the present time a lot of cases where there is more 
than $1,000 stolen are still brought before the provincial court 
judges, because it may be a question of proof. How do you know 
he or she stole goods in the amount of, say, $3,500? We know he 
or she stole something so we will proceed with the theft under 
$1,000, or the theft of this particular item, when in fact more 
was taken. However no one really wants to bother adding to that 
because they feel that getting it through the provincial court 
system will be faster, that there will be competency and that 
justice will be served.
<P>
	Also, right now with theft, it is the violation of theft. Break 
and enter is a violation of an individual, not only materially but 
also a violation psychologically. Anyone who has had their 
home robbed or any of their possessions stolen feels they have 
been violated. It does not matter what was taken because that 
violation is there. The fact is that the feeling of the public 
against theft is very strong and they want these people brought 
to justice and punished. In the opinion of the Department of 
Justice this process can be achieved through these changes, and 
in fact will be enhanced through these changes.

GOVERNMENT SERVICES ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-52, an act to establish the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services and to amend and repeal certain acts, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee; and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix):</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, 
for allowing me to finish my speech on Bill C-52.
<P>
	As I was saying before question period, it has cost the 
government $5 billion to contract out in 1992-93. This money 
that the government of Canada spent on contracting-out could 
have been used to improve the services provided to the Canadian 
public instead of maintaining a patronage relationship with the 
friends of the regime.
<P>
	Let me tell you that between 1984-85 and 1992-93, costs 
have gone up with contracting-out. Costs have increased by 56 
per cent at Public Works Canada during the same nine-year 
period. They increased by 114.2 per cent at DND and by 207 per 
cent at Health and Welfare Canada. Costs also increased at 
Supply and Services Canada-by 247 per cent. And, to really 
cap it, they increased by 628 per cent at Customs and Excise.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	In ten years, while under pressure by the Auditor General and 
the House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Accounts 
to do so, the federal  government never managed to demonstrate 
that contracting-out was cost-effective. The Department of 
Public Works and Government Services is a major department. 
It handles a great deal of money. Let me give you a few 
examples.
<P>
	Public Works and Government Services Canada is responsible 
for the inflow and outflow of all public funds and keeps an 
average daily cash balance of $2.3 million. It is also responsible 
for the accounting system and makes financial transactions 
totalling $163 million. It makes payments to the tune of $200 
million annually for the Canada Pension Plan, the old age 
security system, taxes on goods and services, Public Service 
employees' pay, and so on.
<P>
	It is also responsible for federal purchases. Last year, $13 
billion-worth of goods and services falling into 17,000 different 
classes were purchased. It negotiates 175,000 contracts every 
year. It is the custodian of federal real property. It owns property 
valued at $6.5 billion. It provides office space to approximately 
170,000 employees, in 4,000 different locations. It spends $2 
billion a year.
<P>
	How can we ensure that the government will not use 
contracting-out or privatization contracts to reward its friends? 
In other words, how can we avoid any kind of patronage in the 
awarding of privatization or other contracts by the federal 
government?
<P>
	Bill C-52 should have more teeth. This is the Bloc 
Quebecois's proposal: We ask that a public review board be 
created under the bill to scrutinize contracts awarded by the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services and to 
ensure openness.
<P>
	Second, we ask that a contracting-out code be clearly defined 
in this bill.
<P>
	Third, we demand that members of Parliament of all political 
stripes be consulted about and kept informed of the government 
contract awarding process involving the ridings they represent.
<P>
	Fourth and last proposal: We ask that the Department of 
Public Works and Government Services produce regular 
statements-monthly reports-to open up the federal 
government contracting process. The problem with this bill is 
that members of Parliament cannot find out which government 
contracts directly affect their ridings. There is no way to make 
federal officials accountable for contract-generated or in-house 
expenditures-to make them denounce any waste of public 
funds.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6530"> 6530 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill should also provide for elimination of advance 
payments such as those we discovered recently at 
Communications Canada.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	This bill must also protect the government because it left the 
door wide open to lobbyists. It does not allow a sufficient degree 
of openness. Not too long ago in this House, the hon. member for 
Richelieu moved a motion to prevent companies, stakeholders 
and lobbyists from contributing to the government's election 
fund. Unfortunately, this motion was rejected by the Liberal 
government and by many Reform members.
<P>
	I think that lobbyists who occasionally attend $1,000-a-head 
dinners given by the Prime Minister have a right to expect the 
government to pay them back.
<P>
	For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois proposes setting up 
a three-party public review board whose elected members 
would come from all political parties represented in and 
officially recognized by the House of Commons, from public 
administration experts and from Auditor General officials. The 
government should use this bill to give itself additional audit 
authority.
<P>
	These are certainly the most important openness criteria the 
government should set for itself.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my colleague talked about sub-contracting and 
reported on some abuses that he saw in the last government. That 
is exactly one of the reasons why Canadians throughout the 
country decided to throw the former government out.
<P>
	It is also because of the concerns we have that we-my 
colleague and I and other hon. members-are reviewing the 
issue of contracting out, to ensure that it is fair, equitable and 
open.
<P>
	I have a very important question to ask the hon. member. He 
talks about openness, fairness, balance, etc. I wonder if he 
knows that the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services invited all members of this House to subscribe to the 
open bidding service and to the publication on government 
procurement? The reason I ask this question is that he could find 
the answers to many if not all the questions he raised if he 
subscribed to those services which are provided by the minister.
<P>
	Now, if I am right, and I just checked, so I think that I am 
probably right, no member of the Bloc has subscribed to this 
service. I did not check for yesterday and today, but as of last 
Friday. When my colleague talks about honesty, openness and 
fairness, why did he not subscribe to these services offered by 
the minister so that he can see for himself whether or not we 
have been fair? Why did he not do it or why did some of his 
colleagues not accept this service? Openness, fairness and 
honesty are there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, I went through the process 
with the department in question to be able to  subscribe to the 
service which the member, Mr. Duhamel, mentioned. They told 
me that it would cost $500 a year to have access to that 
information. Also, something which the member did not say is 
that-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is probably simply an 
oversight but I just want us to remember that we cannot name 
one another in this House; we must refer to other members by 
their titles or the constituencies they represent.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Asselin:</B> The member for St. Boniface mentioned that we 
can always go to the library or the public information service, 
but it is a real maze, even for members of Parliament. My 
colleague, the member for Québec-Est, and I will soon 
subscribe.
<P>
	But on the subject of openness, the member should understand 
that if the minister cannot promise to accept the lowest bidder 
who meets the conditions, it is a little less open; it becomes 
rather vague.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the English translation of my colleague's remarks in 
which he was saying that MPs should be consulted and informed 
on the awarding of government contracts in their ridings. I trust 
that was a correct translation.
<P>
	I have no difficulty with the idea of being informed. However, 
if it is a matter of consultation, does the member opposite not 
see a danger that it will be perceived that politicians, MPs, are 
interfering with what should be an open process and putting 
political weight on what should be a completely non-partisan 
question?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, very recently at a meeting of the 
government operations committee, a government member told 
the committee about an experience he just had in his riding.
<P>
	He had not been warned by the minister or any official, but 
fortunately, since he cares about his riding, he read a public 
notice from the department saying that the government was 
looking for a place to relocate the post office in his riding. The 
member intervened with the department and helped save a 
million dollars in this transaction.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
I draw to the attention of the hon. member, to continue with the 
question of my colleague opposite, that the very thought of 
members of Parliament being advised of or being part of a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6531"> 6531 </A></B>
<P>
bidding process is exactly the wrong direction. It is everything 
that could possibly be wrong with politics in my view.
<P>
	We have no business being part of what is going on in the 
bidding process or anything of that nature concerning the 
spending of public money in our ridings. If we were in different 
ridings it might be a different situation, but in our own ridings it 
is something we should not be touching with a 10-foot pole, in 
my estimation.
<P>
	Another point I raise with my colleagues is that of always 
going to the lowest bidder. It is normal business practice to be 
very careful to make the best purchase, which is not always the 
lowest bidder. I suspect there has to be some flexibility, because 
in business practice and experience I am familiar with price is an 
important factor but not the only factor in awarding a contract. 
Could I be favoured with a response from the member.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question is twofold. First, I said 
that it should be standard procedure for a member to be informed 
of the goods or services which may be provided under a 
government contract or by contracting out, in his or her riding.
<P>
	Members of this House are consulted; they have to vote and 
participate in the proceedings. When we are working in our 
ridings it is our duty to make representations. It is not a question 
of sticking our noses in the government's affairs, but we should 
at least be made aware of what is going on in our ridings.
<P>
	Secondly, we discussed the issue of the lowest valid bid. What 
needed to be included should have been clearly mentioned in the 
specifications. If that was done in the first place and a bid is 
found to be valid, it is valid based on those specifications. Then, 
to accept the lowest valid bid is, in my opinion, to properly 
manage public money.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, given the government's strong commitment to 
improving the efficiency of government operations and to 
deficit control and reduction, the amalgamation of common 
services embodied in Bill C-52 makes eminent sense to me.
<P>
	It has been clearly demonstrated that one of the primary 
causes of waste and confusion is the unnecessary duplication of 
services and functions both within the government and between 
levels of government.
<P>
	In these times we simply cannot afford to have human and 
financial resources diverted to performing tasks throughout 
many departments and agencies of government when such tasks 
can be more effectively and much more cost effectively handled 
through a central agency.
<P>
	This is the primary rationale behind the creation of the new 
Department of Public Works and Government Services Canada. 
Although it is just about a year since the amalgamation began, a 
number of efficiencies and savings have already become 
apparent. There will undoubtedly be many more such savings in 
the years  ahead as the benefits of this integrated approach take 
full force.
<P>
	Public Works and Government Services Canada provide 
common services to more than 150 federal departments, 
agencies and crown corporations. It provides them with a wide 
range of services to meet their needs, including property 
management, communications, printing and publishing, 
translation, architectural and engineering services.
<P>
	It also looks after the issuing of all Government of Canada 
payments and undertakes billions of dollars worth of 
procurement on behalf of its clients each and every year. In 
short, Public Works and Government Services Canada is there to 
look after thousands of administrative transactions daily on 
behalf of its clients so that individual departments can focus all 
their time and energies on their own programs and priorities. To 
me this is a very good thing.
<P>
	The amalgamation of the four founding elements of the new 
department, that is the former departments of Public Works 
Canada and Supply and Services Canada, as well as the 
government telecommunications agency and the translation 
bureau, has already paved the way for efficiencies of operation. 
For example, the corporate services areas of the individual 
components are being integrated. Corporate services encompass 
such central functions as finance, administration, corporate 
planning, contract claims resolutions and security, among other 
areas.
<P>
	When taking into consideration the operational reviews that 
have been carried out and the recommendations, as well as the 
new systems to be implemented and the amalgamation, these 
initiatives will result in the savings of expenditures totalling 
$180 million over five years from the date of amalgamation. 
This sounds good to me.
<P>
	Regional operations have also been integrated and the total 
number of regional offices reduced from 10 to 6, again another 
cost cutting service. This has been achieved with no less service 
to client departments or, most important, to the general public. 
Clearly the new integrated Department of Public Works and 
Government Services has already demonstrated that it can 
provide a more comprehensive service to the government and, 
more important, at a considerable cost saving to the taxpayer.
<P>
	While the efficiencies that Public Works and Government 
Services can effect within its own organization are substantial, 
they represent only a small part of the story. By bringing 
together the experience and expertise of the component 
organizations we are creating within the department a centre of 
expertise more extensive and more skilled than we have ever had 
in the past.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6532"> 6532 </A></B>
<P>
	This in turn will help create savings and efficiencies not only 
in the Department of Public Works and Government Services 
but through all government departments and all agencies.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	The department will facilitate government-wide savings by 
providing re-engineered systems for use by all departments. 
Such sophisticated systems as electronic procurement and 
settlement, automated biowork station, a travel escort system 
and so forth will provide throughout the government 
streamlined processes, better ways of delivering services, 
rational resource allocation and more savings.
<P>
	In its central position with close links to all departments and 
agencies, Public Works and Government Services can and will 
play a leading role in many government initiatives aimed at cost 
cutting and the reduction of duplication.
<P>
	For example, the department is very actively involved in the 
government initiative known as locally shared support services. 
The basic idea of this initiative is to consolidate service and 
reduce costs by having departments and agencies located in the 
same building or complexes share certain physical support 
services. Again this is a very good idea, one-stop shopping for 
all.
<P>
	These might include such functions as security, mail room or 
facility management. Individually, these arrangements may be 
quite small, but taken collectively over hundreds of federal 
installations all across Canada, they can add up to many millions 
of dollars in savings to Canadian taxpayers. Again, I would hope 
the House would see this is a very good thing and a very good 
idea, one worth our full support.
<P>
	Public Works and Government Services has organized to 
support and encourage this initiative through its regional 
delivery network. It has identified two phases to implementing 
this scheme. In the first phase large departments, including 
Public Works and Government Services itself, will make use of 
their size, their regional representation and economies of scale. 
They will offer their services to smaller departments.
<P>
	In the second phase re-engineering and integration of 
electronic services will be added. This phase will provide 
telecommunication and informatics infrastructure, office 
automation and video conferencing as well as total office 
support facilities similar to those in the private sector.
<P>
	A number of these innovative initiatives are already being 
pilot tested during this current fiscal year. Certain economies 
have already been put into place across the country such as 
sharing of reception services and joint management of 
storerooms and warehouse facilities.
<P>
	The point is that the creation of the Department of Public 
Works and Government Services through the amalgamation of 
most of the government common service agencies will not only 
help Public Works and Government Services to make substantial 
cost efficiencies  within its own organization, it will also create 
a consolidated centre of expertise and leadership that can help 
scores of departments and agencies throughout the government 
introduce similar economies to their own operations.
<P>
	This will add up to hundreds of millions of dollars in savings 
to Canadian taxpayers in the years ahead. This is reason enough 
for all of us in the House to support this legislation and to give 
speedy passage to Bill C-52.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member who just spoke. 
As regards this bill, we are not opposed to the idea of trying to do 
more with less money. We do not oppose to that principle; on the 
contrary, the Bloc Quebecois favours such an approach by the 
government. However, this legislation is nothing more than a 
bunch of old sections from various acts which are put together to 
amalgamate old departments into a single one, under a new 
name. Can the hon. member tell us just what is new in this bill? 
Can she tell us if there is anything new to give more 
transparency to that department which, in the old days, was 
known as the patronage department? Is there anything new in 
this bill to promote that transparency which we have heard so 
much about since the beginning of the 35th Parliament?
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no question the 
government is committed to open, fair and transparent access to 
the procurement process. That is why the Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services offered to all members an 
invitation to join in the open bidding process in the government 
business opportunities publication.
<P>
	With this system subscribers get instant access to contract 
opportunities, notices of planned sole source contracts and 
notices of contract awards. It also offers contract histories 
which are information on contracts that have been awarded in 
the past, to whom and for what amount.
<P>
	I would respectfully say that you cannot get much more open 
than this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with 
the member that $180 million after five years is certainly the 
direction the government should be going. However I happen to 
note that is against a $2.3 billion per year budget.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6533"> 6533 </A></B>
<P>
	I did some quick mathematics. I believe we are talking about 
an 8 per cent reduction after a full five-year period. Does the 
member not think there is a little bit more in the system that can 
be squeezed out than taking five years to get only an 8 per cent 
reduction in the budget?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is quite 
right. If that was all we were going to save, then perhaps he 
would be right about 8 per cent. But I would totally disagree that 
it is all that is going to be saved.
<P>
	Quite realistically we are talking about a number of things 
here. We are talking about an integrated approach. We are 
talking about a one-stop shopping centre, so to speak, that will 
make it easier for our constituents, yours and mine. We are 
talking about same housing.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I just want to remind all 
members, although it may not be critical in this debate today, but 
the best practice has been established and we try to remind one 
another to direct all remarks through the Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Mr. Speaker, one major thing is the 
expertise that is going to be housed together and able to do 
things quite uniquely. Those are all benefits.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member across the way that by the year 2005 
we will save $1 billion. This is truly going to be a real cost 
saving initiative. It is also more than that. It is going to be a truly 
new initiative. It will plunge us into the next century.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to direct one remark to the member for 
Guelph-Wellington. The good news I heard in her remarks was 
that these changes will eliminate much of the duplication of 
services between the federal government and the provinces.
<P>
	Would the member agree that this will eliminate one of the 
primary sources of friction between the federal government and 
the provinces, and that provinces like Alberta and Quebec, for 
example, should be very happy?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Mr. Speaker, I definitely think this is 
going to go a long way to address many of the concerns that 
provincial governments have raised with the federal 
government. I appreciate my colleague bringing that up.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I want 
to make a suggestion to you, Mr. Speaker. When the Bloc 
member spoke earlier, he said that the system set up by the 
minister cost $500 to each member of Parliament. Since that 
figure seemed very high, I went to check on it and I was told that 
the figure is only $37. Consequently, I-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I am sorry 
but this is really not a point of order. It may be an issue to discuss 
and I am sure we can look at it later. Questions and comments. 
Debate. The hon. member for Kootenay East.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is always 
nice to be able to say something positive about the direction in 
which the government is going. In this instance I believe that it 
is going in the right direction in terms of consolidation, 
efficiency and savings.
<P>
	In fairness to Canadians who have suffered loss of real income 
over the last five years and who may have been displaced or have 
had members in their families displaced-many Canadians have 
had to scramble to survive-there must be an understandable 
lack of sympathy. I can understand the lack of sympathy on the 
part of Canadians for systems within the government which are 
bloated and not efficient. However the government is going in 
the right direction.
<P>
	I also believe that within any workforce, whether it is the civil 
service or any industry, that when people are not efficiently 
producing they know it. When people are working at jobs that 
are dead end jobs and can see that they should be redeployed that 
they have this, I will call it, a antsyness, a feeling of discomfort 
in their place of work.
<P>
	In that place of work there is typically a lack of job 
satisfaction. Certainly there is a lack of a sense of security. I 
know I have been in situations from time to time in employment 
where it was obvious that the enterprise that I was in was going 
nowhere and that gives no sense of security. When we have a 
lack of direction from the top, a lack of statement of purpose and 
a lack of plan coming from the top, it exacerbates the situation.
<P>
	Yesterday in the House I raised the example of Parks Canada. 
We have a situation in my constituency where members of the 
Yoho National Park-only 90 people work there-are in a real 
dilemma. They do not have any idea of what is going on. The top 
people in the parks department do not have any idea what is 
going on either.
<P>
	All sorts of things are being proposed. For example, in 
clearing the highway which is the major project for the park in 
the winter, it is now proposed that the whole operation be moved 
to Lake Louise. What does that do to the businesses in Golden? 
What does it do in terms of the efficiency? It is also proposed 
that the head office be moved to Jasper. What does that mean? 
The picture I am trying to paint is the situation all over the map.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6534"> 6534 </A></B>
<P>
	When we have a downsizing challenge, whether it has to do 
with the issues covered specifically by Bill C-52 or all of 
government, I submit that the government must be prepared to 
take one step. That one step must be specific, it must be incisive 
like a razor, but above all it must be part of a total plan.
<P>
	With great respect to the Liberal frontbench, to this point I get 
no idea of an incisive, total plan. As a consequence the civil 
service right from the bottom to the top is saying: ``When is the 
shoe going to drop? Is it going to be me? What is going to 
happen?''
<P>
	I suspect that members from British Columbia are aware of 
the fact that they will be getting letters, that they will be getting 
petitions from people within the civil service. I cannot speak for 
the rest of Canada but I can say as far as British Columbia is 
concerned, many of us are receiving representations from the 
federal civil service saying: ``What is going on? What is going 
to happen next?''
<P>
	There is a tremendous feeling of insecurity. If I could do 
anything I would encourage the frontbench to get on with a total 
plan and more important, to communicate what that plan is once 
they have actually got it together. The current fear and anxiety 
within the federal civil service is leading naturally to a loss of 
productivity.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	A couple of minutes ago, I raised the issue that there will be 
$180 million saved on a $2.3 billion budget after five years. I 
repeat that the government is going in the right direction but the 
problem is it is taking rather mincing steps.
<P>
	I would like to read an excerpt from a speech given by the 
chairman of the board of the Canadian Imperial Bank of 
Commerce on February 15 in Halifax. Considering that this 
person is responsible for countless billions of dollars in assets 
and has tens of thousands of employees in one of the major 
banks in Canada, he has a tremendous sense of the direction 
Canada is going. I suggest we listen rather carefully to this 
excerpt from his speech.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is all too easy to think that debt is a government problem, but it is not. The 
debt does not cost governments; it costs Canadian taxpayers. Canadians pay for 
the debt directly every day in interest paid from taxes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Before I carry on I want to underline the point that this is not 
the Reform Party speaking, although it sounds like it. This is the 
chairman of the board of the Canadian Imperial Bank of 
Commerce. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The per capita annual interest charge is about $2,200 from tax revenues; 
$2,200 per Canadian goes to pay interest on accumulated debt. Before a single 
dollar of income is redistributed, before a dime goes to social programs, before 
a penny is spent on any other government program $2,200 must be paid yearly 
in interest for each and every person in Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Are you listening? Remember, this amount-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, order. If I want to 
take every occasion you present me with I will try  to react. In 
terms of speaking to one another, the word you or in French the 
word vous totally excludes the Speaker. I really love my work 
and I like to be included and wish I could sometimes be even 
more involved.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your intervention. All 
of us are on a learning curve. I certainly am as one of the new 
people here and I appreciate your comment.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Remember the amount of $2,200 is needed from each one of us just to pay the 
interest on the debt. We are not even touching the principal. As a result, the 
cumulative debt of the federal and provincial levels of government is growing at 
a rate of $60 billion a year and the compounding continues. The pattern has 
persisted for years. Is calling this situation a fiscal cancer an overstatement? What 
would you call it?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And let us remember: Politicians did not do this. Governments did not do this. 
Civil servants did not do this. We prosperous, peaceful, common sense Canadians 
did this to ourselves.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whatever the party or prime minister or finance minister, the Government of 
Canada has not had a single balanced budget in 20 years. During the same period 
there have been scores of budgets in the provinces. Relatively few provincial 
treasuries have forecast a balanced budget and only rarely have they achieved 
their targets.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Of course, we have had elections; 83 different occasions on which the people 
could exercise their democratic right to choose national and provincial 
governments. We had all those opportunities to change policy directions. We 
have elected Liberal, Progressive Conservative, New Democrat, Social Credit 
and Parti Quebecois governments. We have given them variously majority or 
minority mandates. We have even had from time to time intense national debates 
about debt and deficits, but our total debt has continued to soar even higher.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	He talks about Canadians and says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We have only ourselves to blame. Most experienced politicians, I would 
guess a solid majority in every cabinet in the country, will confess privately that 
there is no constituency for cutting spending. Canadians may be in favour of 
cutting somebody else's special interest spending but not their own. The result 
has been an endless procession of impossibly conflicting instructions to our 
political leadership: Cut spending, but not on this; save money, but not on that.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I like this guy. He goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Pity our politicians. It would have taken the wisdom of Solomon and the 
patience of Job to respond to such a conflicting cry and neither of them had to 
get elected.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Government spending problems are too often oversimplified as being a 
question of inefficiency. Some say that the problem can be resolved by reducing 
spending in all current categories. That would help but it is only the beginning. 
The real problem is that many government programs are outdated and it is not 
just that we are spending too much, it is that we are spending on the wrong 
things.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The real problem in my judgment is that we as politicians 
have a responsibility to talk straight to our constituents. During 
the last election it perplexed me whenever the Reform Party 
would talk straight and say we must drive the deficit to zero in as 
quick a period of time as possible that we were attacked by the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6535"> 6535 </A></B>
<P>
Liberals  and the Progressive Conservatives as being the slash 
and spend and hack and cut party.
<P>
	The reality is that we in Canada are at the wall. We have 
managed to get away with this infrastructure spending, or 
should I say borrowing, this transfer of intergenerational debt to 
my grandchildren who I have never seen and are not even born 
and their descendants, all for the sake of some election 
sloganeering.
<P>
	It is the responsibility of all politicians no matter what their 
stripe to generate a culture of acceptance to the fact that it is 
going to hurt. It is going to hurt me, it is going to hurt you, Mr. 
Speaker, and it is going to hurt the people who are listening to 
this debate or reading it in <I>Hansard</I>. It is going to hurt. We 
fundamentally have a choice of doing it to ourselves under our 
control, or letting some external force do it to us.
<P>
	Today the finance minister stood in this place and very 
forcefully and very eloquently said: ``We will maintain 
control''. How can you maintain control when you continue to 
spend $110 million a day more than you have coming in? It is 
impossible. You cannot maintain control in a world where there 
is such a thing as compound interest and in this instance 
compound debt. When we are spending $110 million a day that 
we do not have, we are simply transferring what we are doing in 
1994 to somebody way out there somewhere else.
<P>
	I conclude my comments with a quick review. Bill C-52 is 
going in the right direction for all of the right reasons. If you will 
pardon me for nit-picking, I happened to notice in our review 
that a part of the purpose was that the deputy minister be 
appointed by cabinet.
<P>
	It strikes me that the deputy ministers of all departments are 
people of great importance and strength. They give direction to 
their departments and strong counsel to their ministers. I 
suggest that the deputy minister not just in Bill C-52 but in other 
bills should appear before the standing committee. There should 
be more public scrutiny because more and more power is falling 
into the hands of the top civil servants. That would be a healthy 
thing to do.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	In summary we are going in the right direction with Bill C-52. 
I do support that direction. I do see all of the things the last 
member was talking about, but it is not good enough by a long 
shot. We as politicians must generate a culture of acceptance of 
the fact that we are living beyond our means. We must be 
straight up with our voters. We must convince Canadians that we 
will be able to go in the right direction.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before questions and 
comments it is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform 
the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Rosedale-Gun control; the hon. member for 
Verchères-Customs tariffs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Mr. Speaker, in his 
comments at the conclusion of his speech the hon. member said 
that we should be straight up with Canadians and I agree.
<P>
	If his party formed the government today, would that 
member's government also be spending more than it took in? 
The question clearly relates to the fact that no matter which 
party was forming the government the government expenditures 
and the deficit clearly were going to take more than one year to 
be dealt with. Yet the member continues to harp as if the Reform 
Party somehow would magically eliminate this if it were the 
government. Could the member answer this simple question: 
Would the Reform Party also be spending more than it took in?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> That is a valid question. Of course we would. 
One cannot just simply go hack, slash, bump and that is the end 
of it.
<P>
	However a plan that after three years this government will 
owe an additional $100 billion in debt is absolutely the wrong 
direction. What we would have at the end of three years is we 
would not be going further into debt. Canada cannot afford it. 
The Canadian public intuitively in the back of their minds know 
it. They are just waiting for some politicians to be open, up 
front, honest, candid and frank with them and get on with the job 
that will have to be done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad the 
member for Kootenay East wants to be open and frank.
<P>
	Our government has constantly talked about bringing the 
deficit to 3 per cent of gross domestic product. That is a plan, 
that is a direction and that is something the Minister of Finance 
is committed to. As we talk about social program review which 
is coming up tomorrow, we are going to have a plan on the table 
with different directions of where we are going to go with our 
social spending.
<P>
	We want to talk about being honest. Why does the member not 
come across here and say: ``What are we going to do without 
employment insurance? Are we going to do away with it? Are 
we going to do away with all our social programs? Are we going 
to reduce old age pensions?'' That is the kind of honesty he is 
talking about. Let us hear him say those things.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, the government currently has a 
plan to go another $100 billion into debt over the next three 
years with this 3 per cent figure it is talking about. It has no 
commitment to reduce the deficit to zero. It has a commitment 
only to reduce it to 3 per cent.
<P>
	I heard it said by the late Kim Campbell, that is late in a 
political sense, during the last election that there was not any 
problem. If she managed to get the overspending down to 
whatever the number was it was fine, it was going to be balanced 
books because we did not have to go out and borrow money. 
Then after actually analyzing what she was talking about, she 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6536"> 6536 </A></B>
<P>
was going to be using  Canada pension plan contributions. She 
was going to be using the actual cash flow, the input that was 
coming into the government. That same kind of fuzzy thinking 
has managed to spill over. Maybe there is something unusual 
about that side of the House. When people move from this side, 
which is where most cabinet ministers were in the last House, to 
the other side and get cabinet positions somehow a fuzziness 
seems to set in.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	The reality is that there is no commitment on the part of the 
government to control overspending. I will not call it the deficit 
because that is confusing. The deficit is simply how much more 
is spent than is taken in.
<P>
	With respect to the question of targets let us talk about UI. 
Right now the minister of human resources is going around 
trying to fly all sorts of trial balloons. The Reform Party 
principle is very simple and very straightforward. It is called 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Unfortunately all politicians in the House over the last 20 
years have forgotten the word insurance. Insurance works on an 
actuarial basis that it is not going to be used as some kind of low 
grade social program. Therein lies the problem. Even today the 
minister and the government are working through a UI revision 
as though they are revising a low grade social program. They are 
not putting it into the arena where it should be, which is 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	I have a lot of other comments but the bottom line to the 
exercise is that there is no simple answer to the problem. I am 
prepared to say to the people of Canada that it is going to hurt. 
We can either do it ourselves or we can have it done to us. As 
long as we continue to add $100 billion to the debt of the nation 
and as long as we continue to spend $110 million every day, we 
are not solving the problem. We are just digging the hole deeper.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would have a question for my hon. colleague from the 
Reform Party who made a remarkable speech. Our colleague 
tells us that real politicians would tell us that it is going to hurt. I 
agree up to a certain point. Now, who will this hurt?
<P>
	At present, some people avoid paying tax on billions of 
dollars by using family trusts and tax havens. Here is my 
question: Is my hon. colleague prepared to hurt these people too, 
so that all members of our society pay their share?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have had the privilege of moving 
to the finance committee which has been very instructive. There 
is a myth, an absolutely gigantic myth, that somehow billions of 
dollars are squirrelled away and that if we could get our hands on 
them we would solve the whole deficit and debt problem. The 
myth that was originated by the NDP unfortunately is being 
perpetuated by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	The plain fact of the matter is that family trusts have to do 
with capital gains. Family trusts pay taxes on earnings. Family 
trusts pay current taxes on interest. Family trusts do not pay tax 
on accrued capital gains until they are disposed of by the family 
trust. The myth continuously put forward by the Bloc is that they 
never pay or they are going to roll forward. The fact of the 
matter is that they will be paid in exactly the same way as any 
other individual pays them.
<P>
	It is instructive to be sitting on that committee as they 
continue to try to put forward the myth that there is some kind of 
simple, magical equation, some kind of a simple answer, 
because there is not.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	I come back to the same thing. It is going to hurt all 
Canadians. In further response to the member's question, the 
reality is that if we do not control this the people who will be 
hurt the most are those who can afford it the least. We have to 
target the meagre resources we presently have to make sure 
those people who have the least get the most in terms of help.
<P>
	I do not think major industrialists and people who would have 
these countless millions of dollars in family trusts to which the 
Bloc keeps referring need the help of the social program. It is the 
intention and the direction of the Reform Party to protect those 
who need protection the most.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-52 
combines previously dispersed functions in government into the 
new Department of Public Works and Government Services. At 
first sight it is a technical bill, a necessary but technical piece of 
legislation to make the combinations. It is becoming apparent 
from the debate that there is more to the legislation than that. 
The bill is part of the government's effort to streamline the 
system of government in Canada, to make government a better 
servant of the public. It is for that reason I am very pleased to 
have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-52.
<P>
	Part of the platform that saw the election of the government 
was a firm commitment to government renewal, reforming away 
government works to restore confidence among Canadians in 
their leaders and institutions. At the same time there was an 
equal commitment to reducing the cost and increasing the 
effectiveness of government to lower the deficit and relieve 
Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	The bill, along with several others introduced in the House in 
recent weeks, is tailored to meet both those commitments. 
Merging the former departments of public works and supply and 
services, the telecommunications agency and the translation 
bureau through Bill C-52 permits a more streamlined, 
responsive service by government while reducing the costs of 
doing the taxpayer's business. The amalgamation will assist 
deficit reduc-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6537"> 6537 </A></B>
<P>
tion by cost savings in the order of $180 million by the year 
1998.
<P>
	The legislation also lives up to the government's commitment 
to restore confidence in the administration. Other members 
referred to the tremendous task the new department must 
perform. An annual cash flow of $1.4 trillion, purchasing $10 
billion worth of products and services in a year, 175,000 
contracts per year, and managing $6.5 billion worth of real 
estate are now under one government department. What is 
remarkable about the legislation is that it creates a single 
organization under one minister to perform all this work.
<P>
	Thus not only client government departments and agencies 
but the vast community of Canadian firms doing business with 
government can deal with a single agency. One minister and one 
management team will provide the focus and direction as well as 
the forum to see that both client and supplier interests are 
served. This is truly one-stop government shopping for 
Canadian business.
<P>
	Rest assured that the new department is dedicated to serving 
both the interests of its client departments and the interests of 
the business community. The business community embraces all 
sizes and types of Canadian firms. Their competitiveness is vital 
to a strong, innovative Canadian economy.
<P>
	That is why in carrying out the many large and small 
purchases on behalf of government the new department attempts 
at all times to remain innovative and up to date, maintaining best 
practices in dealing with suppliers and managing its affairs to 
encourage innovation and competitiveness among Canadian 
businesses.
<P>
	That is why the bill rewrites previous legislation to provide 
flexibility which permits the use of purchasing to assist in 
achieving the strategic objectives of government, for example 
penetration of foreign markets by small and medium sized 
Canadian businesses.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	While the new department strives to meet its primary 
objectives of efficient and effective services to government, it is 
guided in its purchasing practices by the principles of 
competition, equality of treatment and openness.
<P>
	Where possible, contracts are awarded through competitive, 
open bidding. Uniform conditions and evaluation criteria are 
applied to all bidders. To remain competitive suppliers and 
potential suppliers must be informed and up to date on 
government requirements. They must know not only what is 
coming up by way of demand but also the rules and regulations 
they must comply with.
<P>
	The new department uses various means to provide such 
information and assistance. One of the newest and most 
innovative is the open bidding service which was referred to and 
explained briefly by the member for Guelph-Wellington when 
she spoke earlier. The open bidding service provides around the 
clock electronic information and assistance to suppliers 
anywhere in Canada, any suppliers that have access to telephone 
lines. It provides subscribers with all the information they  need 
to make an informed bidding decision in government 
procurement opportunities. They no longer need to be included 
on a government source list or await an invitation to bid.
<P>
	This sort of a process is very welcomed by small businesses in 
small communities outside the Ottawa circuit such as my riding 
of Peterborough. Subscribers can review opportunities in their 
product or service areas and order bid documents for those they 
are interested in. Documents are forwarded as quickly as 
possible by the chosen delivery method, be it fax, mail or 
courier. Current contract award information as well as 
information on past contract awards are available to subscribers 
of the service.
<P>
	Other departments and crown corporations, as well as the 
governments of Alberta and Ontario, have decided to use this 
open bidding service to advertise their contract needs. This 
significantly broadens the market available to suppliers through 
a single information source. Open bidding is the aim of the 
publication entitled ``Government Business Opportunities'' 
which is issued three times a week.
<P>
	I was somewhat bemused by the earlier criticism of the 
minister and the bill through suggestions that government 
purchasing practices were not open enough and more 
information should be provided. I really do not understand the 
distorted view of reality that could trigger such a complaint.
<P>
	Federal government purchasing is already scrutinized by 
Parliament, the Treasury Board, the Auditor General, the 
Canadian Internal Trade Tribunal, the Contract Claims 
Resolution Board, all the mass media, the suppliers themselves 
and the taxpaying public. On top of all that, all purchasing 
requirements valued at $25,000 or more are posted on the open 
bidding service I just described. As well, construction, 
maintenance, architecture and engineering opportunities valued 
at $60,000 or more are so posted. When sole source contracts are 
necessary, information is carried both on the open bidding 
service and through the ``Government Business Opportunities'' 
publication.
<P>
	The Minister of Public Works and Government Services has 
gone to even greater lengths to ensure open and easy access to 
contracting information. He has written to all members of 
Parliament, as every member of Parliament who checks the mail 
knows, urging them to subscribe to the open bidding service. 
The parliamentary secretary just gave some information on the 
cost of this service. Following that suggestion would certainly 
better equip members of Parliament to serve their constituents 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6538"> 6538 </A></B>
<P>
than contributing to the paper burden by tabling tons of material 
on 175,000 government contracts.
<P>
	We live in an electronic age. Canadian citizens and businesses 
are rapidly adapting to the evolving information highway. 
Members who complain about lack of information might well be 
advised to catch up. Subscribing to the open bidding services 
would be one step.
<P>
	The Bloc also expressed some concern over the fact that 
riding by riding stats were not available for contracting activity 
in the new department.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	The simple fact is that Public Works and Government 
Services does not keep information based on riding. Since the 
amalgamation of these various government services the 
department systems are not integrated. Further, several searches 
of both the manual and electronic data bases showed that all the 
systems are out of date or in need of upgrading. As a result, the 
department at this time simply cannot produce such reports, that 
is reports based on riding, in its routine operations.
<P>
	Further, we must all realize that riding-based activity is not 
always accurate and at times it is downright misleading.
<P>
	For example, consider the case of the two large oil companies, 
Imperial Oil and Petro-Canada. These companies bill all 
government purchases, close to $300 million per year, through 
their Ottawa offices regardless of where those purchases occur, 
whether they occur elsewhere in Canada or abroad. Rather than 
compile and publish misleading riding-based statistics, the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services actually 
does something real about an even distribution of regional 
benefits from government purchasing. Wherever feasible within 
the confines of agreements such as the North American Free 
Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade, regional benefits are given a high priority when 
evaluating bids for major government projects.
<P>
	Examples of regional benefits are not hard to find: $1.2 
billion of the Canadian patrol frigate contract to Saint John 
Shipbuilding in New Brunswick, $40 million of the Canadian 
Forces supply system upgrade contract to SHL Systemhouse in 
Ottawa, $16 million of the North Warning System contract to a 
Richmond, B.C. firm, and so on with other regional benefits 
wherever they are possible.
<P>
	Further evidence of this minister's desire to keep purchasing 
practices open and fair was his decision that contingency fees 
have no legitimate place in government procurement and the 
introduction of a new contract clause is aimed at eliminating 
them. Bidders are now required to certify that they have not 
hired a lobbyist to solicit award of the contract where any part of 
the payment to the lobbyist depends on the client obtaining the 
contract.
<P>
	Another example: The minister has introduced major 
improvements in contracting methods for advertising and public 
opinion research. There were no effective  guidelines to 
purchase such sensitive services in the past. The media and the 
public have long perceived the practice to be open to abuse and 
political patronage. For the first time new guidelines have been 
approved by cabinet bringing the procurement of advertising 
and public opinion research under similar rules of fairness and 
openness to those governing all government procurement.
<P>
	These new guidelines, the new open bidding service and the 
new lobbyist clause, are all evidence of the determination of this 
government to reintroduce integrity and restore the faith of the 
public in our political and administrative systems.
<P>
	I think the evidence is clear. This government and this new 
department which is created through this bill support both the 
spirit and practice of good business in Canada to the benefit of 
government operations, the business community and Canadian 
taxpayers alike.
<P>
	I conclude by saying that Bill C-52 is far more than an 
effective highly technical piece of legislation combining under 
one roof previous government services. It is a fine example of 
this government's commitment to openness and fairness to 
Canadian business.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the hon. member was in the House earlier when 
we were told, in response to a question, that the bill the hon. 
member just commented on prevented some overlapping with 
other provinces. Basically, that is the spirit of non-overlapping 
that we advocate in the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Here is my first question. What is there exactly in this bill to 
specifically preclude this kind of overlapping?
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	I have another question for the hon. member. The Bloc 
Quebecois tabled a reasoned amendment on this subject. It reads 
as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``this House declines to give second reading to Bill C-52, an act to establish 
the Department of Public Works and Government Services and to amend and 
repeal certain acts, because the principle of the bill does not provide for a 
specific code of ethics to be put in place aimed at making transparent the 
contracting process and the acquisition of all goods and services by the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services Canada''.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6539"> 6539 </A></B>
<P>
	Does the hon. member agree with the idea of improving 
transparency through this bill? If he does, where exactly in the 
bill is this spirit of transparency fostered?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Adams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's 
comments.
<P>
	The answer is the same to both of his questions. As far as 
greater efficiency between the levels of government is 
concerned, I described the open bidding service. I mentioned 
that already the governments of Alberta and Ontario have joined 
in this electronic open bidding service which is available to 
every part of the country reached by telephone, which is 
virtually every part of the country. That is an example. That is a 
step toward greater efficiency between levels of government.
<P>
	It is my hope that the governments of other provinces will 
take advantage of this wonderful opportunity and will therefore 
make it even more efficient between federal and provincial 
levels.
<P>
	With regard to the matter of openness, I described as well as I 
could the open bidding procedure. This is a procedure which is 
available even to the smallest business. People have a telephone. 
The cost is not large. It lists forthcoming opportunities. It lists 
the results of previous contracts, in other words who obtained 
contracts for the previous weeks or months.
<P>
	This is something which is available in offices across the 
country. That is in addition to the thrice weekly publication of 
similar information which is also available, although I think I 
sense where the member is coming from, which is less easily 
available to many of our smaller firms.
<P>
	To answer his question about transparency, it does seem to me 
that one answer to his question is that the open bidding service is 
as transparent as it could be.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, our 
government took office a year ago with a very clear platform and 
very specific commitments to Canadians. We said that we 
wished to develop a country where efficient and innovative 
governments cooperate not only with one another but also with 
businesses, unions, educational institutions and others.
<P>
	We said that we wished to emphasize the concept of 
partnership in all our dealings. We are committed to making job 
creation and economic growth our top priorities. We promised to 
trim the deficit and to use iron discipline in bringing federal 
expenditures under control. We also said that we would restore 
public trust in the government's integrity.
<P>
	All our commitments and promises are reflected in the public 
works and government services minister's priorities and 
performance in the last 12 months.
<P>
	This department, which is responsible for most common 
services provided by the federal government,  worked hard to 
increase government efficiency, create partnerships and 
convince Canadians that the government is conducting its 
operations fairly, openly and in the public interest.
<P>
	The Department of Public Works and Government Services is 
in a good position to take up the challenge of providing effective 
services, establishing strong links and eliminating duplication 
in the provision of government services.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
In the area of efficiency and reduction of duplication of services, 
the amalgamation has already begun to pay dividends. During 
the past year there has been substantial progress in realizing the 
central corporate services of the department such as finance and 
administration and amalgamating these into a single operation 
which can serve the needs of the component sections of the 
department, but with significant savings in financial and human 
resources as well.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	A similar rationalization of resources has taken place at the 
regional level, again with substantial cost savings and reduction 
of duplication. Much work still remains in order to realize the 
full potential for savings through this process of amalgamation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The minister remains confident that he will be able to cut 
common services staff by more than 20 per cent in the next four 
years without reducing service levels for Public Works and 
Government Services Canada's client departments and 
agencies.
<P>
	The full process will generate overall savings of some $180 
million. This streamlining process is in line with the 
government's promise to cut waste and duplication and is a big 
help in meeting the government's commitment to fight the 
deficit through major cuts in public administration 
expenditures.
<P>
	Public Works and Government Services Canada has made 
steady progress toward the government's goal of reaching sound 
agreements with other levels of government, the private sector, 
its public service clients and the general population. Significant 
headway was made in intergovernmental co-operation last 
summer when the federal government and most provinces 
signed agreements to work together to reduce government costs.
<P>
	Public Works and Government Services Canada already 
works with the provinces to identify the areas where the two 
levels of government can work together to reduce duplication or, 
better yet, share services in the interest of our taxpayers.
<P>
	Some provisions of Bill C-52 will pave the way to closer 
intergovernmental co-operation.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6540"> 6540 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For example, it will allow Public Works and Government 
Services when requested by other levels of government to offer 
realty, architectural and engineering services to provinces as 
well as municipalities, something that was not possible before 
this legislation. It will simplify the process in following up on 
opportunities for intergovernmental co-operative initiatives.
<P>
	Over the next few years I am confident we will see a real 
increase in all levels of government working to eliminate 
duplication, to share in procurement where this is beneficial and 
to better co-ordinate services directed at the Canadian public.
<P>
	Another area in which the department has been working hard 
and making progress is in building stronger, more satisfactory 
partnerships with the Canadian business community. As the 
prime procurement agency of the government which spends 
some $10 billion each year for goods and services, Public Works 
and Government Services is one of the prime points of interface 
between the government and Canadian business and industry.
<P>
	In the past the two major points of friction and frustration in 
the government's dealings with the business community have 
been first, the sense by business that dealings with governments 
were slow, cumbersome and costly and, second, that there was 
too much political interference and cynicism, in other words 
that the system was not as fair and open as it should be.
<P>
	Under this government real progress has been made by Public 
Works and Government Services toward addressing both of 
these problems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	By promoting high-tech communications with businesses, 
the department has managed to simplify the process and reduce 
costs. The electronic procurement and settlement system is a 
good example. This central control and settlement system 
linking client departments with suppliers allows users to do 
business electronically, to place orders and issue vouchers 
without paperwork and to pay suppliers without bills being sent.
<P>
	The system was tested successfully and should be fully 
implemented during the year. It is as popular with the 
government as it is with suppliers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The open bidding system that I just described has been 
introduced and provides an electronic bulletin board that allows 
all potential suppliers an equal chance to be aware of the 
government's requirements and to respond accordingly.
<P>
	On many occasions the minister has given a personal 
invitation to all MPs, including MPs from the Bloc and the 
Reform Party, to get on the open bidding service. We should take 
him up on this offer, as I have done.
<P>
	The minister has also introduced a clause to all contracts 
effectively eliminating the practice of  contingency fees in 
securing government contracts, thus curbing the influence of 
lobbyists in this area. He has introduced-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. The member will 
have the opportunity to conclude his remarks when the bill 
comes before the House at the next opportunity.
<P>
	It being 5.30 p.m., the House will now proceed to the 
consideration of Private Members' Business, as listed on 
today's Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should change the name of 
the ``Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'' to the ``Canadian Charter of 
Rights, Freedoms and Responsibilities''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
He said: Mr. Speaker, before I get into the meat of my 
presentation today, I would like to spend a couple of minutes 
describing to the television audience the difference between a 
private member's motion and a government motion and what is 
most assuredly going to be happening to this motion in exactly 
one hour.
<P>
	A private member's motion receives one hour of debate in the 
House. Then it is dropped from the Order Paper, never to be seen 
again, unless there is a spark of interest somewhere and it 
resurfaces.
<P>
	This is one of the checks and balances in our parliamentary 
system. It allows backbenchers and opposition members a 
chance to get a point of view across. It gives opposition and 
government members a chance to debate ideas.
<P>
	If this were a votable bill rather than a motion, it would 
receive a grand total of, I believe, three or four hours of debate. 
It would come back two or three times and would be voted on. 
On a very rare occasion of unanimity in the House on an 
opposition member's bill, it could become law.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6541"> 6541 </A></B>
<P>
	The chances of a bill becoming law promulgated by an 
opposition member are fairly remote. Hopefully it is something 
that we in this Parliament could consider, because it is really the 
essence and the spirit of parliamentary democracy. No one in the 
House has a lock on good ideas. If we are to use our 
opportunities as parliamentarians effectively, we would learn 
from each other and modify each other's bills to meet a common 
objective.
<P>
	In any event, my motion was inspired because I felt we were 
becoming a nation of entitlement. This was very much to our 
detriment and to the detriment particularly of the younger 
generation of Canadians.
<P>
	During the election campaign my fellow candidates and I 
were doing an all-candidates meeting at a high school in 
Edmonton. In the question and answer period one of the students 
got up and said: ``What are you going to do to get me a job?''
<P>
	Through the luck of the draw I was the last person to respond 
and I got a chance to listen to the other candidates. I listened to 
them telling this young person in an auditorium full of students 
that we were going to create a nirvana-poor choice of 
words-motherhood and apple pie. We were going to spend 
money here and spend money there and create jobs.
<P>
	I could just see all their eyes glazing over because they had 
heard it all before and had no reason to believe it. My turn came 
along and I thought, I am going to tell these people the truth.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	I said to that young man: ``Look, if you want to know who is 
going to get you a job when you graduate from high school, have 
a look in the mirror because that is the only person in the world 
who is responsible for you. Your success in life is going to be 
directly attributable to what you put into it. If you expect me, 
your parents, your school or anybody else to do for you what you 
need to do for yourself you are going to be sadly mistaken and 
very disappointed in life''.
<P>
	I am telling you I was Mr. Dinosaur from the Reform Party. He 
must have been thinking: ``Here is this old-timer who does not 
have a clue about what is going on. How could he possibly be 
standing here and telling me I am responsible for myself, like I 
don't have to show up at school every day. If I come in late 
nobody seems to care''. That is not fair because that is not the 
way it is in life.
<P>
	That is the germ of the idea of how we got into this situation. It 
is not just individuals who feel that there is a sense of 
entitlement, it is all of us. Our whole society has become one of 
entitlement. If somebody wants to start a business what does he 
do? He does not get every nickel he has together and get his 
friends and relatives together and start a business. The first 
thing to do is trot down to the bank and see if the government 
will guarantee a loan. Is there not a grant for doing this? Cannot 
somebody  else risk their capital so I can progress in my life? 
That is just not the way it works in this world.
<P>
	We have become a nation of rights, a nation of entitlements. 
We did not become this way just with the introduction of the 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It has been happening slowly 
but surely. It probably happened perhaps in the 1950s and then 
accelerated in the 1960s. Here we are today with the single thing 
that has really codified this whole notion of rights, the 
introduction of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in Canada.
<P>
	As I progress in my speech this afternoon, I am going to be 
referring to some information that I got from a book entitled: 
<I>Protecting Rights and Freedoms: Essays on the Charter's Place 
in Canada's Political, Legal and Intellectual Life</I>. I recommend 
this book to anyone who has any particular interest in going 
further into the investigation of the effect of the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms in our country.
<P>
	I want to acknowledge that I will be quoting from the essays 
of three individuals, all of whom will be familiar to colleagues 
in this House and to you, Mr. Speaker. The first is the Right Hon. 
Kim Campbell when she was Solicitor General. She delivered a 
presentation at a 10th anniversary conference on the charter of 
rights. The second person is Lysiane Gagnon, a well-known 
member of the media from Quebec and Jeffrey Simpson who 
needs no introduction from me.
<P>
	As a matter of fact it was interesting that in another part of 
Kim Campbell's writings she said that Canadians, as compared 
with Americans, really have a different sense of what 
government means. We look at government as protector of our 
rights and freedoms. Government is not something feared by the 
average Canadian. She compared that with the situation in the 
United States where the government is seen as more obtrusive 
by the individual citizen.
<P>
	Ms. Campbell was comparing the case of our bill of rights and 
the American experience. The two do not exactly relate, but let 
me give you the gist of what she was saying as she was talking 
about the tension that exists in Canada between Parliament and 
the judiciary. With the Charter of Rights of Freedoms, the 
Supreme Court has taken on great powers that were not 
previously in our common law tradition to be vested with 
appointed judges. It was the role of Parliament to reflect the 
mores of the time and to interpret what was going on in society. 
We have evolved into more of an American system where the 
judiciary has far more to say about what is going on.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	As a matter of fact Kim Campbell said: ``Courts are now 
required to choose from among competing approaches and 
values. The real question therefore is not whether the courts are 
making policy but rather the appropriate limits of the courts' 
policy making role''. She said that when she was the Attorney 
General of the country. That is a profound statement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6542"> 6542 </A></B>
<P>
	She further said: ``By giving Canadians constitutionally 
entrenched rights and freedoms and by making these 
enforceable by the courts, the charter has given the courts a 
much more powerful and visible role in our governmental 
system. This has led to some tensions and to questions about the 
proper scope of judicial review in a parliamentary system''.
<P>
	Her concern was that unless Parliament and the courts 
understand and respect each other's role we will evolve toward a 
system in which the courts, rather than democratically elected 
legislatures, are seen as the primary protectors and promoters of 
rights and freedoms.
<P>
	That has happened. The courts have taken on an increasing 
role in our society and the role and the responsibility of 
Parliament has as a result been diminished.
<P>
	Then the question comes up: Why do we have a Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms in the first place? The Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms does not have one word in the whole thing about 
responsibilities. The thought of responsibility does not enter 
into the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. How can that be?
<P>
	It was because it was never intended to be anything other, at 
least according to many people. The introduction of the Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms in Canada was done because Pierre 
Trudeau wanted it. He believed if we had a Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms that guaranteed individual rights and freedoms we 
would be able to make a place for French speaking Quebecers in 
the whole of the country and for English speaking Canadians in 
Quebec by law, the notion of individual rights. As I understand it 
the problem was not that we should have these individual rights 
across the whole country. It was the people in Quebec wanted to 
feel at home in Quebec. It was maîtres chez nous, not maîtres 
chez all of Canada, it was maîtres chez Québec, at home.
<P>
	Quebec was not part of the patriation of the Constitution. It 
did not sign on and so instead of this becoming something we 
could all cherish and bind us together, it became yet one more 
irritant.
<P>
	These are the words of Lysiane Gagnon: ``This was another 
episode in the long antagonism between two schools of thought. 
One embodied by Trudeau focused on the rights of French 
Canadian individuals. Given equal chances and a decent degree 
of protection for their language they should be able to affirm 
themselves throughout the country. The second school of 
thought focused on the collective rights of Quebecers to develop 
the institutions and increase the powers of the province that was 
their only true homeland, the place where they formed a 
majority''.
<P>
	We now have a Charter of Rights and Freedoms without 
responsibilities covering the whole nation. The intent was to 
make Quebec feel more comfortable as part of the nation. It did 
not work. What are we left with? A situation where the courts are 
now making decisions that  should be made in Parliament. They 
are making decisions that fly in the face of common sense.
<P>
	I have examples of that. I do not need to bring it out in this 
case right now. There are many examples. The hon. member 
opposite wants an example. Let me give an example.
<P>
	The top court said just the other day that too drunk is a defence 
in a rape case. A guy gets too drunk, rapes someone and as a 
defence cannot form intent and there it is.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	This is a decision that is made by our courts but it does not 
reflect the common sense of the common people. What 
happens? People see something like this and they say Parliament 
could not possibly understand what is going on. The courts do 
not understand what is going on and people feel disconnected 
from the very institutions that they should be connected to and 
feel comfortable with.
<P>
	Now we have a situation in which we have rights through the 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms I submit is with us whether we like it or not because it 
has incredible symbolism in the country. The Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms in a survey done in 1991 had more symbolic 
significance to Canadians than anything else, including the flag.
<P>
	I submit that it is going to be part of us for a long time but in 
the chapter that Jeffrey Simpson wrote, he wrote about Harvard 
professor Mary Anne Glendon in her book of the same name in 
its simplest American form, the language of rights is the 
language of no compromise: ``By indulging in excessively 
simple forms of rights talk in our pluralistic society we 
needlessly multiply occasions for civil discord.
<P>
	We make it difficult for persons and groups with conflicting 
interests and views to build coalitions and achieve compromise 
or even to acquire that minimal degree of mutual forbearance 
and understanding that promotes peaceful coexistence and 
keeps the door open to further communications''.
<P>
	We have seen this in our very Parliament, as last week two 
members who have very different opinions about things were 
starting to fight because one has a right and the other feels 
denied that right. Yet all of life is a compromise of one form or 
another. It is a means of getting along with each other. Under the 
guise of rights we are getting ourselves back into corners where 
compromise is not part of the equation.
<P>
	I will quote again from Jeffrey Simpson: ``A distinguishing 
characteristic of this rights talk is the degree to which 
discretionary decisions of government and the normal and 
sometimes healthy tensions in a pluralistic, democratic society 
are elevated to those of apparently fundamental human rights. 
These rights by virtue of being rights cannot easily be 
compromised.  They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6543"> 6543 </A></B>
<P>
can only be defended to the maximum. These rights also seldom 
have obligations or responsibilities attached to them''.
<P>
	What can we do? Where do we go from here? We are very 
likely going to have the Charter of Rights and Freedoms with us 
forever. How do we go about making the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms more like that which was originally intended, 
something to draw us closer together, to bind us, to protect 
individuals from excesses of the states, to protect minorities 
from majorities and to have rules that we could live by?
<P>
	I would submit that we could achieve that if somehow we 
were able to induce the courts to interpret the Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms in a fashion and in a manner that gave some sense 
to society as a whole so that when decisions were made 
involving the Charter the justices would not always take the 
most liberal interpretation as per individual rights and the 
narrowest interpretation toward the rights of society as a whole.
<P>
	I do not know how this delicate balancing act could be 
achieved but it is certainly worthy of the attempt because we 
have evolved to a situation today in which people think of 
ourselves as rights and entitlements. We have a situation in 
which regardless of the colour of the book that the government is 
quoting from, whether it is the Reform's blue book or the 
Liberal's red book or the Bloc's book, there are certain things 
that we have to do as a nation.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	We have to start to live within our means. As the money dries 
up people are going to be backed into more and more corners 
connected with rights and we are going to have to start thinking 
more and more in terms of our responsibilities to our nation.
<P>
	We recall those 17 words that President Kennedy used years 
ago to discuss exactly this: ``Think not what your country can do 
for you, but what you can do for your country''.
<P>
	If we could inculcate somehow that simple phrase into our 
lexicon, if we Canadians could think what can we do for our 
country rather than what our country can do for us, I think we 
could go a long way in bridging some of the conflicts that are 
evident here in this House, the conflicts between those of us on 
this side of the House and back and forth, and individuals who 
are concerned with their rights. We should probably show far 
more concern for our responsibilities to each other and to our 
nation and far less for our rights to ourselves.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member for Edmonton Southwest proposes the 
name of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms be 
changed to include a reference to Canadian charter of rights, 
freedoms and responsibilities.
<P>
	It is an interesting proposal but I do not think it is one with 
which I could agree for various reasons. In 1982 Canada's 
Constitution was amended to include the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms. Although the charter came into force in 
1982 the rights and freedoms it contains are not new. The charter 
is part of a human rights tradition which Canada shares with 
other countries like France, England and the United States.
<P>
	In England the Magna Carta in 1215 was an early written 
attempt to formulate individual rights. The revolutions in 
France and the former British colonies also ended with attempts 
to set out in writing the rights which individuals possess 
vis-à-vis the power of the state. Individuals, it was decided, 
could not be deprived of these rights by the ruler or in a 
democracy or by an elected body representing the will of the 
majority. The government was not to circumvent the rights of 
the individual.
<P>
	The French called their document le déclaration des droits, 
des langues et des citoyens. The Americans named theirs The 
Bill of Rights. We would later call ours, of course, the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	These constitutional documents represent attempts to draft 
statements of rights at a national level. At the international 
level, the League of Nations and the United Nations began to 
grapple with human rights prior to, during and after World War 
II. The international movement to develop universal human 
rights standards gained momentum following World War II as a 
result of the atrocities committed during that terrible war.
<P>
	In 1948 the United Nations General Assembly adopted the 
universal declaration of human rights while the European 
convention for the protection of human rights and the 
fundamental freedoms was adopted in 1950.
<P>
	In Canada, following World War II, provinces began to enact 
legislation to prohibit various forms of discrimination such as 
the Saskatchewan Bill of Rights, eventually leading to the 
present day forms of human rights legislation. At the same time 
and throughout the 1950s as Canada's self-image as a country 
began to develop, proposals were made for a Canadian bill of 
rights.
<P>
	A joint committee of the Senate and the House of Commons 
considered the proposal in 1947 and again in 1950. Ten years 
later the Canadian Bill of Rights received royal assent. A federal 
statute, the Bill of Rights applied in areas of federal jurisdiction 
but it was not considered a constitutional document.
<P>
	In the 1960s and 1970s the law making process at the United 
Nations similarly resulted in the signing and ratification of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6544"> 6544 </A></B>
<P>
international covenant on civil and political rights and the 
international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	In Canada another period of constitutional negotiation was 
beginning with the adoption of the enriched charter of human 
rights as one focus of discussion.
<P>
	I am not going to review the history of the charter's adoption. 
There are many who are familiar with it. Suffice it to say that 
amending the Constitution is not an easy process. Every 
provision, including its topic, was carefully scrutinized by the 
government, by the special joint committee of the House of 
Commons and the Senate on the Constitution and later by 
provincial first ministers.
<P>
	In the end, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
became part of the Constitution by virtue of the Constitution Act 
of 1982. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is and 
aspires to be a statement by Canadians about the rights and 
freedoms which we as Canadians deeply value in our democratic 
society.
<P>
	Toward this end the charter protects a broad range of rights 
including, for example, equality rights and the right of freedom 
of expression.
<P>
	Many charter rights derive from or have their equivalent in 
those universal standards of human rights which I have 
mentioned earlier. There is a broad tradition of rights and 
striving for rights and the documentation of rights.
<P>
	Rights do not, however, come without responsibilities, nor are 
they absolute. All human rights amendments recognize this fact. 
Section 1 of the charter states that an individual's rights and 
freedoms are subject to certain reasonable limits. In 
determining what constitutes reasonable limits in a free and 
democratic society, governments and the courts balance the 
rights of individuals with the interests of society. This very 
process ensures that responsibilities along with rights are 
recognized by our courts. It is not necessary to change the title 
of this charter to emphasize the integral relationship between 
the individual's rights and his or her responsibility to the rest of 
society.
<P>
	Perhaps more important, as I stated earlier, changing the title 
of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms would require a 
constitutional amendment. This is because part I of the 
Constitution Act of 1982 sets out the provisions of the charter 
and section 34 of part I establishes the charter's title. The 
charter's title is thus part of the Constitution and can only be 
amended using the amendment procedures in part V of the 
Constitution Act of 1982.
<P>
	The procedures in part V include the general amending 
formula in section 38 of the 1982 act. Section 38 permits 
amendment of the Constitution on the consent of the Senate, the 
House of Commons and the legislative assemblies of at least 
two-thirds of the provinces having at least 50 per cent of the 
population of all the provinces. As we have seen in the past, 
obtaining such consent or agreement is difficult. The Prime 
Minister has indicated that the government has no plans  to 
reopen discussion on amending the Constitution in the 
foreseeable future. I think this also extends to changing the title 
of the charter.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the member for Richmond-Wolfe and a member of the Official 
Opposition, I am pleased to take part in this debate and to 
explain our position on the motion of our colleague from 
Edmonton Southwest, to explain this position in relation to the 
new political environment both in Quebec and in Canada.
<P>
	The private member's motion on the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms is very interesting in itself. Our colleague 
from Edmonton Southwest is suggesting that we add the word 
``responsibilities'' to the title of the Charter, so that it would be 
called the ``Canadian Charter of Rights, Freedoms and 
Responsibilities''.
<P>
	This motion reminds us of a fairly recent past when the late 
President John F. Kennedy asked the American people, and 
every individual in particular, not to ask what the government 
could do for them but what they could do for their government.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	Remember the context of that time. It was the early 1960s and 
new frontiers to cross were appearing on the horizon of the 
American empire. Remember the invasion of Viet Nam, the 
conquest of space and the imminence of a new social contract.
<P>
	I repeat, the idea of individual responsibility is not bad as 
such. However, the situation of Canada today is quite different 
from that of the United States in the 1960s. We may be on the eve 
of major social changes in this part of the North American 
continent and these changes will certainly not lead to a stronger 
Canadian state. President Kennedy's message was addressed to 
a nation. The Quebec people are not part of the Canadian nation 
and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms does not apply 
to them.
<P>
	First, Quebec has its own charter, as we recall. It will soon 
have its own constitution. The debate on the responsibilities of a 
citizen in the context of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms do not concern us. Why? For Quebecers, the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms symbolizes domination, not to 
say betrayal. Let me explain. The adoption and coming into 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6545"> 6545 </A></B>
<P>
force of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms with the 
Constitution Act of 1982 marked the high point of the federal 
Liberal Party's policy of Canadian nationalism. The new 
Constitution of 1982, by entrenching a declaration of rights and 
liberties, took from the Quebec National Assembly legislative 
powers over language and education, rights which the people of 
Quebec had fought for since the Conquest.
<P>
	The entrenchment of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the 
Constitution Act of 1982 and the unilateral patriation by Trudeau's Liberal government 
mark a very sharp decline, indeed the abandonment of the most important British 
traditions in law and Canadian institutions.
<P>
	British law and institutions base all of the state's sovereignty 
on Parliament alone, as a result of the long struggle between the 
bourgeoisie and the aristocracy. Contrary to British tradition, 
the 1982 Canadian charter reinforces individual sovereignty at 
the expense of state sovereignty. In other words, individual 
rights prevail over collective ones.
<P>
	With the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, it is the 
judicial authority of the Supreme Court of Canada which 
replaces the sovereignty of Quebec's National Assembly. The 
1982 charter officializes, from a constitutional point of view, 
Canada's integration to the American continent, as Pierre 
Mackay wrote in a publication entitled L'ère des libéraux: Une 
réforme constitutionnelle qui s'impose, published in 1988 by 
Les Presses de l'Université du Québec. Indeed, the ultimate 
sovereignty in a state such as the United States does not rest with 
the Parliament but with the people, and the constitution is both 
the guardian and legal representation.
<P>
	Thus, the precedence of the principle of distinct society for 
Quebec, in the context of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms entrenched in the Constitution, does not exist. That 
principle is violated by the power of the Supreme Court of 
Canada, which imposes the charter principles to all Quebecers.
<P>
	Needless to say that the Canadian charter does not recognize 
the right of people to self-determination. Consequently, under 
the Canadian constitutional law, the only way that an aboriginal 
nation, or Quebec, could become independent would be through 
an amendment to the Canadian constitution, something which is 
absolutely impossible-as the hon. member said-given the 
amending formula provided in the 1982 Constitution Act.
<P>
	The Canadian constitution says very little on the right of 
communities. As I said, the distinct or particular character of 
Quebec is not recognized in any way. The 1982 Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms gives individuals certain rights 
and freedoms versus the state. The charter allows an individual 
to go before the courts to have his rights uphold, a process which 
can even result in the invalidation of laws passed by Quebec's 
National Assembly.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois opposes any Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms and does not feel in any way concerned by the 
motion of the Reform member for Edmonton Southwest.
<P>
	In Quebec, community life deserves as great a protection as 
that granted to individual rights by the Canadian charter. 
Collective rights in Quebec are essential to the survival of 
Quebecers and the principle of  responsible citizens is part of the 
solidarity which reflects so well economic and human activity in 
various fields of Quebec society.
<P>
	Following the election of the Bloc Quebecois at the federal 
level and then the Parti Quebecois at the provincial level, our 
province is about to undertake a major social project to ensure 
recognition of the unique character of its people. This is a 
project in which individual responsibility versus state 
responsibility will primarily be defined in the context of the new 
solidarity surrounding the consolidation and independence of 
that state.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise this evening to address this motion that my 
colleague has put forth. I feel it is a key motion. If we would take 
it seriously and listen to what he has to say, it could be one of the 
things that could turn this nation around in many respects.
<P>
	I have listened carefully to what my colleagues across the way 
and over here have said. I hope that they will listen more closely. 
I think they have missed the point of what my colleague is trying 
to say as he has made this motion.
<P>
	Many Reformers have been long interested in developing a 
charter of responsibilities to provide a counterbalance to the 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Everyone knows that we 
cannot enjoy our rights and freedoms unless we first of all 
discharge our responsibilities as citizens.
<P>
	A number of countries have defined an individual's duties to 
their family, other citizens and their country. Some of these 
countries are Switzerland, Germany, Ecuador, Israel, Morocco, 
Japan, Pakistan, Thailand among others. If we look at what they 
are doing in these countries, as I will in a moment, we will see 
some interesting things that they have developed that we could 
also adopt.
<P>
	This is not some idea that I have dreamed up. This is not 
something that I have come up with. My constituents as they 
have observed what is happening in Canada in our courts, in our 
social programs and in our families have told me: ``You should 
stand up in the House and you should say we have too much of an 
emphasis on rights in this country and not on our 
responsibilities''. That is what I am doing today. I am making 
this point that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6546"> 6546 </A></B>
<P>
we need to emphasize responsibilities, not just rights in this 
nation.
<P>
	I want to quickly go through a list of responsibilities that I feel 
should be included in the charter of rights, freedoms and 
responsibilities. After I have done that I will give some 
examples.
<P>
	First, every Canadian has the duty and responsibility to 
contribute to the defence of the nation from attack by a foreign 
power and/or from insurrection from within. I am sure we all 
would agree with that.
<P>
	Second, everyone has the duty and responsibility to abide by 
the Constitution of Canada, to respect, comply with and uphold 
the laws of this country and to obey and assist the authorities to 
enforce those laws.
<P>
	Third, everyone has the duty and responsibility to render 
assistance in cases of emergency or calamity or in 
circumstances likely to endanger the existence or well-being of 
all or part of the population. We have taken that for granted. We 
should spell that out.
<P>
	Fourth, everyone has the duty and responsibility to 
responsibly exercise their rights and freedoms as an individual 
having due regard for and without restricting the rights and 
freedoms of others. We often forget this. I think we need to hear 
this being said more often.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Fifth, everyone has the duty and responsibility to vote in 
elections and referendums and to participate in civic affairs 
within the limits and conditions established by the law.
<P>
	Sixth, everyone has the duty and responsibility to pay their 
fair share of taxes within the limits and conditions established 
by the law.
<P>
	Seventh, everyone has the duty and responsibility to receive 
education and training under the conditions and in a manner 
provided by law in order to meet his or her personal obligations 
to their family, their community and society as a whole. People 
have an obligation to do their best, to train themselves so they 
can serve their fellow man in the best way possible.
<P>
	Eighth, everyone has the duty and responsibility to provide 
the necessities of life, educate and protect his or her children 
until they are adults. If we were to take that one point and 
explore the meaning of it, it would radically change our attitude 
to our social programs.
<P>
	Ninth, everyone has the duty and responsibility for the crimes 
committed by their children if it can be proven that they failed to 
provide proper control and supervision. We need to give parents 
the responsibility for the actions of their children.
<P>
	Tenth, everyone has the duty and responsibility to support and 
protect his or her parents in case of need and to the extent of his 
or her means, particularly when they are old and unable to work. 
I will give an example of this in another country where it works 
very well.
<P>
	Eleventh, everyone has the duty and responsibility to assist 
and support other members of their immediate family in case of 
need to the extent of his or her means.
<P>
	Twelfth, everyone has the duty and responsibility to do their 
fair share for society and to not take advantage of others or take 
advantage of the state. Think of the implications that has.
<P>
	Thirteenth, everyone has the duty and responsibility to meet 
their own needs before taking advantage of any program, grant 
or loan from the government.
<P>
	Fourteenth, everyone has the duty and responsibility to work 
in accordance with his or her capacity and not make claims for 
welfare benefits from the state until and unless they are destitute 
and unable to work because of disability, age or ill health and no 
other means of support is available from other family members, 
private charities and non-governmental organizations. That 
point would radically change the mindset of many people in this 
country.
<P>
	Fifteenth, everyone has the duty and responsibility to a 
personal code of conduct, behaviour and lifestyle that would not 
cause them to be a burden to their family, their community or 
society as a whole.
<P>
	Sixteenth, everyone has the duty and responsibility to 
co-operate with the government with respect to law 
enforcement and report any illegal activities.
<P>
	The seventeenth and last point-this is not an exhaustive list, 
but it is just an example of the things we could put in 
here-everyone has the duty and responsibility to conduct 
oneself in an honest and fair manner relative to others so as to 
contribute to the well-being of their family, their community, 
their province and society as a whole.
<P>
	I said I would give some examples as well of what these points 
imply. If we look at the Young Offenders Act, here is one 
example of where we should be putting more responsibility on 
people for their actions. Very often our young offenders are let 
go with little or no call on them to compensate their victims for 
damage they may have caused.
<P>
	For example in my constituency a couple of years ago a group 
of teenagers took and trashed a car, a beautiful automobile that 
belonged to another young person. They completely smashed it 
up so that it was totally worthless. The police came and took 
these young people before the court. The court said: ``That 
really was not a very wise thing that you did''.
<P>
	It virtually let them off. It asked them to pay a $500 
deductible. The rest of us have to pay for the damage they 
caused. Six of those youths were completely let go. They should 
have been held accountable. They should have been held 
responsible. The parents should also have been responsible for 
the actions of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6547"> 6547 </A></B>
<P>
these young people. That needs to be addressed. That is why we 
need to include responsibilities in the charter.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	Another example is that the family needs to be the first line of 
defence, not the government, in providing care for members of 
society. I am referring to some of our social programs. Also 
parents should be responsible for child care. That primary 
responsibility should lie with them.
<P>
	I would like to read something from the Swiss civil code. The 
Swiss have very low unemployment at around 2 per cent or 2.5 
per cent. Much of it is due to the fact that they have a charter of 
responsibilities. I do not have time to explain all its 
ramifications but I will give an example of what they have.
<P>
	Since 1978, Swiss law has compelled families to look after 
their needy before the government is asked to do so. Fathers, 
mothers, grandparents and others must support children. 
Governments sue grandparents on behalf of needy children and 
the elderly can sue their offspring for support. The Swiss courts 
collect the money.
<P>
	Let me quote: ``All persons are bound to contribute toward the 
maintenance of their ascendants and descendants in direct line 
as well as their brothers and sisters if without such assistance 
they were impoverished''.
<P>
	Let us think how different that is from the situation in Canada 
today where virtually no responsibility is placed on parents, 
grandparents or children for other members of their family. We 
need to emphasize the role families need to play in our society. 
We must once again generate the feeling of the importance of 
this basic unit in society, this basic economic unit, this basic 
cultural unit.
<P>
	Parents should not only have the right to discipline but they 
should have the responsibility. The government would like to 
remove the right for parents to spank their children. Should we 
not be going in another direction and putting an emphasis on the 
responsibility of parents to do this kind of thing?
<P>
	My colleague over there is unaware of what the government is 
doing. It would like the justice minister to remove the section in 
the Criminal Code that would allow parents to spank their 
children. If we did that, those parents who would choose that as a 
tool to discipline their children would no longer be able to do so. 
We are moving in the wrong direction with regard to a lot of 
legislation in the House.
<P>
	We should be teaching our children in our schools what it 
means to be a good citizen of Canada. I noticed the Bloc 
objected very strongly to that and I can understand why. If that 
had happened we may not have had a group of people in the 
House today bent on breaking up the country. We need to 
emphasize that in our schools.
<P>
	It has huge implications for immigration, for bringing in 
families and all of a sudden dumping those families on to the 
state. We should place more value on the family  and the role it 
can play in society. Governments have been undermining the 
role of families.
<P>
	In conclusion, we should make clear when people come to this 
great country that they have rights but they also have 
responsibilities. We need to send a signal to the people of 
Canada that government is not the primary caregiver. One of the 
best ways to do this is to change the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms to include responsibilities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
cannot support the motion, although I see where it is coming 
from and I certainly agree that the charter as it exists has created 
a great amount of work for the courts, which has taken away 
from Parliament to some degree.
<P>
	The motion as it stands confuses the principle of rights and 
freedoms with that of behaviour. When we say ``responsibility'' 
we are talking about how people should deport themselves as 
citizens. I submit that the motion would have made much more 
sense if it had suggested a charter of responsibilities for perhaps 
the Citizenship Act which is currently under review.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	However even then I would find myself in difficulty 
supporting such a motion. One of the basic freedoms we have as 
Canadians is the freedom to do nothing. We have the freedom 
not to be strong, to be individuals who may be seen as weak. We 
are nevertheless individuals who deserve not to be penalized 
because we are less strong than others. That is the reason we 
need a charter that deals with the rights of individuals.
<P>
	I had a great deal of difficulty during the recent hearings on 
the renewal of the Citizenship Act. I have to go back in time also 
to the Canada clause of the Charlottetown accord. In that 
particular latter instance a document purported to tell me as a 
Canadian whom and what I should respect. It said that I had to 
respect minorities, people because of gender, and people for 
various other reasons.
<P>
	I submit that as a Canadian I do not have to be told things like 
that. As a Canadian and someone who would automatically 
know because of the way I have lived I would know that 
everyone in the country should be treated equally. I would think 
this is a fundamental matter.
<P>
	When we talk about responsibilities we are beginning to 
impose our own rules of behaviour on other people. The hon. 
member opposite during his remarks cited, for example, that it 
should be the responsibility of every Canadian to report 
lawbreakers, to inform the authorities whenever someone is 
deemed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6548"> 6548 </A></B>
<P>
to be doing something that is against some law or regulation. We 
had an instance of that about 60 years ago and that was the type 
of rule that existed in Nazi Germany. I believe Stalin resorted to 
that as well.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Hold on a second. This is precisely the situation 
that exists. When we require citizens to do something we need to 
have choice. Previous speakers did not deal with the question of 
how we are going to enforce responsibilities. Is it going to be 
something that is mandatory or is it going to be something that is 
voluntary?
<P>
	If it is going to be something voluntary then it is the rules of 
conduct or what we would expect in a good citizen and that 
really belongs in a citizenship act, not in a charter of rights and 
freedoms.
<P>
	On the other hand, as one member suggested earlier there is 
the idea that we should actually require citizens to do it. Then 
again we come back to the problem of where the state is actually 
requiring and enforcing behaviour.
<P>
	There may be instances where a Canadian citizen for whatever 
reasons, perhaps fear, does not want to report on a crime that he 
or she has observed. Do we punish that person? I go back to the 
historic past to see that certainly in countries with dictatorships 
it was very common to punish people who did not properly 
report misdemeanours against the state. This is very serious.
<P>
	I do not think that is what was intended by members opposite 
when they demand a charter of responsibilities. I think they are 
basically talking about the Citizenship Act.
<P>
	I would like to make another point, if I may. We go on to very 
dangerous and difficult ground when we discuss issues like this 
one but we should discuss them, certainly. We heard another 
member talk about the difference between individual rights and 
freedoms and collective rights and freedoms. Here we have 
another problem. As the charter exists it looks at individuals. I 
submit this is the way it has to be because each one of us is our 
own self. We are true to ourselves. We may not be as strong as 
other people but we need protection as individuals.
<P>
	When we talk about collective rights, however, we get into the 
same type of situation that occurred during the early part of the 
20th century when nationalism flourished in Europe and led to 
the rise of Nazi Germany and Franco Spain and so on and so 
forth.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	When we approach collective rights, I submit we have a 
situation in our country where I think it was suggested that some 
people in the province of Quebec would like to have collective 
rights for self-determination. If we subscribe to that dictum 
then the Cree in northern Quebec ought also to have collective 
rights for self-determination. Therein lies the contradiction. 
When we talk about such collective rights, then the country is 
broken up. I suggest if separatists were true to that principle then 
it would break up Quebec.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Just so everyone 
understands perfectly clearly, I am proposing the  agreement of 
the House under what is called the right of reply. If I give the 
closing remarks to the mover of this motion, we have to all 
understand that no one else wants to speak. Once the hon. 
member for Edmonton Southwest is given the floor those will be 
the closing remarks and that will end this debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank my colleagues for their thoughtful, genuine and 
heartfelt comments about this. When we talk about the Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms, when we talk about our Constitution 
and when we talk about how we relate to one another, these are 
really serious deliberations.
<P>
	The debate in this Chamber in the last hour is probably the 
reason many of us are here. We want to talk about ideas and why 
our country works the way it does. Just because something 
might be difficult to achieve does not mean it would not be 
worthwhile achieving. If a worthwhile goal cannot be achieved 
in one fashion then perhaps as my hon. colleague just mentioned 
another approach might be more appropriate and might work. 
That is the nature of this debate.
<P>
	For instance, if we feel that some of the comments from an 
hon. colleague are going too far, then it is incumbent on us to 
make a suggestion that would improve it. We should not just 
automatically throw the baby out with the bath water. That is the 
beauty and the magic of our democracy.
<P>
	We walk into this great Chamber daily and from time to time 
we feel as though we are not really accomplishing anything, and 
perhaps some days we are not. But if we can move public 
discourse and discussion just one centimetre forward on 
something that will make our country better for our 
grandchildren, then we have done a wonderful thing.
<P>
	I would like to conclude with a little story about my three year 
old grandson who is the light of my life. He was visiting his 
maternal grandparents in Oshawa. He came back after being 
away for a month or so. My wife picked him up at the airport. He 
got into the car and he looked around for papa and asked in his 
little three year old voice: ``Where is papa?'' My wife said: 
``Papa is in Ottawa''. He thought for a minute and said: ``Oh, 
yes. Papa is in Ottawa. Papa is saving the country''. It is little 
things like that which bring a touch of warmth to your heart.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6549"> 6549 </A></B>
<P>
	All members here and those who will come forward are saving 
the country. It is through this interchange of ideas that we will 
do that and I thank all my colleagues for their attention and 
contribution to this debate.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for 
Private Members' Business has now expired.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 96(1), the order is dropped from 
the Order Paper.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GUNCONTROL">GUN CONTROL</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
having the opportunity of returning to a question which I asked 
the Minister of Justice some time ago with respect to the matter 
of gun control.
<P>
	By way of introduction to this question which I will be asking 
again of the minister and pursuing this matter I want to remind 
all members of this House of some particularly important 
realities we have to bear in mind on this delicate and difficult 
issue. That is there is quite a difference in the perceptions of 
those who come from rural areas in our country who have 
specific interests and specific problems to address with respect 
to this debate and those of us who come from urban areas.
<P>
	I come from an urban area where I want to bring to the 
attention of the minister the serious concerns that our fellow 
citizens have about this issue.
<P>
	My riding of Rosedale I know is often associated in the minds 
of members of this House and others with the idea of a 
residential area of some wealth and some luxury, where we have 
many tree-lined streets and gardens. All of my riding is not like 
that. Much of my riding is an extremely densely populated urban 
area like many other complex dense urban areas in this country.
<P>
	In that part of the riding we have apartment buildings where 
we have a serious problem with violence. We have places where 
the violence is related often to drug use. It is often related to 
young people and disaffected youth who are easily coming into 
contact and possession of firearms.
<P>
	In Regent Park which is in my riding during the course of the 
last election two young men were shot. Recently bullets have 
been fired in that complex area around apartment buildings. 
Bullets went right through the window of some perfectly 
innocent people.
<P>
	I am not describing a phenomenon that does not exist 
elsewhere in this country. I know from talking to other members 
and from talking to various people interested in this issue that 
this is a problem which exists elsewhere in this country as well.
<P>
	The question is what is to be done and what is the minister 
going to do. That is the purpose of my question tonight. In 
asking that question I want to preface it by saying that when we 
look at it from an urban perspective clearly nobody needs long 
guns in an urban riding. Nobody needs a rifle or a shotgun living 
on Sherbourne Street where I live. The only people who have 
such guns are basically those who are are using them for 
sporting or for club purposes. There is no reason to have a 
handgun unless you are a police officer or a law enforcement 
officer.
<P>
	The question then is how do we stop the cycle of violence we 
are looking at in these types of areas. How do we prevent our 
communities and ensure that our communities do not become 
like the United States where in fact a culture of violence is 
inculcated by television and by the media?
<P>
	I want to address these questions to the minister. Where are 
we now on the question of registration of ownership? Where are 
we on controls of ammunition sales? Where are we on tougher 
restrictions on handguns and the prevention of cheaper guns 
coming in from the United States and border controls? Where 
are we on a complete ban on assault weapons of any kind? Where 
are we in our recognition that perhaps this problem calls out for 
a different solution in rural areas than in urban areas? Nobody in 
an urban area wants to prevent aboriginal people from carrying 
on their traditional way of life. Nobody in an urban area wants to 
prevent rural people who live on farms from having the firearms 
necessary either to hunt for recreation purposes or even just for 
pest control on their farms.
<P>
	What we are looking for is protection in our urban areas. We 
also recognize that this may call for different solutions for 
different problems. I would ask the minister if there is any way 
in which the department is capable of drafting regulations which 
would recognize that fundamental difference between the way 
of life of those of us who live in cities and those of us who have 
different needs in the rural areas of our vast country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government has said it will be bringing before this 
House further changes to Canada's gun control legislation some 
time before Christmas. This is a difficult challenge for all of us. 
I am sure that members on all sides of the House will agree with 
me that we must work together to find ways to make this 
legislation clear and effective but also fair.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Justice recently said that the first and most 
important obligation of the government must be to protect the 
lives and safety of all Canadians. I agree with him. Safe homes 
and safe streets are at the very centre of a stable, peaceful and 
prosperous society.
<P>
	It has been said that this is an issue which divides urban and 
rural Canadians. I do not agree. There is no question that 
attitudes differ but the reality does not. If firearms are used to 
commit a crime does it matter whether the crime takes place in 
the city or in the country? A crime is a crime. It is a problem for 
all Canadians, not just those who live in our large cities.
<P>
	I am convinced however that we can find ways to effectively 
control firearms without jeopardizing the enjoyment of those for 
whom the shooting sports are an important source of recreation.
<P>
	Recently hundreds of firearm owners rallied here in Ottawa. 
They were saying to the government: &quot;Do not blame us&quot;. They 
feel that the government is making them pay for firearms crimes 
they did not commit.
<P>
	My colleagues and I do not blame the many Canadians who 
own and use firearms responsibly and safely. The government 
does not blame responsible shooters, nor is it punishing them for 
the crimes of others. What it is doing and what it must continue 
to do is to develop legislation that responds to the needs of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	We need to find ways to control access to firearms without 
imposing excessive or unproductive regulatory burdens on their 
owners. We need to find ways to punish and deter those who 
might otherwise be tempted to misuse a firearm and to endanger 
others. Deterrence does not always work but we must make 
absolutely sure that we get as much effective deterrence from 
the law and its administration as we can.
<P>
	There are people in this country who believe that everyone 
should have the right to bear arms. I am not one of them. I 
believe that principle is foreign to Canada and it is something 
which most Canadians would not support. Ownership of a gun is 
a privilege which must be earned and carefully maintained by 
training, education and responsible use.
<P>
	I also believe that it is a privilege that should not be infringed 
without justification. In restricting access to firearms we might 
inconvenience law abiding Canadians. If we do we must be sure 
that we act in the interests of the safety of all Canadians and that 
measures adopted by this House will not forget that privilege 
and those who have earned the enjoyment of it.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CUSTOMSTARIFF">CUSTOMS TARIFF</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, on May 5, 
in a question directed to the Minister for International Trade, I 
asked him, substantially, whether he intended to resist U.S. 
pressure on Canada to refrain from imposing tariffs on farm 
products subject to quotas,  including poultry, eggs and milk. I 
wanted to know whether the government was prepared to strike a 
deal with the United States by taking a conciliatory stand on the 
issue of customs tariffs on farm products subject to quota, thus 
facilitating the entry of Canadian durham wheat and barley on 
the U.S. market.
<P>
	The minister categorically denied that he would engage in any 
bargaining of this nature in negotiations between Canada and the 
United States on the issue of grain imports.
<P>
	The agreement reached on August 2 regarding Canadian 
wheat exports to the United States was proof that a deal had been 
struck, but at another level altogether. Canada did not sacrifice 
the interests of Canadian and Quebec dairy, egg and poultry 
producers for the benefit of wheat producers; it simply caved in 
to U.S. demands and sacrificed the interests of wheat producers 
by agreeing to a ceiling on our wheat exports to the United 
States. Ironically, a year from now, we will have to start all over 
again.
<P>
	I also wanted to know whether according to the minister, 
GATT rules would take precedence over NAFTA in the event of 
trade disputes, and his answer was yes. I also asked whether he 
could table the legal opinions on which his answers were based. 
Immediately after Question Period, the Minister of Agriculture 
approached me to confirm verbally the information I had been 
given very briefly by the Minister for International Trade and to 
give me the assurance that he would do what he could to send me 
a copy of the legal opinions in question.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	I never saw these opinions, not even a summary or a 
condensed version. A few days later, an official at the 
Department of Agriculture called to let me know it was not 
customary to release such opinions. After a rather laborious 
conversation, in the course of which I reminded him of the 
minister's commitment, I was finally promised a short version 
of the legal opinions. Later, I was told this version was being 
drafted and that I would receive a copy as soon as it was 
available, in about two weeks.
<P>
	Three weeks later, still no news. After contacting a new 
resource-person this summer, I was told that the delay was due 
to a misunderstanding between the Department of International 
Trade and the Department of Agriculture, but the letter was now 
on the Minister of Agriculture's desk, waiting for his signature. 
The minister does not seem to sign his mail very often, because I 
have been waiting for that letter for two months and I am still 
waiting.
<P>
	My colleague François Beaulne, MNA for 
Marguerite-D'Youville, was luckier. He managed to get a 
reply, which some people would call vague, in only a few weeks.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6551"> 6551 </A></B>
<P>
	On May 13, Mr. Beaulne sent a letter to the Minister for 
International Trade, asking him for those legal opinions. 
Incredible though this may seem, he received an answer dated 
June 22, in which the minister replied to his questions, although 
in a rather summary form, I must admit.
<P>
	It would seem that the ministers responsible for Agriculture 
and International Trade are not exactly chatty or keen on public 
disclosure, to say the least, when we are talking about releasing 
the information used to make decisions on behalf of the 
Canadian and Quebec public.
<P>
	According to the principle of responsible government, 
ministers are accountable for their actions to Parliament. 
Therefore, the off-hand manner in which the ministers 
responsible for Agriculture and International Trade treated my 
request is astonishing and unacceptable. When ministers release 
outside the House information that was denied a member who 
asked for it in the House, we must conclude that these ministers 
misuse their power, undermine the dignity of this House and ride 
roughshod over our institutions and democratic values.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade):</B> Mr. Speaker, as hon. members are aware, 
Canada and the United States started negotiations in December 
1993 in an attempt to deal with a number of problems connected 
with bilateral trade in farm products. Although these questions 
were examined in their entirety, negotiations were conducted on 
each product. There was no compromise and there will be no 
compromise in this respect.
<P>
	The latest memorandum of agreement on grain bears this out. 
The memorandum deals only with our grain exports to the 
United States and has absolutely no connection with questions 
still outstanding.
<P>
	The memorandum of agreement benefits Canadian grain 
farmers by giving them stable and secure access to a U.S. market 
where the returns are high. In this memorandum, Canada obtains 
guaranteed access to the U.S. market for wheat at a level that is 
higher than average historical levels for Canadian exports. 
Furthermore, conventional wheat exports for which the CWB is 
not responsible are not subject to the U.S. restrictions. The level 
of access provided in the memorandum of agreement is far more 
attractive than the inevitable alternative, a highly restrictive 
measure that would have reduced our exports to about half the 
level provided in the agreement.
<P>
	The memorandum of agreement also establishes a joint grain 
commission that will be asked to examine U.S. and Canadian 
grain marketing practices and their impact on the international 
grain market. The commission will do a critical study of the 
export incentives program, a U.S. export subsidy program that 
has caused imbalances in the market situation.
<P>
	The memorandum of agreement also obliges the United States 
to withdraw the measure on wheat and  barley taken under the 
provisions of GATT article XXVIII and prohibits them from 
imposing any other restrictive measures on grain that do not 
comply with NAFTA or GATT, during the twelve months the 
memorandum is in effect.
<P>
	I can guarantee the House that a satisfactory settlement of the 
agriculture-related problems that still exist between Canada and 
the United States remains one of the government's absolute 
priorities. I would also like to emphasize that each question will 
be examined on its merits and that no deals will be struck.
<P>
	Bilateral trade in farm and agri-food products is evaluated at 
$13.7 billion. Canada and the United States both have an interest 
in developing that trade in such a way that it benefits their 
respective countries.
<P>
	Regarding the hon. member's allegation concerning the 
discussion he had with the Minister of Agriculture and the 
Minister for International Trade, I was not aware of that. The 
hon. member should write to both ministers to let them know 
that he intends to raise the matter in the House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38(5), the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.45 p.m.)
