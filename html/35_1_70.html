	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-251, an act to provide that Remembrance Day 
be included as a holiday in public service collective agreements.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure in this 
new Parliament to introduce this private member's bill. I 
introduced the same bill in the last Parliament and we almost got 
it through. It passed second reading but unfortunately had some 
difficulty in committee. It enjoyed all party support to some 
degree.
<P>
	The bill seeks to ensure that Remembrance Day is kept as a 
statutory holiday under the Public Service Staff Relations Act. It 
does not in any way try to extend the bill into any of the 
collective agreements that come under the Canada Labour Code. 
It reaffirms that Remembrance Day is a holiday, it is a special 
day of remembrance and it should not be traded away in 
collective agreements.
<P>
	The original intention two years ago in introducing a similar 
bill was because there had been some negotiations in the public 
sector in which both government and the unions put 
Remembrance Day as a holiday on the table. We were told at that 
time that Remembrance Day could have been traded as a 
holiday, say in lieu of an extra day after Boxing Day.
<P>
	Remembrance Day truly is not a holiday but a day to 
remember those who have made the supreme sacrifice so that we 
and others could be free. This bill seeks to regularize, statutize 
and ensure that all agreements entered into under the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act could not make it a tradable holiday. 
It would have to take place and it would have to be observed on 
the date, November 11.

<P>
	In its second report, the committee examined the estimates of 
the Auditor General's office for the 1994-1995 fiscal year. 
Committee members heard testimony from the Auditor General 
concerning the role of his office and the funds allocated to it for 
the purpose of carrying out its mandate. The committee is 
confident that the Auditor General's office has sufficient 
resources to carry out its mandate during the current fiscal year.

	With respect to employment equity, women account for 17.7 
per cent of the employees in the management category within 
the AG's office, whereas the goal at the outset was to achieve a

been surpassed.
<P>
	As a result of sound management and an improvement in 
productivity, the AG's office has successfully reduced its 
expenditures for 1994-1995 by 6.3 per cent. You will agree that 
it has set an example for other government departments and 
agencies to follow in endeavouring to provide cost-effective 
services to Canadians.

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification)</B> moved that Bill C-28, an act respecting the 
making of loans and the provision of other forms of financial 
assistance to students, to amend and provide for the repeal of the 
Canada Student Loans Act, and to amend one other act in 
consequence thereof, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, may I ask for the indulgence of the 
House for a moment? I would like to provide a special welcome 
in our galleries to the grades 3 and 4 class of Hopewell school 
with which I have a family connection. It is very nice to have 
them here.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is appropriate that I am here to introduce the bill on education 
and student loans at a time when we have such a youthful 
audience in our gallery.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Madam Speaker, it is a great privilege for me to speak today 
on the reform of the student loans program.
<P>
	As you know, we were elected to create jobs, help the 
economic recovery and give young Canadians hope again. That 
is why I announced a youth employment and training strategy a 
few weeks ago. I can tell you that we are moving ahead very 
quickly.
<P>
	Recently, senior provincial and federal officials met to 
discuss the trainee program. We hope to announce the first 
initiatives very soon, which will give 60,000 young people job 
training in business within three years.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As members of the House would also know-I have certainly 
had many representations in this regard-we will be creating 
over 60,000 jobs for young Canadians this summer. That will be 
an increase of 20 per cent over last year. This program has 
always been well received and is particularly appropriate for 
young people.
<P>
	Just last Friday in Winnipeg I announced the first 37 lead sites 
under the youth service corps. We are already engaged in a 
number of initiatives to try to give some new sense of hope and 
aspiration to young Canadians.
<P>
	Today I want to address the House on another very central or 
key priority in the youth employment strategy and the major 
reforms we propose for the Canada student loans program.
<P>
	Over the years the Canada student loans program has been a 
fundamental foundation of the entire higher education system. 
We rank among the top countries in the level of public assistance 
for university and community college students. We are certainly 
much more generous and extensive than many other countries in 
the OECD. Over 900,000 full time and more than half a million 
part time students are pursuing post-secondary education to 
make their futures brighter and to give them some sense of the 
skills they will need for the future.
<P>
	However, like many other social and educational training 
programs sponsored at the federal level, our student loans are no 
longer designed to meet today's needs. There are very serious 
gaps in the programs which allow young people to fall between 
the cracks or put barriers or disincentives in their way.
<P>
	There are rigidities in the system which do not allow us to 
provide for the flexibility that today's education requires. 
Young Canadians, their families, the educational community 
and student groups have repeatedly called for fundamental 
reform in the area of student loans. The bill is the first attempt in 
more than 30 years to try to come to grips with these necessary 
changes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4307"> 4307 </A></B>
<P>
	We propose in the legislation a much broader and more 
inclusive system that will bring people in from the margins and 
help those most in need. The result will be a system with various 
components and greater access to funding. Support in school 
and after school will facilitate employment, security and 
opportunities for learning. In short, it will give young Canadians 
the tools they need to achieve educational goals.
<P>
	I tell members of the House that in preparing for the 
legislation we consulted with a wide variety of people: the 
Canadian Federation of Students, the National Educational 
Association, disabled students, the Association of Universities 
and Colleges, and the provinces. We all agree there are at least 
three main reasons change is required.
<P>
	First, the Canada student loans program has been greatly 
underfunded. Full time loans have been frozen at a level of $105 
per week since 1984. Yet education costs during that same 
period have jumped by over 58 per cent. Every member of 
Parliament has encountered students and former students who 
have had problems obtaining enough resources to continue their 
studies or who had difficulty repaying their loans. The proposed 
bill would address both these problems by substantially 
increasing the aid to students and by introducing measures that 
would ease the problems of repayment.
<P>
	A second major reason for the change is the changing 
requirements of the labour market. The majority of jobs created 
by the year 2000 will require a minimum of 17 years of 
schooling. Yet approximately 60 per cent of our young people 
currently enter the workforce directly from high school with no 
further structured education or training. The great tragedy is that 
close to 30 per cent of young people drop out of school before 
they even reach the high school level. I do not think there is any 
greater argument or any greater reason that we must 
substantially improve access to our post-secondary education 
system.
<P>
	There are also very important changes taking place in the 
population, especially with respect to those using our schools 
and universities. Although the majority of students are young 
people under the age of 25, increasingly Canadians born in the 
fifties and sixties are also returning to school. There has been a 
remarkable increase in the number of people who want to come 
back to school. This means that we must provide substantially 
better support for part time students or for adult returning 
students. Let me now present what in concrete terms we propose 
to do in the legislation.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	First, we will increase the loan limits by 57 per cent or to the 
same level they would have been if there had not been a 10-year 
freeze imposed by the previous government. As a result full time 
loans will increase to $165 a week from $105 a week.
<P>
	Second, the proposed act works for students with disabilities 
whose numbers in colleges and universities do not come close to 
reflecting their proportion of people in the population. Students 
with disabilities confront many obstacles to full participation in 
our economic mainstream. Learning should not be one of them. 
It is believed that fewer than 3 per cent of Canada's full time 
university and college students are those with disabilities.
<P>
	The bill will deal directly with those situations by reducing 
the barriers. A survey by the National Educational Association 
of Disabled Students reported that taken together federal and 
provincial aid to students is totally inadequate. It also reported 
that $3,000 or less annually would help to meet the shortfall.
<P>
	As a result we are providing in the legislation permission for 
students with permanent disabilities to qualify for grants up to 
$3,000 a year. This means that for the first time we will open the 
doors for those with disabilities in a very major way. It means 
that they will have more flexibility in their programs. They can 
take fewer courses and have more time to complete their studies. 
Students with permanent disabilities will also continue to be 
eligible to apply for forgiveness of the loans if they run into 
difficulties with repayment.
<P>
	As many members of the Chamber will recognize, there are 
inequities for women in higher education. Current imbalances 
must be addressed. Although women are now well represented at 
the undergraduate level of universities and colleges, they are 
substantially under-represented in areas of post graduate 
studies. One-third of doctoral degrees are awarded to women. 
Only 9 per cent of doctoral degrees in areas like engineering and 
applied sciences go to women and only 17 per cent of those are 
in mathematics and physical sciences. This is a situation in 
which positive intervention on the part of government can help 
to correct these inequalities. Special opportunity grants of up to 
$3,000 a year will be available to women taking doctoral 
programs. Through this we will be able to substantially increase 
their access to fields like engineering, physical sciences and 
applied mathematics.
<P>
	A third area of major change is the need to cope with the 
increasing number of people coming in as part time students. 
Part time students presently make up over one-third of all 
college and university enrolments in Canada. Many of them are 
helped by employers or work to finance their own studies. 
Clearly they do not need a large amount of government support, 
but there is a substantial minority of part time students who need 
financial assistance to continue in school. Student groups and 
educational associations have called for improvements in the 
part time loans program.
<P>
	As Canadians go through the cycle of lifelong learning there 
will no longer be a question of simply being able to go to school 
as a young person, graduate and work for the same employer 
year after year. We are now in a situation in which they will be 
changing their workplace  perhaps four or five times during their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4308"> 4308 </A></B>
<P>
working careers. To do so they will constantly have to go back to 
school to improve skills, upgrade education and substantially 
enhance their educational opportunities.
<P>
	As a result we are proposing to raise the maximum loan for 
part time students by almost 60 per cent from $2,500 to $4,000. 
In addition under the new financing arrangements the repayment 
burden on part time students would be reduced by allowing them 
to pay only the interest on the loans while they are studying.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	We also recognize that students who are single parents or 
people on income support assistance may not be able to meet the 
eligibility requirements for full time loans. These students need 
special attention to top up their resources, and the bill will 
provide it. Therefore special opportunity grants of up to $1,200 
a year will be available to part time students with high financial 
needs. That will allow the single parent with children a 
substantial opportunity to go back to school. These grants will 
be used for direct costs of education such as tuition, books, local 
transportation and child care. It will provide a new foundation 
for part time students, especially single mothers, to go back to 
school.
<P>
	At the present time the average student loan is around $6,000. 
However about 7 per cent of students graduate with debts of 
more than $15,000. Several provinces have recognized that very 
heavy debt burden and have implemented systems of deferred 
grants or loan forgiveness linked to the completion of studies.
<P>
	In consultations on the reforms it became obvious that 
increasing loan levels would also increase debt levels. To ease 
the debt burden of high need borrowers we are creating a system 
of deferred grants to equalize and put them on a parallel with 
less needy students. Under the revised program individuals with 
Canadian student loans in excess of $16,000 on graduation 
would be eligible for a deferred grant. Under the new provisions 
we estimate that up to 21,000 students beginning studies in 
1995-96 would be eligible for deferred grants when they 
graduate at the end of the decade.
<P>
	Easing the transition from school to work makes eminent 
good sense. Canada wants and needs young people to pursue 
higher education. We are also urging all other Canadians, 
middle aged or old, to improve their abilities through lifelong 
learning. We cannot point to education as a key to success and 
then deny support to people who want to go back to school. The 
transition from school to work can be very difficult. Therefore 
the deferred grants will substantially help students with high 
financial need.
<P>
	Under the present system the federal government can pay the 
interest on loans for up to 18 months. Their unemployment may 
be either as a result of their inability to find employment or 
because of a temporary disability or illness. This interest relief 
provision is effective in reducing the number of borrowers who 
default after  leaving studies. However former students in low 
paying jobs cannot obtain this benefit. We intend to extend 
interest relief to include those in part time or low paying work. 
In other words, we will not penalize people for working at entry 
level jobs which allow them to gain experience and show 
employers what they can do.
<P>
	A major problem with the existing program that has been 
highlighted by the Auditor General is the default issue. The bill 
would address the problem by authorizing agreements with 
lenders based on the risk sharing approach. Under the new 
arrangements the existing 100 per cent government guarantee 
would be removed and lenders would assume the liability for 
loans that must be repaid. Many loan defaults under the current 
loan program occur because lenders do not have the incentive to 
be diligent in servicing and collecting student loans.
<P>
	The new financing arrangements are designed to provide 
incentives for lenders to give better services to students and for 
students to succeed in their studies. Lenders will help prevent 
defaults by offering income sensitive terms of repayment. The 
loan package was designed to meet the needs of students and to 
ensure that each student is treated as an individual, not simply as 
a number.
<P>
	Let me stress that these new financing arrangements will not 
limit the access of students to loans. The basic objective of the 
program is to ensure students the credit and access they need to 
pursue their studies. That is why governments have a role to play 
in student assistance. The underlying objective of the student 
loans program will remain and all eligible students will continue 
to receive their loans.
<P>
	I am sure there is a number of other major initiatives in the bill 
that my colleagues on this side of the House will address.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to make two additional comments which I think 
provide some new flexibility. First, as it deals with provinces.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For example, as hon. members know, Quebec has its own 
student loans system. Unfortunately, under the old system, there 
was no cost sharing for students with special needs, as I said in 
my speech. Under the new system, loans for students with 
special needs in Quebec will increase. Also, there will be a new 
cost sharing for student loans in Quebec.
<P>
	I think that this is another example of co-operation between 
the provinces and the federal government in this important 
system for students and for education.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4309"> 4309 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to point out another feature which I personally 
think is very crucial. We are in a world where we have to rethink 
much of what we are doing in education. In particular we have to 
begin to look at how we can substantially increase private 
participation, private investment in education. I said earlier that 
in Canada we spend perhaps the highest percentage of public 
moneys to assist in higher education but we have one of the 
lowest records of private involvement, private participation, 
private investment.
<P>
	In order to ensure a brand new system of learning that will 
encompass opportunities at all stages and all levels of life and 
learning, we are going to have to give more incentive back to 
individuals to invest in their own educational opportunities.
<P>
	One way that has been explored in a few countries such as 
New Zealand and Australia has been the notion of income 
contingency repayment. It allows students who take a loan to 
repay at the level of their income as opposed to a flat rate so that 
the deterrent of having a loan or a debt at the end of your regime 
does not provide a barrier.
<P>
	We are proposing in this legislation to introduce an 
opportunity to work with individual provinces to set up a series 
of pilot projects to test out the notion of income contingency 
repayment. I can say to members of the House that I have 
already had several conversations with provincial ministers of 
education who have shown an interest in this program. It will 
substantially rewrite the way that we provide incentives for 
individuals to invest in their own education without the fear of 
having serious debts at the end. It will provide a scaled down 
portion of repayment.
<P>
	I think this is a sign of the future. It is the kind of building 
block that we can put in place to make a new revision and reform 
and renewal of our broad based higher educational programs. I 
hope members of the House will take a look at these innovations 
that we have brought in to provide these new opportunities and 
see how they can act as a new framework through which we can 
rewrite the blueprint for higher education in Canada.
<P>
	I very much appreciate the attention of the House in 
introducing this important legislation. I believe it will be a very 
major step forward in the immediate opportunity for 
improvements in the level of loans. It will give a substantial 
increase in opportunity for students with disabilities, women 
attending graduate school and students of high financial need. It 
will provide much broader access and will be new ground in the 
notion of the income contingency repayment and a new system 
of providing a lender based system using our banks and financial 
institutions to provide the capital while we provide the backup 
guarantee.
<P>
	I do not pretend that this is the end of the reform. As members 
of this House will know we embarked on a much broader process 
of social reform in the country. I hope to be able to table for 
members in several weeks the broad framework of what we 
propose. This is a very important element. I think we all 
recognize how crucial the necessity for better learning, for 
better education, for better understanding of one's skills and 
abilities will be. We are going to be a society based upon high 
education and high skilled information technology. Therefore 
we have to ensure that our educational system keeps pace and 
stays relevant to those needs.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	With this I strongly recommend to the House the passage of 
this legislation. I look forward to the discussions in committee. I 
hope that we can have fairly quick and speedy assessment by 
members so that this new program can be up and ready for 
students by the school year beginning this fall. If we can do that, 
I think this Parliament will make a very important statement to 
all Canadians that we are concerned and committed to their 
future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Madam Speaker, as the Official 
Opposition critic for training and youth, I welcome this 
opportunity to speak to Bill C-28 amending the Canada Student 
Loans Act. However, before commenting the bill per se I would 
like to say a few words about the presentation the Minister of 
Human Resources Development has made. Just to say it seems 
to me that he had much more to say about the programs included 
in this education and work strategy for young Canadians and 
what he planned to do with his bill than about the bill itself. As 
far as I am concerned, this bill exemplifies the kind of vague 
wording used as a smoke screen by a government which tries, 
unsuccessfully, to hide its centralizing designs. The bill does not 
say much. Unfortunately, we will have to wait for the 
accompanying regulations to be able to fully appreciate its 
impact.
<P>
	One can wonder what the Liberal government's real 
intentions are with Bill C-28. For example, by raising the 
ceiling of student loans, is the government setting the stage for a 
further reduction of its contribution to the funding of higher 
learning institutions? As vague as are the wording and the 
general statements with regard to amending the existing 
legislation, one can nonetheless identify certain guidelines out 
of this bill.
<P>
	At a time student indebtedness has become unbearable due to 
lack of available jobs, the government is taking measures that 
will only put them further into debt and make it more difficult to 
pay off their debts. Let us bear in mind that Bill C-28 is part of 
the youth education and work strategy announced April 15 by 
the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4310"> 4310 </A></B>
<P>
	On that very day, I denounced this strategy that I considered 
as a further infringement in the area of education, an area which, 
according to the Constitution of Canada, comes under the 
exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces. Must we remind the 
minister that this goes against the fundamental interests of 
Quebec, a position which was reaffirmed unanimously in the 
Quebec National Assembly on April 14?
<P>
	These amendments to the students grants and loans system is 
but one element of the social programs reform on which the 
Minister of Human Resources Development has supposedly 
undertaken consultation with the people of Quebec and Canada. 
What is the rush? The minister did not even have the decency to 
wait for the results of the consultation held by the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources and to secure the support of the 
provinces before going ahead with this part of the social 
programs reform.
<P>
	Again, what the Prime Minister meant when he said during the 
election campaign that he did not want to talk about the 
Constitution is becoming apparent today. Reading between the 
lines, we can deduce, as he actually invited us to do, that from 
now on he will pay no attention to provincial jurisdiction and 
impose such things as national education standards. As it turns 
out, this government has not learned a thing. It is going ahead 
with measures that can only increase duplication which is a 
shameful waste of public funds.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	The most important question we should ask on Bill C-28 is 
this: Why does the government want to change financial 
assistance to students? The first reason is obvious. Bill C-28 
gives more power to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. That is essentially the first and most important 
reason in our opinion.
<P>
	First of all, with respect to the appropriate authority, this bill 
says that the Minister may designate for a province an 
appropriate authority, which may designate educational 
institutions that offer courses at a post-secondary school level 
in or outside Canada.
<P>
	Under the old Canada Student Loans Act, the appropriate 
authorities were designated by the Lieutenant Governor in 
Council of the province concerned. This will now be done by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development himself because 
Clause 3.(1) specifies that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>3.(1) For the purposes of this Act, the Minister may, by order, designate for a 
province</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>(a)</I> an appropriate authority, which authority may designate as designated 
educational institutions any institutions of learning in Canada that offer courses 
at a post-secondary school level, or any class of such institutions; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>(b)</I> an appropriate authority, which authority may designate as designated 
educational institutions any institutions of learning outside Canada that offer 
courses at a post-secondary school level, or any class of such institutions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) An appropriate authority may revoke any designation made by it under 
subsection (1), and any designation made in respect of the province under the 
<I>Canada Student Loans Act</I> and, in the case of a designation of a class, may 
exclude any named institution from that designation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>4.(1) The Minister may enter into an agreement with an appropriate authority, 
or with an appropriate authority and the government of the province for which 
the authority was designated, respecting the exercise or performance of any of 
the authority's powers, duties or functions under this Act or the regulations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In this case, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
is the authority in an area of exclusive provincial jurisdiction 
recognized by the Constitution.

performance of any of its powers, duties or functions under this Act or the 
regulations, and such directives are binding on the appropriate authority.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The minister could enter into agreements with the provinces 
to harmonize the administration and financing of student loans 
throughout Canada. Does abolishing the existing provincial loan 
allocation formula mean that the minister can require the 
provinces to respect a greater number of national standards in 
order to receive the allocation?
<P>
	What will happen to a province like Quebec, which respects 
the Canadian Constitution by taking care of its own student 
loans, which come under the area of education, an area, again, of 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction? Will Quebec receive its fair 
share of compensation?
<P>
	We also notice that, in pursuing the centralizing and insidious 
intentions of the federal government in matters of education and 
training, the Minister of Human Resources Development may 
now enter into risk-sharing agreements directly with lenders.
<P>
	The enactment of these will abolish the existing provincial 
loan allocation formula established by the minister.
<P>
	Another question raised by Bill C-28 is the maximum amount 
of loans. The act currently provides for a specific maximum 
amount of student loans.
<P>
	This morning, the minister talked about a maximum amount 
but there is no mention of it in the bill. It may have been 
announced but it is not in the bill. There is no specific maximum 
amount. What the bill says is that it can be set by the minister.
<P>
	Bill C-28 only says that, subject to the regulations, the lender 
is required to make to a qualifying student who has been issued a 
certificate of eligibility a loan in an amount not exceeding the 
maximum set out. What is this amount? Is it the 57 per cent 
increase in the maximum  loan announced by the minister or is it 
something else? The part of Bill C-28 relating to the repayment 
of loans also raises questions. Clause 9 says that the borrower 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4311"> 4311 </A></B>
<P>
may be liable to pay a portion of the interest during the loan 
period under certain conditions. What are these conditions?
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	According to section 10 <I>b)</I> of the current act, the student 
borrower simply does not have to pay interest during the loan 
period while he is in school. That provision has been eliminated.
<P>
	Clause 11. (2) of Bill C-28 provides that the termination of 
the borrower's rights by reason of disability or insufficient 
family income becomes effective if the borrower's condition 
deteriorates after the first day of the seventh month after the 
month in which he ceases to be a student.
<P>
	Does that mean that a borrower who is the victim of an 
accident or any other cause keeping him from working after the 
first day of the seventh month after the month in which he ceases 
to be a student will have to repay the loan, or will he have to 
declare bankruptcy? Considering that 10 per cent of personal 
bankruptcies in Canada are student bankruptcies, does the 
minister want to see that figure go even higher?
<P>
	Clause 12. (1) creates a major ambiguity. It states that a 
certificate of eligibility will be issued to students who have 
attained a satisfactory scholastic standard or who are in need of 
financial assistance.
<P>
	Can a student be refused a loan because of his marks? Who 
will determine the amount required by the student? Will unpaid 
parental contributions be taken into account? Will there be 
national eligibility standards?
<P>
	Clause 12. (7) reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The maximum amount of financial assistance in respect of which a certificate 
of eligibility is issued, other than a loan to which subsection (4) or (6) applies, is 
the prescribed amount, or the amount calculated in accordance with the 
prescribed formulas.</BLOCKQUOTE>
How will this amount be calculated? We have no idea.
<P>
	Will it be possible to give additional amounts through 
scholarships once the ceiling for loans is determined? This 
morning, the minister alluded to subsidies. We will see.
<P>
	Also, clause 14. (7) of Bill C-28 states that amounts paid to 
compensate a province which does not integrate the federal 
loans program will be included in the calculation of the program 
net costs only if the provincial government satisfies the Minister 
of Human Resources Development, within a given period, that 
the provincial program has substantially the same effect. The 
provinces will have to convince the federal minister, in spite of 
the fact that this is a field of exclusive provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Will the minister base his decision on national standards 
regarding education or education financing?
<P>
	Clause 15. <I>(i)</I> reads in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the circumstances under which a new loan- may be denied to a student, or 
an interest-free period- may be terminated-</BLOCKQUOTE>
Which criteria will justify such action? We have no idea.
<P>
	We believe that such measures may have disastrous 
consequences on the future of some students experiencing 
financial, personal, academic or other problems.
<P>
	At first glance, Bill C-28 does not look reassuring to 
borrowers. In my opinion, the government does not have a clear 
idea of the true socioeconomic situation of young people. It is 
worrisome to see that banking institutions have an increasingly 
greater discretionary power. And what about the risk premium 
which will probably be paid to them, given the profits they 
make? Banks are in the best financial position; yet, a provision 
is included to allow the minister to pay a premium and eliminate 
risks for these institutions. This is not reassuring.
<P>
	Clause 15. <I>(n)</I> of Bill C-28 provides for the establishment and 
operation of a program to provide special interest-free or 
interest-reduced periods to borrowers, according to pre-set 
conditions. However, section 9. (1) of the current act provides 
for exemptions, under certain conditions. Is the government 
adding new exemption conditions, or is it amending the current 
ones? We have no idea.
<P>
	If so, it would be interesting to have more details. Finally, I 
come to the most controversial clause of Bill C-28, namely 
clause 18 which includes general provisions. This states that the 
minister may enter into agreements with federal or provincial 
departments to facilitate the administration of the act, or to 
harmonize its administration at the various government levels.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	This is seen as a major improvement over the existing 
legislation on student loans. It reflects, however the centralist 
concept of federalism, a concept that ignores the specific 
identity of the provinces. There is a desire to control everything 
from the top, with no concern for the people who are trying to 
get along on what they have.
<P>
	After this brief overview of the main provisions of Bill C-28, 
there is an important point that I feel should be made. The 
government apparently wants to reform the federal loans system 
by regulation, but these regulations, which undoubtedly would 
shed more light on the matter, are unfortunately not available 
today. The most immediate impact of Bill C-28 may well be to 
increase student debt and thus compromise the future of our 
young people who, in addition to getting deeper in debt, may not 
get the jobs they want when they graduate. This will make it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4312"> 4312 </A></B>
<P>
harder for them to pay back their loans and may increase the 
number of personal bankruptcies.
<P>
	Perhaps I may expand a bit on the subject of student debt. In 
Quebec, for instance, university tuition fees almost tripled in 
three years. In fact, the situation has been similar across Canada 
since 1984. Since Quebec had the lowest tuition fees, there was a 
certain amount of catching up to do, but the fact remains that the 
increase was rather drastic, and more is yet to come.
<P>
	As governments reduce their financial commitments to 
educational institutions, these will have to raise the amounts 
they charge students. In Quebec, the average amount of student 
debt at the post-secondary level is $8,500. It is estimated that in 
Quebec, 60 per cent of parents pay nothing towards their 
children's post-secondary education, and since the parental 
contribution is taken for granted by governments when they 
calculate the amount of financial assistance to be given, these 
students are actually losing quite a bit of money in the process.
<P>
	As for personal bankruptcies, it is estimated that 10 per cent 
of these are filed by students. That is a considerable proportion. 
And these bankruptcies represent a major cost for governments. 
As a member of the Human Resources Development Committee, 
when we were analysing these particular budget items, I heard 
officials say it was difficult to establish the cost with any 
precision because there were tremendous problems with 
recovery.
<P>
	So what happens now? Because of a lack of effectiveness in 
this respect among governments in English Canada-in Quebec, 
the Government of Quebec has a withdrawal right-the 
responsibility is transferred to the banks, and when you consider 
the attitude of some banks, there is certainly cause for concern.
<P>
	According to an article published on April 11 in <I>Le Devoir</I>, in 
Quebec in 1993-94, former students who went bankrupt had 
loans totalling $4.7 million. This is more than twice the loans 
for 1990-91, which at the time totalled $2.2 million. That is a lot 
of money.
<P>
	We therefore believe that this bill will increase the number of 
loans, and thus the number of bankruptcies, as well as the 
amounts involved.
<P>
	More and more students are obtaining loans and bursaries. In 
Quebec, an estimated 175,000 students at the post-secondary 
level are receiving financial assistance this year; in other words, 
nearly 50 per cent of the students enrolled at this level.
<P>
	In British Columbia, it cost the government $17 million in 
1992 to reimburse the loans of 3,037 former students. In British 
Columbia, 3,037 former students were unable to pay back their 
student loans. Seventy per cent of the students were apparently 
unable to pay back their loans because they were unemployed, 
which seems pretty obvious, but I think we should realize that 
unemployment was the culprit in 70 per cent of these cases.
<P>
	According to an article published in <I>Le Droit</I> on January 10, 
1994, 248,000 students received financial assistance directly 
from the federal government in 1991-92, for a total amount of 
$743 million. Although the vast majority of student borrowers 
pay back their loans, we must realize that 13 per cent will not be 
in a position to do so.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development has tabled a 
bill on student financial assistance which unfortunately does not 
take into account recommendations made by the student 
community and especially by student associations. So what do 
students want?
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	First of all, the associations which I contacted in Quebec want 
a student assistance program to be developed, one which would 
draw a distinction between tuition fees and living expenses. In 
determining these expenses, consideration would also have to be 
given to the true costs of the program or field of study in 
question, because this can vary according to the field, region of 
the country, family situation and associated costs.
<P>
	Secondly, when it comes to calculating loans and bursaries, 
parental financial assistance should not be a determining factor. 
All students should be considered as independent. The amount 
of the loan or bursary should not be an incentive for students to 
continue living at home, but rather it should encourage them to 
acquire a certain measure of independence as quickly as 
possible after reaching the age of majority. Obviously student 
associations in Quebec recommend that the federal government 
withdraw completely from the field of education, in particular 
post-secondary education.
<P>
	The federal government wants to increase the amount of 
student loans without taking into account the real ability of 
students to repay the money. Precariousness is a concept used 
with growing frequency in discussions about youth 
employment. It is concept which the government does not seem 
to grasp fully. So-called precarious jobs are the exclusive lot of 
young people in Quebec and in Canada. Fifty per cent of young 
Quebecers and Canadians are reported to hold down precarious 
jobs.
<P>
	Generally speaking, a precarious job is one that is 
low-paying, often paying minimum wage, with minimal 
opportunity for advancement. A precarious job is one with no 
security, often non-unionized, one that can disappear overnight 
for various, more or less justifiable reasons. A precarious job is 
one which a person holds out of necessity and would willingly 
give up for something better. Young people with precarious jobs 
often hold many such jobs for relatively short periods of time. 
Therefore, the definition of a precarious job stands in sharp 
contrast to that of a regular job with a good salary, job security 
and a pension plan.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4313"> 4313 </A></B>
<P>
	Why is it that the majority of precarious jobs are held by 
young people? The primary reason for this phenomenon is the 
growth of the services sector. Seventy per cent of all jobs are in 
the services sector. Furthermore, 70 per cent of young people 
who work do so in the services sector, that is the restaurant, hotel 
and general services industry.
<P>
	Another factor responsible for the widespread precariousness 
of jobs held by young people is the increase in unemployment in 
all age groups. Clearly, young people are especially affected 
because, as recent entrants in the job market, they often must 
settle for the leftovers, that is the jobs no one else wants. 
Another identifiable cause of job precariousness among young 
people is the emergence in the past few years of a second wage 
scale reserved exclusively for new job market entrants that 
businesses can let go if necessary.
<P>
	Furthermore, adolescence has long been considered a period 
of transition between childhood and adulthood. The situation 
has changed, however. Where once it was traditional for young 
people to study full time before moving on, almost 
automatically, to the job market and then starting a family and 
buying a house, now the line between adolescence and 
adulthood has grown somewhat blurred. Indeed, it is not unusual 
in this day and age to see young people having children, working 
and studying all at the same time.
<P>
	Young people experience all kinds of situations that were 
uncommon in the past. Their lives are far more stressful than 
ours were when we were their age. They leave home later 
because of their chronic inability to make it on their own. 
According to the last two census reports, 41 per cent of young 
people between the ages of 20 and 24 lived with their parents in 
1981 compared to 50 per cent in 1991. If the trend continues, 
this figure will hover around 60 per cent by the year 2000.
<P>
	Furthermore, young people are heavy consumers. This 
finding is consistent with what the social model suggested 
during their childhood. However, the living conditions of 
today's young people are vastly different than those of their 
parents. Two major considerations dominate the relationship 
between young people and employment, namely access to 
employment and loss of employment. Young people must be 
patient when it comes to finding a job, while at the same time, 
they can only hope to hold on to the job they ultimately do find.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	In 1986-87, 60 per cent of young people aged 20 to 24 
changed jobs; 45 per cent of this group changed jobs twice, not 
counting those who simply lost their job and could not find 
another one. In 1992, young people aged 16 to 24 were without 
work for 17.6 weeks. The new realities of the labour market hit 
our young people hard.
<P>
	Nearly 40 per cent of those who work have a part-time or 
contract job. Thirty per cent of employed young people work in 
companies with 20 employees or less, which reduces their 
chance of keeping their job because, as we know, small business 
is very volatile.
<P>
	In Quebec, 72 per cent of employed 20- to 24-year-olds are 
not unionized; 85 per cent of these young people have no 
pension plan and will not be eligible for one. This is very 
significant for the long-term security of our young people, 
especially since they enter the labour market when they are 
between 25 and 30 years old, compared to 20 years old for those 
entering the labour market in the 1970s.
<P>
	Young people would also like to be able to save for retirement, 
but as student debts increase, given the labour market and job 
entry conditions we just mentioned, we may well wonder 
whether the government has evaluated the long-term impact of 
this action. Young people are increasingly aware of what they 
have to do. They study more than their predecessors. They are 
proud and fear both rejection and their difficult living 
conditions. But young people also want to be independent. They 
do not want to depend even more on governments and financial 
institutions. But this government tends to consider young people 
as a threat, as potential social problems to be contained.
<P>
	Did the government seriously consult those involved in the 
student community before it reformed student loans? No, 
Madam Speaker. It proceeded in the same way as with 
unemployment insurance reform. Education was one of the few 
hopes young people still had to avoid unemployment, but what 
is the situation now, since 50 per cent of the young unemployed 
have not graduated? It is true, but 33 per cent have a high school 
diploma, 17 per cent a college diploma and 8.6 per cent a 
university diploma, and still they are unemployed.
<P>
	The government must make it possible for young people to 
study with dignity and without becoming too indebted. The 
government must launch a real youth employment strategy.
<P>
	Now I would like to say a little about education funding, 
because as student debts are allowed to rise, we must see that the 
federal and provincial governments throughout Canada are 
spending less on education.
<P>
	As a result, these institutions have no choice but to raise their 
tuition fees. Under particular arrangements between the federal 
and provincial governments, the federal government contributes 
to post-secondary education through established programs 
financing; 32.1 per cent of EPF transfers are for post-secondary 
education. Of the funds allocated to education in Quebec in 
1991-92, of course most came from the provincial government, 
$10.1 billion or 82.4 per cent of the total; 7.7 per cent from 
private sources; $913 million or 7 per cent from the federal 
government and $302 million or 2.5 per cent from local 
governments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4314"> 4314 </A></B>
<P>
	Statistics Canada estimates total education spending in 
Canada at $50.6 billion. In 1991-92, $14.3 billion or 28.2 per 
cent of total spending was spent on post-secondary education. 
For that period, Quebec spent a little over $4.2 billion on 
post-secondary education, or 34.5 per cent of the total education 
budget, compared to Ontario, which spent a little over $5 billion 
on post-secondary education, or 25.3 per cent of its total 
education budget.
<P>
	Between 1973-74 and 1991-92, the average annual increase 
in government spending on post-secondary education was 
10.2 per cent in Quebec and 8.9 per cent in Ontario. These 
figures may seem impressive at first glance, but upon analysis, 
we can see that federal aid for post-secondary education has 
been declining for years.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	In the beginning, the federal assistance introduced by a 1977 
federal act was to be index-linked to general economic growth. 
However, the federal government limited the indexing of 
transfer payments for post-secondary education to 6 per cent in 
1984 and 5 per cent in 1985. In the following years, other cuts 
were announced limiting the annual indexing to the increase in 
the gross domestic product less 2 per cent for 1986 and less 3 per 
cent from 1989. The 1991 budget brought more cuts by freezing 
subsidies for established programs financing until the 1994-95 
fiscal year.
<P>
	In constant dollars, the total federal envelope allocated to the 
Canada Student Loans Program has fallen substantially since 
1986-87. This reduction in resources at a time when the student 
population is increasing has shifted to the provinces a 
significant amount of responsibility for financial assistance to 
students. The federal government's policies are reflected in its 
alternative payments to Quebec.
<P>
	Alternative payments have not increased since 1987-88 
despite an increase in the student population.
<P>
	I would now like to talk a little about the situation of 
francophones outside Quebec. Again, the figures speak for 
themselves. If we look at a statistical profile on the link between 
education and labour force activity prepared in 1992 by the 
Canadian Institute for Research on Regional Development, we 
see that the regions where francophones are the most 
disadvantaged are those with the highest concentration of 
francophones.
<P>
	An analysis of recent data from Statistics Canada also shows 
large disparities in education levels between francophone and 
Acadian communities and the rest of Canada. For instance, 45.2 
per cent of francophones did not complete Grade 13 compared 
with 37.8 per cent of other Canadians.
<P>
	Only 17.2 per cent of francophones completed high school 
compared with 17.4 per cent of other Canadians. Only 20.2 per 
cent of francophones have some post-secondary education 
compared with 23 per cent of other Canadians. And merely 17.4 
per cent of francophones have gone to university as compared to 
21.7 per cent in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	Based on the same statistics, the rate of illiteracy within the 
francophone and Acadian communities in Canada is estimated 
at 30 per cent. At the same time, the rate of assimilation in these 
communities continues to grow, by 3.6 per cent per year on 
average now, a 4.5 per cent increase since 1986. I can see a direct 
link between the level of resources allocated to the education of 
francophones and Acadians and their rate of assimilation.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to quote some figures from the 
OECD. According to the OECD, between 35 and 50 per cent of 
the population in developed countries is living on the fringe of 
the labour market, not because they do not want to work, but 
rather because in the world today, not everyone is expected to 
contribute any more.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that the social fabric is deteriorating 
very rapidly and an increasing number of people are being more 
and more permanently excluded from work. It has got so bad 
that many young people, our future, now see no point in going to 
school and looking for a job impossible to find.
<P>
	High drop-out rates in high school and unprecedented rates of 
functional illiteracy among young people are alarm bells that we 
can no longer ignore.
<P>
	In view of the fact that all the experts agree that job creation 
through economic growth alone is a dangerous mirage, one can 
wonder what the Minister of Human Resources Development is 
trying to do by making it easier for students to get into debt 
while knowing that it will be next to impossible for them to find, 
in the short term, a decent job to pay off their school debts.
<P>
	With this bill, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
proves once more that this government has no intention 
whatsoever of dealing with the real problems or trying to meet 
the real needs of the young people in terms of post-secondary 
education.
<P>
	Where are the positive measures to boost employment? 
Certainly the minister does not expect to improve 
post-secondary education in Canada with those contained in 
Bill C-28.
<P>
	This government is turning a deaf ear to the harsh realities our 
young people are confronted with today and it is dismissing the 
impact of the many changes which hinder their integration in our 
society.
<P>
	In the absence of any real job development strategy centred on 
their needs, many young people have simply decided to quit 
school and join the ranks of UI and welfare recipients.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today on Bill C-28, the student financial 
assistance bill.
<P>
	We Reformers understand that in order to sustain our standard 
of living the youth of Canada must be properly educated with the 
goal of becoming net contributors to Canadian society. Money 
wisely spent in this regard is an investment in the future. Our 
looming debt load and increasing numbers of students however 
have meant that for many years the funding of post-secondary 
education has suffered from less money going to more people.
<P>
	Strains to the system are increasingly evident. Cuts to funding 
and overcrowding are diminishing the quality of education in 
Canada and increasing the costs of education to students. Yet 
these same students find themselves less able to pay back the 
money they owe because of the growing gap between what they 
learn in the school and what they need to know to find 
meaningful, well paid employment.
<P>
	The less able they are to financially benefit from their 
schooling, the less able they are to pay back their loans, the less 
money there is in the pot for future educational requirements 
and the entire system spirals down toward new depths of 
mediocrity.
<P>
	That is the present system of post-secondary education in this 
country. Obviously something needs to be done to address this 
problem. Is Bill C-28 an adequate response? My answer is only 
partially.
<P>
	With apologies to friends in the medical community, I am 
going to use a medical analogy to describe our position with 
regard to this bill. When someone staggers into the emergency 
room of a hospital haemorrhaging all over the place, the first 
thing the staff has to do is deal with the immediate emergency, 
stanch the bleeding and stabilize the patient. The next thing 
which must be done is assess the reason for the damage and 
determine what if any long term treatment is needed to bring the 
patient back to full health. There is little point in doing one 
without the other.
<P>
	The way I view this legislation is that the government is 
addressing the immediate emergency of post-secondary 
education but has failed to operate anything but a band-aid 
solution to what is really a more complicated problem requiring 
radical treatment.
<P>
	While Bill C-28 offers short term relief to those hurting most 
from this system, it fails to treat the underlying problem. 
Therefore our support for Bill C-28 is qualified. As Reformers 
we want to offer as part of this debate the second half which is 
missing from this legislation, an alternative to a system which is 
demonstrably sick.
<P>
	Before I put forth our position I would like to comment 
specifically on the positive and negative aspects of this 
legislation. On the plus side, Bill C-28 does offer a number of 
improvements to the old system and for that the government 
should be commended.
<P>
	The increase in loan limits offers short term relief to students 
who have had to pay for increasing educational costs with a 
smaller purse.
<P>
	The movement of responsibility for the collection of loans to 
the banks to decrease the default rate currently at 25 per cent and 
save the government considerable money, the revision of the 
eligibility criteria to emphasize academic results and the 
expansion of the assistance to apply to a broader range of 
educational institutions are all welcome changes and again I 
commend the government.
<P>
	Finally, it has made some movement toward the area of an 
income contingent repayment system although it is far too timid 
in our opinion. I will return to that later.
<P>
	To balance this assessment out, there are other parts of the 
legislation which are not so commendable to us as Reformers 
and in our opinion fail to serve the best interests of 
post-secondary students.
<P>
	The government has not changed or harmonized the needs 
assessment criteria among the provinces. For example, students 
coming from the family farm may find themselves disqualified 
for assistance because the on-paper assets of the farm are 
deemed too high. The fact that these non-liquid book assets 
have nothing to do with the ability to individually finance one's 
education inherently discriminates against a large segment of 
our students.
<P>
	This is further compounded by a reverse discrimination built 
in to the new grant program whereby only specially designated 
groups in our society will be eligible based on arbitrary 
non-financial criteria such as gender. We understand and agree 
with extra help for the disabled but surely a two-tier system of 
financial assistance is discriminating against those who lack the 
politically correct gender to qualify.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	We also have serious problems with this legislation regarding 
the minister's discretionary powers. In many areas they have 
amounted to a blank cheque, specifically in clause 5 dealing 
with any future negotiated agreement with the lenders, and 
clause 15 which governs the regulations that flesh out the 
principles in the bill.
<P>
	Since the upcoming negotiated agreement with the banks is 
fundamental to the whole issue of student financing-and I 
think the minister would agree this is really so-why are the 
conditions of this agreement not incorporated in the legislation 
so that Parliament can scrutinize and, if necessary, amend it?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4316"> 4316 </A></B>
<P>
	With regard to the regulations, we would like the legislation 
to specifically mandate that they be referred to the House 
standing committee for review before coming into effect. Such a 
directive would rightly transfer power away from the 
department officials and toward the more accountable 
Parliament.
<P>
	The Liberal red book section on parliamentary reform 
specifically states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-a Liberal government will give MPs a greater role in drafting legislation 
through House of Commons committees. These committees will also be given 
greater influence over government expenditures.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Now here is a perfect opportunity for the minister to make 
good on his promise or conversely, demonstrate to the Canadian 
people the emptiness of those words.
<P>
	These are the types of improvements we would like to see 
made to the bill at committee stage. We will certainly be 
working toward that end.
<P>
	As Reformers we believe our role as an opposition party lies 
farther than just opposing everything the government proposes. 
We believe we have the responsibility to offer to the Canadian 
people a constructive alternative to the proposals put forth by 
the government and that is what we will be doing today. It is 
particularly important with regard to this bill since the 
government has failed to show long term leadership toward the 
issue of funding and providing post-secondary education in this 
country.
<P>
	With the present system fiscal transfers under the established 
programs financing or EPF act have increased much more 
slowly than the rate of inflation during the 1980s. This is despite 
increased enrolment. Another flaw is that the federal 
government is unable to target its transfers specifically to 
education which means that the provinces have the ability to 
divert some of their funds to other social areas.
<P>
	Since the federal government transfers money to the 
provinces based on population and not enrolment, what happens 
when a province's universities are in such demand that they 
attract large numbers of people from other parts of the country? 
They are penalized in essence for their success.
<P>
	Such is the situation in Nova Scotia where there are as a 
proportion of the population more full time undergraduate and 
graduate students studying in its institutions than those of any 
other province, a whopping 54 per cent more than the Canadian 
average. Yet under the present EPF system this amounts to a 
financial penalty for building a high quality post-secondary 
education system that attracts out of province students. Where is 
the logic in that?
<P>
	Given our fiscal reality it would be misleading to tell people 
we can fix the problem by pouring in more money we do not 
have. That is old style politics: promising the moon and offering 
no means to pay for it.
<P>
	The public demand more from their representatives today. If 
we cannot promise to spend more, we can do better with what we 
are able to spend. This is where our proposal comes in, what we 
have called the advanced education voucher system.
<P>
	Right now the federal government spends approximately $2 
billion a year on transfers for post-secondary education. Under 
our proposal this amount would be divided into 650,000 
vouchers of $3,000 each. These vouchers would take the form of 
grants to students which they could spend only on higher 
education anywhere in Canada. Students would turn over their 
vouchers to the colleges or universities in which they enrolled. 
The institutions would redeem the vouchers for cash from the 
federal government.
<P>
	The reason for this reorganizing of federal funding for higher 
education is straightforward. Under our new system the 
effective choice and bargaining power of students will be 
increased because they will now have the power to spend their 
voucher where they can get accepted. Colleges and universities 
will be encouraged to compete for students in order to get the 
cash value represented by the voucher.
<P>
	The focus of our institutions will shift from governments as a 
source of funding to the students who will now be bringing with 
them not only their tuitions of $2,000 or more but their vouchers 
worth another $3,000.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	We believe the federal voucher system would work in the 
right direction by encouraging universities and colleges to 
compete for enrolment. This would set up incentives for 
universities to emphasize teaching and the other aspects of 
university life which attract students, such as the rate of 
employment for their recent graduates.
<P>
	For those who may want to lament these proposed changes 
and the pressures they will place on our universities to compete, 
it is worthwhile to refer to a recent <I>Globe and Mail</I> editorial 
entitled: ``University heal thyself''.
<P>
	While not recommending any particular solution, it very aptly 
presents the problems in our current system that our voucher 
system would address. The facts are that financial and other 
pressures are forcing our post-secondary institutions to review 
their mandates and in many cases work smarter with less money. 
Here is a quote from the <I>Globe and Mail</I> article:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Over the past generation Canadian universities have succeeded in being all 
things to all people. Governments financed the creation of new institutions and 
programs to serve a vastly expanded and more diverse clientele, all reaching for 
the middle class dream.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For the next generation, for financial and other reasons universities face a 
tougher job to choose between what they do well and what they do less well. They </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4317"> 4317 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>will either have to make  the changes themselves or allow these changes to be 
forced upon them by governments.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Increasingly, universities will have to be more inventive about carving out an 
area of expertise and delivering it in ways that are transparent to students, faculty 
and the public. If Canadian universities are to move beyond the rhetoric of 
excellence and quality in post-secondary education, they will have to become 
less homogeneous than in the past. Universities will also have to become more 
transparent in deciding what programs to save or drop in the name of quality.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Our voucher program changes the way funding is delivered to 
the universities and colleges and allows them more freedom to 
adapt themselves so as to meet these goals.
<P>
	There is another immediate real world advantage of vouchers. 
Federal support for advanced education is in serious danger of 
being eroded down to almost nothing-and this may sound 
cynical but I must put it forward-because federal politicians 
derive few political rewards from providing it. They transfer the 
money to provincial politicians who then reap the political 
rewards of building campuses, providing programs and 
appointing their faithful to boards of governors. In today's age 
of austerity there are few powerful advocates in Ottawa 
compared to those who lobby for medical care, aboriginal land 
claim settlements, or subsidies to business.
<P>
	At one stroke the advanced education voucher system would 
create a large and powerful political force for higher education 
at the federal level. This force would consist of students, 
parents, husbands and wives, all those who receive the vouchers 
and participate in decisions about how to use them. Advanced 
education could then compete on more equal terms for its proper 
share of what government could afford to spend.
<P>
	That is our constructive alternative to the present system of 
funding post-secondary education, but this would only partially 
address the financial pressures of our students. We would also 
change the current financing system so that every student was 
eligible for loans under an income contingent repayment, or 
ICR, plan.
<P>
	ICR is not a new concept. There are currently different 
elements of ICR implemented in three countries, as the minister 
pointed out, in Australia, New Zealand and Sweden. Simply put, 
it is a program which allows a student to take out a loan 
regardless of whether they are dependent on their parents. 
Students are not penalized on the basis of their parents' wealth 
or more accurately, middle class status.
<P>
	Under the current system it is often those coming from the 
middle income level who find it most difficult to go to school. 
Their families do not have the funds to pay for the schooling 
directly, yet the government says that they are not poor enough 
to qualify for assistance.
<P>
	Under the ICR plan everyone would be eligible because it 
would become the student's total responsibility to assume loan 
payments commencing when they graduated and had a job. 
Their repayment would be based on a flat percentage of what 
their salary happened to be.
<P>
	Under one proposal, if the student had a job with an annual 
income of $10,000 to $12,000, then the loan payments would be 
approximately 3 per cent, or $350 a year. As an individual's 
income increased toward say, $50,000 the rate of pay back 
would increase 4 per cent and then 5 per cent until they were 
paying approximately $2,500 a year, until their debt was paid 
off.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	With ICR, if the graduate became unemployed then the 
payments would be deferred until their annual income rose to 
exceed the set threshold. If they were unable to pay off the debt 
in 15 years, then the remaining sum would be forgiven. Also, if 
the graduate were to die or become permanently disabled, the 
debt would be forgiven. Since forgiven debts would have to be 
paid off somehow under ICR, those graduates with the higher 
income would be charged with an interest rate higher than the 
government's borrowing rate to offset the forgiven debts.
<P>
	This system would eliminate the complicated, arbitrary and 
often uneven eligibility process for financial assistance across 
the country. ICR would not have any eligibility processes due to 
the fact that the payments would become the sole responsibility 
of the student during the 15 years following graduation.
<P>
	The repayment schedule would eliminate the current situation 
of students with very low paying entry level jobs being forced 
into default simply because their loan repayment rates are too 
high for their salaries.
<P>
	Under ICR the amounts of money they would pay would be 
determined by their annual income as determined from their tax 
return. This system however could only run smoothly if the ICR 
recipient had entered a proper and accurate income statement. 
Safeguards would have to be built into the system to prevent 
fraud or misuse of the funds borrowed.
<P>
	How would we initially fund such a system, especially since 
the federal government's cupboard is bare? One way would be to 
raise funds through the current sources, the commercial banks.
<P>
	Under the current system if a person defaulted on their loan 
then the bank would have to hire a private collection agency to 
collect the owed money. The collection costs were nearly $11 
million in 1987-88. In the ICR system the lending program 
could be administered by an independent agency which could 
raise funds from the issue of bonds while a stock exchange for 
second-hand bonds, similar to the Student Loan Marketing 
Association in the U.S., could subsequently be developed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4318"> 4318 </A></B>
<P>
	Another government saving would be the significant 
reductions in write-offs and the new ability to charge compound 
interest according to the full duration of each loan.
<P>
	With the ICR program it would be possible for the universities 
to become independent from the governments by allowing them 
the freedom to raise and set their tuition fees as they felt 
necessary. It makes sense that medical school tuition rates ought 
to be significantly higher than a post-graduate arts program, 
since a doctor's earning power is much greater. Therefore the 
medical school graduate ought to be able to afford a higher 
school debt load and loan repayment cost.
<P>
	I realize that any increase in tuition fees to bring them more in 
line with the actual cost of education is bound to be met with 
howls of protest from certain areas. Student leaders in Canada 
have stridently opposed any increases as unfair to lower income 
students and a deterrent toward attending school.
<P>
	However, we believe that under our ICR program the opposite 
would be the case. The argument of a deterrent factor simply 
fails to stand up to the facts. If these were the deterrents to 
schooling they claim they are, student leaders must have 
difficulty explaining why Canada with its fee structure has twice 
the percentage of university age people in school compared with 
France where fees are zero, or why the United States with the 
highest fees also has the highest percentage of its population in 
universities among the leading industrial countries.
<P>
	Another criticism to this ICR proposal is that universities 
could poach each other's students especially when the market is 
so unstable. I would suggest this is not necessarily bad. If 
poaching took place, either by a university reducing its fees 
while keeping quality constant, or increasing its fees and 
offering more than a proportionate increase in quality via new 
courses, programs or facilities, the beneficiaries would only be 
the students in particular and our overall quality of 
post-secondary education in general.
<P>
	These are the proposals we as Reformers would like to put 
forth as a creative alternative that would offer high quality, 
affordable, post-secondary education to our students.
<P>
	Under Bill C-28 we may stabilize the patient and it is a slight 
improvement to the status quo, but that does not mean the 
patient is cured.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	While for the benefit of our students in the system today we 
may support in principle the emergency procedures of this 
particular bill, we believe our responsibility goes much further. 
We owe our future students a better system than that which 
exists today, a better system that delivers an affordable, quality 
post-secondary education.
<P>
	We believe these two goals can be achieved through our 
advanced education vouchers and an income contingent 
repayment plan. The options for our youth are either improving 
on a poor system or designing an entirely new system. As a long 
term policy we Reformers favour the latter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Madam 
Speaker, before I begin my speech I would like to tell you that 
we are going to be splitting our time on the government side.
<P>
	I am pleased to say a few words to the House to summarize the 
Canada student financial assistance bill. I am excited by this bill 
because I think it will bring positive change to the lives of many 
students who have been shut out in the past 10 years by the past 
administration.
<P>
	As we have heard, the Canada student loans program which 
was established in 1964 has provided $8.5 billion in loan 
guarantees to over 2.1 million students enrolled in colleges, 
universities and vocational courses. It supplements students' 
own financial resources from their earnings, awards and their 
families. It exists to meet a pressing need on the part of many 
young Canadian women and men seeking to better themselves.
<P>
	The reforms provided in this bill enhance assistance and 
target those in need, ease the repayment burden, emphasize 
results, provide for new financing arrangements, set the stage 
for harmonization of federal and provincial student aid 
programs, provide flexibility to explore income contingent 
repayment for education and training.
<P>
	Hon. members should remember that not only will the student 
loan arrangements be modernized but new forms of 
non-repayable grant assistance will be introduced. These 
improvements will ensure that the program better serves the 
needs of students.
<P>
	The youth employment and learning strategy stresses the 
importance of a well educated, skilled and adaptable labour 
force for the 21st century. Post-secondary education and 
training reduces the probability of unemployment and increases 
the possibility of higher individual income.
<P>
	Both the Canada student loans program reforms in particular 
and the youth strategy in general are signs of the government's 
strong commitment to the young people of our country.
<P>
	The Government of Canada is embarking on an employment 
and learning strategy in collaboration with provinces and 
industry that will help young people prepare for the 1990s 
labour market and the new global economy. It will seek to 
improve existing school to work transition measures and 
introduce new approaches for the education and training 
systems.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4319"> 4319 </A></B>
<P>
	The strategy will start to turn things around for young people 
by offering them more opportunities to learn, to work, to 
contribute to society. It builds on the strengths of what has 
worked in the past and sets the stage for new, innovative models.
<P>
	As the Minister of Human Resources Development has stated: 
``We know the status quo is not working when we see too many 
young people sidelined in society''. The government is now 
laying the foundations for improved education and training 
systems. We will test new models to help young people make a 
successful move from school to the workplace.
<P>
	Revitalized education and training systems represent some of 
the groundwork for the social security reform process now under 
way. Social programs are redesigned to restore security, offer 
employment and hope, and create a more productive economy. 
The strategy will ensure that the basics are in place to assist 
young people in becoming productive and self-reliant.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	Further changes to education and training programs will 
depend on the outcome of the social security review. Clearly we 
need to give young people the opportunity to fulfil their 
potential, to contribute to society and to help build a brighter 
future for our country.
<P>
	The central objective of the Canada student loans program 
will remain to provide financial assistance to students for their 
pursuit of post-secondary studies. The government and its 
partners are committed to a student loans program which 
provides for subsidized loans for full time students in school and 
for reasonable costs and terms in repayment.
<P>
	The challenge we face is to improve our effectiveness in 
providing access to post-secondary learning in a climate of 
continuing fiscal restraint. In order to succeed, in a nutshell, we 
must do better with the resources at our disposal. Enhancements 
to student aid must go hand in hand with measures to reduce and 
control program expenditures on defaults.
<P>
	The reforms have been the subject of extensive consultations 
with the provinces' student associations such as the Canadian 
Federation of Students and the National Education Association 
of Disabled Students, educational institutions such as the 
Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada and the 
Association of Canadian Community Colleges and financial 
institutions.
<P>
	There is consensus among the public in general, the provinces 
and interest groups on the pressing need to proceed rapidly with 
reforms to this program. There is widespread agreement that we 
must increase and diversify our assistance to students. 
Assistance therefore will be enhanced and targeted to those most 
in need. This will be done by increasing the loan limits for both 
full and part time students.
<P>
	Loan levels will be raised by almost 60 per cent and restored 
to where they would have been had they not been frozen since 
1984. The full time weekly loan limit will go up to $165 from 
$105, meaning that a student could receive a maximum of 
$5,600 per academic year.
<P>
	For example, Gregg Byron, a student from a middle income 
family of four earning around $65,000, living in my riding in 
Aurora and attending the University of Guelph would not have 
been eligible under the past system for loans. However today 
that middle class family member can have access to $2,040 in 
federal student assistance.
<P>
	That is positive change for middle class families. They are no 
longer going to be shut out of the process, shut out of learning 
and educational opportunities. That to me is the type of change 
that Canadians have been calling for and that we have acted on.
<P>
	The part time loan limit will also be increased. A part time 
student attending the University of Saskatchewan was 
previously eligible for up to $2,500 in assistance but had to 
begin repaying the loan almost immediately. That same student 
under this bill may be eligible for loans up to $4,000 in 
assistance and will only have to commence repayment of the 
principal six months after completion of studies.
<P>
	In total, the value of aid will increase by $2.5 billion over the 
next five years compared to the previous five years. The reforms 
also address concerns about the student debt load, loan defaults 
and the exceptional needs of some students. Some graduates 
have been hampered in the past by their inability to repay their 
student loans. The reforms will reduce the repayment burden for 
high need students, recent graduates as well as facilitate the 
transition from school to work.
<P>
	A national program of deferred grants for students in need 
will be set up to maintain their debt loads at reasonable levels. 
This will mean that a student with a student loan debt of $22,400 
may be eligible for a deferred grant up to $6,840 to write down 
the actual debt load of that student to $15,600.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	Interest relief will be expanded to include low income 
borrowers. For the first time in the history of the program, 
borrowers who are employed but do not make enough money to 
cover their entire student loan payment each month, may be 
eligible for full or partial interest relief for up to 18 months 
following the completion of studies.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4320"> 4320 </A></B>
<P>
	Special opportunities grants will be provided to meet the 
exceptional educational costs of students with disabilities, 
women pursuing doctoral studies and high need, part time 
students.
<P>
	I think we have brought some very positive change to this 
legislation. I look forward to debating this issue in the House 
and in committee.
<P>
	Let us remember that when we look at the big picture of 
Canada student loans and financial assistance, when we look at 
the issue of a learning continuum and getting our people ready to 
compete in the global economy, when we speak about providing 
opportunities to individual Canadians who have previously been 
shut out of a system that did not bring everyone in, this 
legislation really brings about positive change to students' 
lives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased this morning to have the opportunity to 
speak on this very important bill. I commend the parliamentary 
secretary for his remarks and his fine ability in bringing forward 
many of the points. This bill will enhance our student loan 
program. I may well repeat some of these issues as they are 
important.
<P>
	The issue of accessibility to student loans is one of particular 
interest to me. In my riding of Annapolis Valley-Hants I have 
the honour of representing students from Acadia University, 
Hants Community College and King's Tech Community 
College. I have also had the pleasure of teaching at Acadia 
University for the past 25 years.
<P>
	I know from personal experience that providing greater 
accessibility to finances for students is one of the most 
important commitments we as a government can make. The 
purpose of the student assistance program is to enable people 
who wish to pursue higher education to do so without 
encountering restrictive financial barriers or incurring an 
unreasonably heavy burden of debt.
<P>
	Over the past 30 years successive federal governments have 
played a leading role in financing post-secondary education. 
The federal commitment to the Canada student loans program 
has been crucial in the overall economic and social development 
of our country.
<P>
	As the Minister of Human Resources Development stated in 
his remarks, Bill C-28 delivers on a commitment made by the 
government in our youth and learning strategy. I believe that this 
legislation will ensure that students assistance will better serve 
the needs of the present and future generations of students.
<P>
	Our efforts to amend the current Canada student loans 
program are based on two key principles. First of all we realize 
that having a well educated, highly trained population is 
essential for our future economic and social well-being. 
Second, this bill reaffirms our commitment to ensure that the 
federal assistance is distributed in a fair and accessible manner. 
A person should not be denied access to higher education on the 
basis of not having adequate financing. An increased investment 
in our  student loans program is vital in order for our 
government to fulfil the main commitments it made in the red 
book. Whether we are discussing job creation, the information 
highway, the promotion of environmentally sustainable 
technology or the fostering of international trade agreements, 
our future economic success hinges on having a highly educated 
and well trained workforce.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Canada cannot afford to maintain a system which excludes 
groups of people from full participation. When we deny access 
to social benefits such as higher education, we cheat our citizens 
and we deprive our country of future wealth.
<P>
	The Canadian labour market and the world economy have 
changed and our social programs must also change as we move 
toward these challenges. When people become unemployed 
these days they may be out of work longer. Often they need 
retraining for a new kind of work. Higher education and training 
is one pathway out of the unemployment maze.
<P>
	Education is one of the best guarantees anyone can have in 
terms of finding meaningful long term employment. Yet, despite 
the obvious spinoffs of a well educated population, long term 
economic stability, less reliance on a social safety net, a skilled 
labour pool and an increased tax base for government, the old 
student assistance program is not meeting the needs of a 
changing society.
<P>
	While the Canada student loans program remains a major 
source of financial aid, student loans have been frozen since 
1984. At the present time steadily increasing tuition fees are 
adversely affecting those who want access to higher education in 
Canada.
<P>
	This problem is a particular concern in the province of Nova 
Scotia. Recently the student union executive at Acadia 
University forwarded to me information regarding education in 
Nova Scotia. I would like to share with my colleagues in the 
House some of the details of the information package.
<P>
	At a time when the fishery and resource industries are in 
transition, we risk leaving a whole generation of young people 
behind. In many cases their parents cannot afford to help them 
finance post-secondary education. Furthermore, many 
communities can no longer offer stable employment which does 
not require a post-secondary credential.
<P>
	Under the old program most students qualified for $3,360 of 
assistance per year. Since the loan limits have been frozen 
tuition fees in Nova Scotia schools alone have risen by 11 per 
cent. This is 5 per cent higher than the national average. The call 
for substantially increased student loans, non-repayable grants 
for those with special needs and deferred grants to keep debt 
loads manageable have been unanimous. Hard pressed students 
and parents along with educators have long pushed for increases 
in these areas. The bill demonstrates that our government is 
listening.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4321"> 4321 </A></B>
<P>
	In order to address this serious problem we have put forth a 
series of concrete and rational solutions. These include the 
increasing of loan limits for students up to 57 per cent to 
$165 per week, raising the ceiling on part time loans to $4,000 
from a current level of $2,500 and allowing students to pay only 
the interest during their studies.
<P>
	We have made a commitment to offer deferred grants to high 
need students in order to reduce their debt load to reasonable 
levels while expanding interest relief to low income borrowers 
experiencing temporary repayment problems. We are further 
promoting greater fairness and accessibility through the 
creation of a program of special opportunity grants to meet the 
education costs for students with disabilities, high need part 
time students and women in doctoral studies.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	I have already received positive feedback from students' 
organizations in my riding over the increases in student loans. It 
is clearly an initiative that is long overdue.
<P>
	One area that I would like to touch on in my remaining time is 
that of the new financing arrangements proposed in this bill.
<P>
	As a result of discussions with interest groups, our 
government realizes that we must find newer and more efficient 
methods of providing financing for student loans. For instance, 
the government will proceed with an income contingent 
repayment loan program on a trial basis. I understand that this 
type of program has been the subject of much debate and a 
certain amount of controversy.
<P>
	In my discussions with various educational organizations I 
have learned that support for this program is mixed. Concerns 
mainly exist around the fear that over a period of time block 
funding through established programs funding will decline, 
thereby shifting a greater financial burden on to students who 
would then require further increases in their student loans.
<P>
	As my colleagues and I have outlined today, our government 
recognizes the importance of having a well educated population. 
We also realize that the federal government has an opportune 
role to play in ensuring access to education and training. Our 
interest in the program reflects a greater commitment to making 
the entire student loans program more efficient and more 
effective in offering students income sensitive solutions to 
repaying loans. In no way does our willingness to look at these 
new methods of financing detract from this government's 
commitment to post-secondary education.
<P>
	Private lenders have often been reluctant to lend funds to 
students with poor and non-existent credit histories. That is why 
our government will continue to have an important role to play 
in the area of student assistance.
<P>
	Finally, the new financing arrangements will enable us to 
significantly reduce payments for default loans.
<P>
	In closing, the changes we are proposing in this bill will 
enhance the program's objective. While we wish to update and 
modernize the program, we will fully share the goals of those 
established by the student loans programs: a strong and 
prosperous Canada, a country where everyone can make a 
contribution.
<P>
	I believe that the implementation of this bill will help greatly 
as we attempt to achieve these objectives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix):</B> Madam Speaker, further 
to what was said by the Liberal member on Bill C-28, I welcome 
this opportunity to make a few comments, which will be 
followed by a question for the hon. member who just made his 
speech on Bill C-28.
<P>
	This morning, I listened to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development discussing Bill C-28, the new legislation to help 
students. Well, it is about time. It is about time the government 
improved the system to help students who are studying away 
from home and students who are doing postgraduate work. But 
unfortunately, in the last budget brought down by the Minister of 
Finance, with its projected deficit of $39.7 billion, and I say 
projected, because unless there is some degree of economic 
growth and job recovery in the near future, I think the deficit 
will be well over $39.7 billion.
<P>
	My point is this. I would like to remind the hon. member that 
in his last budget, the Minister of Finance announced a $7.5 
billion cut in social programs, spread over the next three years, 
and this will have an impact on social programs. For instance, 
the government is talking about programs to keep students from 
dropping out of school and to help them go on to university, 
which means some students will have to leave home, because 
not all municipalities have a CEGEP or university.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	Obviously the minister's bill will get students even deeper in 
debt. They will have easier access to loans and bursaries, and 
while they are still taking their courses they will only have to 
pay back the interest. Today, if you want to get a bachelor's 
degree, it takes at least three years of CEGEP, often away from 
home, and four or five years of university. It all adds up every 
year, and not all expenses are eligible for the program. I am 
thinking of accommodation, transportation costs, food and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4322"> 4322 </A></B>
<P>
clothing, all of which are not necessarily eligible for the 
program. Here again, the parents must foot the bill.
<P>
	In a previous speech on taxation, I asked the government to 
introduce some income tax measures to help parents who 
indirectly subsidize their children and pay for the education of 
those who go to school away from home. A person who lives in 
Charlevoix, Baie-Comeau, Baie Saint-Paul, or la Malbaie and 
sends his children to Quebec City or Montreal, or even farther 
away, spends a minimum of $8,000 to $10,000 annually on 
transportation, accommodation, food and clothing. I would 
suggest that the government make it possible for the main earner 
in a family where a child is sent to school away from home to 
deduct part of the cost involved from his income tax.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murphy:</B> Thank you, Madam Speaker. I thank the 
member for his non-question. I know he was trying to get where 
he was trying to get from.
<P>
	I believe the program that we are putting forward combines 
three things. It combines our whole program, not just the 
educational program here. Deficit cutting, economic 
development and the other aspect of our total program in the red 
book talk about education and getting a better educated society 
to meet the growing economic development that we say is going 
to happen in this country and I believe will happen.
<P>
	We cannot take on too much of the responsibilities that he is 
talking about because we do not want to increase that debt that 
he and we are concerned about. I think we have made a fair 
program that will access the availability for all students.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Péloquin (Brome-Missisquoi):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a real pleasure to have this opportunity to 
participate in this debate on Bill C-28 to implement reforms to 
the Canada Student Loans Program. In all conscience, I cannot 
condone this new attack of the federal government on provincial 
areas of responsibility.
<P>
	I am a teacher by profession and I am familiar with this kind 
of manipulation the federal government has been exercising in 
Quebec for so long. It is imposing national standards while 
knowing full well that they do not meet the specific needs of 
Quebec. We are wasting a great deal of time harmonizing 
curriculums, again at the expense of the students.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	Since the beginning of this 35th Parliament, the Liberal 
government has been showing puffing self-centredness in 
granting its ministers broader and broader discretionary power. 
Just a little while ago, members of the Official Opposition 
vehemently condemned provisions of Bill C-22 giving the 
minister the power to compensate friends of the Liberal Party of 
Canada following the cancellation of the sale of Pearson 
International Airport in Toronto. It seems that the government 
did not get the message the first time around, given it is caught 
scheming again to manipulate power. Once again, unreasonable 
powers are being granted to a minister.
<P>
	In my speech before the House on the cancellation of the 
Pearson Airport contract, I compared Bill C-22 to a scorpion. 
This government initiative appeared harmless enough until the 
Bloc Quebecois uncovered the government's true intentions. 
The venom of the beast was skilfully stored in a tiny little clause 
which granted the minister excessive powers to compensate as 
he considered appropriate companies and investors with close 
ties to the Liberal Party. Charles Bronfman and his buddies had 
just seen major profits slip through their fingers, and the Liberal 
Party could not let such generous contributors to its election 
fund suffer.
<P>
	Bill C-28 falls into the same category. It is as poisonous as 
Bill C-22 in that it insidiously gives outrageous powers to a 
minister. However, it goes much further in its obscene attempt to 
pervert provincial education systems, particularly in Quebec.
<P>
	The federal government simply does not have the courage to 
admit what it is doing openly. It prefers to attack in a roundabout 
way the integrity of provincial education systems. It 
shamelessly exploits an already difficult aspect of student life, 
that is the loans and bursary system. Once again, the end 
justifies the means. Regrettably, this saying is well known by all 
Liberal governments worthy of the name.
<P>
	Several provisions clearly demonstrate the pernicious nature 
of this bill. Allow me to quote a few excerpts from clause 3 
which states the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>3. (1) For the purposes of this Act, the Minister may-designate for a 
province (a) an appropriate authority, which authority may designate as 
designated educational institutions any institutions of learning-that offer 
courses at a post-secondary school level-;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	One question immediately springs to mind: What does the 
legislator mean when he speaks of ``appropriate authority''? To 
what or to whom was he referring? Again, we are confronted 
with the same old expression, one which I would readily qualify 
as diabolical, namely the infamous ministerial discretion. There 
is nothing more dangerous than putting too much power in the 
hands of one individual. I know what I am talking about, having 
spent over two years in Haiti working as a teacher and school 
principal. I know very well the damage these discretionary 
ministerial decisions can do to an education system.
<P>
	Our concern for economy and efficiency must not make us 
forget principles as fundamental as the transparency and 
democratic integrity of the entire decision-making process. But 
what are this government's real intentions in giving such powers 
to the minister? The government's allegations in this respect 
sound a little false. A May 9 press release from the office of the 
Minister of Human Resources Development states that the bill 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4323"> 4323 </A></B>
<P>
will allow the government to enter into agreements with the 
provinces to rationalize the  financing and implementation of 
student assistance programs.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	The press release goes on to say that this initiative shows how 
this government prioritizes public spending to better serve 
Canadians and promote the rational use of public funds.
<P>
	All these arguments sound a lot more like nice excuses 
invented by the Liberal government to interfere even more 
deeply in this area of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	The Canadian Constitution is especially clear on this. 
Sections 92 and 93 of the British North America Act clearly 
specify that education comes under the exclusive jurisdiction of 
the provinces. I urge the members opposite to refer to this 
section often in order to benefit from one of the few clear and 
non-ambiguous provisions of the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	This is quite an unusual phenomenon, especially since this 
provision is strictly in favour of the provinces. However, the 
federal government does not see it that way and does not seem to 
care at all about the provisions of its own Constitution. In fact, it 
has never hesitated to invade areas of provincial jurisdiction and 
the Liberals hold most of the records in this regard, 
unfortunately. They are indeed past masters in the art of always 
surrounding their usurping machinations with high-sounding 
rhetoric, thus creating the illusion that the federal government is 
acting with noble intentions.
<P>
	In fact, we have the feeling that the present Prime Minister is 
only perpetuating the invasive doctrine of his mentor, who left 
us the constitutional mess that we are in today, the memorable 
Right Hon. Pierre Elliott Trudeau.
<P>
	In this case, the minister can conclude agreements with 
financial institutions for the new Canadian student loans 
program. Negotiations have already begun with the Royal Bank 
of Canada, among others.
<P>
	Do you see the absurdity of the situation, Madam Speaker? 
The Royal Bank made itself ridiculous in the 1992 referendum 
by predicting a financial disaster for Canada if the ``no'' side 
won. This same Royal Bank would be made responsible for 
administering the federal student loans program. How can the 
Liberals seriously think that Quebec could be interested in a 
project which is so clearly intent on domination?
<P>
	However, the very prestigious Toronto daily <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
devoted the front page of its May 20 edition to constitutional 
power sharing between the federal and provincial governments, 
from a specifically Quebec point of view. In that issue, the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> gave us the results of a Léger &amp; Léger poll on 
how Quebecers see a fair distribution of powers between Quebec 
and Ottawa. It is important to mention that this is not an internal 
report by the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society or the movement for a 
French Quebec.
<P>
	The figures which I am about to give come from a poll ordered 
by what is probably the most federalist daily newspaper in the 
country. So this is what the <I>Globe and Mail</I> reported last Friday 
following a survey of 1,000 Quebec taxpayers. Only 10.9 per 
cent of those questioned think that the federal government 
administers public funds better than the provincial government.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	A majority of people would prefer to see Quebec, rather than 
the federal government, have full power regarding issues such 
as manpower training, health, justice, energy, the environment, 
etc. In fact, 62.1 per cent of respondents feel that education must 
fall under exclusive provincial jurisdiction. The results of this 
survey are very telling. People are well aware that the federal 
government has absolutely no business in a field of jurisdiction 
as important as education is for Quebec's socio-cultural 
development.
<P>
	They are also well aware that national English Canadian 
standards are not compatible with the specific needs of Quebec's 
education system. Any federal interference in the field of 
education constitutes an attack on our cultural integrity. I am 
concerned by the fact that these national standards will be set by 
English Canada, considering that it did not even recognize the 
mere principle of a distinct society in Quebec.
<P>
	I have spent close to 30 years as a teacher and my experience 
can help shed some light on the issue being debated today. All 
stakeholders in Quebec are currently holding consultations to 
implement a series of reforms to improve our education system. 
We certainly do not need federal involvement to complete this 
delicate exercise which is so important for Quebec to blossom 
out as a nation. In fact, Quebecers have clearly said so in the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> survey, and I am proud to act as a spokesperson 
and report this display of collective insight.
<P>
	I have seen a lot of things and I feel it is my duty to openly 
condemn this latest attempt by the federal government to 
interfere in a field of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. In doing 
so, I speak on behalf of all my former colleagues who still work 
in the education sector. I also speak on behalf of all those who 
voted for me last October 25 and asked me to defend Quebec's 
interests as best as I can. I also speak on behalf of all students 
attending a school, a college, a CEGEP or a university. But, 
mainly, I speak for future generations, who certainly deserve 
better than what the federal government is proposing with its 
Bill C-28.
<P>
	I would have liked to conclude by giving an outline of this 
legislation, but it is absolutely impossible and the reason is very 
simple: most of the provisions contained in Bill C-28 will be 
implemented through regulations to be made public later. When 
exactly will that be? It is hard to say since that, too, I imagine, 
will be subject to a discretionary decision from the minister.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4324"> 4324 </A></B>
<P>
	Out of respect for the public, it would be in the interest of this 
Liberal government, which has been stressing the virtues of 
integrity and transparency for months, to take a serious look at 
these nice principles before tabling a bill in this House. I 
therefore ask the government to be a little more honest and frank 
with Quebecers and Canadians. In this bill, too many measures 
will be taken through regulations. Why will the minister not 
table at least a draft of these future regulations?
<P>
	The minister responsible also gives himself way too much 
power with this legislation. Why is the government trying to 
muzzle opposition members by granting excessive discretionary 
powers to the minister? Bill C-28 seems to be an attempt to hide 
from us important elements and the government is doing its best 
to ensure that no light is shed on this issue. I remain convinced 
that if the Liberal government is going to the trouble of playing 
hide-and-seek with its legislation, it is because its intentions 
may not be as noble as it claims.
<P>
	Quebecers are not as uneducated as the federal government 
seems to think.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	Those awful separatists are not the only ones who are 
concerned about the integrity of our education system. We saw 
an instance of this today in the newspaper <I>La voix de l'Est</I>, 
where Valère Audy, a highly federalist editorial writer, made 
some comments that were particularly relevant to today's 
debate. I will quote what he said, since it is a clear indictment of 
the federal government's ulterior motives in all areas connected 
with education.
<P>
	This is what Mr. Audy had to say: ``Education is already a 
provincial matter, and Quebec does not intend to relinquish any 
part of that jurisdiction, but it must be careful because the 
federal government is constantly trying to encroach on that 
area''.
<P>
	This comment reflects how important it is for Quebec to 
maintain its jurisdiction over primary, secondary and 
post-secondary education.
<P>
	The carrot concept does not work any more in Quebec. The 
federal government may think that when they see a red maple 
leaf at the bottom of a cheque from the Royal Bank, Quebec 
students will become ardent federalists and spend the rest of 
their lives thanking their federal benefactor. It would hardly be 
in character for Quebecers, but it would not surprise me if the 
Liberal Party of Canada were to make that assumption.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I take great exception to the remarks of the member 
across the way. He used language to suggest that the government 
was devious and underhanded. If the member does not agree 
with the federal government's being involved in training 
programs, what is new? Let us call a spade a spade. Let us not 
use deceptive language to try to put down someone else because 
we hold a different  view. I find that very difficult to accept. We 
are working as a House of Commons, as a body, to try to pursue a 
better Canada for all Canadians.
<P>
	I take note that the member did not touch on the bill; he had 
another agenda. I have a question to put to him. Does he or his 
party find anything worthwhile in the bill? Or, is he only 
interested in the issue he talked about, that is Quebec and 
Quebec independence? I would like the hon. member to respond.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Péloquin:</B> Madam Speaker, I just want to say that as long 
as the federal government tries to intrude in jurisdictions that 
are strictly provincial, I will never be able to accept, I will never 
be able to vote in favour of this legislation. If the other 
provinces in Canada are satisfied and can live with this because 
it suits them and because it is what anglophones want, that is 
fine. But the hon. member seems to forget that Quebec is French 
and that Quebec has very specific needs that relate to its culture 
and its language.
<P>
	All things considered, the federal government has no business 
intruding in a matter under provincial jurisdiction, and that is 
why I cannot accept the bill as it applies to all of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade):</B> Madam Speaker, first of all, I would like 
to congratulate my colleague, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. He has introduced an extremely progressive bill, 
one that is very important for young Canadians because, Madam 
Speaker, as you know this bill will rejuvenate legislation which 
was left untouched by the former Conservative government for 
ten years.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	One of the most important provisions of this bill is the 
proposed increase in student assistance of 57 per cent per year. 
Students across Canada, whether they live in Quebec, Alberta or 
another province, will be able to benefit from a 57 per cent 
increase in financial assistance.
<P>
	As for the question raised earlier by my colleague from the 
Bloc Quebecois concerning provincial deductions, I would point 
out to him that this bill gives provincial governments the choice 
of opting out. As my hon. colleague knows, the province of 
Quebec and the Northwest Territories have already exercised 
their right to opt out of the existing legislation. The federal 
government reimburses the equivalent of $72 million to them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4325"> 4325 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore, as far as the question of provincial jurisdiction is 
concerned, the argument really does not wash.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have to move away from jurisdictional bickering and 
focus on the whole issue before us. The proposal by the minister 
calls for an increase in grants and student loans. We have to 
commend the minister for coming forward with the proposal and 
for amending an act which has not been touched for over 
10 years. It goes back 20 or 25 years. It is an archaic act that 
does not reflect the reality of today.
<P>
	My colleague questioned why the federal government was 
trying to infringe on provincial jurisdiction. My answer is quite 
frank. In Canada there are over 300,000 people between the ages 
of 15 and 24 who are unemployed. These figures do not include 
people who have given up looking for work. They live in the 
Atlantic provinces, Quebec and elsewhere across the country. 
We have reason to be concerned.
<P>
	Also across Canada on an annual basis in excess of 100,000 
students are dropping out. We have reason to be concerned. It 
does not matter which province or territory we come from. Over 
33 per cent of our youth are dropping out before they finish high 
school. We have reason to be concerned. It does not matter 
which province or which territory we come from.
<P>
	In excess of 38 per cent of Canadians are considered to be 
functionally illiterate or have difficulty reading or writing. We 
have reason to be concerned. It does not matter which territory 
or which province we come from, especially when the cost of 
illiteracy is in excess of $10 billion to the economy as a whole. I 
would suggest colleagues on both sides of the House should be 
very concerned about it.
<P>
	The minister is to be commended when he proposes 
amendments to the act and comes forward with tangible 
propositions to deal with a situation of national proportion, a 
situation which I personally call a national crisis.
<P>
	My colleague from St. Boniface worked very hard along with 
other colleagues on this side of the House to reform the act, to 
make a tangible proposition so that we would have an act to 
reflect the reality of the nineties. My colleagues and the minister 
must be commended for consulting people from all walks of life, 
special interest groups, educational institutions and so on, to 
bring forward an act to reflect the realities of the nineties. They 
must be commended.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	If there are complaints about certain aspects of the act let us 
put them on the table in the form of amendments. It is the 
responsibility of government to look at those amendments and 
to deal with them in a positive and fair way.
<P>
	I cannot for the life of me give up on the issue of education in 
Canada. If we look at the needs of the nation, at the way we are 
going, at the international situation and at the national situation, 
we cannot help but say we must do something now. Sixty-five 
per cent of all jobs in the 1990s and beyond the year 2000 will 
require at least a grade 13 education if not more.
<P>
	We can look at the figures to find out that between the ages of 
15 and 24 years only 9.8 per cent of our youth actually have 
university degrees. If we look at the same figures between the 
ages of 15 and 24 years only 17.7 per cent of them have high 
school diplomas. This is a national crisis that needs a national 
plan or a national strategy.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development must be 
commended for beginning the dialogue. Ultimately we should 
have national norms or national standards across Canada for 
education with the provinces having the right to opt out if they 
so choose. The minister has proposed a provision for provinces 
to opt out. That is fine. There is nothing wrong with that 
provided they fulfil the commitment to quality education. 
Education is already under the jurisdiction of provincial 
governments. There is no need to be nervous about the issue.
<P>
	The federal government is not trying to grab more 
responsibilities from provincial governments. It is the opposite. 
We are saying and putting in writing that education is a 
provincial responsibility. We want to work with the provinces. 
We want to enter into dialogue with the provinces to progress 
with the agenda, not block the wheels of the car that so far has 
not been moving as fast as we would like it to move.
<P>
	There should be national standards across Canada provided by 
the provinces in the core subjects of mathematics, grammar and 
the sciences. There should be a national strategy for the training, 
recruitment and retention of well qualified and motivated 
teachers at all levels of education: primary, secondary and 
university.
<P>
	Also educators should have regular professional development 
programs made available to them to be kept informed of new 
training methods, technology and developments in the subjects 
they teach, in particular the core subjects we spoke about. There 
should be closer links among the different elements of the 
educational system, industry and employers, the co-operative 
programs the minister included in his proposal and spoke about 
over and over again.
<P>
	A colleague in the opposition mentioned that many people in 
the province of Quebec did not have as much access to education 
as they should have had. I agree with him totally. It is a shame 
that we still have disparity in terms of access to education and 
the educational system as a whole across the land. For example, 
in Newfoundland we find the illiteracy rate is rampant at 40 per 
cent to 45 per cent. That is a national shame that must be 
addressed. In Quebec the figure improves a bit but is still not at 
an acceptable standard. Ontario and the  western provinces show 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4326"> 4326 </A></B>
<P>
more improvement in terms of the illiteracy level, but it is still 
not satisfactory. Everybody should be working together.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Nowadays when you finish high school in British Columbia 
do you think you can transfer your credits to a high school in 
Ottawa, in Quebec or in Newfoundland?-no. They do not 
recognize them. There are no norms, no standards, nothing. The 
educational system is in chaos.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I see you signalling me. I hope somebody 
will ask me a question. A long-winded debate is raging about 
jurisdiction when the debate should be about responsibility of 
the different levels of government to deliver a quality service. 
The minister is to be commended.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Madam Speaker, I am to 
understand from what the hon. member who just spoke said that 
the bill before us this morning is meant as some kind of 
compensation or at least something to remedy the federal 
government's inability to create jobs? In other words, are they 
saying: ``Seeing that we are unable to create jobs, let us keep 
students in school longer and let them get deeper and deeper into 
debt just so that they do not make statistics worse''? Is that what 
this bill is about? That is what I gathered from the hon. 
member's remarks.
<P>
	Regarding national standards, I think that English Canada can 
develop its own, and it is not my place to intervene in that. In the 
case of Quebec however, it is a different story. I am an elected 
representative of Quebec and the standards this gentleman 
imposes on the rest of Canada leave me rather cold, but when he 
wants to impose standards upon Quebec in an area of exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction, no way!
<P>
	So, this was my question: Does the bill before us confirm that 
the government, being unable or incapable of creating jobs at the 
present time, will cause students to stay in school 
indeterminately, perhaps causing further indebtedness, just to 
defer the problem a few years? Also, in view of the present lack 
of skilled labour in various trades in Canada, does this bill on 
student loans apply to these trades as well? I would like a brief 
comment on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harb:</B> Madam Speaker, I would recommend that the hon. 
member read the bill, because it does deal with the issue of 
access to education for young Canadians. Ultimately, the 
purpose of the bill is to facilitate access to the education system 
for young Canadians. This is not a bill to resolve all social and 
economic problems in Canada, but I can tell you that it is a very 
progressive step toward resolving the present economic crisis in 
Canada. This is a most progressive proposal. All my hon. 
colleague has to do is ask university students in his area; they 
will tell him that Canadian students are living under the poverty 
line.
<P>
	I have spoken with several students and I was myself a 
student. I remember how many times a week we had hot-dogs 
and macaroni. I am not saying that it is not good food, but the 
point is that students live under the poverty line.
<P>
	I think of all those dropping out these days. A great many 
students are quitting school because they cannot afford the costs 
involved. This bill will help them by providing them access to 
education.
<P>
	If my hon. colleague does a little research, he will find that at 
the university level, nearly 50 per cent of students do not 
complete their degree because, unfortunately, they have to work 
to support themselves. That is why what the minister is 
proposing is very important for Canadian students. I hope I have 
answered the hon. member's question.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to take part in this 
debate today. In fact, I have nothing but praise for the efforts of 
the minister who is responsible for this initiative. There is 
nothing political about this bill. We are trying to respond to the 
needs of Canadian students who wish to continue their 
education, and that includes students from Quebec.
<P>
	This bill has a built-in flexibility which allows people from 
Quebec, the Northwest Territories or anywhere else to either 
participate or opt out. So why make this bill a political issue 
instead of seeing it as a bill that deals with a number of very 
important issues? I do not understand this attitude. I wish hon. 
members opposite would discuss specific points and tell us how 
to improve the proposed legislation, and I wish they would drop 
the political references. Look at the bill and tell us how you 
would improve it, if you have any useful suggestions.
<P>
	As you may recall, I was in the House during the last 
Parliament, and the hon. member who just made the 
presentation was there, and many times he and I and a number of 
other members condemned the Conservative government's 
failure to act on the student loans issue. There were many 
problems, and they did not deal with any of them. This 
government has listened and reacted very positively.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We heard and we acted, and we acted in an extremely positive 
way.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4327"> 4327 </A></B>
<P>
	What did we do? We need to look at it from two perspectives: 
the perspective of students generally today and what 
government has undertaken to try to make life more appealing, 
more accommodating for them as they pursue their education or 
work in the workforce; and the specific item in front of us today, 
the legislation with respect to student aid.
<P>
	What have we done generally for students, in what kinds of 
situations do they find themselves today? I am referring to the 
number of initiatives that the government has recently 
announced. Let me briefly review them because I want to spend 
most of my time on the specific elements of the legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As you will recall, there were two components. The first was 
Youth Employment. It covered a number of programs that 
encouraged youth employment, including Youth Service 
Canada, which was an attempt to ensure that young people 
would be able to acquire job experience that would make it 
easier for them to enter the labour market. We also have youth 
internship programs to help young people acquire the training 
they need to find good, well-paying jobs that will contribute to 
Canada's prosperity.
<P>
	Within the same component we had summer employment 
programs to help young people find summer jobs and acquire 
job experience relevant to their future education or to the skills 
they will need in a full-time job. As you will recall, there was 
also a second component.
<P>
	The second component was called: Learning Strategy. This 
component embraced a number of initiatives, including the 
reform of the Canada Student Loans Program.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	What I want to discuss in depth in a little while is that we also 
had initiatives on learning. They were mostly aimed at setting 
national objectives whenever possible, not to supervise or 
restrict any province or territory but to try to agree so that the 
young and the not-so-young could work in any province or 
territory.
<P>
	We also had the partnership-based Stay-in-School Program 
to reduce the drop-out rate.
<P>
	These are important initiatives.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These are important initiatives for young Canadians. I believe 
that most fair minded people would say that there has been a 
tremendous effort on the part of the government and a number of 
the ministers, including the minister responsible, to respond to 
the needs of youth, whether it be for educational or work 
purposes.
<P>
	Let me talk briefly about some of the more important 
components of the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act. 
Most people recognize that it increases the loan limits by 57 per 
cent, $265 a week, which is still not a fortune. One still needs to 
budget very carefully. It raises  the ceiling on part time loans to 
$4,000 from $2,500. This was a serious weakness in the last 
program. These are two problems that were really very serious.
<P>
	It creates a national program of special opportunity grants for 
special target groups; students with disabilities, high need part 
time students, women, and doctoral studies. We recognize that 
these groups are under represented. We need to make a special 
effort to make sure they are represented.
<P>
	It establishes a regionally sensitive approach to assessing 
student need. This was a need and continues to be a need. I am 
delighted that we have responded to it.
<P>
	The bill also addresses the whole question of the repayment 
burden on recent graduates. This will be alleviated by offering 
deferred grants and by expanding interest relief. These measures 
make sure that students who have debts can pay them back in a 
way that responds to their unique situations.
<P>
	It also addresses the whole issue of consistency and fairness. 
This would be reinforced by revising eligibility criteria and by 
using a common approach to the decimation of educational 
institutions. These were great weaknesses and they have been 
addressed. That is not all.
<P>
	It goes on to address new financing arrangements for student 
loans based on lender risk sharing and access to loans and 
income sensitive terms and repayment. This will also reduce 
costs to taxpayers.
<P>
	For some members the opting out provision is very important. 
It is maintained. I find this totally supportive, sensible and 
sensitive. It also addresses the question of provisions which 
would be made to harmonize federal and provincial student 
assistance programs by streamlining financing and 
administration. It also addresses new approaches to providing 
aid and is prepared to explore income contingency repayment of 
loans. In fact, there will be some pilot projects on this.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As I just mentioned, this bill raises many questions which 
should have been addressed a long time ago. Unfortunately, it 
has not been done. I am not saying that this bill is perfect. After 
all, what bill ever is?
<P>
	But I believe that if we look at this bill, at the situation 
students now find themselves in, at our labour-force initiatives, 
at the various programs put in place by this government; if we 
consider this bill in the light of today's situation; if we recognize 
that there was not enough money for students to continue their 
education, that there were major weaknesses with regard to 
part-time students, that we were often insensitive to the 
problems of students who had trouble repaying their loans; if we 
recognize all this, Madam Speaker, I believe we will agree that 
this commendable initiative should be encouraged and 
supported.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	I hoped that we would take the politics out of this bill. I hoped 
that people would look at it for what it is, a serious and 
comprehensive attempt to respond to students and their needs 
across the nation.
<P>
	If members have specific suggestions to make in order to 
improve this, we welcome them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Madam 
Speaker, this bill is of personal interest to me. Before getting 
into my present line of work I was a teacher.
<P>
	I graduated from the University of Saskatchewan. Two of my 
daughters are presently attending the university and I have two 
more at home who also plan on going to the university. You can 
see I have a deep personal interest and understanding of 
university and for how much an education costs. I know that 25 
years ago the cost was high and I know what it costs today. I am 
deeply concerned about the cost in the future.
<P>
	I have spent much of my working life preparing students for 
university. Some of them have chosen to go directly from high 
school into the work world, but some have gone to other 
post-secondary institutions, including universities.
<P>
	Since statistics consistently show that individuals with 
university degrees have considerably larger lifetime incomes, I 
tried my best to convince as many of my students as possible to 
go to university. I often explained to them that for every day they 
spent in high school they could expect to earn $200 extra in their 
lifetime. In that way, by getting that higher education I hoped it 
would provide some incentive for them to continue on with what 
they were studying. Unfortunately not all of my students wanted 
to go; they just could not afford it.
<P>
	Even though this bill will increase the amount of loan money 
available to students by 57 per cent, the fact remains that the 
discriminatory aspects of the Canada student loans program still 
remain.
<P>
	This bill, as in the past, will require students and their 
families to take a means test. This means those students whose 
parents are well off are ineligible for student loans. Even if those 
students receive no assistance from their parents and have to go 
it alone, they are ineligible.
<P>
	Low income taxpayers are especially discriminated against as 
they are less apt to send their children to university. Yet their 
taxes are used to pay for post-secondary education, including 
the government's share of the student loans program which is 
$479 million this year alone.
<P>
	By 1990 two-thirds of the adult population did not possess 
post-secondary credentials. This means that two-thirds of the 
people are helping to pay the post-secondary education costs of 
the other third who, as stated before, earn considerably higher 
incomes. We have the poor subsidizing the rich. To put things in 
plain English, this bill will perpetuate a problem which has  
existed since 1964. We always have had this kind of thing, the 
poor subsidizing the rich for their education.
<P>
	The most serious area of discrimination is in the repayment of 
student loans which we find onerous and rigid. The current 
program discriminates against the poor and unemployed by 
forcing them to pay back their loans at the same level as those 
who are gainfully employed and/or those students who end up 
earning far more money.
<P>
	The repayment plan is inflexible because it forces former 
students to begin repaying their loans six or eight months after 
graduation, irrespective of the borrower's income. This is not 
only unfair but it also results in unacceptable default rates on the 
loans and increased collection costs, all of which cost taxpayers 
more and more money.
<P>
	Reformers maintain that the government cannot just look at 
one part of the problem of funding for post-secondary 
education, namely student loans, without looking at the problem 
of total government support for post-secondary education in its 
entirety.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	Total university enrolment has grown by 42 per cent between 
1980 and 1991. In 1980 the government invested an average of 
$7,700 per full time student to cover university operating 
expenses. By 1992 this figure had fallen in constant dollar terms 
to under $6,700, a 13.5 per cent drop. Some provinces have 
recently announced some absolute cuts in operating grants for 
universities.
<P>
	At a time when we need to become more competitive in the 
international community, when we need to upgrade our skills, 
when we have to exploit those areas at which we are better at 
providing well trained people for the workforce, it is not the 
time to be cutting back on university funding. In fact we should 
be doing the opposite. We should be trying to take advantage of 
our global economy.
<P>
	Suffice it to say with higher budget deficits, with the 
increasing debt load we are experiencing and a higher and higher 
percentage of tax revenue needed just to pay the interest on the 
debt, the budget squeeze for our universities is going to get 
worse before it gets better.
<P>
	We need to decide what is important in this country. Higher 
education is important and we need to preserve that. We need to 
preserve health care. There are certain priorities we must 
maintain. We cannot do it all for everyone. This government has 
to decide what its priorities are and higher education should be 
one of those.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4329"> 4329 </A></B>
<P>
	With declining income from federal and provincial 
governments, universities have sought other sources of revenue. 
While revenues from gifts and donations and non-government 
grants increased an average of 42 per cent during the 1980s, they 
still account for less than 1 per cent of the general operating 
income. All of those areas account for less than 1 per cent.
<P>
	Tuition fees have played a considerably more important role 
in helping to offset the decline in government revenue. Tuition 
fees have increased 60 per cent since 1980. In 1980 tuition fees 
accounted for 13 per cent of general operating revenue for 
universities and in 1992 they were a source of 22 per cent, a 
substantial increase.
<P>
	In 1991 the Smith Commission of Inquiry on Canadian 
University Education concluded: ``A preoccupation with 
underfunding pervades every campus. The effect is extremely 
negative''. It concluded that: ``There is room for increasing 
tuition fees, provided there is an effective proper student 
assistance plan''-and here is the key phrase-``with automatic 
income contingent repayment''.
<P>
	The previous speaker asked for positive suggestions. We are 
going to give him one of those positive suggestions at this time.
<P>
	What I would like to explore in more detail is this whole 
concept of student loans with a built in, automatic income 
contingent repayment plan. The Reform Party supports a move 
in this direction for three basic reasons: there would be a 
reduced cost to the taxpayer if we implemented this; there would 
be greater flexibility and fairness for students; and the 
maintenance of high quality educational services would take 
place. Those are three very strong arguments as to why we 
should consider income contingent loans.
<P>
	The reduced cost to the taxpayer is really an important one at 
this time because we cannot load down our taxpayers with more 
debt. There is also greater flexibility and greater fairness for our 
students. They would have more choices. They would have 
access to funds which they previously did not have. It would 
allow them to get into fields they would like to pursue. With this 
increased, or this change in funding, the educational institutions 
would also have more flexibility.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	In fact on April 29, Motion No. 291 was introduced by the 
leader of the Reform Party which asked the government to 
consider amending the Canada Student Loans Act to include an 
income contingent repayment system for the very reasons I have 
just mentioned. The hon. member for Medicine Hat outlined 
some of the details of how an automatic income contingent 
repayment plan would work but I think it bears repeating.
<P>
	Simply put, an income contingent loan repayment scheme for 
post-secondary education would allow students to pay back 
their student loans over a period of time based on their annual 
income and using the income tax machinery to monitor and 
collect student loans. That is already in place.
<P>
	Here in a nutshell is how it would work. All students would be 
eligible for a student loan. The means test would be eliminated. 
Upon graduation a student would begin to pay back their student 
loan. The loan repayment plan would be linked to the student's 
earnings or the ability to pay. Precisely how much a former 
student paid back would vary from year to year, depending on 
his or her salary level. That seems to me to be a very fair way to 
collect the money. The specific amount would be set as a 
percentage of income. It would be paid back through the income 
tax system. We would not have to set up a new collection system. 
If a person's income did not reach a specified amount, the 
payment would be deferred until their earnings came up.
<P>
	This repayment system depends entirely on the supply of 
accurate income statements long after the individual has left the 
institution of higher learning. Revenue Canada would have to 
supply the necessary data automatically. It could be done 
cheaply through the whole income tax system and through 
statements those people would supply. This would necessitate 
the recording of student borrowers with the tax department of 
course, and the inclusion of social insurance numbers on student 
loan forms.
<P>
	With the full details of each student including future incomes 
and movement within Canada, the income tax authorities would 
act as the primary monitor of subsequent loan collections. 
Income tax is already doing this now in the case of defaults on 
student loans when they apply tax refunds toward the student 
loan debt. That is a positive suggestion and I hope the 
government is listening.
<P>
	Income contingent repayment would save taxpayers money. It 
would save money by drastically reducing the number of 
defaulted loans. It would save money between the simple 
interest paid by student borrowers and the accumulated or 
compound interest paid by the government. It would 
dramatically reduce the collection fees on defaulted loans.
<P>
	Between 1985 and 1990, $44 million in student loans were 
written off for a total write-off proportion of nearly 5 per cent. 
The value of the defaults accumulated on the federal books since 
1984 is rapidly approaching $1 billion. Collection agencies are 
now being hired to collect the money which in itself involves 
substantial costs.
<P>
	With the total value of default now over $900 million the 
potential earnings for the collection agencies is estimated to 
range from $135 million to $170 million. Those are the fees just 
to collect these. Income contingent repayment could be imple-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4330"> 4330 </A></B>
<P>
mented immediately at far less cost, thereby improving the  
collection success rate with less frustration and aggravation for 
students and for government.
<P>
	In 1993 the Association for Universities and Colleges of 
Canada developed a proposal called ``A New Student Assistance 
Plan'' based on a concept of income contingent repayment. It 
recently made a presentation to the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development as part of the phase one 
consultations the minister has on his review of social programs.
<P>
	The materials provided by the association list the benefits of 
its proposed student loan income contingent plan. I want to go 
through three areas of benefits that it lists. I hope the 
government is listening because this is a key group that has put 
these forth.
<P>
	First of all, there are the benefits for students. Students would 
have increased accessibility and increased availability. It would 
not depend on many factors that are now put into this whole 
system.  They would have increased access. It would be for all 
students. That is a very key advantage.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Second, there would be a more fair method of repayment. The 
student loan would emphasize the student's ability to pay. It 
would not automatically come into effect six or eight months 
after they graduated from university. It would depend on their 
income level. That is a much more fair method.
<P>
	It would provide student assistance to individuals who do not 
currently qualify for means tested student assistance. It would 
be available for everyone. It would provide improved benefits 
for students in the face of rising educational costs. That is a 
reality. We must face the fact that costs are increasing.
<P>
	The second area explained as being of benefit is a benefit for 
the universities. It would allow universities more flexibility in 
setting tuition fees, including differential fees by programs. For 
example, someone in medicine who could expect a higher return 
after graduation could have higher tuition fees. Another benefit 
for the university is that it would assist universities in 
maintaining accessibility in the face of declining government 
funding. Government funding continues to go down. It would 
help the universities in that area. It would help universities to 
meet their mission of providing high quality education for all 
qualified students.
<P>
	Of course the third broad area of benefit would be the benefit 
for government. It explains it this way. It would provide an 
avenue for the federal government to continue to invest in 
higher education and to support equality of opportunity across 
Canada.
<P>
	Second, it would largely eliminate the problem of loan 
defaults since students repay only when they reach a specified 
income level. Right now 70 per cent of loan defaults occur 
within 12 to 18 months of the students completing their studies. 
It would address that problem.
<P>
	It would eliminate the need for and the cost of collection 
agencies to collect delinquent student loans by using the income 
tax system to collect loan payments.
<P>
	It would also be of benefit to government in that it would help 
the government meet its objectives of encouraging life long 
learning.
<P>
	Finally, it would permit more fairness in the way governments 
provide student assistance.
<P>
	There are those who oppose income contingent repayment, 
but I do not think their arguments hold up under serious 
examination. For example, the Canadian Association of 
University Teachers made a submission to the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development. It dismissed 
income contingent repayment without even attempting to 
compare it to the status quo. It said that under income contingent 
repayment, the total cost of education will be greatest for those 
who take the longest time to pay and that wealthy students will 
pay the least. It failed to consider that both of these statements 
are also true under the present system.
<P>
	Another complaint is that income contingent repayment 
would serve as a disincentive for the federal and provincial 
governments to maintain their grant levels once tuition fees 
begin to rise. This assertion completely ignores the reality of the 
past 15 years during which students have assumed a greater and 
greater share of their education costs as a result of financial 
constraints imposed by both the federal and provincial 
governments on these institutions. That is reality. That is the 
status quo.
<P>
	These increases in tuition have taken place in the absence of a 
single income contingent repayment plan and for reasons which 
have nothing to do with student loan programs. With increasing 
enrolments the government deficit, debt crisis and declining 
financial support from both levels of government, it is obvious 
we cannot just bury our heads in the sand and hope that the 
money genie is going to appear and save our schools of higher 
education. Let us face reality.
<P>
	The problem is serious and the problem has to be addressed 
now. This bill does not really address the problem. I call on the 
government to embark on a complete overhaul of the financial 
support system now serving post-secondary institutions and 
students.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	This government continues to tinker with programs. We need 
a complete overhaul. We cannot continue to just make small 
adjustments. I believe the federal government's established 
programs financing should be completely replaced with the 
voucher system as described by the hon. member for Medicine 
Hat. The student loans legislation should be amended as moved 
by the hon. member for Calgary Southwest to provide for 
automatic income contingent repayment. We do not need 
another pilot project, we need an income contingent repayment 
plan for students now.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4331"> 4331 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra):</B> Madam 
Speaker, one must congratulate the Minister of Human 
Resources Development on Bill C-28, an imaginative approach 
to updating and modernizing a measure that has been on the 
books for some years.
<P>
	We work in an area of some constitutional doubt. That has 
existed since the immediate post-war period when Prime 
Minister St. Laurent and his successors ventured into the field of 
higher education in the knowledge that without a national 
presence, a national leadership, we might fall behind in the race 
to achieving and maintaining world standards.
<P>
	That remains the situation today. There are limits to 
constitutional power. They necessarily condition what it is 
possible to do at the federal level in the field of higher 
education, although with imagination and some civil courage 
governments are doing their utmost in that area.
<P>
	It is also important to remember that we live in the era of 
budgetary restraint now with us. There are limits to what you 
can do in any area without taking away from other priority areas.
<P>
	What this legislation does is change something that has not 
been fundamentally changed in 30 years. It is very noticeable in 
terms of the financial provisions, the benefits available to 
students, which were frozen by the preceding government at 
1984 levels. It is very much to be welcomed that the minister has 
taken the lead here with the substantial increase in the loan 
limits, a figure of 57 per cent, reflecting the growth in education 
costs borne by students over the intervening 10 years.
<P>
	In fact, if you examine the projections for the next five years, 
the value of aid for students from the federal government would 
be $6 billion, an increase of $2.5 billion compared with the 
previous five years. That recognizes the commitments made by 
the Prime Minister during the election campaign to bring our 
standards of education in line with the best of the world 
community, that we would meet the standards of Japanese 
education, German education, education for society on the 
leading edge of technology. This is without derogating from the 
necessary provision which we all respect for the arts and other 
areas apart from the natural sciences.
<P>
	Investing in students in higher educational institutions is an 
investment in Canada's future. The government is honouring its 
commitment made during the election campaign.
<P>
	I think there is merit in examining the sensitiveness with 
which federal-provincial relations have been handled here. For 
provinces which for their own historic reasons, related perhaps 
to different views of the role of education, want to opt out of the 
program, provision is made for compensation so that the 
students in those provinces can benefit from the increases in 
federal provisions.
<P>
	The other measures in the bill relate to rationalization, 
streamlining and updating the legislative scheme in existence 
for the past 30 years, increasing the loan limits for full and part 
time students and special opportunity grants to meet exceptional 
education costs of students with disabilities, high need part time 
students and women in doctoral studies, and establishing 
objective but regionally sensitive approaches to assessing 
needs.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	The issue of repayment of student loans is one which all 
candidates in the last election who have institutions of higher 
education within their constituencies or who themselves have 
experienced education in higher institutions are aware of. It is a 
matter of extreme concern in a period where summer 
employment has largely dwindled away and where the economic 
opportunities and the times of the affluent continually 
expanding society are no longer there.
<P>
	Many of us in the last few months have been concerned with 
approaching the minister or the officials in charge and arguing 
on a case by case basis the merits of flexibility and adjustment of 
the terms of student repayment of loans. I must report, although 
this has been a certain amount of work for my staff, that we have 
been delighted to assume the burden and that we have had a good 
success record.
<P>
	This raises one of the issues which is always true for students 
of law and society. How much do you try to do by legislation? 
How much do you try to produce in your legislation an 
exhaustive code of many many pages? How much must you 
leave to administrative discretion with proper controls over the 
discretion to ensure that it is exercised with flexibility and 
compassion where that is needed?
<P>
	I believe in amelioration of the conditions of repayment of 
these student loans. In particular I noted the repayment terms 
become income sensitive. Borrowers are able to choose between 
floating and fixed rates of interest based on lender to prime. I 
think these are measures from which we can take great 
encouragement.
<P>
	I would suggest more flexibility in the timing period. There 
are ways of doing this administratively and, as I said, on a case 
by case basis. I and I am sure many other members on both sides 
of the House have experienced a warm response on the part of 
education officials when we raised the cases with them.
<P>
	The importance of this is that all eligible students across 
Canada continue to have access to Canada student loans whether 
it is directly through the federal government or through their 
own provincial governments in the case of those provinces that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4332"> 4332 </A></B>
<P>
have opted out or may wish to opt out in the future from the 
national plan.
<P>
	The costs of the reform are controlled through development of 
a consistent method of assessing student need. This is being 
developed jointly with the provinces. The federal aid sharing 
approach is caught up with the larger inquiries now being made 
for harmonizing and improving federal-provincial relations and 
administrative machinery in the areas where the federal 
government makes grants-in-aid to the provinces.
<P>
	On this particular aspect I think the government has already 
made considerable progress. What is here essentially is a 
program of updating, modernization, with more flexibility, 
more compassion, more understanding, if you wish, of student 
needs that is related to the realities that there are limits to 
federal power in the field of education. This government and 
preceding Liberal governments have done their best to interpret 
federal powers flexibly in the light of the higher policy needs.
<P>
	There is also the recognition in a period of genuine budgetary 
restraint that if you grant in one area you cut in another. What is 
very impressive here is the high priority that this government 
gives to education. Higher education is the key to our future. It is 
the key to the job strategy at the beginning of the 21st century. 
Education that is put forward now trains people with the 
technology that is necessary to build our industrial recovery and 
expansion in the next century.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Madam Speaker, during 
the election Liberal members talked a lot about allowing 
committees to have more power in Parliament.
<P>
	One of the concerns with this bill actually comes from the 
Association of Universities and Community Colleges. It is 
worried that any agreement with the banks that would allow the 
banks to lend money and collect might be so restrictive that it 
would not allow income contingent repayments to come into 
being. It has been suggested that the standing committee might 
be the appropriate place for any agreement with the banks to be 
vetted.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member would be willing to suggest to the 
minister that the standing committee would be the appropriate 
place to have the agreement with the banks reviewed and 
whether the government still holds to the commitment of 
empowering the committees to do that type of vetting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McWhinney:</B> I thank the hon. member for Medicine Hat 
for his thoughtful question.
<P>
	The cases I was referring to-that I have handled personally 
in the last few months-in fact a species of income adjustment 
has been reached in the administrative disposition of the cases 
with flexible responses on the part of the administrators. 
Whether this should be generated into a general rule is a matter 
that could be referred to a House committee. I must say I am not 
familiar with the activities of the committee in charge of this 
bill, but it seems to me it would be a thoughtful and helpful 
suggestion to pass on to the committee. As I  say it can be 
reached through administrative arrangement.
<P>
	Members should not underestimate their ability in raising a 
case for their constituents with administrators to get an 
appropriate response. However a more general rule through a 
committee would be helpful.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to make a few comments and to 
commend the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra on a very 
thoughtful presentation.
<P>
	My comments refer to my other colleague from Medicine Hat 
and I make them as chair of the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development which as he knows since he is a 
frequent attender to our committee is carrying out on behalf of 
the government an extensive consultation on Canada's social 
security system, including provisions which are being made by 
the Government of Canada to assist students. The whole student 
aid and student loans program come under the mandate that we 
have been given as a committee in connection with the social 
security review.
<P>
	As well, it is to the Standing Committee on Human Resources 
Development that this legislation will be referred. I want to say 
by way of comment that I think the whole matter of income 
contingent repayment and other features of the student loan 
system fall very much within the purview of either of the 
mandates that the committee has in order to review that part of 
the work of the human resources development department.
<P>
	Regardless of what the government proposes in terms of 
broader social security reform, the points that have been made 
by my colleague from Vancouver Quadra and by others on this 
side of the House as to the need to update the loan limits, to 
make the student loans provisions more flexible, to assist 
targeted groups that are under represented in the student 
population, such as women, persons with disabilities and others, 
and to present that package in a way that is fiscally responsible, 
has got to be a direction that we as Canadians have to go when it 
comes to assisting students to pursue higher education.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	I believe members on all sides of the House would agree with 
me that the key to Canada's economic prosperity in the future is 
a well educated workforce. The key to providing hope for our 
young people is to provide access to higher learning.
<P>
	The Canada student loans program which languished and fell 
behind under the 10 years of the Tory administration needs to be 
brought up to date quickly and that is really what the Minister of 
Human Resources Development is doing with this legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4333"> 4333 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
delighted to be taking part in this debate. I am particularly 
delighted to follow my colleague from Cape Breton 
Highlands-Canso who is an important part of the human 
resources team. I want to underline and echo the words that he 
spoke with regard to the updating of the Canada student loans 
program.
<P>
	I represent the riding of Halifax. Within the boundaries of my 
riding are Dalhousie University, St. Mary's University, the Nova 
Scotia College of Art and Design, the Technical University of 
Nova Scotia and the University of King's College. We also have 
the Atlantic School of Theology and just outside my riding in 
Halifax West is Mount St. Vincent University. Halifax is very 
much a university city. Students in Halifax are very much a part 
of our culture, if you will, and they certainly are very important 
to our economy.
<P>
	In my nearly six years as a member of Parliament one of the 
things I have been concerned about, particularly representing a 
university town in Atlantic Canada, and I have said this on many 
occasions previous in this House, is the fact that in Nova Scotia 
we have the highest tuitions, the lowest salaries for both faculty 
and administrative staff, and the oldest physical plants. 
However we still manage to provide probably, indeed not just 
probably, indubitably, the best university education that can be 
received in the country. Of course I include not just the 
universities in Halifax. I include St. Francis Xavier University, 
with a bow to my colleague from Cape Breton 
Highlands-Canso, Acadia University, the University College 
of Cape Breton and Université Sainte Anne at 
Pointe-de-l'Église.
<P>
	We have gone a long time without an update to the Canada 
student loans program. Certainly over the last six years I have 
met frequently with students. They come to my office in 
Halifax, they come to my office here in Ottawa as part of their 
national lobbying process. My house is on the edge of the 
Dalhousie campus and I meet with students on a regular basis 
just doing my grocery shopping or walking around in my riding 
on the weekends.
<P>
	One of the unfortunate hallmarks of the last several years has 
been the fact that university students have been very much 
afraid. Certainly in my riding of Halifax they have been afraid. 
Their tuition rates have risen enormously because of rising costs 
and because the Canada student loans program was not keeping 
up with their needs.
<P>
	Add to that the problem with getting jobs, with trying to 
balance studies and part time jobs, and you have a fairly stressed 
out population among students. These young people worked 
hard but they saw problems everywhere they turned and they 
saw unfortunately in the past a government that was not very 
responsive.
<P>
	In consequence I am absolutely delighted that this bill 
delivers on a commitment made by the government in its youth 
and learning strategy. That commitment was to improve student 
assistance to better serve the needs of present and future 
generations of students.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	We talk a great deal in Nova Scotia about the brain drain. 
Perhaps we can be pardoned for reiterating the statement but 
Nova Scotians have travelled right across this country. They 
serve in legislatures. They are on the faculties of universities. 
They are on the boards and in the management offices of large 
and small businesses. Many of these Nova Scotians who have 
fanned out across this great country of ours are a product of 
Nova Scotian education.
<P>
	We are delighted to make this contribution to the national 
effort. We are proud of the daughters and sons of our province 
who go farther afield to make their futures. For a long time we 
have been concerned that this tremendous outpouring of the 
educated was going to be stifled because young Nova Scotians 
just were not going to be able to take advantage of the 
opportunities that our great universities give to them.
<P>
	It is important to note that loan levels had been frozen for 10 
years while tuition fees were rising at an alarming rate. It is 
important to note that this legislation sets the stage to modernize 
the whole Canada student loan program which has not been 
fundamentally changed in 30 years. This means effectively, 
while I hate to admit it, that prior to this bill the Canada student 
loan legislation was exactly the same for the students starting 
university last year as it was when I started university-perish 
the thought-30 years ago this September. I could say I was two 
but it would not be true. The need for change and the time for 
change clearly had come.
<P>
	A number of us within the caucus, as we worked on the policy 
plans that led to the red book, had lobbied very long and very 
hard with the Minister of Finance, as he is now, and with 
Chaviva Hosek, who was then head of the research bureau and is 
now chief policy adviser to the Prime Minister, for changes. I am 
delighted to see that those changes have come about through the 
presentation of this bill.
<P>
	What is particularly edifying about this legislation is the 
increasing of the loan limits for full and part time students and 
the providing of special opportunity grants. This is something 
that was long overdue. Special opportunity grants are in this bill 
to meet the exceptional education costs of students with 
disabilities, high need part time students and women in doctoral 
studies, and to establish an objective, regionally sensitive 
approach to assessing student need. I will address the last point 
very briefly by saying that life can be very different for a student 
in Nova Scotia than for a student in metropolitan Toronto and 
different again for a student in the prairies or in Vancouver. It is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4334"> 4334 </A></B>
<P>
time that the Canada student loan recognized those regional 
differences.
<P>
	I want to say that the special opportunity grants are a 
tremendous addition to the Canadian student loan program.
<P>
	I attended as an undergraduate Mount St. Vincent University 
in Halifax where I later taught. I was fortunate enough to be a 
member of both the board of governors and the senate and I was 
also president of the national board of the alumni for Mount St. 
Vincent.
<P>
	Mount St. Vincent has special programs for women. It has 
special programs for students with special needs. However for a 
long time those of us involved with Mount St. Vincent knew that 
it was necessary for the Canada student loans program to reflect 
and be sensitive to these particular needs.
<P>
	I am particularly delighted that this is being looked at and 
taken care of in this bill. I sincerely hope that no one thinks that 
the moneys being expended through this legislation are a waste.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	I hope we will not hear that this investment in the future of 
Canadians, young Canadians, Canadians with special needs, 
Canadian women and so on, is something we should not be 
doing. The need to invest in our students, in the next generation, 
in those who are to carry on nation building and ensuring that 
this remains the greatest country on earth, is never a waste. I for 
one sincerely hope that no one in the House would suggest 
otherwise.
<P>
	I conclude my remarks by congratulating the Minister of 
Human Resources Development for bringing forward the bill. 
The students of Canada, particularly the students of universities 
in my riding, will rejoice that the government has taken its duty 
to heart and has fulfilled another promise from the red book. It is 
taking to heart what is in the best interest of Canadians, 
particularly young Canadians, making it law and making sure 
that we as a government represent and put forward the very best.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened very carefully to the speech made by the hon. 
member, especially since she hails from the Maritimes. I would 
like to ask her a question about the decision to abolish the 
special 18-month deferral given to students who have graduated 
but have failed to find a job.
<P>
	The previous legislation stipulated that any student who could 
not find work after graduation, something that happens often 
enough due to the current economic recovery situation, was 
given an 18-month deferral, which meant that the student could 
continue looking for some work without having to pay back his 
or her loan.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member would be willing to suggest to 
her government to reinstate the deferral period in this bill, 
through an amendment, at committee stage or any other way, so 
that, given the economic situation, someone who is looking for 
work will not be penalized and thrown out in the streets merely 
because society cannot provide him or her with a job.
<P>
	I am asking hon. members, and especially those from the 
Maritimes who will have to address unemployment issues, like 
the increase in eligible weeks and the reduction in benefit weeks 
following the social reform, would it not be possible to ease 
things up for students by maintaining the previous provisions 
which gave an 18-month deferral to unemployed graduates?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question but ask for a clarification. In my experience it was not 
an 18-month deferral under the previous student loans 
legislation. It was a six-month deferral and if there were special 
circumstances the time period could be extended. Before I 
became a member of Parliament, I acted several times for 
students who were given longer deferral periods.
<P>
	Perhaps it was different in Quebec because Quebec had the 
opting out. There may have been something different in the 
province of Quebec but, as I understand it, it was six months. As 
I also understand it, if circumstances warrant deferrals can 
continue. Given that we have to be very responsible fiscally, if 
students are working and can pay back they should pay back as 
soon as possible. Most of us who have bank loans do not get 
deferrals if we are working. There is flexibility if there is a 
problem; if the student is not working a deferral can be made. It 
was not at any time 18 months, but as I say there may have been a 
different situation in the province of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
a quick question about the affirmative action part of the 
program.
<P>
	Could the hon. member tell us roughly what percentage of 
women are currently undergraduates in the physical sciences 
compared to men? What would be the difference between male 
undergraduates going on to graduate school and females?
<P>
	The second part of the question is if the government goes 
ahead with the legislation what steps will be taken to ensure that 
men still have access to all the spots in graduate school so that 
there is no discrimination against men through legislation by the 
government?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Madam Speaker, I will defend to my dying 
breath the rights of men to get into graduate school. I reassure 
the hon. member for Medicine Hat that while I do not have at my 
fingertips the percentages of women in the physical sciences and 
the other programs he mentioned, at the moment members of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4335"> 4335 </A></B>
<P>
male gender  are not in any danger of losing their superiority in 
numbers in graduate schools in the country, particularly in the 
sciences.
<P>
	I merely tell the hon. member there is a fairly strong men's 
group working on the matter. It is called western civilization. 
However, if he is worried about it, he should get deeper into the 
whole area of affirmative action to discover that women have 
been discriminated against most strongly in these areas for a 
number of years. Any program that comes along to ensure more 
women in these areas is obviously going to be supported by the 
government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in this debate on Bill C-28 
regarding student loans and other forms of financial assistance.
<P>
	I would like to start with a brief historical background. In 
1964, Quebec decided to opt out of the student loans legislation, 
and this has allowed us to develop a different model, more suited 
to the various regions of Quebec and the different forms of 
education we have. For example, at the college level, we have 
one extra year before entering university, something which does 
not exist in English provinces. We are proud of the model we 
have developed over the years and, even though there have been 
a few glitches from time to time, we have something which 
answers the needs of our students. This is particularly important 
in regions like the one I represent where we have two CEGEPs, 
one in La Pocatière and one in Rivière-du-Loup.
<P>
	There is also one university, the <I>Université du Québec à 
Rimouski</I>, which serves the riding of 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, and one vocational training 
centre which you enter after high school. They are all important 
for the region, not only from an economic point of view because 
of the students they attract from elsewhere, but also because 
once they graduate these people can contribute to the economic 
development of the region.
<P>
	It is important that the provisions be an incentive to study. 
The example I was giving earlier to the hon. member is a case in 
point.
<P>
	When you remove the possibility for students who have 
completed their studies to benefit from an exemption period 
should they fail to find employment, you introduce a 
disincentive to education. This is particularly so in areas where 
unemployment, especially seasonal unemployment, is high and 
where the likelihood of finding employment a few months after 
graduation is remote. We would have liked to see in this bill a 
more decentralized approach. Unfortunately, what we see 
instead is more of the same as in the UI reform where the 
Minister of Human Resources Development announced an 
increase in the number of insurable work weeks and a decrease 
of the benefit period, which is a direct attack  against those 
economies which rely heavily on seasonal employment.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	In the same vein, we find the kind of offensive you would 
normally not expect from a Liberal government, especially 
given its electoral promises. For instance, you will find that 
when a former student becomes disabled, for him to claim his 
permanent disability as a reason for not repaying his student 
loan, it has to occur within seven months of the end of his 
studies. Currently, this period is much longer.
<P>
	Under the guise of making it easier for students to have access 
to the Canada Student Loans Program, in fact the government is 
setting stricter limits. It is making it more difficult to invoke 
conditions beyond someone's control. Becoming disabled is 
usually beyond one's control. If, for example, a student is 
disabled as a result of a car accident, during the winter, nine 
months after the end of his studies, the course of his life is 
altered forever, and on top of that he has to assume the burden of 
student loans and grants he was hoping to pay back as soon as he 
had a job, which he finds himself unable to do because of his 
new disability.
<P>
	The hon. member for Vancouver Quadra was just talking 
about compassion. I think that the government should show 
more compassion and treat former students who are in a difficult 
situation more humanely instead of the opposite.
<P>
	Another aspect of this bill that we representatives of Quebec 
find totally unacceptable is the departure from what used to be, 
that is allowing the appropriate authorities to act in the area of 
loans and bursaries since appointments were made by the 
provincial cabinet to the appropriate bodies. In the new bill, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development takes it upon 
himself to appoint these people. We think that this is 
unnecessary centralization that will hurt the practical 
application of this program in every province.
<P>
	Secondly, before, provinces opting out as Quebec did had to 
show the federal minister that their own plan met the general 
conditions of the federal plan, which left them with some leeway 
to adjust their loans and bursaries programs to their own needs.
<P>
	Now the new bill says that the province will have to show that 
the program which it wants to implement meets the 
requirements of the federal law in every area covered. 
Obviously, in the medium term, this will force provinces like 
Quebec that want to have their own loans and bursaries to 
comply more and more with federal standards and thus, on 
occasion, to diverge from their own provincial requirements.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4336"> 4336 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	On top of the massive centralization it will bring about, this 
bill also gives the minister too much leeway in defining the 
reform. We are moving from a system where most of the 
elements were provided in the legislation to a reform which will, 
in the end, be implemented through regulations we know 
nothing about.
<P>
	This is like signing a contract without seeing it. Before the 
government signs the contract, we would like to know exactly in 
which kind of a regulatory framework this legislation will be 
implemented; we want to avoid any surprises, especially since 
the examples I gave earlier show these regulations may indeed 
contain surprises not altogether to the advantage of students.
<P>
	Since the minister promises to submit the regulations to a 
committee, I believe it would be important that we get them at 
this stage so that we may analyze them globally and see if the 
program, as it will be when those regulations are implemented, 
will be beneficial for students and will in fact create an incentive 
for the youth of Quebec and Canada to study, to succeed and to 
get well-paying jobs that will enable them to contribute to the 
development of their community.
<P>
	I think this bill should be improved in order that the reform 
meets all the requirements of the students and other 
stakeholders, that is educational institutions, banks and all other 
banking institutions, and that it results in a better system, more 
efficient than the one we have now but also more advantageous 
for future generations.
<P>
	The cost of student grants and loans, and on that point I agree 
with the member who just spoke, must be regarded as an 
investment. It will allow us to see that the generations 
graduating in the year 2000 will have a maximum chance of 
finding jobs, leading decent lives and creating adequate family 
lives.
<P>
	In the context of this International Year of the Family, I think 
that is exactly the attitude we should adopt regarding this 
situation.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to call the attention of the House 
particularly to the rather more difficult circumstances that could 
result from the fact that students will be asked to undertake a 
study program with very little assurance of being able 
afterwards to make use of the time needed to find appropriate 
jobs. For instance, a student who is presently in high school 
meets a professional training counsellor to discuss his future 
choices, and he tells him to get into a loan and bursary system 
that provides this and that, that he should get an education in 
order to have a better chance of ultimately making good money 
and leading a normal life. But if the conditions that are offered 
to him are less advantageous, we are encouraging these people 
to leave the system.
<P>
	A bill such as this could, through changes that seem 
economically profitable in the short term, have a negative 
long-term effect in the sense that students, instead of getting 
into the education system in order to be the most competitive 
possible, would rather choose to quit school too early, thus not 
providing the manpower that Quebec and Canada will need in 
the coming years.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	So, I believe it is important that, in the future, the minister not 
bring about, through his decisions, changes that would upset a 
system that took several years to develop, especially in Quebec, 
where the loan and bursary system has sometimes led to major 
discussions. The government should not, by interfering in an 
area of provincial jurisdiction, jeopardize advances made in that 
area.
<P>
	We would like the minister to insure most of all the tabling of 
regulations to make sure that the package is an interesting and 
logical piece of work, rather than a series of scattered decisions 
or decisions that will make the life of students more difficult.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade):</B> Madam Speaker, several Opposition 
members have raised an issue which I consider a rather 
interesting one: jurisdiction over education. They said that 
education is a matter of provincial jurisdiction. Our government 
agrees with that, but I would like to set the record straight.
<P>
	In the bill as tabled by the minister, there is a provision under 
which the provinces are not obliged to participate in the 
program. As you know, Quebec and the Northwest Territories 
have already said they do not want to participate. I would 
appreciate if the hon. member would tell me whether he is 
satisfied with the bill proposed by the government as far as 
jurisdiction is concerned, and I want to stress that this bill 
recognizes the right of the provinces and territories to do what is 
referred to as opting out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member 
for his question, which gives me an opportunity to clarify my 
position. It is true that this bill is not satisfactory to us, because 
in the section that applies here, the provinces must satisfy the 
minister that their plan, in relation to the matter in question, will 
substantially have the same effect as the federal plan. 
Previously, this requirement only concerned the effects of the 
plan.
<P>
	So there is a big difference between the two. Previously, they 
said: ``What are the objectives of your plan for Quebec?'' And 
the federal minister said they were in line with the federal 
objectives, and it was all right. However, as the bill stands now, 
it says that the plan will have to have the same effect in relation 
to the matter in question, which means that the provinces have 
lost the flexibility they had before in this respect, and 
everything will depend far more on the individual minister.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4337"> 4337 </A></B>
<P>
	The person who is Minister of Human Resources 
Development today may not be there a few years from now. And 
we can expect bureaucratic inflation because when a 
bureaucracy is allowed to check the details of a program, you 
may be sure that this will make a lot of jobs for public servants.
<P>
	Previously, the emphasis was more on political objectives, 
and so it was more up to the politicians to make a general 
evaluation. In fact, there have been no major problems with 
Quebec's opting out in this area for the past thirty years, but 
there were no reforms during the past thirty years either. We do 
not want the provisions of the new legislation, as it stands now, 
to add to bureaucratic constraints, at a time when we should be 
doing the exact opposite and giving the provinces as much 
leeway as possible.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	I think this is a time for general legislation which allows for 
defining objectives and clearly identifying these objectives and 
not a time for setting up audit teams in Ottawa to audit Quebec 
and the territories concerned who have the same kind of 
situation and fighting about whether our plans have 
substantially the same effect. In this respect, the new legislation 
is not satisfactory to us, and that is one of the reasons why we 
object to the bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey):</B> Madam Speaker, 
education is a universal norm. I used to be a teacher. One thing 
about education is that it is dynamic.
<P>
	In a lot of cases although people develop ideas in different 
municipalities those ideas might be the same. There has to be 
some central body to make sure there is some kind of uniformity. 
That is the role of the federal government.
<P>
	We are not trying to stifle creativity in whatever this 
government is drafting. We are trying to make sure that we 
enhance and use all the knowledge and talents from all the 
provinces. I do not think any one province has talents exceeding 
those of another province.
<P>
	For instance, in my municipality a youngster at one of the 
high schools I taught at qualified recently for a global 
scholarship. He will be leaving for Japan. I will be making a 
statement in this House about that. I know that all provinces, all 
peoples and all races produce people with these talents.
<P>
	It is the role of the federal government to make sure that the 
educational facilities throughout this great country of ours have 
some semblance of order. Notwithstanding the fact that 
provinces are innovative and the province of Quebec has done 
extremely well with its economic base and some restructuring of 
its industries. In fact, it is a leader. Certainly the rest of Canada 
from time to time could copy some things from Quebec, but I am 
sure there are also things in Ontario which could be 
cross-pollinated.
<P>
	There is always this movement of the provinces wanting more 
responsibility. They ask the feds to collect the money and then 
pass it on. However the feds do have a responsibility to maintain 
that uniformity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comment. I singled out two expressions that he used, because 
they set us apart dramatically. He mentioned a ``central body'' 
and ``uniformity'' as being responsibilities of the federal 
government. This is precisely what we disagree with.
<P>
	Education development, in Quebec and in Canada, cannot be 
uniform from one end of the country to the other. If you take just 
one example, the Northwest Territories, where the loan and 
grant system is applied differently, certainly have situations 
which differ greatly from ours. As to uniformity, a province 
might consider-and Quebec just did it- extending the loan 
and grant program to vocational training, to people who enter 
the labour market after high school, because it makes sense in 
that province, while it may not be the case elsewhere.
<P>
	Some provinces may wish to emphasize keeping their 
graduates at home. This is why we disagree on this subject and 
why we oppose the bill introduced by the government.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, drunk driving continues to be a problem throughout 
Canada. Every year in Canada over 45 per cent of all traffic 
collisions involve alcohol.
<P>
	I am told that every 20 minutes in Canada someone falls 
victim to a drunk driver and every four hours someone is killed 
as a result of drunk driving. In 1991 over 31,000 Ontario drivers 
were charged with impaired driving offences. That is one person 
every 17 minutes.
<P>
	The Peel regional police through a program called Operation 
Lookout call upon all Ontarians to report drunk drivers. All 
provinces should follow this example.

	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, after 
127 years of federalism, the Outaouais is still neglected by the 
federal government and receives only 1 per cent of the $2.5 
billion in federal contracts which are awarded every year. This 
shameful neglect on the part of the federal government proves 
how totally indifferent it is to the economic development of the 
Outaouais and the creation of jobs in this area. Such an attitude 
has a disastrous impact on its economic situation.
<P>
	The fact is that the federal government, while saying it 
champions the cause of the Outaouais, is actually promoting the 
inequality which has persisted in the Outaouais and 
Ottawa-Carleton regarding the awarding of federal contracts.
<P>
	After decades of fruitless protests and demands, Quebecers, 
especially in the Outaouais, have now understood that it is only 
through sovereignty that they will be able to develop their 
country.

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
August 1992, 73-year-old William Dove was lured from his 
cabin near Whitewood, Saskatchewan and brutally beaten to 
death by two men and a teenager. Unbelievably, Hubert 
Ascoose, one of the two men convicted of manslaughter, is 
already eligible for parole.
<P>
	The victim's mother has asked to attend the parole hearing 
scheduled for June. The parole board has advised Mr. Dove's 
family that they are welcome to attend the parole hearing ``but 
they won't be able to say anything''.
<P>
	Many people in Saskatchewan feel that the three charged in 
this case got such light sentences that they literally got away 
with murder. Once again the system bends over backward for the 
criminal and denies the victim's family a chance to tell the 
parole board what they think.
<P>
	When is the government going to correct this gross injustice? 
When is the government going to make changes to the parole 
system to put the rights of the victim and the protection of 
society as its first priority of the criminal justice system?

Speaker, as a member from Atlantic Canada I am very proud and 
very pleased that my government, the Government of Canada, 
has recognized the 12,000 Canadians who voluntarily served in 
the merchant navies of Canada and other allied countries during 
the second world war. Many of those merchant mariners came 
from Atlantic Canada and one out of ten died on the high seas.
<P>
	Yesterday, after 51 years, this government represented by the 
hon. Secretary of State for Veterans and the hon. Minister of 
National Revenue in twin ceremonies in Halifax and in 
Vancouver presented the Canadian Volunteer Service Medal to 
veterans of the Canadian Merchant Navy. With the 50th 
anniversary of the D-Day landings on the Normandy beaches 
just a few days away, it is very appropriate and timely that this 
government acknowledge the success of the allied war effort 
vested in large measure in the considerable sacrifices made by 
allied merchant seamen.
<P>
	Today Canada salutes the veterans of the merchant navy and 
we thank them for their ultimate sacrifice.

	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in the 
House today to honour an officer and a gentleman on his recent 
retirement. For 35 years Lieutenant Colonel Donald Edward 
George Irish has served our country as a member of the 
Canadian forces. During that time he has made significant 
contributions to the Canadian cadet organization and the youth 
in the Hamilton-Wentworth region.
<P>
	He is respected by his fellow officers, revered by his 
cadets-I know because I am one of them-and known to his 
peers to be knowledgeable, fair and impartial in mediation. In 
fact, Lieutenant Colonel Irish is considered by many to be the 
most respected cadet instructor air list officer to have ever 
served in the Canadian cadet movement.
<P>
	With his time, compassion and genuine concern he has played 
a major role in guiding the development of one of Canada's 
greatest resources, our youth.

accomplishments of Lieutenant Colonel Donald Edward George 
Irish.

Asbestos area. On May 11 last, the issue of Metropolitan Gas 
expansion was debated by the National Assembly. Mr. Johnson 
stated at that time that it was not cost-effective to invest in that 
area.
<P>
	People there have been ingenious enough to diversify and 
survive after the demand for asbestos dropped dramatically; 
Thetford Mines was even declared Industrial City of the year in 
1992. We can see that Mr. Johnson is completely disconnected

<P>
	While this industry has struggled in the face of low world

land use decisions here at home, the B.C. industry remains a 
driving force, employing 33,000 British Columbians and

the South African Parliament opens. One of the first items on its 
agenda is the reform of the justice system to remove decades of 
prejudice and imbalance.
<P>
	It is about time we did the same. Canada incarcerates 
offenders at a rate which is the third highest in the world. Canada 
incarcerates its aboriginal people at a rate which is three to four 
times higher than the population as a whole and at a rate which is 
twice the rate South Africa incarcerated blacks.
<P>
	The right wing Reform Party is today asking Parliament to 
change the Young Offenders Act. The fact is 70 per cent of the 
offences committed by young offenders are only property 
offences but an amazing one-quarter of these youth who commit 
these property offences are sent to jail.

	Unlike the right wingers opposite, our government is 
committed to putting justice back into the justice system.

	In celebration of this day, the Prime Minister has asked 
Canadians to reflect on the important role the family plays in all 
our lives. In particular he recognized the importance of the 
family unit for children and young people.
<P>
	I would like to build on the Prime Minister's words and ask 
Canadians to reflect on the significant role played by the senior 
members of our families, our parents. My father, who is with us 
in Ottawa this week, is an example of the generation that with 
hard work and dedication made Canada the great country it is

people who have made this country. These Canadians are truly 
the foundation of our society.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week, the Prime Minister stated that since the 
Canadian Constitution is silent on the matter, the issue of 
Quebec's sovereignty is, and I quote: ``purely hypothetical''. 
This statement raised some doubts about the Prime Minister's 
position, that is to say, whether or not he recognizes Quebec's 
right to decide on its own sovereignty.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister to remove these doubts as to 
his position on the subject and to tell this House whether or not 
he recognizes Quebec's right to self-determination.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in 1980, we allowed a referendum to be held on the question of 
Quebec's separation. As I said several times last week, and I say 
it again today, only 5 per cent of Quebecers see the issue of 
separation and the Constitution as a priority. It is my duty to deal 
with the nation's real problems instead of spreading political 
and economic uncertainty in this country, and to make sure that 
Quebec remains in Canada. And I am convinced that Quebec 
will remain Canadian.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I asked a fundamental question which requires a clear 
answer. My question is whether the Prime Minister of Canada, 
of this country, respects Quebec democracy. Will the Prime 
Minister tell us clearly, and I will repeat my question, as head of 
State and Prime Minister, whether or not he recognizes Quebec's 
right to self-determination?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is a very broad question. It is more or less what the Leader of 
the Parti québécois said last week, when he commented on an 
international opinion according to which Quebec's borders 
would have to remain as they are. In the same opinion, it was 
also said that according to international law, Quebec could not 
separate from Canada without the consent of Canada, and that 
we would have to allow a vote to be held on the question.
<P>
	That was done in 1980. I worked for the federal cause in a 
democratic vote, and Quebecers decided to remain in Canada. 
When I read current reports, I am convinced that this is not what 
Quebecers are concerned about, and that we are wasting our 
time. And as the Leader of the Opposition traipses around the 
world, he is creating problems for the Canadian economy, 
because talking about separation has a destabilizing effect. I am 
talking about a united and prosperous Canada that will go into 
the twenty-first century as a country that is a shining example to 
the world, and with all the provinces in Canada.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to ask the Prime Minister whether he realizes 
that his ambiguous remarks imply that he reserves the right not 
to recognize the desire for sovereignty democratically 
expressed by Quebecers?
<P>
	How can he reconcile this ambiguous attitude with his own 
behaviour and that of his leader, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, in 1980, 
when they were both very much involved in the Quebec 
referendum campaign and they agreed to abide by the outcome 
of this democratic process? Why don't this party and this 
government follow the example of the Conservative Party and 
the  New Democratic Party which adopted resolutions formally 
recognizing Quebec's right to self-determination?

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want a referendum with a very clear question, not playing on 
words to try to confuse people, not talking about sovereignty, 
not talking about sovereignty association, but talking about the 
real thing: the separation of Quebec from Canada.
<P>
	I am a democrat but I am not going to spend my time debating 
that because I know clearly that the preoccupation of the people 
of Quebec is exactly the same as the preoccupation of all 
Canadians. They want jobs, job creation and growth. They want 
all parties to work toward that goal rather than have the Leader 
of the Opposition, who is supposed to protect the interests of 
Canada when abroad, creating uncertainty around the world. He 
is guilty.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister 
of Indian Affairs said that Quebec's natives could remain in 
Canada if the province decides to become a sovereign state. The 
Minister of Foreign Affairs then stated that the Minister of 
Indian Affairs should retract his comments, while the Prime 
Minister tried to avoid the issue and justify the statement made 
by his Minister of Indian Affairs.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Does the head of the 
Canadian government recognize the principle of territorial 
integrity for Quebec, whether that province chooses to remain 
part of Confederation or become independent? Does he 
recognize that principle?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to quote the opinion used by Mr. Parizeau last week, to the 
effect that Quebec natives must remain in Quebec and that 
Quebec must remain in Canada. Mr. Parizeau forgot to add that 
part. It is the international law for the time being. I want 
Quebec's territory to be fully protected, and the best way to 
ensure that is for the province to remain part of Canada, because 
the Canadian Constitution says that as long as Quebec remains 
part of Canada, no one can change its borders without its 
approval. Quebec's territory is protected by the Canadian 
Constitution. This is the best protection Quebecers can ever 
hope for.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
Prime Minister not realize that with this answer, which is sort of 
a veiled threat, he maintains the ambiguity resulting from the 
irresponsible statement made by his Minister of Indian Affairs? 
Can he tell us if he really knows the principle of international 
law which provides that when a state becomes sovereign, it does 
so with its  whole territory? Does the Prime Minister know that 
principle?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the territory as a whole means all of Canada. That is what the 
opinion which Mr. Parizeau had in front of him the other day 
said but he forgot to mention that. This is our objective. And 
while we are discussing hypothetical issues, there is a lot of talk 
on international markets about the political instability in 
Canada and that has the effect of making interest rates go up, as 
the Minister of Finance can confirm.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	It is because these people do not care about the economic 
interest of Quebecers. If they did, they would help us stabilize 
interest rates, create jobs and give Quebecers what they want. 
Quebecers do not want to talk about the Constitution: They want 
jobs and they want to be able to come home at the end of the day 
with their dignity intact.

my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The unwillingness of the federal government to so far 
vigorously promote its vision of federalism or to respond to 
various problems created by Quebec separatism is creating a 
national unity vacuum. That vacuum is now being partially 
filled by statements from provincial premiers, ad hoc 
pronouncements by ministers of the government, separatist 
rhetoric and media speculation.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister believe the time has now come for 
the federal government to fill the national unity vacuum with 
something more positive and concrete on the federalist side? 
And, if so, with what does he propose to fill that vacuum?

an economic vision or a social vision or a vision of Canada's 
international role. My point is that  something visionary and 
futuristic has to be put forward to fill that vacuum.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that what he needs to do 
soon, what he needs to do now, is provide the country with a 
fresh, clear vision of what a 21st century federal state should be 
in order to deepen the commitment of all Canadians including 
Quebecers to Canadian federalism?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
now the leader of the Reform Party says there is no need to talk 
about the Constitution. Fine; I agree with him. That is why we 
are working on reforms to social programs at this time. We have 
tried to have fundamental reform and to make sure we approach 
the problems in a modern way by putting the emphasis on the 
right thing: job creation and dignity of work.
<P>
	In terms of trying to make arrangements with the provinces, 
that is what the minister for federal-provincial relations is doing 
at this time. He is working to try to end the duplication of many 
programs. That is a practical way to have better federalism. We 
have been working that way since the beginning.
<P>
	To come in with so-called new things and get people around 
the table like we have done over the last three years and talk 
Constitution all the time will lead to that. That is the speech this 
member of Parliament is making across the country today and he 
knows it makes no sense. The people do not want us to spend our 
time on constitutional matters. They all know that we live in the 
best country in the world and that we can solve our problems in a 
practical way. The big scheme à la Reform would never work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that is not exactly the kind of visionary statement I had in mind. 
It seems to me that behind the government's reply is also a fear 
that it is conceding legitimacy to the separatist cause by even 
acknowledging some of the problems which Quebec separatism 
creates. Yet by saying nothing on such problems the government 
is leaving the national stage open to one-sided separatist 
arguments and ad hoc federalist responses which confuse rather 
than clarify the issues.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	My question is simple: Will the Prime Minister agree today to 
publish a list of the key issues which Quebec separatism raises 
from a federalist perspective and simply assure Canadians that 
his government is developing a principled response to those 
issues?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> The best way 
to answer the question is to do what we are trying to do. That is 
to give good government to the people of Canada which is what 
they want, to reopen that type of debate, to talk about the values 
of Canada. I do it all the time. In fact I will have the pleasure of 
saying that to 1,000 people in Calgary this week. I said that in 
front of 12,000 people in Winnipeg last week. I will have 
another  great occasion to say the same thing to a great crowd in 
Edmonton.
<P>
	I say to everybody who listens to me that we have problems. 
Every country in the world has problems. It is not easy, but I 
would not change the problems of Canada with the problems of 
any other nation of the world. We live in the best nation in the 
world, the most generous country that exists with a tolerant 
society. It is a country that has such an open democracy we can 
tolerate the separatists in front of us who want to break up the 
country. You do not find a better country than Canada.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a study commissioned by the federal government 
concluded that over 10,000 defence industry jobs had been lost 
in Quebec since 1987. It also indicated that unless action is 
taken, 10,000 more jobs are in danger of disappearing within 
five years.
<P>
	Given this alarming context, how can the Minister of Industry 
refuse to implement an emergency plan to put defence industries 
to alternate, civilian uses, thereby preserving thousands of jobs 
in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to congratulate my hon. colleague on his article published 
in <I>La Presse</I> last week. At least he paid attention to the debates 
we had in this place the week before the recess.
<P>
	It must be made very clear here that the Bloquists' 
understanding is that defence conversion requires massive 
subsidies to be paid to companies which also have shareholders 
and managers responsible for finding ways of succeeding. That 
is essential to helping us understand where they are coming 
from.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We will support defence conversion and DIPP is doing that. 
We also recognize the important role shareholders and company 
managers have in ensuring the success of their own enterprises.

defence production? This is a concrete example of conversion.

<P>
	I would like to point out as well to the hon. member that since 
this government was elected we have approved 41 DIPP 
applications. Of those, 39 were for civilian or dual use purposes. 
This in effect demonstrates that a defence conversion program is

question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Last Tuesday the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development suggested that the aboriginal people of Quebec 
would have the right to remain in Canada if Quebec separates. 
On Thursday the Minister of Foreign Affairs said that the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development had 
misspoken and would soon clarify his remarks.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister tell this House which of his ministers 
speaks for the government on the subject of aboriginal people in 
Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
under the Canadian Constitution the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development is the one responsible for natives in 
Canada.
<P>
	Because there was a lot of debate about hypothetical 
questions, he gave a hypothetical answer. At that time I said we 
were all wasting our time. That was my answer.
<P>
	We are talking about a hypothetical situation that will not 
exist. I do not want to spend my time on that because I want 
members of my cabinet and members of this Parliament to be 
preoccupied with the jobs that are needed for the Canadian 
people.
<P>
	To speculate on what would happen, as Mr. Trudeau said one 
day: ``If my grandmother had wheels, I would have been a bus''. 
I do not want to speculate; I do not like if, if, if. I like to do 
things. What is important at this time is job creation and giving a 
good society and a lot of confidence to the Canadian people and 
Canadian investors so that everybody will be there.
<P>
	I do not want to reply to hypothetical questions. It is not 
permitted by your rulings, Mr. Speaker. One cannot ask 
hypothetical questions in the House.

for pointing that out to me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
following that hypothetical answer, I would like to try one more 
time with another one of the Prime Minister's ministers. The 
government House leader recently stated at a convention that the 
government had no policy regarding native self-determination 
in Quebec should separation occur.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister tell this House whether he has any 
strategy to deal with aboriginal people in Quebec so that all 
Canadians, including members of his own cabinet, will know 
how he intends to address this crucial issue?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I agree that the questions are getting into the 
more hypothetical stage. I will permit the Prime Minister to 
answer that question if he so desires.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker,

members of organizations supporting President Aristide. The 
terror campaign against them is intensifying.

the complete blockade of Haiti and prepare for the return of

	One of the best-known ways to get around the embargo is 
through the border with the Dominican Republic. We cannot

	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Solicitor General.
<P>
	Recently in my riding of Mission-Coquitlam two high risk 
prisoners, wrongly labelled low risk, walked away from 
Ferndale minimum security prison. They walked away either by 
walking out the front gate or by crossing the prisoner golf course 
and going over the four-foot fence.
<P>
	Mission's mayor and council have requested an immediate 
public inquiry as to those prisoners' classification in being 
there. Because of the federal government's inaction to this 
point, the municipality is going to hold its own public inquiry.
<P>
	Will the Solicitor General launch an immediate public inquiry 
into the whole classification system?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member has raised a good point, but she is a bit late on 
it.
<P>
	The Correctional Service of Canada's commissioner has 
already announced a national inquiry, not just into the 
circumstances of the escapes from Ferndale but into the 
situation involving minimum security institutions, including the 
approach to classification. This is already under way. I am sure 
it will do a good job in dealing with the concerns she has raised 
and which I fully understand.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the Solicitor General for his 
answer. He may be aware that I did contact his office and was 
waiting for a confirmation on just that question. I have not yet 
received it.
<P>
	However, I am concerned that classification seems to be one 
of the areas where there is inconsistency. In making the term low 
risk, would the Solicitor General please check in his public 
inquiry as to how the classification comes about. That seems to 
be the problem why we have so many high risk prisoners with 
low risk classifications.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will draw the hon. member's point to the attention of the 
commissioner of corrections so that it can be taken into account 
in the national inquiry which is going on. I understand this is 
already intended, but I will make sure it is not overlooked in the 
inquiry. I think the inquiry is much needed and I look forward to 
its results.

<P>
	Several weeks ago the minister was quoted as saying that only 
16 deportation orders against criminals had been overturned last 
year. He argued that this meant the immigration and refugee 
board was working just fine.
<P>
	Recent reports indicate that at least 242 non-residents, most 
with criminal records, had deportation orders overturned.
<P>
	Was the minister unaware of the numbers of criminal 
deportations overturned? If not, why did he choose not to reveal 
the true number?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, the number that I referred to some 
time ago in the House was the number of overturned cases. The 
cases that the hon. member talks about include a large number of 
cases that were stayed. There is a difference between 
overturning and staying.
<P>
	I have also said that I do not look kindly on those individuals 
who clearly poke fun at our system, who abuse our system. We 
will have a bill in the House of Commons before we go home in

well as that of her party to deal with it.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister has also tried to reassure Canadians that 
the vast majority of deportations are carried out after they are 
ordered, but of approximately 25,000 deportations ordered last 
year fewer than 9,000 have actually been carried out.
<P>
	Canadians deserve to know how the immigration enforcement 
system is working.
<P>
	Will the minister agree to the public disclosure of the 
percentage of deportation orders successfully carried out, 
especially in light of his recently announced amnesty agenda?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know where the hon. 
member is getting this amnesty agenda. The government did no 
such thing. She is obviously twisting the facts of what we did 
last week, which was to impose a number of interim measures, 
because I believe that the agency and the automatic review after 
failed claims were not well defined and that discretion rested 
solely with the minister. What we had were end runs around the 
system to try to get to members of Parliament, to ministers, to 
NGOs, to the media, to church sanctuary.
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
	Rather than having something undefined I chose instead to put 
discretion back into the system, define what it means to have an 
automatic review and what it means to have a humanitarian and 
compassionate review so that the people and the council know 
the rules by which they have to appeal. I think that makes sense, 
rather than having the system overtaxed.
<P>
	The hon. member should be careful in how she uses the word 
amnesty because first, it is not an amnesty; second, the people 
who can apply for that are post-93; and third, those with 
criminal records are not eligible.

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs recently stated that an 
agreement had been reached with the Quebec government 
regarding the future of the military college in Saint-Jean.
<P>
	However, the Premier of Quebec denied that such an 
agreement on the future use of the college existed. Can the 
minister tell us whether or not an agreement was reached with 
the Quebec government regarding the use of the college in 
Saint-Jean, as he announced at the Liberal convention last 
week?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the negotiations on the future use of the college in 
Saint-Jean are ongoing. We clearly had a meeting of the minds 
on a number of items that will be part of the final round of 
negotiations. But, as I indicated last week, the final agreement is 
not ready yet. When it is ready, I will be happy to give a copy to 
the opposition member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, could the 
minister tell us exactly what, in his current negotiations with the 
Quebec government, is the federal government's proposed use 
for the college in Saint-Jean?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, as usual, we have been very flexible in our negotiations 
with the provinces, and in this case with Quebec. We are still 
flexible. Therefore, until we have a final decision, we cannot 
announce it, because we are giving Quebec the opportunity to 
continue to discuss some of the items.

	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	One of the five principles of the Canada Health Act is 
accessibility. Traditionally this principle has been interpreted 
narrowly, that is, ensuring that health care is not denied for 
financial reasons.
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	The greatest barriers to health care today are the line-ups and 
waiting lists Canadians encounter when they require health care 
services.
<P>
	Does the minister agree that accessibility for health care must 
be defined in terms of timeliness as well as affordability?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
accessibility is a case of affordability as well as timeliness.
<P>
	When extra billing is involved it means that some people very 
much do not have access to treatment. We are looking at all five 
principles to make sure that as much as is possible within our 
system we can withstand the pressures that are there. We have 
the best health care system in the world, bar none.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary question is for the Minister of Health. The 
minister has reduced access to health care services in her recent 
decision to cut funding to British Columbia.
<P>
	Access to health care is the right of all Canadians. How can 
the minister say she is complying fully with the Canada Health 
Act when her actions are making health care less and less 
accessible?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
was not a choice I had. I had a duty to enforce the Canada Health 
Act.
<P>
	The Canada Health Act is very specific. Extra billing is not 
allowed. Once a year provinces are asked to submit a report on 
the extra billing that is going on in their province. When this 
report was sent to me I had no choice but to act on it because 
extra billing restricts access for people.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member, how can paying extra money for a 
physician give everybody better access? All it does is make 
some physicians richer than others.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADASTUDENTFINANCIALASSISTANCEACT">CANADA STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-28, an act to respecting the making of loans and the provision 
of other forms of financial assistance to students, to amend and 
provide for the repeal of the Canada Student Loans Act, and to 
amend one other act in consequence thereof, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me a 
great deal of pleasure on behalf of the constituents in Hamilton 
West to speak at second reading of Bill C-28, the Canada 
Student Financial Assistance Act.
<P>
	Contrary to the views espoused by certain members opposite, 
this bill should have nothing to do with the politics of separatism 
or the political autonomy of our provinces. All we are trying to 
do with this legislation is ensure that our citizens have adequate 
access to post-secondary education.
<P>
	The government realizes that many Canadian students need 
financial assistance in order to achieve their academic goals. 
The government also realizes that the provinces cannot address 
those needs alone which is exactly why the Minister of Human 
Resources Development has chosen to work in concert with 
provincial authorities to try and provide sufficient financial aid 
to college and university students in this great country.
<P>
	The legislation before us today provides proof that the 
government is committed to the principle of protecting access to 
post-secondary education. This principle is an extremely 
important one to uphold if for no other reason than simply to 
ensure that all Canadians have the opportunity to intellectually 
empower themselves through post-secondary education and 
training initiatives.
<P>
	Debate on the issue of financial assistance to students across 
Canada seems quite timely and highly appropriate when one 
considers the fact that thousands of secondary school students 
will receive acceptance to a Canadian university or college 
within the next 30 days. Many of these students will apply for 
and receive financial assistance from federal and provincial 
sources in order to obtain enough money to finance their 
post-secondary education.
<P>
	However unless we act now, many more students will either 
be unable or unwilling to pursue a college or university 
education due to a lack of funds.
<P>
	In addition to the students trying to enter college or university 
for the first time, there are several thousand who will graduate 
this year with a substantial debt load, in some cases as high as 
$15,000 and even $20,000.
<P>
	The time has come for the federal government to respond to 
the increased financial burden faced by those Canadians who 
seek to further their education. We must work together to 
provide incentives for people to pursue higher education by 
replacing the archaic provisions of the Canada Student Loans 
Act with legislation that is more reflective of the changing 
financial needs of Canada's student population.
<P>
	In the process of representing a riding with a high university 
and college student population, I have had the opportunity to 
speak with a number of students and parents of students at 
McMaster University and Mohawk College, both of which are 
located in the great city of Hamilton.
<P>
	The students in my riding have brought forward a number of 
concerns related to the Canada student loan program. For 
example, with the rising cost of university and college tuition, 
students are uncertain whether their weekly student loan 
allocation will cover their basic educational costs. Students who 
have received loans from the federal government are frightened 
about the debt and increased burden they will have to bear by the 
time they graduate from college or university.
<P>
	In this regard many students are calling for the reinstatement 
of the six-month post-graduation interest free loan period that 
was removed by the previous government. Many students who 
cannot afford to go to school on a full time basis have been 
forced to attend school on a part time basis while holding down 
part time jobs in order to earn enough money to keep food on the 
table. In some cases these students are single parents or re-entry 
women and men trying to upgrade their academic skills while 
supporting a family at the same time.
<P>
	To make matters worse, there has been a ceiling of $2,500 per 
academic year applied to students enrolled in part time studies 
even though the cost of part time post-secondary studies often 
exceeds that amount in tuition and textbooks alone, not to 
mention room and board.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4350"> 4350 </A></B>
<P>
	There is also the issue of the often exceptional costs faced by 
students with special needs such as students with disabilities 
and students who suffer from severe financial disadvantages, 
many of whom would benefit from a national system of targeted 
grant funding.
<P>
	These are just some of the fundamental concerns that the 
government is attempting to address by means of Bill C-28. 
After nearly 30 years it seems reasonable to think that the 
Canada student loans program is long overdue for fundamental 
reform.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	When we look at weekly student loan allocations, for 
example, we see that they have been frozen for over a decade 
now. Yet in the same span of time, the costs associated with 
post-secondary education have skyrocketed by some 58 per 
cent. This scenario is absolutely ludicrous and appears to defeat 
the principle of trying to provide adequate financial assistance 
to those who need it in order to defray the rising costs of their 
education.
<P>
	In addition to addressing issues of access to post-secondary 
education, the government is also prepared to address the costly 
inefficiencies that have been identified in the Canada student 
loan program as well. Outdated eligibility criteria, inconsistent 
need assessments, loan defaults and inefficient program 
delivery are some of the key problems that are recognized and 
addressed by the proposed legislation.
<P>
	It should be noted that the proposed changes to the Canada 
student loans program have met with positive response from 
many of the students in my riding of Hamilton West. For years 
student organizations such as the McMaster Student's Union 
and the Canadian Federation of Students have called for higher 
weekly loan limits, greater repayment flexibility and a national 
system of grants for needy students.
<P>
	The proposed legislation will increase weekly loan limits by 
57 per cent from $105 to $165 for full time students and will also 
increase the part time student loan limit from $2,500 to $4,000. 
The government also intends to establish special opportunity 
grants for disabled students and students with serious financial 
needs.
<P>
	In addition to raising loan limits and providing needs based 
grants, the government is also committed to establishing a more 
flexible repayment schedule for college and university students. 
The proposed legislation allows the federal government to 
conduct a meaningful income contingent repayment pilot 
project in order to determine whether or not this type of funding 
model which has been implemented with mixed results in other 
nations is worth pursuing at all.
<P>
	Perhaps the most important aspect of the proposed legislation 
is the message it sends out to all Canadians about the degree of 
importance the government has placed on protecting access to 
higher education for all Canadians. By proposing the stated 
reforms to the Canada student loan program, the federal 
government has taken a giant step toward strengthening our 
overall system of education and training.
<P>
	In closing, I want to point out that this legislation is not about 
separatist politics or the constitutional implications of 
provincial responsibility for post-secondary education. Bill 
C-28 is about access to higher education in Canada, plain and 
simple.
<P>
	All we are trying to do is ensure that Canadians who have the 
desire, the ability to pursue post-secondary studies are provided 
with the funds to do so. A high quality accessible system of 
education will be the salvation of this society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for his comments.
<P>
	I was disappointed that this rather comprehensive and bold 
initiative that responds to actual problems that young people are 
experiencing has not been applauded by the opposition parties.
<P>
	I stand to be corrected if I am wrong. From the official 
opposition we have heard some noises, some rhetoric about our 
getting into provincial responsibility. There is an opting out 
clause there. Provinces can opt out if they wish. I do not see why 
that point was made and I wonder if my colleague would explain 
why the Bloc Quebecois would want to do that.
<P>
	We all know that young Canadians need more assistance. That 
was documented in the 34th Parliament and finally in the 35th 
Parliament the government has acted. It has not only raised the 
amount of loans available and grants for those who are under 
represented and made repayment much more sensitive to those 
who have to repay but it has taken a number of measures quite 
apart from the job creation initiatives to make life more bearable 
for students.
<P>
	How in the world is that involved with politics? I wonder if 
my hon. colleague at the same time, because there are two 
questions, would care to briefly define the Reform Party's 
position on this legislation.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure whether I want to thank 
the hon. member for St. Boniface for the question because I 
would not dare try to speak for our separatist friends opposite.
<P>
	To answer my colleagues question in its simplest form, the 
parties opposite, especially the Bloc in this case, have to realize 
that education is not some sort of commodity like pork hocks or 
apples. It is a national principle. Education is a national 
principle. Education is a natural resource and I am now working 
with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4351"> 4351 </A></B>
<P>
the minister to  prove how the country can actually export this 
natural resource.
<P>
	We have a natural resource called education. With this bill, as 
I have outlined, we want to do many things to make 
post-secondary education accessible to all Canadians, whether 
they are working or not working, whether they are young or old, 
whether they want to be retrained or whatever their situation. 
They must have equal access and not just because they have 
some money in their pockets they can go to school. That is not 
very fair.
<P>
	If the Bloc can take politics out of the issue, if the Bloc can 
understand that we are not talking about the resource of 
education being something with which to balance the books or to 
trade off. If Bloc members say that with the bill the federal 
government is attempting in some way to make a power grab 
away from the provinces, especially the province of Quebec, 
they are missing the fundamental point that education is not a 
commodity.
<P>
	Education is a natural resource. Education is something 
precious that must be made available to all Canadians whether 
they live in B.C., in the Northwest Territories, in Ontario or in 
Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
says a lot about the value of education in his speech. We can 
easily go along with him on that because education is important, 
that is a fact. But when we educate our young people, we explain 
to them that contracts are important. We tell them that a contract 
is binding, whether it is a handshake or in writing. From being 
with educators, I know that they spend a lot of time telling them 
that it is important.
<P>
	Well, the best-known contract in this country is the Canadian 
Constitution. What does this Canadian Constitution say? It says 
that education is exclusively in provincial jurisdiction. We can 
take a long time explaining the values of education and where 
we stand on it, but everyone in Quebec seems to agree that 
education is important. We must do everything required to make 
education better. One way to do that is to avoid duplication and 
to act as consistently as possible in co-operation with the 
educational partners in a province.
<P>
	Now the hon. member opposite tells us not to worry about the 
Constitution, that it is not serious, that these are problems and 
annoyances which the Bloc Quebecois seems to want to bring in. 
So I ask him whether the Constitution and a contract and 
everything legal really have any value for him. I would like to 
know his position on that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. I suppose we have to keep in mind that if the federal 
government could unilaterally afford to provide students with 
enough money to carry out their  educational requirements it 
would do so. If the provincial governments could provide the 
funds necessary all by themselves for students to obtain 
post-secondary education, there would be no argument. 
Obviously there has to be some teamwork. Even in question 
period today we saw the wall going up between the hon. 
member's party and the Government of Canada. As much as we 
see that wall going up we are not going to be threatened. The 
Bloc must understand it cannot do it by itself. Quebec cannot do 
it by itself.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	We can all work better in education if we work as a team. 
Together we can make that education possible without money 
being the inhibiting device for our students. Ask any one of our 
pages in the House today. They know what it is like to work all 
kinds of hours, go home, grab a meal where they can grab one 
and get through their education. Do they care whether Quebec is 
paying for it by itself or whether the feds can? I do not think so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased today to speak on the issue and in support of the 
government bill.
<P>
	I graduated from university about 11 years ago, in 1983. Since 
then or over the past 10 years there has not been any increase in 
loans for students. The bill is about our future. It is about our 
young people. It is about education and access to education for 
people so they can go to university and take part in our society.
<P>
	From 1990 to 1993 people with lower than high school 
education saw a loss of 17 per cent in the number of jobs they 
could have access to. For those who had a high school education 
there was a loss of about .5 per cent. Those with beyond high 
school education, with post-secondary education, there was an 
increase of 17 per cent in the number of jobs available for them.
<P>
	We can see the impact and the importance of education. We 
can see the need for us to have access to education and the need 
for a bill that finally remedies the problem we have seen over the 
past 10 years of erosion of student loans because of inflation. It 
is very important that we support the bill.
<P>
	The reforms being made to student aid are an essential part of 
the government's broader strategy. We want to work with the 
provinces and interest groups to revitalize learning and training 
in Canada. To compete in the global marketplace and to respond 
to increasing technological advances we have to ensure that our 
education and training systems are relevant, effective and 
accountable. We have to take action now so that tomorrow's 
graduates are able to compete and prosper.
<P>
	It has long been a hallmark of Canadian society that every 
person should have access to educational opportunities to 
develop to his or her full potential. It is well known that 
education and training have two important goals: to prepare 
individuals for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4352"> 4352 </A></B>
<P>
fulfilling  social and cultural life and to prepare them to 
contribute as productive members of our society.
<P>
	Provincial jurisdiction over education in Canada is clear. The 
provinces have already begun to implement reforms which seek 
to make Canadian learning systems more productive and 
accountable for results. Canadians in all provinces are well 
aware of the importance of ensuring that education meets the 
challenges of modern society as we approach the 21st century.
<P>
	Their recognition of the need for new visions and new 
approaches is shared by the federal government. As education 
and training are crucially linked to the economic health of any 
nation, the federal government would be remiss not to facilitate 
and support all efforts which seek to prepare young Canadians 
for the future.
<P>
	It is recognized that the concept of lifelong learning requires 
the involvement not only of governments but of parents, 
teachers, business, industry, labour and communities. 
Substantial financial support is provided by the federal 
government for education at the post-secondary level. Over $6 
billion a year is provided to the provinces under the established 
programs financing arrangements, the EPF program.
<P>
	The federal government has always maintained a strong 
interest in fundamental values relating to quality education and 
training which are shared by educational jurisdictions across the 
country. In this regard the government remains committed to 
assisting the provinces in providing whatever support it can to 
ensure the efficiency of our learning systems.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	The new Canada Student Financial Assistance Act is an 
important part of efforts being made in this area. Our youth 
employment and learning strategy announced on April 15 
committed the federal government to support along with the 
provinces a number of other key initiatives. These include the 
development of clear national goals and expectations, updating 
and improving existing measurement tools, promoting 
technology and innovation in learning, and facilitating the 
dissemination of information on important learning and labour 
market issues.
<P>
	We are confident that all these measures will contribute to 
improvements in education and learning throughout Canada. 
They will greatly assist Canadians in developing, acquiring and 
maintaining the skills and knowledge they need in today's 
world. Our citizens must be able not only to enter the workforce 
successfully but to be able to adjust to changes in the labour 
market. For that they need education.
<P>
	Indeed it is important to recognize that education and training 
processes are seldom if ever constant. While it would obviously 
be much easier and less costly merely to maintain what is 
already in place, it is not good enough. In view of rapid 
unwilling changes in today's global economy, we must always 
be alert to ensure that our learning systems are relevant and 
current. Modifications  and new initiatives must be introduced 
to address emerging issues and new realities. This is what the 
government intends to do. While we do not dispute that these 
challenges are formidable we must not be fearful to act.
<P>
	Canadians do not lack the initiative or desire to compete. We 
have every confidence in the ingenuity and commitment of 
individuals who are endeavouring to get ahead by pursuing 
post-secondary educational opportunities either full time or 
part time. Canadian students must have the right tools to enable 
them to undertake their studies and produce results that are 
meaningful and positive. This is why the government has 
introduced the bill before us.
<P>
	Obviously one of the major barriers standing between 
students and post-secondary education is the lack of significant 
financial resources. Students have repeatedly indicated over the 
years-I heard this during the election campaign and 
since-that they need more financial aid to meet the rising cost 
not only of their education but of their basic living expenses. 
And our pages know it well.
<P>
	We should make clear at the outset that students are not asking 
for a handout. They are seeking financial support for the time 
while they are in school. They are well aware of the expectation 
that they will repay what they borrow as the great majority of 
former students do and as I did about three years ago when I 
finished paying off my student loan. The great majority of 
students pay them off once they begin to work.
<P>
	Student aid reforms therefore seek to increase the maximum 
amount that students both part time and full time may borrow. 
While it may seem to be a big increase, let us not forget that loan 
levels had been frozen for the past 10 years. The new loan levels 
the bill proposes merely reflect the realities of today's costs. 
These measures will also make grants available to students with 
special financial needs, including those with disabilities, 
women in certain doctoral programs and high need, part time 
students. Deferred grants will also assist borrowers with 
significantly high debt loads.
<P>
	New financing arrangements with lenders, revised eligibility 
criteria, improved need assessment and greater flexibility for 
new federal-provincial approaches to student aid are part of the 
reforms being provided in the bill. All these measures are aimed 
at establishing a fair, consistent and accessible student aid 
program. The government is confident the reforms will 
contribute significantly to achieving the overall objectives of 
the youth employment and learning strategy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4353"> 4353 </A></B>
<P>
	The emphasis of our strategy is toward greater effectiveness, 
inclusiveness and accountability. A learning system shows its 
true value if the end results are clear, meaningful and relevant.
<P>
	The federal government will also contribute to support the 
efforts of provinces, the private sector and community groups to 
develop initiatives designed to reduce dropout rates. That is 
absolutely a critical part of this bill and of our government's 
program.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	Canadian youth must be made aware of the vital importance 
of education and training in terms of their own futures and be 
encouraged at every opportunity to develop their skills and 
abilities to full potential. That is what life long learning is all 
about.
<P>
	We must ensure access to learning systems based on 
excellence and relevance in terms of providing people with the 
skills needed to be productive and self-sufficient members of 
our society. We must ensure a smooth transition from school to 
the workplace.
<P>
	Many people today are understandably disillusioned if their 
education and training does not enable them to move into the 
workforce. It is only natural that students expect their hard work 
and commitment to yield positive results and it is most 
discouraging when this does not happen.
<P>
	In fact, I have students in my riding who have graduated in 
various areas and are looking for jobs. They are having a tough 
time and for them it is discouraging. I see that in people when I 
meet them in my riding. Not only does the individual suffer in 
this case but the loss in terms of wasted resources and untapped 
potential hurts the educational system, the labour force and 
indeed the Canadian economy and society as a whole.
<P>
	Accordingly, a number of key elements of our youth 
employment and learning strategy relate to the important goal of 
providing young Canadians with practical labour market skills 
and meaningful work experience, like the co-op programs at 
Mount Saint Vincent University located in Halifax West. These 
programs are a key element in moving into the workforce.
<P>
	Our initiatives are aimed at addressing specific problems 
which prevent Canadians from participating fully in society, 
including high dropout rates, limited access to post-secondary 
education and lack of work experience. We are certainly not 
willing to nor would we need to begin from scratch. There are 
many positive features of our education and training systems 
and we intend to build on what has worked well in the past.
<P>
	It is imperative however that we also consider new 
approaches to meet today's realities. We are seeking to build 
solid structures which will help to eliminate problem areas 
associated with the transition from school to work.
<P>
	It is important to recognize that our reforms and initiatives 
relating to youth employment and learning are not meant in any 
way to offer anyone a free ride or an easy way out. Individuals 
have a responsibility to take advantage of the opportunities 
available to them and to apply themselves to the fullest extent 
possible.
<P>
	If governments can ensure that world-class education and 
training systems are in place and that access is maintained 
through viable student assistance programs, we are confident 
that Canadians throughout the country will provide the 
determination, hard work and commitment which are all 
necessary components for success.
<P>
	Basically, what all Canadian students are saying is: ``Give us 
a fair chance. Give us the support we need as we pursue learning 
and training opportunities''.
<P>
	Canadians from all walks of life and from all regions of the 
country recognize the vital role education plays in their lives. 
They are willing to make sacrifices and to do what it takes to 
achieve their learning and employment goals.
<P>
	Canadians are not expecting guarantees. All they really ask 
for is access and opportunity. They have the confidence it takes 
to succeed. We must build upon that confidence by providing all 
citizens, including those with special or exceptional needs, with 
a chance to develop and show their talents and abilities.
<P>
	We cannot expect individuals to contribute to society in a 
meaningful way if they believe they have received unequal or 
unfair treatment or have been excluded from opportunities.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I know it is 
difficult when members share their time, but I regret that the 
member's time has lapsed. It is time now for questions and 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the 
hon. member is the third speaker from Nova Scotia to address 
this issue today.
<P>
	My question relates to how universities are funded in the 
various provinces. It is interesting to note that Nova Scotia, 
perhaps more than any other province, funds students from 
outside the province. Dalhousie and some of the other 
universities attract a lot of out of province students. 
Unfortunately, under established programs financing the 
funding these universities receive is on a per capita basis, based 
on the population in the province.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	Does the hon. member agree that it makes a lot more sense to 
give this funding over to the students? They could purchase their 
education with a voucher. This would ensure that some of these 
Nova Scotia institutions would get the funding they need to 
continue to support the high level of students they get not only 
from their own province but from other provinces as well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4354"> 4354 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Regan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for 
the question. I am glad to see he is so aware of the situation in 
Nova Scotia. We do have a large number of universities and it is 
a concern. With so many universities per capita we are providing 
so much brain power for Canada from Nova Scotia.
<P>
	The question of funding of course has been an issue in our 
province certainly because of the fact that we have a large 
number of universities producing excellent graduates. With the 
funding coming per capita it is a problem and a concern.
<P>
	I have talked with students in my riding of Halifax West who 
have been very involved in their universities and have been 
involved in looking for improvements to the student loans 
program and student financial assistance. They have strong 
objections to the idea of this voucher system. They do not feel 
that it is workable.
<P>
	The first and most important step is to give students the loans 
and the kind of financial support that will give them real access 
to university and this bill does that. By substantially increasing 
student loans for the first time in 10 years this bill finally takes 
that major, most important big step of moving us toward a 
situation in which people can actually gain equitable access to 
universities and post-secondary education. That is the key and it 
is very important.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
helping students is an excellent thing. I have two short questions 
for the hon. member. First, why not give these amounts directly 
to provinces, so that they can help students? Second, in regions 
such as my riding, where there is no CEGEP, college or 
university, would it not be possible to provide a little bit more 
financial help to people who live far from these institutions?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Regan:</B> Mr. Speaker, unfortunately I was not able to hear 
entirely what the member said as I had a problem with the 
translation. However I want to point out that I know there has 
been a lot of-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> If I can be of assistance, I 
will beg the indulgence of the House and I will ask the member 
for Matapédia-Matane-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
-to repeat his two questions as concisely as possible, so that 
the hon. member for Halifax West can understand him and give 
his reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to oblige. I started 
by congratulating the hon. member by saying that helping 
students was an excellent thing. I asked him first if it would not 
be better to send the money to the provinces, so that they could 
help students.
<P>
	Then, I asked if it we could be a little more generous in those 
regions, particularly in rural areas, where there is no university 
or college. Indeed, if you live close to Laval, that university is 
easily accessible from your parents' home, which makes things 
relatively easy, but it is a different matter if you have to travel 
200, 300 or 400 miles.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Regan:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your indulgence. I 
thank the hon. member for his question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Next time I will try to listen more carefully. I tried to listen in 
French because I wanted to make sure I understood, but I was 
trying to translate. I apologize for that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is an interesting idea that we should transfer this whole 
responsibility to the province, but I think we have a joint 
responsibility. People from my part of the country believe very 
strongly that we need to have a strong education system all 
across Canada, that we have an interest across this country, 
whatever province one is in, in having students coming out of 
post-secondary education who are well educated and have had 
access to education all across this country. They look to the 
federal government to be part of that system, to be part of 
providing and ensuring that access.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	To relegate it entirely to the provinces is not what people are 
asking for in my view. In fact, they are asking for us to be 
involved and to play a role. For instance some of the provinces 
lack the financial wherewithal to overcome these problems if 
they did do it on their own.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, I join in this debate 
with great delight today, since I am one among all members of 
this House who have received an education.
<P>
	I remember seeing a bumper sticker which said: ``If you can 
read this, you're too close'', but I think a much more poignant 
bumper sticker reads: ``If you can read this, thank a teacher''. 
All of us are beneficiaries of the education system in this 
country, myself included.
<P>
	I began my schooling in a very small rural school in 
Saskatchewan. As a matter of fact I was instrumental in saving 
the school from being closed. I was the fifth student and that was 
at the margin where it would have been closed. Later on I had the 
privilege of being one of the first young men from my 
community to go to university in Saskatoon. There I jumped into 
classes of 200 to 250 students which was a remarkable transition 
from my earlier school years.
<P>
	I am one who is a very firm believer in education as are all the 
members of the Reform Party. I think I can say that 
unequivocally not only for the members of this caucus but also 
for the members of our party throughout this country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4355"> 4355 </A></B>
<P>
	There was a question asked not long ago in this House by the 
parliamentary secretary. He asked one of his fellow Liberal 
members to explain the Reform position on education. 
Fortunately the Liberal member declined.
<P>
	During the last campaign various attempts were made at 
stating what the Reform position was by our opposition parties. 
If I can say so with great respect, there was a great deal of 
distortion in the explanation by our opposition.
<P>
	It should be known that we based our position on consultation 
with a wide variety and a large base of our constituents, of 
people in our ridings, on a consensus for what the priorities of 
spending should be. It is totally clear that this country is in 
financial trouble. I am going to come back to that a little later in 
my speech, but we are going into debt at the rate of $1,200 per 
second. That is how fast we are going into debt. That cannot 
continue if we are going to keep this country from going down 
the tube. Consequently the Reform Party has assumed 
leadership in asking the people of this country what should we 
do first, what are our priorities?
<P>
	Contrary to what many people said about us, our own 
members, Canadians, told us-and we are a party that responded 
to it-that the very first item to be maintained in terms of 
spending and keeping it healthy and strong was our health care 
system. That was the very top item. That was in our platform. 
We stated it, it was in our documentation, and there was no 
excuse for there being any misunderstanding on that point.
<P>
	The second point on which we were unanimous and where we 
said it was very important for us to be strong and healthy was in 
the education of our youth. In fact our policy stated-and I 
challenge any member here to check it out if they want to go 
back to the documentation from the campaign-that present 
levels of funding for education should be maintained or even 
increased, if possible. There will be found in the Reform Party a 
very strong level of support for education.
<P>
	All of us know how important it is. I do not think I need to 
spend a great deal of time speaking about how important 
education is. Can we imagine living in a society where very few 
of us could read or write? The majority of us can read and write, 
but we occasionally hear of this thing called marginal or 
functional illiteracy.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	That is something that we must continue to address but the 
fact is that in this country every individual is entitled to that 
starting education. As students proceed through the years, for 
various reasons they reach a certain level of education and stop 
their formal education.
<P>
	I want members of this House to know that I have a lifelong 
career in education. I chose to become a teacher when I 
graduated from high school. On the influence of a very effective 
teacher whom I had in high school, I changed my career choice 
to one involved with young people.
<P>
	I was a young person at the time, but he challenged me to 
become involved. I am still young, yes, half way to 110. I was 
challenged to work with young people. Frankly, I have enjoyed 
it. I taught high school for four years. During the first three years 
of that career, I was the math department in a small rural school 
with some 150 high school students. I taught all of the maths 
from grades 9 to 12. It was a delightful experience.
<P>
	I taught in a very large city high school for one year. For 
reasons that I will not go into here today, I decided not to stay 
there. A wonderful opportunity came up. I received the 
opportunity to work in a technical institute, a post-secondary 
education institute in Edmonton, the Northern Alberta Institute 
of Technology.
<P>
	Prior to this rather abrupt career change that I experienced last 
October, I worked there continuously for 27 years, teaching and 
working with young people. I always felt that I was a failure as 
an instructor if I only taught my students what I knew. I had to go 
beyond that and teach them how to learn.
<P>
	My greatest successes were those students who passed me in 
knowledge and who went on from the technical institute. In 
some cases they went back to the university and exceeded even 
what I knew which-I suppose I should be modest here-is not 
that great.
<P>
	During that time I encountered a number of students who quit 
school during the time they were at the institute. They stopped 
for various reasons. Some realized that after they got into this 
program of studies it was not the right one. Some left because of 
home pressure or home difficulties. The most heart wrenching 
ones were those who stopped because they ran out of money.
<P>
	I feel very close to this question today. How do we effectively 
arrange our affairs so that our students can go on in their 
education to the very apex of what they are capable? Only as we 
do that will we have a society which benefits from that.
<P>
	I know that we are all pleased that the majority of us can 
speak, read and write. Unfortunately in my field of math the 
academic strengths out there are not that strong. In fact, I have 
been doing a little ongoing survey. When I tell people that I am a 
math instructor, I find that about 95 per cent of them right away 
respond by saying they hated math. I guess there is a flaw in that.
<P>
	Not many years ago the question of sex education in school 
came up. When we were discussing whether this should be 
taught in schools, one of my colleagues indicated: ``Why not? If 
the schools teach it the way they teach math and physics, the 
children will lose all interest in it''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4356"> 4356 </A></B>
<P>
	I need to get back here. We want to train our young people to 
the very apex of their abilities. Though we like the majority of 
them to be educated, it is true that we owe our high standard of 
living to a select few among them. These are the students who go 
past high school, past their undergraduate degrees. They become 
our scientists, engineers and researchers and we must do all that 
we can in order to accommodate them.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	In his opening comments today in introducing this bill, the 
minister said that we need reform. As soon as I heard the word 
my heart just fluttered with delight. After that he said we need 
fundamental reform. While I gave an accolade to the 
government for at least addressing the question and recognizing 
that in the past number of years our financing and our help for 
students to carry on with their education had suffered, I looked 
to see where this real reform was coming from in this proposed 
bill.
<P>
	I would like to humbly recommend some changes to this bill. 
We need to get down to the fundamentals. What I observe in this 
bill is not a reform, a rethinking, a reinvention or real good 
creative thinking. What I picked up was ``We are going to take 
what we have done before and just make more of it''. Where we 
used to limit the loans to $2,500, we will now make them 
$4,000. Where we used to have students under great financial 
pressure to pay their loans back, we will now make that a little 
easier for them. I applaud that. Those are very necessary steps if 
that is the route that we are going to take.
<P>
	However, there is a marked absence of creative and lateral 
thinking in actually looking at the solution to this problem. 
Regardless of which method is chosen to finance education, it 
costs the taxpayers money. We want to use that money as 
efficiently as possible. There is no doubt in my mind that 
dumping money from the taxpayer to the different levels of 
government and then dumping it back again with these big dump 
trucks, having no accountability for how it is used, is one of the 
greatest detrimental features to the effectiveness of our 
educational system. I certainly think that we should do 
something a little more creative.
<P>
	Other speakers in our party talk about the concept of the 
voucher. It has a great deal of merit. I challenge members 
opposite to stop and really think about what it does. First, it 
grabs on to a catchword that we have nowadays, and that is 
choice. If we were to give individual students a sizeable 
voucher, one that would cover their total cost of education in 
whatever university of college or technical institute they 
choose, they would then have a total choice. Too often their 
choice of where they go for their schooling is imposed on them 
by financial restrictions. If we gave them the voucher, they 
could go to the school where they themselves have determined 
they can benefit most and therefore return to us the taxpayers the 
maximum benefit.
<P>
	I have also thought that we should not have students working 
when they are studying. Most of the time that is a distraction 
from their studies. I have thought of this: Why do we not reward 
them for what they are actually supposed to be doing when they 
are students? Why do we not give them the opportunity to earn 
money by being good students? One thing I thought of was why 
do we not have tuition that is refundable as a percentage of their 
performance in their classes? Give them a real reward for the 
effort that they put out.
<P>
	I was a student way back in the mid-fifties. I realize now in 
looking back at it that I lived in an ideal world. When I wrote my 
university exams in spring, if I finished in the morning I was on 
my job at noon. A week or two before the exams my boss whom I 
had worked for the year before asked me: ``Ken, when can you 
come to work? I need you''. I drove a truck as my summer job. 
He had some hauling to do and he needed me. It was wonderful.
<P>
	What is the difference between then and now? I went through 
school without a loan. I came out of school after five years of 
university, having been completely self-supporting without any 
debt. I paid my room and board, my clothing, tuition and books 
and I had money left over. I made a dollar an hour on my job 
which was about 50 per cent more than I needed.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	What was the difference? There is a remarkable coincidence. 
If we go back to the mid fifties and sixties-I graduated in 
1961-those were the years before our government started 
cranking us into a huge debt hole. Those were the years when 
there was consumer confidence. There was business confidence. 
As a result there were jobs for us during summers and on 
graduation that were waiting for us.
<P>
	When I graduated from university, I had a choice of jobs. I 
cannot help but make the connection that there is some 
correlation between the level of debts of government and the 
burden that has placed on all of us and the dampening effect that 
has on our economy. That is the reason why our young people are 
now in this bad situation.
<P>
	I cannot help but think that this government is missing a great 
opportunity. This government thinks in terms of: ``Let's borrow 
more and spend more and thereby get out of our problems''.
<P>
	I am very disappointed with this bill which among other 
things provides a mechanism to allow students to graduate from 
university or college with a maximum debt load. I wish we could 
stop thinking about borrowing and debt and start being creative 
so that students can earn their way as they go and come out 
without a debt as we did away back then. We would really have a 
strong economy as a result.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4357"> 4357 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe that my time is almost up. I conclude by saying that 
there are some areas in this bill which I think we really ought to 
look at. I am not sure that we are wise in choosing to target 
certain groups for special consideration. I really do not believe 
that we should be saying that you are special if you are of a 
certain gender.
<P>
	When I fly in an aeroplane, drive in a car or go over a bridge I 
really do not care about the gender of that engineer, but I do care 
a lot about the competence of that person who designed and built 
the structure to which I am entrusting my life.
<P>
	I think it is myopic at this stage in our society to keep dividing 
people into this category, that category and that one. We ought to 
begin treating all of our students equally regardless of gender or 
race or ethnic background or what language they speak. Let us 
treat them equally. Let us give them a voucher. Let us give them 
freedom of choice. Let us give them the maximum opportunity 
to go out there and do the very best they can with their lives.
<P>
	I really encourage this government. I think it is on to 
something here. It is starting and at least facing the question. I 
sincerely wish that it would step back and try to be more 
creative.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to my hon. friend from the Reform Party. I 
commend him for his dedication to education and recognize his 
long career as an educator. Certainly he has some very positive 
things to say to government about education.
<P>
	I was so encouraged by much of the hon. member's speech 
that I expect he will be supporting this bill when it goes through. 
I certainly hope he will do that.
<P>
	I would make a suggestion to the hon.member, and I speak 
from experience also, being someone who worked his way 
through college without student loans and so on. I recall those 
days in our situation just breaking even with what one could earn 
the summer and what it would cost in the winter. In thinking 
back on that education system we had in the late 1950s, our 
course was very heavily subsidized by government. Therefore 
our tuition was relatively low by today's standard. We lived in 
residence and our board was relatively low by today's standards. 
I suggest that all the costs cannot be laid on the shoulders of the 
national debt. It seems to me there was a different approach 
toward education at that time. In my case, which was 
agricultural college, agriculture was considered enough of a 
priority so most of the costs of those courses were paid for by 
government.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	I would like to respectfully ask the hon. member if he will 
support this bill and in so doing be able to contribute to the 
education of our young people across Canada. Perhaps he could 
bring these new ideas and suggestions to our government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member. I respectfully 
differ with him in terms of government involvement in our 
education vis-à-vis what it is now.
<P>
	If I am not mistaken, I believe the involvement of the 
government directly in education then was about in the same 
proportion as it is now. Somewhere between one-half and 
one-third of the costs were borne by the students through tuition 
and the other part was subsidized. It depended again on what 
kind of study was pursued. If you went to medical school or 
some of the highly technical oriented places where the lab and 
shop equipment was very expensive then of course the 
government involvement was higher.
<P>
	However I do not quibble with that. As a taxpayer and as a 
citizen I think we are very, very wise to invest in education. That 
is one of the things government should be doing. It is not 
something that should be left to go by itself. The government has 
a legitimate role to play. However in the actual practice of it, to 
introduce a degree of competition by vouchers, to introduce a 
degree of accountability by that I think can only improve our 
educational system.
<P>
	The member asked whether I would be supporting this bill. If 
the choice is between the status quo and what this bill provides 
as an improvement, I think I will have to support it because it is 
an improvement. It is better than what we have, but it is not 
going far enough and it is going in the wrong direction.
<P>
	I still have to study the bill some more to see the details. 
Hopefully the committee will come up with some good 
amendments. Maybe we will be able to introduce more elements 
into it which will reward those who are diligent, who work and 
come out the other end without the debts instead of penalizing 
them at the expense of those who incur a debt.
<P>
	One of the features of this bill is that if you happen to run up a 
really huge debt you can get part of it forgiven. However if you 
are astute and you live on potatoes and rice because there are 
those times when you have to be really frugal-as some of us 
did, and you can see I had my share-the fact is the frugal 
individual is the one who forgoes the benefits. In a way he is 
penalized.
<P>
	In education, as in all areas of life, we need to reward the 
actions and activities we want. We should somehow be 
punishing those we do not want, instead of vice versa.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
some pleasure that I join in this debate today.
<P>
	I am the member for Winnipeg South and the University of 
Manitoba is in my riding. I was post-secondary education critic 
for our party when I served in the Manitoba legislature. I have 
taken a great interest in the situation as it affects students in my 
province at the university in my area and certainly in all of this 
country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4358"> 4358 </A></B>
<P>
	I am one of those, and I expect it is shared by most members in 
this House, who believes that education is a public good. I note a 
member opposite who serves with me on the human resources 
committee. We listened to submissions on employability on that 
committee.
<P>
	One of the things which was noted very quickly is that the job 
creation rate for people with a university education, college 
training, or a profession is something in excess of 10 per cent a 
year. However, the job creation rate for those without 
post-secondary education, for those with less than high school 
education, is minus some 17 per cent and declining. It is a very, 
very serious situation.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	We all benefit, all of us. Not just the person being trained but 
all of us who live in this country benefit by having a populace 
that is well educated, well trained, productive, et cetera.
<P>
	The question is what do we do in support and in pursuit of that 
public policy? That is what this bill is attempting lay out a 
framework for. It does not answer all of the questions but it does 
make some very innovative changes to the current legislation 
which provide for some fairly major improvements in the way 
we as a community support those people who are able to achieve 
a standing at a university or college.
<P>
	I want to deal briefly with one piece of information which was 
mentioned just before I stood up to speak. That is the question of 
the level of support which is currently provided for students 
versus what was provided.
<P>
	While there is some variation between smaller colleges and 
universities and the more major institutions, students do not pay 
one-third to one-half of their education. At large universities 
they paid 15 or 16 per cent. This has slowly ratcheted up over the 
last few years as a result of, I believe it was the Smith 
commission report which looked at the share that students 
should pay.
<P>
	At the University of Manitoba it is around 19 per cent right 
now that the student revenue is comprised of total expenditures 
at the school. There is a covert, if not an overt, policy in place to 
bring that up to 25 per cent, which I think was the level 
recommended by Dr. Smith, believing that gave students more 
power and a little more clout in their negotiations with 
universities.
<P>
	The dilemma is that despite the fact we give lip service and 
stand up to make statements about the importance of education 
and we examine the value of an education and understand this is 
something which is a major improvement to life in our 
communities, as a country we have not provided very significant 
support to students, particularly in this last eight years.
<P>
	One of the things we did right away in 1984 as a country-it 
was done by the former government, but it was done in this 
Chamber-was we froze the amount of money a student could 
borrow or could claim for cost of living. From 1984 until this 
year the amount of money they could claim for food and housing 
was frozen. That put students in a very difficult position. The 
cost of living did not stop going up. People still had to pay for 
their apartments and their meals.
<P>
	What we did part way through the last eight years is we 
changed the regulations relative to work. I think the previous 
government felt what should be done was to allow them to work 
more part time but still consider them full time students. By 
doing this it would somehow allow them to shoulder more of the 
costs and therefore pay for their own education and not be a drag 
on the public purse.
<P>
	Unfortunately that put students under enormous pressure. 
People began working at those part time jobs. They had to in 
order to pay for their living accommodations and to feed 
themselves. As someone who has had the proverbial potatoes 
and rice also, I can assure you students are not eating a whole lot 
better now. It forced them to take time away from their studies. 
It took time away from the pursuit of excellence in their 
education. It put them in the position of having to work 
continually to sustain themselves and at the same time trying to 
get that education.
<P>
	You could get by if you were a student from a family that was 
intact and you could live at home, or your family lived close to a 
university and you could live at home and commute. If your 
family lived in the rural area or in the northern parts of the 
province and you had to live in residence, or you were a student 
who for any one of a number of reasons came from a home that 
was either too impoverished or too disparate to offer any 
support, you were in a very difficult financial situation.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	Almost from the time the government changed the regulations 
we saw a very gradual but significant increase statistically in the 
number of part time students at universities and a decrease in the 
number of full time students. That was even factoring out the 
influx of older students who pick up the odd course.
<P>
	That was because students found they could not do both 
things. They could not go to university full time and work what 
they had to in order to sustain themselves. All of a sudden three 
year degrees were taking four or four and a half years. Those 
students who, had they been able to concentrate and work full 
time on their studies, would have come out with degrees and 
excellent averages in good preparation for graduate school were 
unable to do that because they were forced to spend so much 
time just sustaining themselves.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4359"> 4359 </A></B>
<P>
	What did the government do just prior to the last election? It 
announced an increase in student loan limits. Looking at that 
increase and at the regulations which support that increase, the 
government also changed the identification of what were 
personal contributions. This was done to the point whereby even 
though it was seen that more money could be borrowed, it did 
nothing to alter the underlying ability to assign greater cost to 
the cost of living.
<P>
	The government changed the regulations. Instead of basing 
accommodation on two people sharing an apartment, it based it 
on three people sharing an apartment. It took things out of the 
basket of goods students were deemed to need in order to survive 
at university. The result was that students were put under more 
and not less financial pressure.
<P>
	There is another element to the provision of student aid which 
needs to be talked about because we are the federal government 
and we deliver these services for the most part through a 
relationship with provincial governments.
<P>
	What was happening in my province was that the federal 
government was providing about $3,500 in total support. If a 
student required more support than that, another $3,500 could be 
obtained from the provincial government. A very small number 
of special needs students could access another chunk of money 
through the provincial government.
<P>
	One of the concerns we had was that when one was tied to that 
provincial assessment and delivery of support, as the federal 
government increased its ability or willingness to subsidize the 
interest on certain loans, the provincial government rather than 
also increasing its support would simply decrease its 
involvement.
<P>
	I am sorry to report to this Chamber but that is exactly what 
has happened in my province. I do not know what has occurred 
in some of the other provinces, but in the province of Manitoba 
as the federal government has moved to increase the loan limit, 
the provincial government has withdrawn certain support.
<P>
	All we have done in one aspect of this program is to transfer 
an expense on to the back of the federal government. That has to 
open the door for a discussion about the federal role in funding, 
the federal involvement with provincial agencies in the 
assessment and delivery of support. Perhaps we need to look at 
some new vehicles for delivering support to students. I think you 
will find that the possibility of that is contained within this bill.
<P>
	My concern since I first began to work with this is that over 
the last eight years we were successively constraining the 
support given to universities through established programs 
financing. We were holding back on the support that we in 
pursuit of a public policy took on to the public purse to the point 
where in some cases the annual increases universities were 
getting were in the negative numbers.
<P>
	That certainly happened in Manitoba and in some other 
provinces. Even when they were getting positive increases they 
were increases of a point, a point and a half, or two points versus 
the total cost of living, inflation, et cetera which was at the three 
or four point range back in the late 1980s.
<P>
	This caused the universities to look to that 18 or 19 per cent of 
revenue coming from students in order to make up for the 
shortfalls in their revenues. We were seeing student fee 
increases of 15 and 20 per cent year over year. Student fees at the 
University of Manitoba increased over 100 per cent during the 
last eight years.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	In our pursuit of that policy we were taking something that 
had been deemed to be a public good, that had been funded by 
the community, by the government in pursuit of a 
well-educated, productive population, and we were transferring 
responsibility of that from the government on to students. It has 
created some very difficult situations.
<P>
	We gave the students no options on the repayment. We gave 
them no way out of the hole that we were forcing them to dig for 
themselves.
<P>
	I have been given the high sign by the Speaker so I will draw 
this to a close now and perhaps I can go a little further in 
response to a question.
<P>
	I support the bill because it does many things. It enables us to 
provide some repayment options for students, it opens the door 
to link good performance to some opportunities in community 
service, it allows people to deal with their debt management, it 
provides more badly needed support to students, and it allows us 
to assess a reasonable level for the cost of living that is also 
regionally sensitive. These are very profound and long overdue 
changes which I hope we will pass quickly and get into play.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask 
the hon. member how concerned he is about the indebtedness of 
Canadian students. As you know, on average, and I quote from 
Quebec figures, students owe $8,500, but for those who 
graduate, the debt level sometimes reaches up to $16,000 or 
$18,000. The member talked about the tuition fees which have 
tripled since 1984. Somehow, it seems like the load was 
transferred after the subsidies for post-secondary education 
were frozen. That led to an increase in tuition fees.
<P>
	Also, I think the increase in the debt level should be a concern 
for all of us. How far are we ready to go? In this bill, when we 
talk about financial assistance, we are mostly talking about 
loans, and not necessarily about grants, so that also contributes 
to the debt level. With the public debt in Canada standing at 
$17,000 per capita, we are asking our students to further 
increase their debt level. Add to that the rather shaky 
employment situation,  and you have 16 per cent of Quebecers 
going 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4360"> 4360 </A></B>
<P>
bankrupt, including students unable to pay back their loans. 
Students account for 10 per cent of personal bankruptcies in 
Canada.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member if he is concerned about 
the alarming debt situation our young students are in.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alcock:</B> I thank the member for Lévis for the question. 
We serve together on the human resources committee and I have 
found his interventions to be always thoughtful.
<P>
	It is a difficult problem. The member puts his finger exactly 
on the problem that has confronted students up to this point. We 
say it is a loan but there is an element of grant here because we 
pay the interest on those loans for the three, four, five years, up 
until the time that people begin repayment, and then we pay a 
subsidy up to a certain amount.
<P>
	At the same time we know that if we allow people to 
successfully complete their education, the economy is still 
performing relatively well for people at that end of the scale. 
The question is that until this bill we have not allowed them any 
options, any opportunities to repay. If they get stuck, if they 
cannot find a job, we have not provided for them or given 
ourselves the opportunity to provide any way in which they can 
repay their loan. This bill begins to speak to that. It begins to 
offer some opportunities, whether it becomes income contingent 
repayment or some form of community service as an alternative 
to work.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	We know that if you graduate university right now, job 
creation for university students, depending on the region of the 
country, is somewhere between 11 and 17 per cent. That is pretty 
healthy. It provides a lot of options, a lot of opportunities for 
work, a lot of options for people to access employment and 
repay these loans.
<P>
	The bigger question is, are we allowing people to have an 
adequate educational experience or are we just simply putting 
them into a no-win situation in which they perform poorly 
because they have to work so hard to get by day to day that they 
are less competitive in the marketplace when they get out?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take the opportunity to voice my support for Bill 
C-28, the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act. Indeed this 
is a necessary pillar to ensure quality in higher education in 
Canada.
<P>
	Financial assistance to Canada's students is in a very real 
sense an investment and there are few investments in the country 
which can be expected to yield as great a dividend as an 
investment in the human potential.
<P>
	In many respects the intellect, diligence and perseverance of 
young Canadians is our biggest asset as a nation, our most 
precious natural resource. Imagine nearly 1.5 million students, 
both full time and part time, trying to reflect the future of our 
country. Indeed, the youth and students of today, though they 
only represent a portion of our total population, represent 100 
per cent of our future. The government is committed to making 
certain that the rich vein of talent which courses through our 
youth does not go untapped.
<P>
	As is the case with other natural resources that are mined the 
key raw elements of youth, namely creative and artistic minds, 
idealistic and visionary hearts, and adaptable hands are most 
useful when refined through education and training.
<P>
	Bill C-28 is just one important facet of a comprehensive 
youth employment and learning strategy. It is designed to break 
the traditional dependency of a young person's educational 
opportunities on his or her financial capabilities. The bill 
provides increased financial assistance for students whose 
pockets may not be as deep as their commitment and potential to 
achieve.
<P>
	Generally speaking, the bill has two principal features. First, 
it provides for agreement between governments and lenders in 
so far as loans to students are concerned. Second, it allows 
greater flexibility where the student loan program is concerned 
respecting eligibility, the total amount to be granted in terms of 
loans and grants and as well in terms of repayment of these 
loans.
<P>
	The bill provides for a new risk sharing agreement with 
lenders which will see them assume liability for loan repayment 
to a greater degree.
<P>
	Bill C-28 also contains measures aimed at simplifying the 
joint federal-provincial administration of the student loan 
programs by way of agreement, not by coercion, and thereby 
diminish the cost of administration of the program and saves 
that money for actual loans and assistance to students.
<P>
	The second major component of the bill is flexibility. Under 
the bill there is greater flexibility with regard to both the type 
and maximum dollar amount of loans available to students. As 
well the provinces have the option of opting out of the current 
program and receiving an alternative form of federal payment 
thereby respecting provincial jurisdiction and taking into 
account provincial and regional interests.
<P>
	Also pilot programs may be established to determine whether 
repayment plans can be structured on an income contingent 
basis, taking into account a student's total debt load as well as 
the student's earning capacity at any given time.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4361"> 4361 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	In addition, the new allocation formula provided for in the bill 
means middle class students may find it easier to qualify for 
loans than they do under the current guidelines.
<P>
	As well Bill C-28 portends great things for part time students 
who will have greater access to funds, both loans and grants, 
than ever before. The new flexibility will also address segments 
of our society, including women pursuing advance degrees, and 
the disabled who have been under represented in certain areas of 
higher education.
<P>
	Some members of the House have taken issue with this 
provision, saying that such a provision will create a division in 
the country. I submit that the government wants these women as 
well as the disabled to have an equal opportunity to pursue the 
higher levels of education. Contrary to what others say, we are 
only trying to make the playing field level for them as well, and 
where in the past, history has made a mistake, to correct the past 
mistakes of history.
<P>
	It is important to note that these general improvements will 
translate into very specific and measurable benefits for students. 
First and foremost, loan limits will be increased by 57 per cent, 
thus the full time loan limit increases from $105 to $165 weekly.
<P>
	Students with permanent disabilities may qualify for grants of 
up to $3,000 annually to help cover transportation, 
interpretation and other technical courses necessary as a 
consequence of their disabilities.
<P>
	A special opportunities grant would be made available to 
women pursuing doctoral degrees in fields where they are 
currently underrepresented and part time students will have the 
ability to apply for loans whose maximum will be raised from 
$2,500 to $4,000 annually. A $1,200 grant will also be available 
to part time students who are able to demonstrate other exigency 
needs. Different grants would alleviate the heavy burdens which 
rest with so-called high need borrowers.
<P>
	These sorts of provisions are intended to respond to the 
demands the government has heard from students nation wide. 
These measures are the best indication yet that the government 
is not simply talking about tending to the needs of our youth but 
is in fact acting quickly and with an eye toward sweeping future 
improvements.
<P>
	The young scholars of today are the women and men who must 
have the tools to lead Canada into the 21st century with research, 
innovation and determination. It is they who will need to lay the 
cornerstone of the much talked about information 
superhighway. It is they who will need to provide the brain 
power necessary to realize innovations which will make life 
more productive, more enriching and more fulfilling for all of 
us, for all Canadians.
<P>
	To accomplish these formidable goals they will require the 
kind of exhaustive training and educational background which is 
most often furnished by Canada's many excellent colleges, 
universities and vocational schools.
<P>
	It is for this reason that the government will not force young 
Canadians to make tremendous debilitating financial sacrifices 
in order to further their education. The government is acting in 
partnership with the leaders of tomorrow, effectively extending 
its right hand to them in a gesture of co-operation and respect 
and in recognition of their needs and potential to contribute to 
our Canadian society.
<P>
	In this way we are today striking a bargain which will 
ultimately benefit tomorrow's Canada, for our youth of today 
will be prepared to compete in the global economy and as well to 
contribute to our national economy and our social cohesion.
<P>
	They who represent 100 per cent of our future as a nation shall 
secure the future for us as today we grant them the necessary 
tools to enable them to secure their national dream.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, several 
people have commented today it is a shame that students should 
be going so far in debt while they are pursuing a university 
education. However I point out that when they go into debt they 
are the ones who are getting the education. They will be the ones 
earning the income and therefore they should be responsible for 
paying it back.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	I put to the hon. member who has just spoken that contrarily 
the part of the bill that would allow for outright grants to go to 
members of society in essence forces people like me and people 
working at fast food restaurants or driving cabs to pay through 
taxes for the university education of people who quite 
conceivably could have extremely good careers, make a 
tremendous amount of money, but never have to pay for a big 
part of their education.
<P>
	Would the hon. member comment on the fairness of that type 
of system?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to comment on 
the fairness of the provision.
<P>
	The fairness of this provision can only be understood if we 
look at our students as not only working for themselves, for their 
personal aggrandisement or for their selfish interest in the 
future. If our thesis is that the students of today would only earn 
for themselves and for nobody else, not for society, of course 
society would have no obligation to them.
<P>
	The students of today, I should remind the hon. member, do 
not only work for themselves. Their success is the success of our 
nation. Upon them the future of the country depends. To say they 
will have the education, the income and therefore should pay for 
themselves alone is  to forget that the students of today will be 
the ones contributing to our national economy in the future. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4362"> 4362 </A></B>
<P>
They will be the ones contributing to the social cohesion of our 
country.
<P>
	To forget those very important principles is to overlook the 
very essence of education itself. I therefore submit that when the 
hon. member reflects on these principles he will come quickly to 
the conclusion that there is no merit to the question he posed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague 
opposite commented on the views of student associations, of the 
Canadian Federation of Students. However, as a member of the 
human resources committee, I observed that the views of this 
federation differed widely from those held by, for example, 
student associations in Quebec.
<P>
	The hon. member may not be aware that one of the concerns 
expressed by students in Quebec is very close to the heart of the 
official opposition, and that is its concern for upholding the 
Constitution as it pertains to education, a field which comes 
under exclusive provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Therefore, I would like to hear my colleague's views on this 
point and find out, first of all, whether he is aware of the 
demands made by student associations in Quebec. I would be 
interested in his comments because there is a growing awareness 
that there are two separate countries within Canada. There are 
those who tolerate, and even want, federal assistance in 
educational matters. However, there is another reality in 
Quebec, one which believes that for reasons of culture and 
identity, the Quebec government should be solely responsible 
for education.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pagtakhan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am aware of some of the 
concerns of Quebec students. I was listening earlier this 
morning to the debate of the hon. member. I recall he indicated 
that one of the many concerns was withdrawal of the federal 
government from the educational programs.
<P>
	Withdrawal in what way-to the point a which funds are not 
given to Quebec students like they are to any other Canadian? Of 
course the government stands opposed to that because it is 
committed to helping every student in the country wherever a 
student may be. Whether students reside in Quebec, in my home 
province of Manitoba or in my home city of Winnipeg they are 
entitled to help from the federal government.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	In terms of the administration of the program, I realize that 
education is an exclusive provincial jurisdiction. There is 
provision in the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act for 
opting out and alternative payments will be given. There is the 
flexibility in the bill that I indicated during debate to respect 
provincial jurisdiction, to respect regional interest, but to ensure 
at all times that students wherever they are in the country will be 
treated equally by the federal government.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Brant-Via Rail; the hon. member for 
Bourassa-Integration of Immigrants; the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce-Handguns; the hon. member for 
Mercier-Unem- ployment Insurance; the hon. member for 
Lotbinière-Inter-governmental Affairs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, those who 
hoped that by launching wide consultations on the reform of 
social programs, not only in the papers he published himself but 
also in the comments he made here, including student assistance 
programs, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
would initiate a real reform have been disappointed. How can 
the minister, before the consultations, before submitting an 
action plan that would trigger reactions, come up with a project 
that, instead of the hope repeatedly promised and announced in a 
passionate tone of voice, only offers to young people the 
possibility of getting deeper into debt?
<P>
	Except for a few scholarships and a possible rebate for those 
who have reached the maximum debt level, the only hope is for 
getting into debt. This bill only offers the hope of getting into 
debt while ensuring a real and effective centralization, as I will 
try to demonstrate.
<P>
	First of all, let us keep in mind that young people do not start 
out with the same advantages, whether they are born male or 
female, rich or poor, to a family that stresses education or one 
that has too many problems to give it the importance it should 
have. There is a great injustice right from the beginning of life. 
That is why some countries choose to work to make education if 
not completely at least widely available to all young people as 
long as they have the necessary abilities.
<P>
	We know that hope in life, the hope to find a job, despite their 
scarcity-we will come back to that later-, depends to a large 
extent on the capacity to study and get a degree. In some 
countries, France for example, education is completely free. 
Others offer scholarships or loans. In Canada, depending on 
what each province wants, both scholarships and loans are 
sometimes available. In Quebec, which has a loans and bursaries 
program, students have been complaining since the 1980s that 
bursaries are being reduced while loans have increased.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4363"> 4363 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	For a long time, the federal government has subsidized 
education; this is a fact, and we cannot rewrite history. But in the 
previous Student Loans Act, at least it respected the provinces' 
wishes.
<P>
	To begin with, I would like to emphasize that the federal 
government subsidizes education in two ways. First, by way of 
EPF, a program created many years ago, it transfers funds 
collected from taxpayers to provinces for education. These 
funds have diminished. I will give you an example taken from 
the budget. In 1992-93, the funds amounted to $2.8 billion, but 
for 1994-95, they will total $2.119 billion. And this is at a time 
when the number of students is rising and when the market is 
growing for graduates from expensive fields of study.
<P>
	One the one hand, the central government's help is 
decreasing, but, on the other, student assistance is also 
decreasing. What the government is doing here is decreasing 
this aid, which is not direct aid but a loan to be repaid by the 
students. It is replacing a grant it no longer gives by another way 
for students to get into debt. That is the bill's real aim.
<P>
	So, it is more debt and more centralization. Students' 
indebtedness, as my colleague said before, is always increasing. 
This bill, according to the department's figures, provides that 
the funds available for loans will rise from $1.8 billion to 
$5 billion. Students will have access to higher education, but 
they will have to get into debt to do it. What is the context?
<P>
	First of all, the cost of education has risen because federal 
contributions have been dropping. Education costs three times 
more now than in 1984. In Quebec, a similar increase took place 
in the last three years. Because of high unemployment, students 
have a hard time finding a summer job to pay for their education 
the way they did in the past. To get by, when I was a student, I 
used to work during the summer like many other students did. 
What are the students doing now? More and more, they are 
studying part-time and combining school and work.
<P>
	Some may think this is excellent because students will know 
how much their education costs. Let me refer to the experience 
of all university and college students and teachers in the world. 
Of course one could understand when students studied and had 
part-time jobs on the weekend. However, the students' need to 
work, whether they are in college or in university, has been 
constantly increasing, to the point where schedules in these 
institutions are now influenced by the reality of part-time work.
<P>
	But that is not all. In recent years, I worked as a lecturer at 
UQUAM and at the Université de Montréal. I noticed how 
strong the pressure created by this part-time work was on 
students, teachers and, ultimately, the education system as a 
whole. This is true not only in Quebec but also elsewhere.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	So, we will be penalized when our students later become 
professionals or scientists and have to compete against their 
peers from other countries who will have had the opportunity to 
dedicate all their time and energy to studying. A commitment to 
studying is not only an individual commitment; it is also a 
collective one. Consequently, to feel good about the fact that, in 
the end, students make it by working part-time and getting 
deeper into debt is to bury one's head in the sand.
<P>
	The greater incidence of part-time work has a disastrous 
effect on the quality of education and the ability of students, 
during this privileged time of their life, to passionately dedicate 
themselves to the pleasures of research. If students do not have 
this opportunity at this particular time, they certainly will not 
have it later on. Some who have had to work part-time know 
how hard it is not to be able to fully dedicate oneself to one's 
studies.
<P>
	I should add that getting into debt does not have the same 
meaning for a student in arts or literature. We all hope that, in 
the future, many will continue to take law, engineering, 
medicine, teaching, or simply improve their knowledge, in the 
hope to find a career.
<P>
	I am not overly bothered by the fact that a medical student can 
incur debts of $30,000. However, I read this morning that 
Bernard Lamarre, President of the Ordre des ingénieurs du 
Québec, said that 4,500 to 5,000 engineers in Quebec are 
currently unemployed. Now even an engineer cannot be sure 
that he will be able easily, or just plain able, to repay a debt that 
can be as high as $12,000 or even $15,000, on average. The bill 
provides a possible reduction if it is over $16,000.
<P>
	Who will recommend that a student going into teaching-we 
do not know if he will find work-or many other fields where 
jobs are scarce should go up to his neck in debt? Let me say that 
this is an unsolved problem of my generation, which we share 
with others here. It is a miserable failure because instead of 
preparing for the year 2000, 2010 and 2020, we find ourselves in 
an even more difficult situation. Although we may be satisfied 
with the number of students, in fact, when we look at the whole 
system, this issue of funding is extremely difficult and it is our 
generation's failure. It is a failure for which we will pay dearly.
<P>
	I also want to talk about the centralization which this bill 
represents. I will only take a few points, in particular, the 
definition of appropriate authority.
<P>
	In the old law-I should say in the current law-the 
appropriate authority is a person, body or other authority 
designated as such by the lieutenant governor in council of the 
province for the purposes of this Act. So the authority is 
designated by the province concerned.
<P>
	The bill says: ``Appropriate Authorities: 3.(1) For the 
purposes of this Act, the minister-of course, the minister who 
is a member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada-may, by 
order, designate for a  province-again, it is the minister who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4364"> 4364 </A></B>
<P>
has this power-an appropriate authority, which authority may 
designate as designated educational institutions any institutions 
of learning in Canada that offer courses at a post-secondary 
school level, or any class of such institutions''.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	In the existing legislation, a designated educational 
institution in or outside Canada was also designated by the 
Lieutenant-Governor. In this bill, the same authority designated 
by the minister or another authority also designated by the 
minister will decide which educational institutions will be 
designated in or outside Canada. It is obvious that these two 
provisions clearly transfer control of the student financial 
assistance program from the provinces to the minister.
<P>
	In some cases, the provinces do not mind losing that power. 
Nevertheless, according to our Constitution, education comes 
under provincial jurisdiction. I think the federal government is 
going too far by saying in this bill that it is the minister who will 
designate the appropriate authority for a province, especially in 
this context of broad consultations about a social reform that is 
supposed to give hope to Canadians.
<P>
	It seems to me that the minister should listen to our criticisms 
regarding centralization and indebtedness, that they should 
encourage him to wait. There are a few incentives for students in 
this bill, although I do not have enough time to talk about all of 
them. For instance, the federal government does dangle the 
prospect of bursaries in front of them. But this is centralisation, 
because these bursaries would come directly from the central 
government. The government could give these incentives 
without having to overhaul the current legislation and define 
new relationships between the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and the provinces.
<P>
	There are other signs of centralization. Certificates of 
eligibility refer to the determination of the assistance needed by 
persons eligible for loans. In the bill, the appropriate authority 
may issue or cause to be issued for a period of studies a 
certificate of eligibility to a qualifying student whom that 
authority considers-there are two conditions specified in the 
legislation-(<I>a</I>) to have attained a satisfactory scholastic 
standard; and (<I>b</I>) to be in need of a loan for that period. But this 
is determined by the appropriate authority designated for the 
province.
<P>
	Here, it is specified: ``Subject to the regulations''. Do we 
know what the regulations are? No. ``Subject to the regulations, 
the appropriate authority designated by the same Minister may, 
on application, issue or cause to be issued to a qualifying student 
a certificate of eligibility, in the prescribed form, for a period of 
studies at a designated educational institution-we saw how it 
was designated, in Canada, by the appropriate authority 
designated by the Minister, or outside Canada, by the 
appropriate authority designated by the Minister. So,  both 
characteristics are the same, but subject to the regulations, and 
the regulations are determined by the Minister.
<P>
	Suffice it to say, in conclusion, that this bill stigmatizes the 
failure of our generation, the generation now in power in this 
government, to give effectively and for good an opportunity, if 
not equal at least less unequal, to young people, no matter what 
their origin is, but subject of course to their ability and their will 
to study.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	This is a bill that gives absolutely no indication about what 
can be expected in this country and, as a spokesperson for the 
Official Opposition, and in spite of my convictions, which are 
well known, I say that no matter what hopes one might have for 
that reform, I think that this bill destroys them. This bill is cause 
for concern because it was not intended in the first place to help 
the students since it only allows them to go into debt, and they 
are not even sure of finding a job when they graduate. As for 
centralization, it is consistent with a commitment by a federal 
government which decides alone in Ottawa on what is good for 
everybody.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was very 
interested in the member's speech. I happen to be the father of 
three children who are now in their 20s and who ended up 
coming through the education process with a tremendous debt 
load.
<P>
	I wonder if the member would agree that perhaps a 
constructive way to handle that situation would be to take a look 
at an income contingent repayment plan so that if they are in a 
very low paying job such as in a social working kind of situation 
or, as has been suggested, perhaps from an arts perspective 
versus someone who is on the higher end after a few years as a 
lawyer or a doctor, there is some real possibility of being able to 
overcome that by tying the repayment of the loan to the income 
that the student would have at the time.
<P>
	Would she see this as a way of getting away from the number 
of defaults on student loans we are presently saddled with?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, research has been done by 
students and those who are concerned by this issue of student 
grants.
<P>
	I think there is hope in that regard. But students have warned 
us and rightly so against the temptation to make the future 
generations bear alone the weight of education, which is a tool 
for our community development. I am very sensitive to this 
argument. It would be too easy in the end to say that they have 
only to study now and pay later. In fact, now is the time to share. 
That is why I am very disappointed with this bill. The minister 
had promised to introduce an innovative bill which would deal 
with the real problems. It seems to me he failed completely.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4365"> 4365 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague 
from Mercier spoke as usual very passionately, but also with 
considerable knowledge of the subject at hand.
<P>
	I would like to ask her-since she did not have the opportunity 
to touch on this point-if indeed the real problem is the shortage 
of jobs for students when they complete their studies. This bill is 
part of a strategy which the Minister of Human Resources 
Development has called the Youth Employment and Learning 
Strategy. We have looked closely, but have not been able to find 
any concrete measures, aside from precarious jobs such as those 
associated with Youth Service Canada, or low-paying jobs. This 
presents a problem. I would like to hear the hon. member's 
views on this matter.
<P>
	If time permits, I would like to hear what she thinks about the 
transfer of responsibility to banking institutions. What was up 
until now the responsibility of the government will now be 
transferred to banking institutions.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are not accustomed to leading 
questions on this side of the House. However, my colleague has 
given me the opportunity to focus on one of the major problems 
that young people face. My colleague spoke about how people of 
my generation-I am 53 years old-were able to find work quite 
easily upon graduating from university. This was likely also true 
for some people who are younger than me and certainly for those 
who are older. Finding a job is the issue uppermost in the minds 
of young people. There is no possible way it can be argued that 
this bill is part of an overall employment strategy.
<P>
	Regarding my hon. colleague's second question, I am 
concerned about the new role that banks are being called upon to 
play. I am concerned because we are told that as things now 
stand, the banks have no incentive to ask students to repay the 
money they owe and that as a result, the government is left to 
contend with loan defaulters. I note that the minister has given 
banks a great deal of latitude to negotiate. Is it not a little absurd 
that the additional money to be spent will be used to help banks 
put more pressure on students to repay their loans?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to join in the 
discussion and debate because for too long in Canada we have 
been living in the context in which the future seems to be a dead 
end for our young people and for people who want to pursue 
post-secondary studies.
<P>
	Many young people are wondering what awaits them when 
they get out of school, college or even university. They are 
wondering whether they will be able to find a job that 
corresponds to their skills. They are wondering if there is a place 
for them in the labour market.
<P>
	We must do much more than wring our hands about the often 
drastic situation of our young people while remaining 
indifferent to their plight. We can get into debates about issues 
around centralization. We could make passionate arguments 
about indebtedness but it is important to note that the program 
proposed today is a model of administrative delegation with the 
federal government providing for the financing of student loans 
through private sector lenders and provinces undertaking 
certain responsibilities in respect of assessing student needs and 
awarding aid under the program.
<P>
	We must give back to our country and to its citizens the 
confidence and optimism that are needed to create a strong, 
dynamic economy which is so necessary in the context of market 
globalization.
<P>
	In light of this need, the government recently launched, and 
the minister again spoke of it today, on the youth employment 
and learning strategy in order to give our young people in 
particular and Canadians in general the means and the 
opportunities of taking on this new economic challenge.
<P>
	Under the proposed reforms provinces are expected to play a 
central role in the administration of the programs. In fact the 
proposals to reform the program have been developed through 
close consultation with provinces and interest groups over the 
past two years. Many of the changes reflect criteria in place 
under provincial student assistance programs. I am referring to 
measures which emphasize results in learning as well initiatives 
to ease student indebtedness on completion of their studies.
<P>
	Far from limiting provincial flexibility, the bill continues to 
provide for jurisdictions choosing to offer their own student 
assistance programs to opt out of the federal scheme and receive 
appropriate compensation. The formula for compensation has 
been expanded to include the enhancements offered under the 
federal program. In this way students in opted out jurisdictions 
will also benefit from the changes being recommended by the 
government.
<P>
	What are those changes? The student bill amends the Canada 
Student Loans Act in order to ensure that it truly meets the 
objectives for which it was designed 30 years ago to enable our 
young people to pursue their education in accordances with their 
talents, their interest and ambitions.

<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	Women pursuing post-secondary education face great 
challenges. The United Nations has identified unequal access to 
education as one of the impediments to women's full 
participation in society. Women still face many of the 
challenges confronted by women in the fifties and in the sixties. 
They face segregation by occupation, low wages, insufficient 
child care and a heavy burden of family responsibilities which 
can impede access to education.
<P>
	These facts influence the ability of women to obtain teaching 
jobs at universities and colleges and to advance through the 
professorate. At the college level 15,000 full time teachers are 
men, compared with 10,000 women. At the university level 
there are 30,000 men who are full time faculty and only 8,000 
women. Furthermore, women are concentrated at the lower 
ranks of full time university faculty. They account for less than 8 
per cent of full professors, 20 per cent of associate professors 
and 33 per cent of assistant professors. Because women at all 
levels below full professor are less likely than their male 
counterparts to have earned a doctorate, their career prospects 
are significantly hindered.
<P>
	Despite rapid improvements in the participation of women at 
the undergraduate level, we know they are still greatly under 
represented in areas such as engineering, applied sciences, 
mathematics and the physical sciences.
<P>
	Right now about one-third of doctoral students are women. 
Female doctoral students receiving Canada student loans tend to 
have greater assessed needs and higher debt loads than their 
male counterparts, which makes studying more difficult for 
them and repaying their loans more onerous.
<P>
	The proposed amendments are designed to eliminate this 
barrier which is faced by women who are pursuing 
post-secondary studies or who have decided to return to college 
or university. Female doctoral students may be eligible to access 
up to $3,000 in any given year for up to three years of study to 
help them meet the costs associated with studies at the doctoral 
level.
<P>
	As I previously mentioned, the amount of loans and 
allocations has not changed in 10 years. Currently the maximum 
amount of loans provided to students under the program is 
$3,600 a year. The average cost of one year of studies, however, 
is estimated at $9,500 for a single student enrolled in university 
who does not live with his or her parents.
<P>
	Furthermore, students who have one or more dependents or 
who are the head of a single parent family and persons with 
disabilities have additional financial difficulties for which no 
specific measures are provided under the program. The program 
in its current form is not always equitable. There is no guarantee 
that students in comparable circumstances will receive fair, 
uniform treatment from one province to the next. In addition, 
the amounts provided are determined by provincial authorities 
without taking into account the province or  region in which the 
educational institution attended by the applicant is located.
<P>
	Under the new program the maximum annual loan limit will 
increase to $5,600 per school year for full time students, and 
$4,000 for part time students. This will ensure that those persons 
with the greatest need can count on reasonable financial 
assistance while they complete their studies. I would point out 
that these amounts represent an increase of almost 60 per cent.
<P>
	In addition, special opportunity grants which will be awarded 
to students with the greatest financial need will help 
re-establish equality of opportunity for higher education.
<P>
	Expanding eligibility for the interest relief plan to low income 
persons with low wage or part time jobs will grant them relief 
they had previously been denied.
<P>
	This will enable us to provide support to those students who 
are truly determined to succeed, while at the same time making 
good use of taxpayers' money. With the new legislation we will 
be able to establish new funding terms so that all eligible 
students will have access to loans, to develop repayment 
formulas that take incomes into account, and to benefit 
taxpayers by reducing the costs of the program.
<P>
	For a system of financial assistance to be fair and equitable 
for all Canadians from coast to coast it must be consistent while 
obviously reflecting the particular economic conditions of each 
region.
<P>
	The federal government therefore intends to work more 
closely with the provinces with a view to standardizing the 
operation of the program and to exploring the potential for 
greater harmonization of federal and provincial student 
assistance programs.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	This bill respects provincial jurisdiction over education. 
These reforms are about creating opportunities and providing 
hope to Canadians who might not otherwise pursue 
post-secondary learning without financial assistance.
<P>
	The bill is intended to provide the necessary enabling 
authority so that the government's announced reforms to the 
program can proceed.
<P>
	Contrary to what we have heard in the House, the government 
has been very clear about its intention to overhaul the Canada 
student loans program. Specifically, our intention was 
announced to increase the loan limits for full time and part time 
students. The government will shortly be providing an overview 
of the regulations to the committee examining the bill in 
specific ways.
<P>
	These regulations will be subject to the normal regulatory 
approval process. They will be prepublished for the purpose of 
pursuing the widest possible consultation on their content. Prior 
to finalizing those regulations they will be reviewed in light of 
those comments for consideration and approval by the governor 
in council.

	The Government of Canada has long provided funding for 
post-secondary education. In 1993-94, $15.6 billion was spent 
on post-secondary education. The total federal support reached 
$8 billion, representing over 50 per cent of total support.
<P>
	Federal EPF transfers to Quebec for post-secondary 
education are expected to reach $1.5 billion in 1994 and 1995, 
representing an increase of over $12 million over last year.
<P>
	It is in this same spirit of federal-provincial co-operation and 
in order to provide the greatest possible opportunity that I join in 
this debate and I support the minister responsible.
<P>
	We have before us an innovative project aimed at giving the 
people of Canada, both young and old, the chance to reach their 
objectives in the area of education, training and equal 
opportunities for doing so.
<P>
	Therefore we must not hesitate to take bold steps to restore the 
faith of our fellow citizens in the future. We must let them know 
that we wish to strengthen our economy and make Canada a 
strong and competitive country on the international scene. This 
is a primary objective of the youth employment and learning 
strategy.
<P>
	We have here a complete initiative, a concrete initiative that is 
part of a national strategy whose value I am convinced is 
recognized by all Canadians. I am also convinced that all of my 
fellow members of Parliament are becoming increasingly aware 
of the merits and the necessity of this initiative after today's 
discussions. I therefore call on every member to demonstrate 
and give their support to this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to salute the 
hon. member and since we are both on the Standing Committee 
on Human Resources Development and she is well informed of 
the social program reform, I take this opportunity to ask her a 
question on that subject.
<P>
	Today, we are studying the student loans program in the 
context of a particular strategy directed at youth, but 
fundamentally, that program should be part of social program 
reform throughout Canada. The Committee on Human 
Resources Development has been asked to engage in a 
consultation process following the action plan that had been 
announced earlier by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, who will table his overall plan of action within 
the next few weeks. The comprehensive reform proposed in this 
action plan was supposed to cover, in a coherent manner, all 
aspects of social and income security programs, including 
student financial assistance.
<P>
	What have we observed? As with unemployment insurance, 
we can see that, in this case, the minister has decided not to wait 
for the outcome of the consultation process on social reform.
<P>
	Since she is a member of that committee, I would like to ask 
my colleague to explain why it is so urgent to proceed with these 
changes before the outcome of the reflection process which we 
have undertaken together is known.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> I thank my colleague for his question and 
also for his concern as to the progress of the work we are 
presently embarking upon.
<P>
	I am aware that my colleague knows that we have heard from 
hundreds of Canadians who have come before our standing 
committee. My colleague is aware of the situation that faces the 
young people in this country and that we need to provide them 
with opportunities for jobs. It is important that our young people 
at the end of the school year can see where their future is heading 
in the upcoming year. In the process that is before us there is a 
tie-in of course with the work and the reform that is going to 
take place. It is also important to note that we are here to govern, 
to take the leadership and to ensure that we meet the needs of 
Canadians especially our young people at this very crucial time 
of the year and also at this very crucial point in the economic 
situation that faces our young people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, a number 
of members on this side of the House would dearly love to 
support this bill although we do not feel that it goes far enough 
in some areas. We are quite concerned about the affirmative 
action portion of it in which women doctoral students would be 
given grants.
<P>
	We are concerned that we are handing out privileges based on 
gender in this country and that it would be done with the 
authorization of the government.
<P>
	We are wondering why extending student loans to women as 
they are extended to everybody is not enough for those women in 
the doctoral studies programs.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are talking about equity in 
this country. I think that the member across the way should 
recognize that there are some inequities and there should be 
some opportunities to ensure that in every institution and every 
place in our society that women are there in equal numbers and 
that their skills are recognized.
<P>
	There are 15,000 male full time teachers in our system 
compared with 10,000 women. We know that the opportunities 
are not there for women. This is an opportunity provided for 
women to find themselves on the same level as men and to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4368"> 4368 </A></B>
<P>
ensure that in all of our teaching facilities there are the same 
qualifications and an equal balance of sexes in our professions.
<P>
	It is important that a role model be there. It is important that 
we give strong messages to our young people that regardless of 
their sex, opportunities are there for them. This is an 
opportunity that is being provided at this time for women who 
would like to continue their studies at the doctoral level to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to have the opportunity to follow my 
colleague and to speak on this legislation in support of this 
initiative by the government.
<P>
	I am going to make my remarks in three capacities this 
afternoon. The first capacity is as one who has benefited from 
the Canada student loans program in the past.
<P>
	The second is in the capacity of someone who represented in 
my first term as an opposition member and continues to 
represent here as a government member the countless cases of 
students and families that have run up against the deficiencies in 
the current program.
<P>
	The third is in my capacity as the chair of the human resources 
development committee which would be expected to study this 
legislation more thoroughly.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	In my first capacity, if it had not been for the student loans 
program, I would probably not have been able to pursue 
university studies through the BA, MA and PhD levels because 
my family did not have the resources. My family was not of the 
means to be able to support my entry into university.
<P>
	As the oldest of eight children in Margaree Forks, Nova 
Scotia, my father's income was barely above the poverty line. 
He did his best to provide for his family. If there had been no 
opportunity for me to receive student loans and student 
bursaries through the federal government in the early 1970s, 
chances are I would have done like many others and ended my 
education at the high school level. Happily that was not the case. 
I had the opportunity to achieve the benefits of a university 
education.
<P>
	I do not think there is anybody in this House who would 
question the importance now more than ever of young people 
having access to higher education as a means for being fully 
productive members in our society and in the Canadian 
economy.
<P>
	In my career as a member of Parliament I have represented 
many young people who have found the existing limits, the 
existing regulations and the existing red tape associated with the 
student loans program, the national requirements and in the case 
of Nova Scotia some of the provincial restrictions, make it 
absolutely imperative and urgent that something be done to 
loosen up the criterion, to expand the accessibility of the 
program and to make the kinds of changes the government is 
proposing in this legislation.
<P>
	One of the issues that provided the most work for myself and 
my constituency staff was of students in Cape Breton 
Highlands-Canso who were unable to attend university or who 
had to drop out because the amount of assistance they were able 
to receive was insufficient to allow them to go to university. 
There were those whose parents were unable to meet the 
requirements that the regulations called for in order to 
supplement what they could get through the student loans 
program. Because of various forms of red tape they did not 
receive an answer until it was too late for them to continue. They 
had to drop out of the program and very often had to go on 
unemployment or perhaps even welfare.
<P>
	Time and time again I had these situations in the last four 
years. As a result, we realized that something had to be done to 
open the loan limits. It fell on deaf ears when we brought it 
before the previous government. I am happy that the minister 
and the government are taking the initiative to review and to 
enhance the support that the Canadian government provides in 
conjunction with the various provinces to assist young people in 
pursuing higher education.
<P>
	The bill before us delivers on a commitment made by the 
government in its youth and learning strategy to improve 
student assistance to better serve the needs of present and future 
generations of students. The proposed legislation sets the stage 
for the modernization of the Canada student loans program 
which has not been fundamentally changed for 30 years. Student 
loans were frozen by the last government at 1984 levels. The 
government is increasing the loan limits for students by 57 per 
cent to reflect the growth in education costs borne by students 
over the intervening years.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	Just to give an example of those increases, in Nova Scotia 
tuition fees are among the highest in Canada. They rose 
dramatically over the period when the Conservative government 
was in power in Canada from an average in 1985-86 of $1,478 
per student to $2,415 in 1992-93.
<P>
	As a result of those increases in tuition fees and the freezing 
of student loan limits, a growing number of students were 
unable to pursue higher education. Add to that the fact that jobs 
for students were not able to keep up with the demand created a 
crisis situation and some say a lost generation among our young 
people. I certainly hope that is not the case.
<P>
	It is urgent that the government act. I believe that in 
introducing legislation such as this at this time and in 
preparation for the next school year this government is acting as 
soon as it is responsibly possible to do so to begin to address that 
urgent need.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4369"> 4369 </A></B>
<P>
	Over the next five years the value of aid for students will be $6 
billion, an increase of $2.5 billion compared with the previous 
five years. This is an addition over the next five years over what 
would have been made available to students for the financing of 
secondary education. There is opting out with compensation as 
there has been in the past to allow provinces such as Quebec to 
deal with their own programs. In addition the formula for 
compensation to Quebec and to the Northwest Territories will be 
expanded to include the new program elements which are made 
available as a result of this legislation.
<P>
	Assistance would be enhanced as a result of this legislation 
and targeted to those in need by increasing the low limits for full 
and part time students, providing special opportunity grants to 
meet with the exceptional education costs of students with 
disabilities, high need part time students and women in doctoral 
studies and establishing an objective regionally sensitive 
approach to assessing student need.
<P>
	The legislation also facilitates the transition from school to 
work which is another important requirement of our work and 
labour market environment at the present time. It does this by 
creating a national program of deferred grants to reduce the debt 
load of high need students on graduation and by expanding 
interest relief to low income borrowers.
<P>
	These are some of the features that are contained in Bill C-28. 
I am encouraged that the government has moved so quickly in 
order to introduce this legislation.
<P>
	I know that I will be asked as the chairman of the human 
resources committee, perhaps by my colleague from Lévis or 
my colleague from Medicine Hat, why this legislation is being 
introduced in advance of the government's program for social 
security reform and whether this in a sense undermines the 
social security reform process.
<P>
	To that anticipated question I would say that nothing in this 
bill precludes the broader assessment of the needs of 
post-secondary students and the dealing with these needs as part 
of an overall social security reform process. In the same way the 
changes that have been introduced in the recent budget to the 
unemployment insurance program of course do not mean that 
the unemployment insurance program is not part and parcel of 
the social security review process which is part of the exercise 
that we will be involved with as a government and as a 
committee.  An important point to bear in mind is the reason the 
legislation in a sense precedes the very important exercise of 
social security reform which the government is carrying out. 
Hopefully we will deal with the legislation in an expeditious 
fashion. If passed it would make it possible for students in the

	The House resumed, from April 13, 1994, consideration of the 
motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should immediately take 
the required measures to authorize the construction of a high-speed train (HST) 
linking the cities of Windsor and Quebec City, as well as the necessary 
infrastructure.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome the opportunity afforded by the motion 
standing in the name of the hon. member for Joliette to repeat 
what I said in this House on March 22. To emerge from its 
economic doldrums, our country needs a large-scale collective 
project, one that will generate our enthusiasm and mobilize us.
<P>
	Such a project exists. I am referring to the HST, the 
high-speed train between Quebec City and Windsor, which 
could also be run on a loop connecting Mirabel and Dorval. 
Several studies have already concluded that this project would 
be economically viable.
<P>
	A high-speed train running through a densely populated 
corridor with high ridership potential answers a need. The train, 
as other countries have already realized, is not a relic of the past. 
In its modern version, when certain distances must be covered 
and the ridership is there, it is the way of the future.
<P>
	According to a study conducted by Bombardier, HST per 
capita transportation costs will be competitive with those of 
other competing modes. Furthermore, the benefits of control 
and speed are obvious.
<P>
	I may add that the HST would be a welcome solution to the 
problem of transportation to and from Mirabel and Dorval. It 
would be necessary to add to the main line a loop where the train 
would run only at certain times. It would take 18 minutes to get 
from airport to airport, and in the airports would also be linked 
directly by rail to Quebec and Ontario.
<P>
	Another point is that trains are more environmentally friendly 
than any other means of transportation. Running at a speed of 
300 kilometres per hour, the HST uses half as much energy per 
passenger as a car and one-quarter as much as a plane. Pollution 
has a price, a financial cost which we tend to forget in our 
calculations and which  should be added when comparing 
various transportation modes with highway and air 
transportation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4371"> 4371 </A></B>
<P>
	Electrification, which is the rule in Europe, would have the 
double advantage of being environmentally acceptable, since 
there would be no emissions into the atmosphere, and of 
consuming energy that is abundant in Ontario as well as Quebec, 
a province that is trying to export surplus energy.
<P>
	And now for the burning issue of unemployment. 
Construction on the HST would create 80,000 jobs annually. In 
addition, 40,000 jobs would be created in sectors related to the 
project, plus 1,250 permanent jobs in maintenance and 
management of the network. The HST would ideally take up the 
slack and hire workers who might be laid off following the 
merger between CN and CP.
<P>
	Yes, but look at the cost! According to the proposed 
investment strategy, and if we take the average strategy of 300 
kilometres per hour, it would cost $7.1 billion in 1990 dollars. 
According to this hypothesis, during the construction period tax 
revenues would be generated totalling $1.8 billion. For the 
government, the HST is an investment rather than an 
expenditure.
<P>
	However, these advantages are better understood abroad than 
in this country. Several of the most developed countries in the 
world now have one or more HSTs in service. Canada is lagging 
behind.
<P>
	Bombardier, a domestic company, has more customers abroad 
for its railway products than it does here. In this area as in so 
many others, the government's lack of vision is overwhelming.
<P>
	Does our low population density preclude this kind of 
project? That would be a poor argument. Some of the countries 
that already have HSTs or are planning to put one into service 
are not more densely populated than the Quebec City-Windsor 
corridor.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	In this high-tech sector, we could be leaders instead of 
followers and be the first ones to develop an exportable 
expertise that could help improve our balance of payments. Yet, 
while our competition is taking action, we are examining the 
umpteenth report on the subject.
<P>
	If our governments act now, we still have a chance to find our 
opportunity window on the high speed train market. The time 
lost so far can be caught up, we are told, but we must act now.
<P>
	The late lamented Jean de La Fontaine wrote a delightful little 
story our minister of transport may find useful and inspiring to 
read every day. You guessed right, I am referring to the tale of 
``The Tortoise and the Hare''.
<P>
	In closing, Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, in their history books, will 
our children be taught that in terms of collective achievements 
commanding their admiration, the last decade of the 20th 
century was marked in their country by the so-called 
infrastructure project, that is to say a plan to fill in wholes with 
asphalt from the West coast to the East coast?
<P>
	Is our ambition limited to leaving our children-apart from a 
huge debt of course-roads with fewer wholes in them and 
sewers with fewer leaks? Certainly not. Such a vision is not 
worthy of Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	Our children-I hope and it depends on this 
government-will be able to say proudly that besides carrying 
out this infrastructure work, we, their parents, made sure, as the 
21st century drew nearer, that we remained leaders among 
innovative nations.
<P>
	So, with the HST, we will prove to them that our creative 
potential and capacity of having daring ideas is intact; in a word, 
we are not in a decline and want to provide them, to face the 
challenges of the 3rd millennium, a new building tool that 
reflects our ambitions for their future as well as our own past 
achievements.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, Motion 
No. 112 asks the federal government to authorize the 
construction of a high speed rail link between Windsor and 
Quebec City. The Bloc motion actually reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should immediately take 
the required measures to authorize the construction of a high speed train linking 
the cities of Windsor and Quebec City, as well as the necessary infrastructure.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The motion could be interpreted in a couple of different ways. 
If the motion is asking only for authorization to proceed using 
100 per cent private funding then there would be no real reason 
for us to stand in the way of construction of such a project.
<P>
	Alarm bells are ringing for me and I have a reputation to 
defend. I managed to get to third place on the list of scrooges on 
Parliament Hill, proof that I am exceptionally careful with 
taxpayers' dollars. I will have to apologize to my constituents 
for not making it to number one position, but I will try to do 
better next year.
<P>
	I have a reputation to defend, as I said, and alarm bells are 
going off all over the place in connection with the motion. I see a 
sink hole, a black hole for taxpayers' dollars into which we 
could throw billions of dollars without ever creating a 
self-sustaining transportation system between Windsor and 
Quebec City.
<P>
	If the second interpretation of the motion is that we are being 
asked to authorize taxpayers' money to be spent on this project 
then I say absolutely not. I quote from a colleague who has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4372"> 4372 </A></B>
<P>
earlier spoken to the motion: ``Considering that the political 
elites of Ottawa have not had the competence to turn an annual 
budgetary surplus since the early 1970s, I would certainly be  
surprised if any viable industry would want to enter into a 
working partnership with the federal government''.
<P>
	What then could possibly be the justification for government 
participation in a high speed rail proposal? In short the crux of 
the issue is very simple: if the rail line is a financially viable 
project then the federal government should give its full 
legislative backing to such a plan, providing there is no fiscal 
component involved. If it is not proven to be fiscally viable then 
why would the government sink any of its non-existent money 
into such a plan anyway? It certainly would be nice for us to be 
the North American pioneers of high speed rail transportation 
but if the logic is not there then neither should the taxpayers' 
money be there.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	The possibility of the public and private sector splitting the 
cost on this project has been discussed. This means the 
government would still be asked to pay nearly $3 billion toward 
something that sounds great but may not work.
<P>
	Where is the government going to get such a large amount of 
money? Not only is the availability of $3 billion in question but 
also I wonder if that amount will rise as more costs are 
discovered, either costs that were not figured into the original 
project or costs that were underestimated, as is often the case 
with government projects. While costs may rise astronomically 
there is no guarantee a profit would be made at the end of the 
project anyway.
<P>
	There is also the question of whether private industry would 
indeed want to enter a partnership with the federal government 
as I mentioned earlier. If there are huge profits to be earned then 
the private sector should tackle this project on its own.
<P>
	I am not condemning or encouraging the idea of a high speed 
rail link per se. Rather I am saying the government should not be 
involved in any way other than legislating to make the project 
possible, if legislation is indeed needed.
<P>
	I cannot justify putting $3 billion worth of taxpayers' money 
into such an uncertain project. I believe the building of such a 
railway should be left up to the private sector to finance if it 
feels the need for it.
<P>
	If there is no interest in this project from private industry then 
it must feel there is not enough financial stability in the 
investment to undertake it. If it feels the risk is too great for 
itself, it is not the place of the government to override the 
people's decision and spend their money on a project they would 
not support themselves.
<P>
	I know this is a revolutionary thought for many members on 
the government side, the thought that they would not do 
something that the people wanted them to do.
<P>
	In my riding of North Vancouver there is a private company 
which runs tourist rail traffic through the Rocky Mountains. 
This company, Rocky Mountain Rail Tours, is in its fifth season 
and receives absolutely no taxpayer subsidies. It creates a 
significant number of private sector jobs and has generated 
more than $5 million in taxes for all levels of government. 
While there were losses for the first five years of operation the 
company stuck it out and made a six-figure profit in 1993.
<P>
	That is evidence that such a system can be built and run 
without government interference. The only threat to this 
company at present is the possibility of a government run 
railway receiving extraordinary amounts in subsidies as its 
competition.
<P>
	Though it took a few years to get off the ground, Rocky 
Mountain Rail Tours is now doing very well and the company is 
forecasting more and more passenger traffic all the time. As I 
mentioned, the only threat that exists right now is the possibility 
that cabinet may authorize VIA Rail to begin running again on 
those same tracks.
<P>
	Even if the government had wads of money spilling out of its 
treasury, which it certainly does not, there would be no logical 
sense in undertaking a high speed rail link between Windsor and 
Quebec City at this time. That is because one-third of the track 
would be located in Quebec and as long as the separatist threat 
continues to loom over the economic and political well-being of 
the country there is no point in proceeding with such a project.
<P>
	I want to retain at least number three position on the <I>Hill 
Times</I> list of Scrooges on Parliament Hill, so I cannot risk 
supporting this motion that is on the table from the Bloc.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, support for the high speed train connection in the 
Quebec-Windsor corridor has been received from people who 
held very different views, people like Mr. Marc Lefrançois, 
president of VIA Rail who said: ``In terms of plans that stir 
people into action, it is difficult to find a better one''. It also 
promotes the expertise of a company like Bombardier which is a 
domestic company and holds rights to the technology required 
to carry out this project.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	The HST project also received support from the Young 
Liberal Federation in Quebec who, while not being known as 
sovereigntists nonetheless saw in this project an opportunity to 
stimulate job creation for  young people, whether engineers and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4373"> 4373 </A></B>
<P>
technicians or linemen. In other words, this is a job-creation 
project.
<P>
	At Bombardier, they are not a bunch of incompetent people. 
They are the ones who manufactured in La Pocatière, in my 
riding, the railway cars now in service in the tunnel across the 
Channel between England and France, two sovereign nations 
that nonetheless saw fit to be linked by such a means of 
communication. The British did not refuse to contribute because 
the French were going to benefit from the tunnel. They asked 
themselves: ``Will we benefit from this?'' And came to the 
conclusion that they would.
<P>
	I think that, whatever the constitutional context, Quebec and 
Canada stand to benefit from developing this link, particularly 
since it would be the first of the sort in North America and the 
technology could be applied in 19 other sites over the continent. 
You go nowhere with a rule like: no government money shall be 
invested in this project; we must wait for the private sector to 
take on the project. If that rule had been applied strictly, we 
would still ride on gravel roads and we would not have the 
transportation network we enjoy today.
<P>
	I think we must have a modern-day attitude and the HST is 
definitely modern. In fact, it is the most environmentally 
friendly mode of transportation of all. It is a lot less polluting 
than cars or planes.
<P>
	The question we have to ask ourselves is this: is it going to be 
cost-effective to build a high-speed train in the Quebec 
City-Windsor corridor? In fact, as Mr. Rémy Bujolt, chairman 
of the GPC Consortium and consultant for VIA Rail on this 
matter, was saying: ``To succeed, we will have to attract as many 
passengers as possible; if not this project will become a money 
pit. For this project to be cost-effective, the high-speed train 
must capture 40 per cent of the market between Montreal and 
Toronto compared to 13 per cent today''.
<P>
	But the answer to this question is in the efficiency of the 
high-speed train. This train would link Quebec City and 
Montreal in 85 minutes; Montreal and Ottawa in 45 minutes and 
Montreal and Toronto in 140 minutes, at 50 per cent of the cost 
of a plane ticket. It would also serve Quebec City, 
Trois-Rivières, Montreal, Ottawa, Kingston, Belleville, 
Toronto, London and Windsor.
<P>
	Do you not think that with such a fare, the HST will easily 
replace many air carriers? That probably explains in part why 
the project is stalling so inexplicably. Is the airline lobby 
holding up the project? With all the support it received, there is 
no reason why anyone should oppose it.
<P>
	I discovered this afternoon there might be a new reason: it 
might be the fear of displeasing the Reform Party because they 
see no advantage in that project since it encourages development 
on a north to south axis in North America; that in itself is not a 
bad thing and there would certainly be similar projects to be 
developed in the west.
<P>
	We believe the HST project is highly mobilizing and job 
creating since it would generate 80,000 direct jobs and 120,000 
indirect ones. Compared to other projects, it would be much 
cheaper because of the taxes that governments would collect on 
the income of a whole generation that would be put to work. 
Right now in Quebec, there are 4,000 engineers without work. 
Don't you think that such a project would be welcomed by those 
people who are looking for jobs, who studied at university and 
who have nothing because no interesting development project is 
proposed to them.
<P>
	Therefore, the high-speed train project appears to be an 
interesting way of developing the economy of the 
Quebec-Windsor corridor, but it is also very interesting for the 
Bombardier company. For instance, in La Pocatière, in my 
riding, Bombardier has a plant that built the cars used to cross 
the English Channel and those of the New York subway. The 
economic cycle in that plant is often the reverse of the cycle of 
the whole economy. While the economy is taking off again, 
employment declines in the plant. Conversely, in an economic 
downturn, more jobs are created at the plant.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	Such a project could perhaps balance production and increase 
employability to ensure that the region does not experience ups 
and downs like going from 1,000 to 250 or 300 jobs. Such a 
project could stabilize job creation in the region and ensure that 
expertise stays where it is.
<P>
	Now, every time the economic cycle hurts our businesses, 
technicians and engineers go elsewhere. They must move on to 
other jobs, so that our businesses lose this expertise and have to 
start from scratch every time.
<P>
	A project such as the high-speed train would create jobs to put 
young people to work and help build a corridor between Quebec 
City and Windsor which, in the end, would benefit all elements 
of society between Quebec and Ontario and towards the United 
States. And, if the decision is made quickly enough in case 
Quebec City is chosen to host the 2002 Winter Olympics, it 
would certainly be a very interesting means of transportation for 
which we would have planned in time, for once.
<P>
	I think we have all the elements we need to succeed. I was a 
little disappointed when the Prime Minister, replying in jest to a 
question from the Leader of the Opposition, asked whether the 
high-speed train should be stopped at the border between 
Quebec and Ontario. I think that it is much more important than 
that and that it deserves serious answers dealing with the 
substantive issue.
<P>
	Studies have already been carried out. What is needed now is 
the political courage to go ahead with the project. The economic 
conditions are such that we are sure the high-speed train is not 
another Hibernia project. If we could take the money that 
Quebec has thrown away with Hibernia and stop the Hibernia 
project and put that money into the high-speed train, we could 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4374"> 4374 </A></B>
<P>
contribute  Quebec's share directly to this project and maximize 
job creation in doing the work.
<P>
	Creating a new rail line creates jobs that will make good use 
of skilled workers and line workers, namely people with 
high-school education who can do all kinds of support work to 
install the line; at the same time, it takes technological expertise 
that would surely make Quebec and Canada leaders in this field.
<P>
	We can bet that in 15 or 20 years, there will be maybe 10 or 15 
high-speed rail lines in North America. Then we will know if we 
have missed the train or if we seized our opportunity to be 
leaders in such projects and to make Canada and Quebec experts 
in developing this kind of transportation link which is what we 
need in a continent like North America.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, this debate 
has been quite interesting. I suppose many of us come to this

<P>
	I listened to the first speaker from the Bloc. He was talking 
about combating uncertainty with this project. With a wide open 
cheque book and having absolutely no idea how many cheques 
we are going to have to write, to say that this would be a project 
which would combat uncertainty is probably 180 degrees from 
the reality. I do not see this project as being a solution to 
combating uncertainty whatsoever.
<P>
	The member spoke of it in terms of economic viability. As my 
colleague from North Vancouver has said, if it truly is 
economically viable why is private industry not stepping up to 
bat? Why are they not the people who are asking for the okay 
from the people of Canada?
<P>
<B>(1830 ) </B>
<P>
	In doing a little research for this I came across a presentation 
made in writing from the TGV Canada consortium which is led 
by Bombardier and GEC Alsthom. They are the people who are 
attempting to pull this together, at least the concept, for 
Canadians to buy into. It sounds absolutely terrific.
<P>
	On page 17 of their report they say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The TGV is the job creation project for the 1990s. For the construction phase 
alone, TGV Canada will provide a major boost to job creation in all parts of 
Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	They go on about the fact that we are going to have 
engineering, construction equipment, construction, cement and 
concrete products, metal products, steel rails, structural steel, 
transportation equipment, rolling stock, electrical and 
electronic industries, signalling and communications. It goes on 
and on. It just sounds wonderful.
<P>
	Who is going to pay for it? Who is going to pay for all of these 
wonderful things in this project?
<P>
	One of the other members in his speech mentioned the 
channel tunnel. To the best of my knowledge, according to the 
information I have received, the tunnel underneath the English 
Channel will never be paid for. It will never pay for itself 
because it went double its budget.
<P>
	I suggest with the greatest of respect to our friends in the civil 
service that because there is not a profit motive involved in the 
kind of work they do, without that discipline that is exactly what 
would happen on this project.
<P>
	In additional research, I took a look at what the member for 
Québec-Est said in <I>Hansard</I> on December 11, 1991, March 12, 
1992, March 19, 1992, and what the member for Drummond said 
on March 20, 1992. It goes on and on. This project has been a 
favourite of people from that area and I can understand why.
<P>
	If we had any experience where private enterprise had come in 
and done something like this on a massive scale without 
government support, without getting their hands in the pockets 
of ordinary Canadians, certainly the majority of people in this 
Chamber would be in favour of it.
<P>
	I see a statement under Standing Order 31 on March 20, 1992 
by the former member for Drummond where it states in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In addition to the many industrial benefits, the socioeconomic advantages, 
and the potential for exports, setting up a high-speed railway line could very 
well make Canada a centre of excellence for high-speed railway transportation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He goes on:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, building a high-speed line at an estimated cost of $5 billion to 
$8 billion-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That seems to me not necessarily knowing what a million is. 
With a billion being a thousand of those and the spread being 
between $5 billion to $8 billion, well it is only taxpayers' 
money.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-will represent the biggest private investment this country has ever known. 
This genuine revolution in transportation could generate the construction of 23 
corridors in North America, with economic spin-offs and investments totalling 
$200 billion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That scares me a lot. It really scares me when we have people 
like myself, not an engineer, not a financier-I would suspect 
that the former member was probably like myself, not 
necessarily even understanding what $1 billion is-throwing 
out figures, saying it will cost $5 billion or it will cost $8 billion 
and it will spin off $200 billion. These are not crackers we are 
throwing out. These are billions and billions of Canadian 
taxpayers' dollars.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4375"> 4375 </A></B>
<P>
	We have so many unknowns with it as well. We have not tried 
a smaller high speed line as a test. We do not know it will operate 
in our climate, in our specific situation. I have travelled by 
railway in Switzerland with its concrete ties and the whole 
business and while I know that much of its climate is like ours, 
we have not done a small enough test in Canada to even know if 
we have the technology and the technological ability to be able 
to do this at this point.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	With the first speaker this afternoon talking about leaving the 
people of Canada something, I suggest with the greatest respect 
that what we would be leaving them would be a sinkhole of 
public debt. That is what we would be leaving them with in this 
project. The timing is wrong.
<P>
	I would further suggest, again with the greatest respect, that if 
we really want to combat uncertainty, we have to get down to the 
business of working out a united Canada. We need to get away 
from this business of blowing this country up and separating it 
and pulling it apart. If we want real certainty in Canada, we have 
to focus on solving problems together. That is what is going to 
make Canada great, not some mythical fantasy land high speed 
rail line between Windsor and Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to participate in this debate initiated by the hon. 
member for Joliette, whom I want to congratulate for raising 
what is, and will be, a major issue for Quebec. I am very 
enthusiastic about this project, and this for two reasons. First, 
because of its technical nature and, second, because of the 
regional development which might result from it.
<P>
	As regards the technical aspect, I want to go back briefly to 
the election campaign, when members opposite put forward the 
idea of cancelling the helicopter building project. At that time, 
the Liberals received the support of the Bloc Quebecois on the 
condition that the cancellation of this contract be compensated, 
in terms of the financial and human resources involved, by the 
implementation of another major project. At the time, the 
current opposition leader had already suggested that this major 
project be the construction of a high-speed train line which, 
given its magnitude, could replace the helicopter project, in 
terms of the budgets involved and the skilled manpower 
required.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the government only remembered the first part 
of the Bloc's position and simply cancelled the helicopter 
project without providing any alternative. This is a tragic 
decision, considering that this whole issue is related to the 
industrial conversion or, rather, the lack of industrial conversion 
which, in the last five years, has resulted in the loss of 11,000 
high-tech jobs in Quebec alone.
<P>
	In that context, the high-speed train project would, given its 
technical nature, give a real boost to the economy of Quebec and 
Canada.
<P>
	In terms of regional development, the magnitude of the 
project makes it very appealing for all the regions along the 
Quebec-Windsor corridor. Indeed, because of its magnitude, the 
project, which would involve costs of $8.5 billion, would also 
create 127,000 jobs for ten years. Considering all the claims 
made by the members opposite and their slogan about jobs, jobs 
and jobs, and considering that they have so far only proposed 
infrastructure projects, they should seize this opportunity, 
especially since they already know that the opposition will 
support the creation of real jobs which will have a real impact, 
unlike a lot of the jobs related to the infrastructure program, 
which merely maintain employment levels or are only 
temporary in nature.
<P>
	Especially since 70 per cent of the project would be privately 
financed, with only 30 per cent being funded by three 
governments for a total of roughly $2.5 billion. According to all 
projections, 50 per cent of this amount would be recovered as 
soon as the construction was completed, with $1.8 billion in 
spin-offs and fiscal revenues generated during the actual 
construction.
<P>
	So, we are talking about very important regional spin-offs, 
economically as well as socially. It is estimated that the French 
city of Lille has enjoyed $1 billion in regional spin-offs from 
hotels, office towers, convention centres, restaurants, and so 
forth.
<P>
	One must also realize that such a project targets a potential 
North American market which could be worth $200 billion over 
the next twenty years.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	We must, therefore, act quickly because the Americans are 
poised to jump into the fray. In the United States, 18 to 20 high 
speed train projects are now being considered and should 
become a reality. This shows how important it is for Canada and 
Quebec to position themselves to carry out this project without 
delay, relying on the help of our small and medium-sized 
businesses, each of which will develop a certain expertise. This 
expertise can, in turn, be subsequently exported, if we act 
quickly.
<P>
	As the member for Trois-Rivières, I have a special interest in 
this project, not only because I hope it will get the go ahead, but 
also because I hope that it will extend to the Saint-Lawrence 
North Shore and that a station will be built in my riding, the city 
of Trois-Rivières, which also happens to be the regional capital 
of the Mauricie area.
<P>
	The Mauricie region has a population of 300,000 and extends 
from La Tuque in the north to Bécancour and Nicolet in the 
south. It is comprised of a number of relatively well-known 
municipalities such as La Tuque, Saint-Tite, Shawinigan, 
Grand-Mère, Shawinigan-South, Cap-de-la-Madeleine, 
Trois-Rivières-West and Louiseville in the west and 
Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade in the east. Right in the middle is 
the city of Trois-Rivières, the  regional capital, where you will 
find a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4376"> 4376 </A></B>
<P>
rather flourishing university and many cegeps and private 
schools, as well as important companies, multinational and 
national corporations, like Kruger, Tripap which was just 
launched by the Fonds de solidarité, Reynolds in 
Cap-de-la-Madeleine, Alcan in Shawinigan, Belgo in 
Shawinigan, the Cartonneries Saint-Laurent, the former PFCP 
in La Tuque, the Aluminerie of Bécancour in Bécancour, Norsk 
Hydro, SKW, CIL and Didier, the last few are all companies 
based in the Bécancour industrial park, which need an efficient 
and adequate transportation system to grow.
<P>
	In fact, one could claim that some measures have already been 
taken and that, consequently, we need to go ahead with the 
high-speed train project. For example, the train no longer stops 
in Trois-Rivières. The former government, in its wisdom, 
decided to eliminate the Montreal-Quebec City run on the North 
Shore. Despite this decision, however, $2 million was spent on 
the intermodal terminal in Trois-Rivières. The bridge which had 
collapsed at Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade was rebuilt at a cost of 
$7 million and the Gare du Palais in Quebec City was 
refurbished at a cost of $60 million. All of this work would 
facilitate the eventual development of a high speed train.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to request the co-operation of 
all stakeholders in my region. I want them to know that they can 
count on my support and, I am confident, the support of all my 
colleagues from the Mauricie region. I hope that the mayors and 
all the associations and lobby groups seize this opportunity and 
realize the importance of this project and its potential impact on 
Trois-Rivières. I hope that all of our region joins in so that if 
ever the HST becomes a reality, it stops in Trois-Rivières.
<P>
	The HST must become a reality. When the opposition 
discusses the project, it deals in facts. Already, the mayors of all 
of the principal cities involved have held a meeting. We have 
here before us the former mayor of Toronto, now the President 
of the Treasury Board, who co-signed an important brief which 
was submitted to the government. We have the former mayor of 
Quebec City, a close friend of the Prime Minister and his chief 
of staff, who also co-signed the brief along with the mayors of 
the four other cities involved.
<P>
	The HST project must come to fruition. All stakeholders 
directly concerned are unanimous on this point. Moreover, in 
the opinion of the chairman of the board of directors of VIA Rail 
who has been studying this matter for the past ten years, this is 
not an improvised project. In my view, the federal government 
would not have to make any new outlays of money and would 
only need to maintain the subsidy currently paid every year to 
VIA Rail for the upkeep of the Quebec City-Windsor corridor. It 
would not have to come up with any new money and would only 
have to continue providing the subsidy for 25 years. Therefore, 
no additional financial  effort would be required on the part of 
the federal government.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	Another reality mentioned by the chairman of VIA Rail is the 
fact that the rolling stock used on this section will have to be 
renewed over the next ten years. This will carry a tremendous 
cost and, rather than changing for equipment already obsolete, 
why not embark on a modern project which would fulfil the new 
needs of our societies.
<P>
	There are other advantages to such a program that I should not 
forget to mention. There is naturally the improvement of 
passenger rail service as such, then there are reductions in air 
pollution, in road traffic, in airport congestion, and there is 
finally, as I already said, the promotion of regional development 
all along the corridor, whether it is in manufacturing or trade.
<P>
	To conclude, I only wish that like France, Germany, Italy, 
Spain, Japan and shortly Korea and Great Britain, we had a HST 
between Quebec City and Windsor which would use the North 
shore and stop in Trois-Rivières. This project would be a joint 
venture between the governments of Canada, Ontario and 
Quebec, notwithstanding the comment by my colleague from 
the Reform Party who said that, given the risk that Quebec might 
become sovereign, we should perhaps delay or rethink such a 
project.
<P>
	I do not think that such words are worthy of a chamber like 
this one, given the attitude of the Official Opposition with 
regard to the bridge to Prince Edward Island, which the Bloc 
approved right away; or given the money that Quebec 
contributes to a project like Hibernia, as mentioned by my 
colleague from Témiscouata. I also doubt the appropriateness of 
remarks like the one made by the Prime Minister when he said 
there would be a border between Quebec and Ontario. We told 
him in the House that there is no border when we go from 
Montreal to New York with Amtrak, so why should there be one 
between Quebec City and Windsor. We should not fall for that 
kind of argument. This project is so important, so promising, 
that only public interest should be taken into consideration.

<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="VIARAIL">VIA RAIL</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
follow up on a question I asked of the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Transport a few weeks ago regarding, of all 
things, the future of passenger rail in Canada and particularly 
along the Windsor to Quebec corridor.
<P>
	The people in my riding spoke out very vociferously against 
the cuts in 1990. Now they find themselves in a position in 
which their limited but very important passenger rail service is 
yet again in jeopardy.
<P>
	Just by way of interest, the other day I was down on the 
platform in Brantford and saw 40 men and women prepared to 
board the train to Toronto and points eastward. There were men 
and women on their way to work in the city of Toronto and young 
adults on their way to university in Toronto. Seniors find the 
train service very accommodating and easy to access, and there 
were two going into the city to visit with medical specialists, 
friends and neighbours, and to go to the theatre. As well there 
were two families that had been visiting in southwestern Ontario 
and were on their way home to Quebec City.
<P>
	As the parliamentary secretary knows, the line that runs 
between London and Brantford and goes on to Toronto is the 
least subsidized of all the VIA lines. I cannot see that it would 
make any sense to further cut the service along that section of 
the corridor.
<P>
	Beyond that I would like to say I have listened to the 
parliamentary secretary and the minister talk about how they 
view VIA's initiatives in terms of managing continued federal 
government funding cuts, that they will be looking at 
managerial restructuring and efficiencies, that they will be 
working to upgrade, modify and update their very outdated 
labour contracts, and finally that they will be rationalizing 
unused infrastructure.
<P>
	I would say to the government that it must insist VIA is 
successful in all three of these approaches. Beyond that I would 
like to suggest and believe that the government should prepare a 
comprehensive multimodal transportation strategy for Canada 
that would include an individual comprehensive mandate for 
VIA setting out its mission, its roles, its goals and the 
expectations by which its success can be measured.
<P>
	I think in that mandate it will become clear to us that in places 
like southwestern Ontario the VIA infrastructure is most 
commonly used as a commuter service. I am not sure that I as a 
member from southwestern Ontario feel comfortable asking the 
rest of Canada to support that specific use of the infrastructure, 
just as I expect those in Alberta are necessarily anxious to ask 
those of us in Ontario and further east to support the VIA service 
to help them build their tourist industry.
<P>
	While we as a national government should continue to support 
this very important passenger rail infrastructure, we should also 
encourage VIA to work very closely with our provincial 
counterparts to ensure that the use of the infrastructure is 
effective and very useful to the particular region in mind.
<P>
	These are important things our government could do. In fact 
debate should be held in the House of Commons and a loud and 
clear direction should be given to VIA to be again a successful 
and useful mode of passenger rail transportation in the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want first to congratulate the 
member for Brant on her hard work in promoting the needs of 
her area, especially the transportation needs of the people of the 
riding of Brant and elsewhere.
<P>
	I can also say that we share a common vision with regard to 
the role that passenger rail service should play in the country. 
Some of the suggestions she put forward are obviously ones that 
the government and the minister are considering.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4378"> 4378 </A></B>
<P>
	I should point out, though, with respect to her specific 
question that it is premature for the government to look at 
specific service cutbacks or service routes at this time. I believe 
the member alluded to the fact that VIA is currently conducting 
some negotiations with its workforce. Those negotiations 
hopefully will be fruitful so that in fact VIA can meets its fiscal 
requirements as mandated by the government and essentially be 
able to maintain a viable passenger rail network across the 
country.
<P>
<B>(1855 ) </B>
<P>
	I should also point out that not only are the workers part of the 
solution. We have always said in the House that passengers must 
be part of the solution. As well as other interested parties, 
municipalities and provincial governments, passengers need to 
be part of the solution for a new invigorated VIA.
<P>
	People have to use trains. People talk about the value of 
trains. They want high speed trains. They want to use train 
services. The reality is that they jump in their cars usually by 
themselves and travel from point <I>a</I> to point <I>b</I>. We have to do 
much more to encourage people to use this mode of 
transportation. That is very fundamental.
<P>
	Let me point out to members that there is a unique opportunity 
for all parties to work together toward a solution, including the 
municipalities and provinces, as they have between Brantford 
and Toronto. They have helped subsidize that particular route. 
That is an opportunity for everyone to work together to ensure 
that we can maintain a passenger rail service in the country.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INTEGRATIONOFIMMIGRANTS">INTEGRATION OF IMMIGRANTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, following my 
comments of April 14 last, in this House, regarding certain 
allegations made by the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration concerning COFIs, centres for the integration of 
immigrants into the French community, may I remind the 
minister that the fact that the federal government reinvests 
taxpayers' money in these centres does not give it the right to 
interfere with Quebec's rights.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, the jurisdictional limits of both levels of 
government were defined in the federal-provincial agreement 
known as the Cullen-Couture agreement, which was signed in 
1978, and later broadened and confirmed by the 
MacDougall-Gagnon-Tremblay agreement. The terms of the 
agreement are very clear. They give Quebec total jurisdiction 
over immigrant services and social integration of immigrants 
through the COFIs.
<P>
	Fortunately, the Quebec Minister of International Relations 
and Cultural Communities, Mr. Ciaccia, called his federal 
counterpart to order and suggested that he should mind his own 
business, just as the Bloc Quebecois did in this House.
<P>
	The statement by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
criticizing the lack of enthusiasm shown by the COFIs in 
presenting the Canadian reality is indeed a case of unacceptable 
meddling in Quebec affairs.
<P>
	I would remind the minister that it is not for nothing that 
Quebec has been demanding, and finally got, some powers 
regarding immigration. In fact, the repatriation of every power 
in this area amounts to nothing less for the Quebec society than 
its own survival and the preservation of the French language on 
its territory. The integration of newcomers into the French 
community has always been essential to our survival as a nation.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to congratulate COFI instructors for 
their excellent work in making refugees and immigrants feel 
welcomed and in helping them get integrated into our society.
<P>
	I would point out to the minister that COFIs are not supposed 
to give immigrants courses on federalism, but rather to give 
them basic instruments which will help them cope with their 
new environment, that is Quebec and especially Montreal, 
where over 80 per cent of the immigrants are found.
<P>
	Lessons on day to day living informs newcomers about 
front-line services such as transport, housing, welfare, health 
insurance or education. As you can see, all those services are 
under Quebec's jurisdiction.
<P>
	The minister should know that out of approximately 45,000 
immigrants to Quebec, only a small fraction can take advantage 
of the COFIs' integration services. A large majority of them 
must manage by themselves to find information and adapt to 
their new environment.
<P>
	As we can see, the situation is far from reflecting the 
minister's description. Instead of asking COFIs to praise 
Canadian federalism, the minister should give them the 
financial means to offer all newcomers the services they need 
for harmonious integration into our society.
<P>
<B>(1900 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration has already stated unequivocally 
on the floor of this House that there is no disagreement between 
himself and his colleague from the province of Quebec 
vis-à-vis their respective roles in helping new immigrants 
successfully integrate.
<P>
	Settlement programs and services in every province in this 
country help newcomers access services in their new 
community and participate in local life. Much of the 
information provided relates quite specifically to the 
communities and province in which the immigrants live.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4379"> 4379 </A></B>
<P>
	For immigrants destined to the province of Quebec the 
Canada-Quebec accord recognizes Quebec's exclusive 
responsibility for settlement and integration services for which 
there is federal compensation.
<P>
	Not only is there no problem but the federal government 
appreciates that understanding and appreciation of Quebec 
culture and society is vital in helping immigrants in Quebec 
adapt to their new surroundings.
<P>
	The minister has told his Quebec counterpart and stated in this 
House that he thinks that Quebec has a first rate settlement 
program for its immigrants.
<P>
	Conversely, the Quebec government understands the role of 
the federal government in promoting awareness of Canada. In its 
responsibility for citizenship, the minister is committed to 
promoting what he has called a strong, exciting patriotism and 
love of Canada. This is the essence of the citizenship review that 
he recently announced.
<P>
	Immigrants throughout Canada have the opportunity to seek 
Canadian citizenship. It is the mandate of this ministry to 
provide information and assistance to Canadians seeking 
information about citizenship and particularly to immigrants 
preparing for citizenship.
<P>
	I am pleased to report that the federal-provincial committee 
responsible for the Canada-Quebec accord met on April 29. It 
considered the questions raised in the media about the 
integration of immigrants in Quebec. At this meeting Quebec 
representatives tabled a copy of their linguistic integration 
program highlighting that its purpose is to provide immigrants 
with the basic tools necessary for integration into Quebec 
society.
<P>
	The Quebec program is not designed as an introduction to 
citizenship, the latter being a federal responsibility.
<P>
	On April 14 the minister announced his plans to develop a new 
Citizenship Act for a renewed and reinvigorated citizenship for 
all Canadians. The Canada-Quebec accord clearly gives the 
Government of Canada sole authority in citizenship matters.
<P>
	Most eligible immigrants apply for and receive Canadian 
citizenship. Any measure to promote citizenship will of course 
address their needs as well. Members of the federal-provincial 
committee or comité mixte exchange information as required. 
That is its mandate and the minister believes in letting the 
committee carry out its mandate.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HANDGUNS">HANDGUNS</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on April 27, I put a question to the Minister of Justice 
asking him what action he would take to ban handguns as a result 
of a meeting he had earlier that week with a group which made 
that proposal to him. The group in question consisted of 
representatives from Concordia University, the Canadian Safety 
Council, the  Canadian Bar Association, the Ottawa chief of 
police and others.
<P>
	In answer to my question the minister said that the 
government is committed toward more effective gun control, 
but he was not able to give me much detail at that time in his 
answer. As a result I am putting the question once again today.
<P>
	Since that time several important things have happened. We 
have had two drive-by shootings in this area recently, one by a 
group of minors who were able to obtain weapons, guns and 
ammunition illegally and without much difficulty.
<P>
	The second happening was a very important resolution passed 
by the Liberal convention here in Ottawa just a few weeks ago. 
In that resolution which was passed by an overwhelming 
majority of the convention delegates, among other things they 
asked that the private possession and ownership of handguns be 
severely restricted.
<P>
	As many have pointed out and as I have pointed out in this 
House before, handguns are not used for hunting. They have no 
legitimate purpose with private individuals and therefore should 
be banned or at least severely restricted. They are now restricted 
weapons but they are still available too loosely and much can be 
done to tighten that up.
<P>
	Among the other subclauses of that resolution is one which 
would ban the sale and ownership of ammunition to those under 
18 years of age. The sale of such ammunition would only be 
made to adults if they were in possession of the appropriate 
documentation.
<P>
<B>(1905 ) </B>
<P>
	For years I have been proposing that no one should be 
permitted to buy ammunition unless they present the firearms 
acquisition certificate. In this way all those who want to use 
and/or own weapons would have to get a firearms acquisition 
certificate because in order to shoot the gun and to be effective 
in one's shooting of the gun, one needs both the gun and the 
ammunition.
<P>
	If we can put more obstacles in the way of those who want to 
use weapons in a criminal way or illegally, the better off we are 
and the better chance we have of reducing crime with guns. To 
oblige people to have a firearms acquisition certificate or other 
appropriate documentation, as the resolution points out, the 
better chance we have of preventing incidents such as happened 
in Ottawa and other incidents across the country where people 
have committed crimes with guns.
<P>
	I repeat over and over again that there is considerable 
evidence from Canada and around the world that where guns are 
less available and where ammunition is less available there are 
fewer crimes with guns. That is an absolute fact that has been 
shown over and over again.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4380"> 4380 </A></B>
<P>
	Once again I want to thank the Minister of Justice for his 
answer to me and also the response of the Prime Minister 
following the convention. If the parliamentary secretary could 
give us more details with respect to this important matter, we 
would appreciate it very much.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Justice recently indicated in this House 
that the government is committed to enacting more effective gun 
control legislation.
<P>
	He has said that the government is looking at all of its options 
and that it will be introducing measures in this House in due 
course.
<P>
	I speak for many members of this House when I say that I am 
concerned about the levels of violent crime in this country. 
Canadians are afraid of violence and they want their government 
to take strong measures not only to stem the growth of violence 
but also to reduce it. They are afraid that values in other 
countries where citizens are allowed easy access to firearms will 
take root in Canada.
<P>
	The minister has indicated that the government is considering 
its options, one of those being more controls on handguns. There 
may be some legitimate use for handguns but in my view these 
should be the exception and not the rule. They should be 
carefully screened and under close control. Handguns are the 
most useful type of firearm for many common offences.
<P>
	In the United States where they are not under the type of 
restrictions found in Canada, they are the most commonly used 
firearms in crimes such as armed robbery and homicide. In 
Canada, they are already under strict controls and criminal 
misuse is less common but it is increasing.
<P>
	In previous years handgun homicides represented about 
one-third of all homicides from firearms. In the last year or two 
this has risen to about one-half of all firearms homicides. Under 
the circumstances, complete prohibition of handguns must be an 
option. If this does not prove feasible, then the government 
should act to make sure that only those who actually require 
handguns are allowed to possess them and that strict and 
effective controls are in place for those who do possess them.
<P>
	The minister said that he is looking at these options. I am 
confident that these options include measures to respond to 
concerns about handguns. As the hon. member well 
understands, the subject of gun control has a long and 
contentious history in this House. When the government brings 
forward its proposals I am sure that they will receive close 
scrutiny. I am sure that this House will respond to the calls of 
Canadians for strict and effective gun control and that the 
response will also be a response to the concerns raised by the 
hon. member.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCE">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, on March 
24, I asked the Minister of Human Resources Development the 
following question: ``How can the Minister argue that his 
government's priority is job creation, when its only strategy is 
an attack on 85 per cent of the unemployed, and moreover in the 
poorest provinces?''
<P>
	I could ask this question to the minister because I had just 
received the information that unemployment insurance cuts for 
1994-95 and 1995-96 would amount to $735 million a year in 
Quebec and $630 million in each of these years in the Atlantic 
provinces. This adds up to $1.365 billion in cuts for Quebec and 
the Atlantic provinces together, where some 30 per cent of the 
Canadian population lives.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	Before the minister made these changes to unemployment 
insurance that will be submitted to Parliament, was he 
concerned about the economic impact of these cuts? I am talking 
about the economic impact because claimants will receive less, 
because they will not have access to unemployment insurance, 
because they will not have accumulated as many weeks of work, 
because benefits will be lower. This reduction means less money 
circulating in Quebec and in the Atlantic provinces, money that 
would pay rent and buy groceries and other necessities.
<P>
	When governments have laws like the Unemployment 
Insurance Act to give money to workers who lose their jobs, this 
money is immediately put in the economy. It is not used to buy 
luxury goods and it is not used to accumulate wealth or to 
speculate either. It is money that goes into the local 
communities and all these communities, whether they are in my 
riding or in the Lower St. Lawrence or in small villages in the 
Atlantic provinces, will be directly affected because there will 
be less money in circulation.
<P>
	Has the minister thought of the additional burden he is 
imposing on the provinces because social assistance will be 
greatly affected? Employment and Immigration published 
figures showing that increased welfare caseloads are expected. 
For example, it predicts 14,500 new applications from people 
who run out of UI benefits and 4,400 from people not entitled to 
UI.
<P>
	In Quebec alone, the minister predicted-and we can consider 
these figures to be conservative as well-that 14,500 more 
households would be on welfare at a cost of $127 million for 
next year; I repeat, these figures are conservative. So I repeat my 
question: How can the minister claim that he is working on job 
creation when, before helping people, he cuts what they need to 
eat, to live and to hang on?
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in terms of actual money transferred, Quebec and 
Atlantic Canada will still be better off than the rest of Canada. 
Taking into account the changes introduced on February 21, the 
Atlantic provinces as a whole will receive $970 in 
unemployment insurance per capita and Quebec $730 per capita 
compared with $575 per capita for all of Canada.
<P>
	Historically Quebec and Atlantic Canada have each received 
more in benefits than they paid in premiums. On average each 
receives about $1 billion annually in transfers from Ontario and 
the western provinces.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The changes that we proposed to the unemployment insurance 
plan aim at putting people back to work. Small businesses asked 
us to give them a break and reduce unemployment insurance 
premiums so as to be able to create jobs for Canadians. This is 
what we did.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The unemployment insurance changes cannot be seen in 
isolation. They represent a first but interim step in giving 
Canadians a sense of new direction.
<P>
	If in the redesigning of the social security system we find that 
different changes are needed, we will make them. There is no 
doubt that the proposed measures will impact on some 
unemployment insurance claimants. That is unavoidable. We 
have tried to make the changes in a manner that is fair and 
protects those with the greatest needs.
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Unlike the previous government, we made sure that the 
changes took into account the needs of the poorest of the poor.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As we begin the shift from our current set of programs to 
something more comprehensive, we have decided to reintroduce 
a principle into unemployment insurance that was part of it for 
30 years. That is we have decided to look at the needs of 
individuals with low incomes and with dependants and to 
provide more adequate coverage for these Canadians. These 
individuals will receive a 60 per cent benefit rate. Others will 
receive 55 per cent.
<P>
	With the provinces and the territories we will initiate new 
programs targeted at the most chronically unemployed 
Canadians. We have dedicated $800 million over the next two 
years for these strategic initiatives to test out new approaches to 
social security.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INTERGOVERNMENTALAFFAIRS">INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
directed to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and again 
concerns the referendum on the defunct Charlottetown Accord. 
In 1992, this referendum cost Canada the modest sum of $145 
million. The federal government paid $105 million, while 
Quebec paid $40 million under its election legislation. Need I 
recall that this means Quebec spent more than its share? In 
addition to the $40 million, Quebec spent one-quarter of the 
federal expenditures, or $26 million. So altogether, Quebec 
spent over $66 million, far more than any other province.
<P>
	Quebec is therefore entitled to put in a claim to the federal 
government for reimbursement of these $26 million, its 
Canadian share, since it had already spent its provincial share.
<P>
	As I pointed out in the House on May 4 this year, no payments 
have been made by the federal government to the Quebec 
government so far. However, the issue has been raised several 
times by the Government of Quebec, the Bloc québécois and the 
Parti québécois. Personally, I asked the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs of Canada for some explanations on 
May 4. I repeat, in terms of dealing with the issue, the evasive 
response of the minister was certainly not satisfactory.
<P>
	The behaviour of the federal government certainly defies all 
logic. Barely a week before the federal election, on October 19, 
1993, in response to a question by the Leader of the Opposition 
in the National Assembly, the former minister responsible for 
Electoral Reform, Marc-Yvan Côté, who is a federalist, thank 
you very much, maintained that there was a commitment by the 
federal government to reimburse the cost of this referendum. 
Mr. Côté pointed out several times that he had submitted several 
requests to the federal government and had done so on the basis 
of a commitment made by the previous Conservative 
government to reimburse the Quebec government.
<P>
	This injustice to Quebec is an issue not only for sovereigntists 
in Quebec but also for the federal government's federalist 
friends. The Quebec Government has been patient, but we have 
now been waiting for 18 months.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs explain 
the fact that no decision has been made regarding the 
reimbursement of this amount of $26 million? It is, in fact, a 
legitimate request which the Quebec government has made 
several times. How can the minister explain the unfair decision 
he is making by having Quebecers pay more than their share of a 
referendum on the renewal of the Canadian federation?
<P>
	How can the minister explain his decision given the results of 
the referendum which was overwhelmingly defeated, contrary 
to what the Liberal Party of Canada wanted to see? Are we to 
understand from the behaviour  of the minister and his 
government that Quebecers must pay more dearly than the 
English provinces of Canada its rejection of this agreement? 
Everyone knows that several other Canadian provinces also 
rejected the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4382"> 4382 </A></B>
<P>
Charlottetown agreement and the situation with Quebec is still 
unresolved.
<P>
	Finally, I come to the conclusion that for some federalists 
equity does not have the same meaning if it applies to English 
provinces or to Quebec. The longer the federal government 
waits before reimbursing the $26 million the Quebec 
government is entitled to, the more this double standard will 
become obvious to the Quebec population.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, on October 26, 1992 
there were two separate referendums, one in Quebec and one in 
the other provinces and the two territories.
<P>
	Quebec held its own referendum under provincial laws while 
a referendum was held in the rest of the country under the 
federal Referendum Act. It was Quebec's own decision to hold a 
separate referendum subject to provincial not federal laws.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	You will remember that, with Bill 150 and after the demise of 
the Meech Lake Accord, the Quebec government had pledged to 
hold a referendum on Quebec's sovereignty before October 25, 
1992. Following the Charlottetown accord, Quebec changed its 
own bill in order to hold a referendum on the Charlottetown 
accord rather than on Quebec sovereignty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Parliament has also adopted its own rules to permit the 
holding of a referendum under federal laws. On June 23, 1992 
the federal Referendum Act received royal assent.
<P>
	On September 10, 1992 after a debate the House of Commons 
approved the text of the referendum and the referendum 
question which read as follows: Do you agree that the 
Constitution of Canada should be renewed on the basis of the 
agreement reached on August 28, 1992?
<P>
	On September 17, 1992 the governor in council issued by 
order in council an order that a proclamation do be issued 
directing that the opinion of the electors of nine 
provinces-except Quebec-and the territories be obtained on 
the referendum question.
<P>
	The federal government did consult the electors of nine 
provinces and two territories on the Charlottetown accord 
according to the federal Referendum Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As for the Quebec government, it decided to hold a separate 
referendum on the Charlottetown accord. Quebec followed its 
own rules on the referendum question, the referendum process 
and the voting.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On October 26, 1992 there were two separate referendums 
subject to two different sets of rules. The question of 
reimbursement of the Quebec referendum costs by the federal 
government is now being discussed bilaterally with Quebec.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 7.22 p.m., this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
