introduce this private member's bill which would see the Criminal 
Code amended to provide for a minimum sentence of seven years 
for convictions of impaired driving causing death.
<P>
	At present the Criminal Code provides a 14-year maximum 
sentence for this conviction. However, statistics show that 
sentences range in the average of only one to four years for this 
serious crime. In a recent case in my riding involving the death of 
three family members, the convicted person, who had two prior 
impaired charges and convictions, received only a three and a half 
year sentence, hardly consistent with the tragic consequences of 
this crime.
<P>

severity of the crime and sends out a strong message of deterrence.

<P>
	The bill recognizes the efforts of a constituent of mine, Mrs. 
Linda Rumble of Whitby, Ontario and the ultimate gift her nephew, 
two-year-old Stuart Alan Herriott, gave to others whom he never 
knew.
<P>
	This bill assists in providing more public education and 
awareness in organ donation by making every April 21 known as 
national organ donor day across Canada. April 21 marks the 
anniversary of young Stuart's death.
<P>
	By establishing a national organ donor day it is hoped that more 
Canadians will be encouraged to make a pledge to organ donation. 
In doing so, Stuart's supreme gift will be remembered so that his 
act of kindness can be repeated by many other Canadians.

concerning an amendment to the Canada Business Corporations 
Act, specifically to do with limiting the number of concurrent 
corporate directorships that anyone can hold where that person 
holds less than 5 per cent of the voting shares of the corporation.
<P>
	The nature of the bill has to do with the importance of directors' 
liability and that there is a point at which one person could hold 
more directorships than they could discharge their responsibilities 
fully.
<P>
	Therefore, this bill seeks to limit the number of directorships so 
that the interests of shareholders, the employees and the

Copyright Act (profit from authorship respecting a crime).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, my reintroduced bill would amend the 
Criminal Code and the Copyright Act to prohibit a criminal from 
profiting by selling, authorizing or authoring the story of a crime. If 
a person is convicted of an indictable offence under the Criminal 
Code, any moneys he or she may have made or may make in the 
future from the creation of a work based on the crime would be 
deemed proceeds of crime subject to seizure by the crown.
<P>
	The bill further amends the Copyright Act to provide that the 
copyright in any work principally based on the crime, where the 
work is created, prepared or published by or in collaboration with 
the convicted person, becomes the property of the crown. This 
would permit Canada, in countries which have signed the Berne 
Copyright Convention, to enforce its copyright.
<P>

committing a crime.

introduce Bill C-206, an act to amend the Criminal Code (offence 
committed outside Canada).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, section 6.2 of the Criminal Code specifies 
that persons are not to be convicted of offences committed outside 
Canada. However, there are a few exceptions such as war crimes, 
hostage taking, hijacking, international terrorism, et cetera.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	My bill amends section 7 of the Criminal Code and provides that 
everyone who commits an act or omission outside Canada that, if 
committed in Canada, would constitute an offence under the 
Criminal Code, shall be deemed to have committed the act in 
Canada, if he or she is a Canadian citizen, a permanent resident, or 
present in Canada after the commission of the act.
<P>
	The tragic inspiration for this bill is the true case of two 
Canadians who sexually assaulted a Canadian child while on 
holiday in the Caribbean. At present, there is no way of prosecuting 
those criminals in Canada. My bill would close this loophole and 
allow us to bring people like them to justice.

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this is a very specific bill that I am 
reintroducing to amend a particular section, section 52 of the 
Canadian Intelligence Service Act.
<P>
	It would provide that recommendations of the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee are to be implemented unless 
overruled by the minister concerned. In that event the minister 
would be required to report to Parliament the reasons for overruling 
the decision of the committee. If the reasons were secret the

definition of the term human being to the Criminal Code. The 
purpose of the definition is to extend the same protection to the 
unborn child as we extend currently to the born child and to focus 
the debate on the vexing issue of abortion and the question that has

vitamin content, carbohydrate content, fat content and the caloric

<P>

requires that each person seeking election have their nomination 
papers signed by 100 electors resident in the riding in which they 
seek to be elected. We all know this.
<P>
	In the last federal election, in my riding of Scarborough West 
there were eight people on the ballot. At least four of those people 
had not complied with section 82.1 and had not had their 
nomination papers signed by 100 electors resident in the riding of 
Scarborough West. There was absolutely no mechanism to deal 
with this flagrant abuse of the Canada Elections Act.

district to request the review of a nomination paper when the 
elector has reasonable grounds to believe that one or more persons 
who signed the nomination paper are not qualified electors resident 
in the electoral district. A nomination paper that had not been 
signed by the required number of electors resident in the electoral 
district provided for by the Canada Elections Act would be 
declared invalid.

``We citizens residing in Quebec wish to point out to the House of

11-year old Daniel Desrochers who died in Montreal on August 13, 
1995 as a result of a bombing in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve 
area, an attack aimed specifically at an alleged member of a 
criminal organization. That police forces do not have the tools and 
legislation they need to fight organized crime. That the 
Communauté urbaine de Montréal, the city of Montreal and the 
Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, among others, have 
called for the urgent adoption of anti-gang legislation by Canada. 
That organized crime threatens democracy, our individual 
freedoms and the safety of the population, including innocent 
people, as demonstrated in the August 9 attack. The petitioners 
therefore pray and call upon Parliament to adopt anti-gang 
legislation and agree to this demand''.

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to introduce this petition signed by hundreds 
of members from my riding  of Prince George-Bulkley Valley. 
They wish to draw the attention of the House to the fact that there 
are profound inadequacies in the sentencing practices concerning 
individuals convicted of impaired driving, also that Canada must 
embrace a philosophy of zero tolerance toward individuals who 
drive while impaired by alcohol or drugs.
<P>
	Therefore, the petitioners humbly pray that the Parliament of 
Canada proceed immediately with amendments to the Criminal 
Code that will ensure that the sentence given to anyone convicted 
of driving while impaired or causing injury or death while impaired 
does reflect both the severity of the crime and the zero tolerance by 
Canada toward this crime.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I would like to present three 
petitions.
<P>
	The first has been signed by a number of Canadians from 
Petawawa, Ontario. The petitioners draw to the attention of the 
House that managing the family home and caring for preschool 
children is an honourable profession which has not been recognized 
for its value to our society. They also state that the income tax act 
discriminates against families who make the choice to provide care 
in the home for preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill 
or the aged.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families who 
decide to provide care in the home for preschool children, the 
disabled, the chronically ill, or the aged.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ALCOHOLICBEVERAGES">ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

<P>
	The petitioners who are from Sarnia, Ontario would like to bring 
to the attention of the House that the consumption of alcoholic 
beverages may cause health problems or impair ones ability to 
operate machinery and/or equipment. Specifically, fetal alcohol 
syndrome and other alcohol related birth defects are 100 per cent 
preventable by avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to enact 
legislation to require health warning labels to be placed on the 
containers of all alcoholic beverages and to caution expectant 
mothers and others of the risks associated with alcohol 
consumption.

the preborn stage is not protected in Canadian society, they pray 
and call upon Parliament to act immediately to extend protection to 
the unborn child by amending the Criminal Code to extend the

Corrections and Conditional Release Act. The principles to be 
observed here are: to have a just and safe society; to protect victims

<P>
	I would like to present, pursuant to Standing Order 36, a petition 
signed by several members of the constituency of Beaver River and 
the Grand Centre and Cold Lake area. Knowing of course that the 
budget is coming down very soon, they want to make sure that the 
government knows that any ill-advised tax on health and dental 
benefits would have an adverse effect on the oral health and overall 
health of Canadians.
<P>
	The petitioners point out that dental care in Canada has been 
focused on prevention and family affordability for a generation. 
They also state that Canada's prevention directed system of oral 
health care combined with a tax free status and a past Parliament 
granted dental premiums have contributed to Canadians enjoying 
one of the highest standards of oral health in the world.
<P>
	The petitioners also state that-and this is the important 
one-Canadians are taxed to the limit. Canadians find any new tax 
embarrassing and offensive and they just simply cannot afford it 
any more. They are calling on Parliament to refrain from 
implementing a tax on health and dental benefits and to put on hold 
any future consideration of such a tax until a complete review of 
the tax system and how it impacts on the health of Canadians has 
been undertaken.

which would sanction or allow the aiding or abetting of suicide or

today about a country which has a wealth of young people. This 
country was born of a common will to populate one of the largest 
territories in the world. It was born of this sense women and men 
had of belonging to this fertile land.
<P>
	This country was born of an ideal, the same ideal of freedom that 
inspired the first settlers and continues to inspire newcomers; an 
ideal based on civic-mindedness and rooted in democracy, an ideal 
that produces a peace-loving society whose most dynamic force is 
the principle of individual equality. This country has a name: 
Canada. This country is part of the New World, as explorers of 
times gone by called it; it is also a country ready for a new world.

What is somewhat regrettable is that the separatists, who are so 
concerned with having the country they love passionately, are 
denying us ours.
<P>

<P>
	Our heritage, our culture, our shared struggles, shared joy, these 
help define what it means to be a Canadian. All the voices of 
Canada must be heard. Whatever their pitch, wherever they are, it 
is when our voices can be heard that we have a country moving 
forward. It is when the people of one community can have an 
emotional and lasting impact on someone from another community 
that we have a country that is moving forward. It is when the 
problems of one are the problems of all, when the joys of one can 
be the joy of many that we have a country moving forward. Our 
voices must be heard and they must be nurtured.

keep alive our faith in our country and keep on nurturing it.
<P>
	Ours is a country too often taken for granted, a country where 
women, men, children, First Nations, Acadians, Franco-Saskatche-
<P>
<HR>

<P>
wanians, Quebecers, the  people of Hamilton as well as those of 
Vancouver, and immigrants of all backgrounds feel at home.
<P>
	Canada has not said its last word. In fact, Canada is just 
beginning to speak out. We Canadians are not in the habit of 
boasting about our feats, but modesty does not preclude pride. Our 
flag, which is only 31 years old, is one which, albeit young, 
commands respect around the world, a flag that represents one of 
the most envied people on this earth. Let us honour it. I invite all 
Canadians to take part in the one in a million flag project. This is 
quite a challenge.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The one in a million flag project launched on Signal Hill, the 
eastern most point of the North American continent overlooking St. 
John's harbour, challenges Canadians by this time next year to have 
one million more flags flying across the country. We challenge 
businesses. Yes, we challenge businesses and we challenge 
companies, school boards, municipalities and Canadians to help 
sponsor this mission to put one million more maple leafs on the 
porches, the balconies, the parks and the school desks of Canada.
<P>
	In the coming days Canadians from coast to coast will be able to 
call 1-888-Fly Flag or-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	-in French, 1-888-DRAPEAU, toll free, to show their pride in 
Canada or to obtain any information they may be looking for in 
order to promote the Canadian flag.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Propaganda!
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> The member calls it propaganda. As Canadians, it is 
our right and our duty to take pride in our flag. Indeed, it is not only 
our right but also our duty to make our country, which is called 
Canada, better known.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We must show our pride in the linguistic duality of this land. I 
challenge every community across the country to make Saint-Jean 
Baptiste day an integral part, not a separate part, of celebrating 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	You may not be aware of the fact that, in our riding of Hamilton 
East, the Cercle français has been celebrating Saint-Jean-Baptiste 
Day for 20 years. That day must be celebrated in every province 
and in every community across the country, from Sherbrooke to St. 
Boniface, from Moncton to Maillardville. We will honour our 
country by celebrating Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, a day for all 
Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We should also take the days leading up to Canada Day to honour 
the diversity of this great country.
<P>
	I know my colleague, the Minister for Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development, is committed to seeing us recognize the 
first ever national aboriginal day, and to make this an integral part 
of the celebration of what we are as a nation. We need more contact 
and cultural exchange community to community, person to person. 
We need to recapture the spirit of 1967.
<P>
	My community this summer is celebrating our 150th birthday.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And I know that there will also be a celebration in Rimouski.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	I was very touched when the hon. member for Rimouski invited 
me to come to her home town. I can assure her that I will be there to 
celebrate Rimouski's anniversary, and I also want to invite her to 
Hamilton, for our city's 150th anniversary.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This summer 150 families from Hamilton and Shawinigan will 
be twinned.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond: </B>Shawinigan!
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> The hon. member says Shawinigan. He makes fun 
of the name Shawinigan. There are a lot of people from Shawinigan 
who like that name.
<P>
	The 150 families from Shawinigan that will come to Hamilton 
will be welcomed by Hamilton residents who will help them 
discover our region.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I see the level of understanding between our communities 
growing. It is a great idea and we must do more. We need to help 
Canadians rediscover this great country and make it easier on 
people to visit Montreal instead of Miami, Port Alberni instead of 
San Francisco, Cape Breton instead of Cape Cod.
<P>
	We must work with the airlines, the bus companies and the 
railways to put Canadians on the road to rediscovering the 
greatness of their own country. The world lives in an age in which 
knowledge is power. We need to know ourselves better as 
Canadians because that will give us more power as Canadians and 
more power as a country.
<P>
	We are committed to providing Canadians, particularly young 
Canadians, from every corner of the country an opportunity to 
experience the whole of what Canada has to offer.
<P>
	We will also launch the Terra Nova project to allow Canadians to 
talk to each other not just face to face but through cyberspace. We 
will bring together the public and private sectors in a unique 
CD-ROM project which will tell the Canadian story in a new and 
exciting way.

<P>
	We also intend to build on the Youth Link project which was 
launched recently by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and by me at a 
school in Winnipeg. We hooked up students speaking in French-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	-with students attending Hamilton's Delta High School, 
students from a school in Hull, and students from a school in 
Dorval. They talked to each other. They did not talk about the 
Constitution or politics. They talked about music. They asked each 
other what they thought of such and such a musician, or they 
inquired about their favourite hockey team. They talked and were 
starting to get to know one another.
<P>
	Quebec francophones did not know that there were students in 
Winnipeg who did all their school work in French, even though 
they were anglophones. English speaking students attending 
Hamilton's Delta High School were not aware of the fact that 
students in Dorval could go to an
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Youth Link will give students a chance to exchange ideas with 
not only other students across the country but with young people 
around the world. The more we know about where we have come 
from as a nation, who we are as a people and what we have 
accomplished together, the more confident we can all be that we 
will make the right decisions about our future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have every reason to walk hand in hand on the road to 
Canada's future. We were always able to overcome every obstacle 
and we are now the society that is best equipped to face the next 
millennium.
<P>
	Our strength lies in our diversity. In the context of an 
increasingly greater worldwide economic integration, Canada 
offers to the world community the image of a modern, bilingual 
and openly multicultural society, a society reflecting the world 
itself.
<P>
	The francophonie is a significant feature of the Canadian 
diversity. I recently met with provincial premiers in Winnipeg and 
we discussed how such a great asset it is to have people speaking 
French in every province.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Ten years ago we probably would not have had the kind of 
meeting we had in Winnipeg. Ministers from across the country 
came together and said that being able to speak in both languages in 
their province was not an economic drag but an economic plus. 
They were positioned to bid for international contracts and bring 
people together because they could offer the kind of linguistic 
capacity the world is looking for.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This major economic asset is just now beginning to be 
recognized throughout the country, which was not the case when 
we adopted bilingualism policies during the 1970s.
<P>
	People want to take active charge of their own development, and 
this is why we will be organizing an economic forum of the 
francophone communities throughout this country which will take 
place this summer in the Beauce region.
<P>
	This economic forum will foster the economic development of 
Canada's francophone communities, making every possible 
competitive opportunity available. Indeed the federal government 
will need to meet our commitments to help these communities to 
develop and grow. To show you how serious we are, both the 
President of Treasury Board and I as Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, are committed to delivering the goods relating to the 
Official Languages Act. I shall be working in close conjunction 
with the President of Treasury Board to ensure that we as a 
government meet our obligations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada is about building hope and a dream for people around the 
world who look to us for inspiration and who look to us to make our 
differences work. Canada is bigger than the sum of its parts. We 
have come to learn through our own experiences and our history 
that even if culture and tradition distinguish people from each 
other, the bonds between us can be strong and unbreakable when 
we work together to build each other up instead of tearing each 
other down.
<P>
	Canada is about people. It is also about land. We are proud to be 
the second largest country in the world. We are proud to be the 
country that holds 20 per cent of the world's fresh water, fresh 
water that will be an important instrument into the 21st century.
<P>
	We are the first country to have established a national parks 
service. The government is proud to have a Prime Minister who 
created more national parks than any other Canadian. That is why 
we are committed to giving all of Canada's natural regions a 
national park by the year 2000.
<P>
	Our ancestors left us a tremendous natural legacy. It is now our 
duty to build on that legacy for our children and our grandchildren.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada is both a geographical and a cultural space, and a number 
of our artists have gone beyond our borders to conquer the world, 
as we were delighted to see last night in Los Angeles. Our artists 
must be assured of pride of place in their own markets and their 
work must be made accessible to the entire population. As well, our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="100"> 100 </A></B>
<P>
artists must have exclusive ownership of what they  produce. We 
must bring our copyright law up to date, so that there is a proper 
balance between the needs of creators and the needs of consumers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Last night in Los Angeles Canadians were honoured when some 
of the largest recognized entertainment awards in the world went to 
Canadians. Canadians also know that more than 20 years ago 
governments through policy had the courage to make sure 
Canadian lyrics and Canadian music would have a chance to be 
heard in Canada and around the world.
<P>
	When Canadian content rules were introduced there were 
naysayers, downplayers, the negatives and the nos, but the results 
of those policies are coming to fruition in what we saw last night. 
Joni Mitchell, Charles Dutoit, Shania Twain, Alanis Morissette, 
Daniel Lanois and Rob McConnell are Grammy winners not just 
because of their incredible talent but because their country's 
cultural policies supported them at a time when it was needed.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	We must continue to stand up for our singers, our songwriters 
and all our artists. Cultural institutions like the CBC, the National 
Film Board and Telefilm Canada are essential in understanding 
Canadians and in telling Canadian stories. We will maintain the 
vitality of these institutions.
<P>
	The Juneau committee report calls for more distinctively 
Canadian programming in quality and quantity. Let me assure 
Canadians we have heard that message loud and clear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As a country, Canada is by far the most open to foreign cultures. 
This openness is a source of enrichment, but the Government of 
Canada must ensure that Canadian culture is promoted and 
developed.
<P>
	Proud of our past, we are a people that looks to the future.
<P>
	An hon. member just mentioned ADISQ. Mr. Speaker, I 
happened to meet some representatives of ADISQ the other day in 
Montreal. What struck me was that ADISQ works with all the other 
record companies in Canada-in Toronto, Vancouver and 
Montreal-because they realize that when you are in that kind of 
small business, there is strength in numbers. We have a music 
culture in Canada today, thanks to the policies we set as Canadians. 
Canadian content rules guarantee that Canadians can listen to their 
own songs, not just to what comes from the United States.
<P>
	Above all, we are a nation of builders. We were when we built a 
new world. We will be again as we start a new millennium. Let us 
all work together. Let the courage and pride of each Canadian be an 
inspiration to his or her fellow citizens.
<P>
	Why do we have universal health care in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Because we are all sick.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> The hon. member says because we are all sick. You 
may be, but I am not.
<P>
	Why do we have a health care system? Because in the forties and 
fifties, some farmers in Saskatchewan got together and decided to 
create a shared-risk system, which was eventually endorsed by 
Canada. It all goes back to the principle of collective responsibility 
which we inherited from the francophones in this country. Thanks 
to this expression of shared responsibility, which recognizes the 
individual, we have a country that shares the wealth with the people 
of Newfoundland, at a time when they are in need. Five or ten years 
from now, when Newfoundland experiences economic growth, it 
will be their turn to give, because that is how Canada works.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the past, we have noted that provinces have needed each other. 
The system of shared responsibility that has been established has 
permitted us to help when help is needed. Newfoundland needs our 
help right now but in 10 years' time perhaps Newfoundland will be 
helping its neighbours.
<P>
	It is that spirit of shared and collective responsibility that gave us 
national health care and the uniqueness that makes us Canadian.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is the strength of our common collective experience that will 
make us succeed in the 21st century. I am convinced that Canadians 
across the country want to build a better country: Canada.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister. This morning she spared 
us the tears and the story of the woman in the wheelchair, who went 
to Montreal on October 27. Her awkward sincerity was entirely 
justified this morning.
<P>
	She speaks of a Canada, a Canada I have long travelled and 
which I fail to recognize in the words of the minister.
<P>
	In 1965, I joined the army. That was the time I decided to give 
Canada one last chance. There were seven Quebecois in three 
platoons at Borden, in Ontario. The member, now retired from the 
armed forces, with whom I had the privilege of discussing this in 
the past, acknowledged that this was in fact the case. There were 
seven Quebecers who joined at Borden in January 1965 in three 
platoons-90 men. After five months, the first test, six of the seven 
Quebecers were dropped; three English Canadians of the 
eighty-three were dropped. Note the proportions.
<P>
	Someone came to my office the other day. In 1965, in those same 
years, the Department of External Affairs was  preparing future 
ambassadors. From the class of ambassadors, of the 38 Quebecers 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="101"> 101 </A></B>
<P>
who entered in 1964 or 1965, three remain with the department. Of 
the 12 English Canadians, 11 are still there.
<P>
	That is career equality, equality of opportunity in this fine 
country.
<P>
	In 1965, I was one of the six who left the army. It really upset 
me, but it led to my becoming a separatist. There, I used the word 
the Deputy Prime Minister wants to hear. I am a a staunch 
sovereignist with an unshakable faith in his cause.
<P>
	She talks about drastic budget cuts at a time of economic 
difficulties for everyone, including the unemployed. How many 
millions of dollars will they now spend on bringing little 
English-speaking Canadians from the West over to Quebec for 
Canada Day or Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day? Probably almost as many 
millions as they spent so little Quebecers could enjoy their summer 
vacations in the rest of Canada, at taxpayers' expense.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister described this country as the most 
beautiful, the greatest, the most noble, the one that welcomes and 
accepts everyone. What they should have done first is have 
accepted Quebecers in the land and given them the place and 
consideration they deserved. That, however, is something they 
were not able to do. They tried to assimilate us.
<P>
	She talks about Winnipeg. I was in Winnipeg last summer; I 
visited Louis Riel's grave and, just beside it, that of his lieutenant, 
Ambroise Lépine, whose tombstone has fallen over and broken in 
two. For five days, I walked all over the streets of Winnipeg, St. 
Boniface, St. Adolphe, St. Norbert, but I heard fewer than 10 
people spontaneously speak French among themselves.
<P>
	She talks to me about a Canada I do not know, a Canada that is 
disappearing. And they will not be able to save it because they 
already have a $600 billion debt, a good part of which was chalked 
up keeping the country together. They cobbled this country 
together with money. It did not happen spontaneously. They bought 
it with special legislation and massive spending. They spent 
billions on keeping the country together and today they realize that 
our debt has reached $600 billion but that the country is no stronger 
than at the beginning.
<P>
	I say that they should spend the billions or hundreds of millions 
of dollars they are about to spend on trying to reduce poverty in 
Montreal. She did not boast about that. She overlooked this little 
detail. Montreal is the poorest city in Canada. She did not brag 
about that in her speech. They might throttle an unemployed person 
now and then, but there are thousands of unemployed in Canada. 
What regard does she have for these people? She did not say 
anything at all about them, not a word.
<P>
	And what about the UI bill? We can reply to the Deputy Prime 
Minister that her Canada is a utopia, an illusion, and that she may 
be the only one dreaming about it.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	She and her boss, the Prime Minister, are among the last 
believers in that kind of Canada. They should sit down and discuss 
with the provinces, especially Quebec, and they might eventually 
be able to achieve a more acceptable partnership.
<P>
	In this regard, I ask again-and now I might get a show of tears, 
the wheelchair story, the events of last October. I, for one, do not 
believe at all in the Canada described to me by the Deputy Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a shame that the hon. member 
feels the need, as it is, to refer to how things were in the 
mid-sixties.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel:</B> Things have changed now.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> He says that things have changed. In 1965, women 
could not join the army, period. Women were not allowed in and, in 
many cases, they were excluded the same way that francophones 
were.
<P>
	That is why, in 1977, we put forward policies to promote the 
development of francophones. Does anyone know who Roméo 
Dallaire is? Dallaire is known around the world as this person who 
came from Canada, a French-speaking serviceman selected by the 
United Nations to lead the battle. Roméo Dallaire is a 
Franco-Canadian, a Franco-Ontarian, because he was born in 
Ontario. There are francophones in Canada. The Bloc member was 
born in Ontario. The fact that his fellow member comes from 
Peterborough, Ontario, goes to show that there are indeed 
francophones. The fact that Roméo Dallaire is a francophone, who 
has lead a battle for the UN proves that the French fact is 
recognized at the highest levels in our government. The Prime 
Minister, a francophone, did not speak English before being elected 
to the House of Commons. The Minister of Finance, and some of 
the most seniors government members happen to be of French 
background.
<P>
	It is true that, in 1965, women were underrepresented. How 
many women sat in the House of Commons in 1965? But we are 
turning things around and making changes happen in our country. I 
am not living in 1965, but in 1996, and I figure that we are able to 
work together to build something better.
<P>
	Take this morning's newspaper, Mr. Speaker. There are reports 
about Canada and the Filipinos; we have our problems, I agree.
<P>
	What does Montreal want? I have a brother in Montreal, an 
anglophone who did not speak a word of French before the age of 
12 or 13, but who now lives in French, with his daughter Béatrice 
and his son Gabriel. An anglophone. I am not alone. There are 
hundreds of  thousands of people across this country who want to 
build. But what do the people in Montreal want? They want us to 
set aside our quarrels about the Constitution and separation, which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="102"> 102 </A></B>
<P>
are draining the energy and strength of this beautiful country, 
Canada.
<P>
	If you really want to work toward economic recovery, let us seek 
political stability and recognition together. Together, we can work 
wonders for this country, Canada. The tears I have shed for this 
woman from Alberta, thousands and thousands of Canadians also 
shed. Notwithstanding the comments made by the Premier of 
Quebec, they know full well that we form a country and that we 
will remain a country, Canada, a country in a good position to meet 
challenges. Let us stick together.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
be sharing my time with the hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de 
Fuca. I want to respond to the throne speech and to some of the 
comments that the Prime Minister made yesterday when he 
addressed the House.
<P>
<B>(1100 )</B>
<P>
	He talked about the government's having done its job already 
and that now it was time for business to do its job to fulfil its 
obligations.
<P>
	Those are very bizarre comments from the Prime Minister 
because I do not think the Prime Minister and the government have 
fulfilled their obligations at all. I see the obligations of the 
government with respect to business, job creation and those sorts of 
things as creating an environment in which jobs can grow, 
businesses can be prosperous and people can look forward to the 
future with some hope. The government has failed miserably in its 
attempt to create an environment like that.
<P>
	This fall a poll suggested Canadians could not list a single thing 
of significance that the government had done over the two years it 
had been in power. We have a pall over the country today, a shroud, 
a pessimism because the government has failed to show any 
leadership on the issues that Canadians are very concerned about.
<P>
	I will talk specifically about some of the things the government 
could address but has failed to. The Prime Minister said that when 
talking about jobs the government has done what it could do and it 
is up to business. I reject that. I point to the debt, probably the 
single most important underlying problem we have which affects 
not only jobs but the sustainability of social programs, the 
prosperity of the country as a whole.
<P>
	Today we have a debt of $570 billion. The Prime Minister has 
been in government for a long time and perhaps has started to take 
billions for granted.
<P>
	For the benefit of the government, when I go to high school 
classes and talk about the size of the debt, I remind them of how 
much money $1 billion is. If I had a  stack of hundred dollar bills 
about two metres high that is $1 million. If I stacked our debt of 
$570 billion it would be over 1,100 kilometres high. That is a 
tremendous amount of money and the government over the course 
of its mandate is adding $110 billion.
<P>
	Business cannot balance the budget for the Prime Minister, only 
the Prime Minister and the government can do that. How can he say 
he has done all he can do? That is absolutely false. They have not 
balanced the budget and they have not begun the process of paying 
down the debt which is also critical to the long term fiscal and 
economic health of the country.
<P>
	If we do not balance the budget we cannot begin to lower taxes. 
There is tremendous weariness in the country today with respect to 
the heavy burden of taxes that people bear. It is unbelievable. 
Under the previous government we had something in the order of 
32 tax increases. In both budgets that have come down under the 
Liberal government to date we have had more tax increases. Over 
the last several weeks starting with the finance committee, a report 
in January, and ending up with the Deputy Prime Minister, we have 
had more talk of taxes.
<P>
	The finance committee was talking about tax increases for fuel, 
lotteries and tobacco. The Deputy Prime Minister was talking 
about a tax for the CBC. Despite the fine words of the Deputy 
Prime Minister a few minutes ago about Canadian culture and how 
the government creates Canadian culture, 61 per cent of Canadians 
want to see the CBC privatized. The Deputy Prime Minister, the 
finance minister and the Prime Minister have ignored what 
Canadians are saying on those issues, saying they want a tax to 
support the CBC. That is outrageous. That is ridiculous.
<P>
	The government has not done all it can do to deal with the issues 
Canadians are concerned about. It certainly has not created an 
environment that leads to job growth. When it does that I can 
guarantee businesses will more than pick up the slack. They need to 
have the chance and the government is the only one that can give it 
to them.
<P>
<B>(1105 )</B>
<P>
	There are many other areas in which the government has not 
fulfilled its moral obligations or even the promises it made during 
the election campaign. I guarantee if the government fulfils its 
obligation, its promise, to get rid of the GST, that would be 
something Canadians would cheer. They would respond very well 
to that. Business would respond well to that. It is a regulatory 
burden. In the election campaign government members made a 
very irresponsible promise, saying they would abolish the GST.
<P>
	They said it again last week. However, the only responsible way 
to abolish the GST is to balance the budget and then begin to lower 
the rate of the GST. We cannot just get rid of it because we would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="103"> 103 </A></B>
<P>
then be out  $17 billion. We already have a huge debt and a deficit 
we have to deal with. They made a very irresponsible promise.
<P>
	Liberal backbenchers are very concerned. They put their 
integrity on the line when they went door to door during the 
election campaign, promising to get rid of the GST. Now they are 
very concerned their government cannot fulfill that promise. They 
should be holding the government to account on that issue.
<P>
	Despite the Prime Minister's words, the government has not 
done all it could have done to create an environment in which 
business could create jobs, in which there could be prosperity, in 
which people could look to the future with some hope. It has not 
done what it needs to do.
<P>
	Tax reform is another area in which the government could have 
done something but has not so far. Our party has talked about the 
prospect of a flat tax. Even some of the Liberal members across the 
way have talked about a flat tax. In the United States today it is one 
of the major issues.
<P>
	People are very interested in making their tax system 
understandable, which must be one of the most important aspects 
of a tax system. In a democracy people have the right to understand 
how their tax system works. It would also be fairer. There would be 
only one rate. The more money one made, the more one would pay, 
but it would be one rate. Therefore it would cost people on the basis 
of their ability to pay.
<P>
	We would not need so much help to fill out tax forms. Therefore 
it would be much less of a drain on Canadian taxpayers. There are 
may other aspects of a flat tax that make it good, something to help 
create jobs, not the least of which is the removal of disincentives to 
be more productive. However, the government has rejected this. 
The finance department has said no way, it does not want this. 
Again, the Prime Minister is dead wrong. The government has not 
done all it can to create an environment for jobs and for growth in 
the economy.
<P>
	Last spring in the House we debated internal trade barriers. The 
government brought down legislation, if I remember correctly, Bill 
C-88. The Reform Party argued at that time that the changes the 
government was advocating were simply not adequate. The 
industry minister assured us the changes were an important first 
step. We said we still do not have the mechanisms in place to 
ensure we do not have those disputes.
<P>
	Now we see in the throne speech the minister is eating his words, 
saying we need a better trade deal. I remind Canadians and 
members across the way that according to studies, internal trade 
barriers cost anywhere between $5 billion and $44 billion a year to 
Canadians. Again, the Prime Minister and the government have not 
done the things they need to in order to create an environment for 
business.
<P>
	Group after group told the finance committee over the course of 
the prebudget hearings in the fall that they do not want the
<P>
government involved in business anymore. The nine words 
Canadian entrepreneurs fear the most are: ``I'm here from the 
government, I'm here to help''. People are tired of seeing the 
government interfere in business.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	Many business groups told us not to interfere in, subsidize or 
pour billions into businesses. What is in the throne speech? The 
government is stating it will get involved in envirotechnology and 
biotechnology industries. It wants to be involved in the aerospace 
industry and the high tech industry. Does that mean we will be 
subsidizing Bell Canada? What does that mean? It is ridiculous. 
Let us get away from that, from pouring money into business. Let 
business look after business and then we will create jobs.
<P>
	The government has also failed to give people some hope that in 
the future the Canada pension plan, old age security and health care 
will be available for everybody. Because of that and because it is 
talking about more payroll taxes, which are job killers, there is a 
shroud of pessimism across the country which hurts the ability of 
the economy to create jobs.
<P>
	Therefore I argue the Prime Minister is wrong. The government 
has not done all it could to create an environment for growth and 
jobs. It should rethink the approach it has taken in the throne 
speech and get at the fundamentals which include the debt and 
deficit problem. If we can wipe that out we can have lower taxes. If 
we have lower taxes we will have jobs for Canadians, which is what 
the Prime Minister should be working on.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is so easy to criticize, which truly seems to be what is 
happening, but the government is trying to find concrete answers.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Perhaps we have all forgotten some of 
these things, but the member has to be in her seat when she asks a 
question or makes a comment. Unless I misread my sheet, I do not 
believe the member is in her seat. If the member would be kind 
enough to go back to her seat we will stall for time while she is 
doing that.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hated to do that because I 
was able to sit beside a Reformer and I hate to have the camera off 
him.
<P>
	It is easy to criticize. I worry about that because the Reform 
member did not talk about some of the really positive things, for 
example, the youth initiatives the throne speech announced.
<P>
	However, I will talk a bit about the balanced budget the hon. 
member made reference to. We have continually over the last two 
and a half years been hitting our budget  targets. As much as the 
Reform Party does not want to acknowledge that, we are the first 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="104"> 104 </A></B>
<P>
government in 20 years to do so. It is important for all Canadians to 
know that.
<P>
	It is much more important to hit our targets than to say we will 
balance the budget and never do it and perhaps even accumulate 
debt. Most of the Reform members came from the Conservative 
Party which accumulated debt for years and years. I draw that to 
the member's attention. Concerning the GST, I as a Liberal 
backbencher promised to replace it. That will be done.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member if he found anything in the throne speech 
that pleased him at all, particularly the youth issue which is a 
wonderful thing for our communities to help our youth find jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has raised a number 
of things. I was pleased to see you put her in her place, literally not 
figuratively.
<P>
	With respect to budget targets, the only budget target that really 
matters is a balanced budget. One can set arbitrary figures and meet 
them, but at the end of the day the one that really matters is the one 
that gets us to zero so that we can start having surpluses and start 
offering people tax relief, sustainable social programs or whatever.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	She mentioned that we were members of the Conservative Party. 
I would argue that the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party 
have been peas in a pod in this place for 125 years. We are a breath 
of fresh air. We are introducing some new ideas. The people across 
the way are recycling the old ideas that got us into the mess we are 
in today.
<P>
	With respect to the GST, what Canadians want is lower taxes, not 
different taxes. They do not want the son of GST. They do not want 
a different name.
<P>
	With respect to the youth initiative, what Canadians want are not 
band-aid, short term solutions. What they really want is an 
economy that creates long term employment for all Canadians and 
of course, for young Canadians as well, but that cannot always 
come from the government. That is how we got into the mess in the 
first place. That is why we have a debt of $570 billion. It is because 
the government has gone out and thought it could fix all these 
problems by throwing money at them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, long on wind and short on constructive solutions to 
Canada's deepening problems, the government's throne speech was 
a huge disappointment.
<P>
	By footing up this path, the government has done a huge 
disservice to all Canadians. Never more in the last 50 years has 
Canada needed strong leadership and a vision to lead us out of the 
problems that affect all of us. We need effective solutions to solve 
these problems and we need them now, yet the throne speech had 
only comments like: an openness to explore, wanting fresh  
approaches, a desire to consult and have meetings. This 
government has been in power two years. The people of this 
country want and demand more than some vague desire to study, 
meet, consult or heaven forbid, have another royal commission.
<P>
	There are few solutions in the throne speech yet solutions are 
what we want. Solutions are what Canadians demand. Our 
problems are not insurmountable despite what the public thinks. 
There are solutions out there but we must have the courage to enact 
them today.
<P>
	I will not spend my precious time trashing the government. That 
is going to be fruitless. Rather, what I will try to do is put forth 
some of the constructive ideas that we have. I hope the government 
will work with us or better yet, take these solutions and implement 
them for the benefit of all Canadians.
<P>
	The biggest threat to Canadians as my hon. colleague has 
mentioned is the debt, the deficit and government overspending. It 
is not commonly understood despite what we have said as to why 
that is so.
<P>
	Continued overspending adds to the debt, driving interest 
payments up which decreases the ability of this or any government 
to provide for government programs to help Canadians. It also 
drives up taxes. That of course is crushing to the economy and 
drives businesses either into bankruptcy or down south.
<P>
	Despite what the Minister of Finance has said, the International 
Monetary Fund told us a few months ago that the projections of the 
Minister of Finance are wholly inadequate if we are to get back on 
our feet economically. Yet we do not see any action by the Minister 
of Finance on this.
<P>
	We are going to put forth a budget next week that is going to tell 
the government specifically how we can get the deficit to zero and 
attack this problem in a meaningful fashion. This issue of course is 
biggest for our youth. What did the government serve up in its 
budget plan? A lot of motherhood statements, a lot of feel good 
statements. As we know, that does nothing to get someone a job. It 
does nothing to provide solid funding for post-secondary education 
for our youth. Furthermore, those promises were vague promises, 
somewhat grandiose and not backed up with any ability of how 
those things are going to be done.
<P>
	The other big issue today is national unity. I would say this to the 
Prime Minister: The action that the government is taking on this 
issue rather than leading to national unity is going to lead to 
national disunity.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister's efforts to give Quebec a regional veto and 
put distinct society clauses in the Constitution are not going to 
bring Quebec into Canada. The separatist leadership wants one 
thing and one thing alone and that is a sovereign country called 
Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="105"> 105 </A></B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister can stand on his head and do gymnastics, 
promise anything under the sun and it is simply not going to keep 
this country together. He has to take some decisive actions. He 
must first give offers that do not smack of inequality and 
unfairness to Canadians. He must give solutions which are going 
to bring Canadians together.
<P>
	First, he has to stop bribing separatist politicians to stay in. 
Second, he must decentralize appropriately: allow the feds to do 
what the feds do well and allow the provinces to do what the 
provinces do well. He must offer all Canadians exactly the same 
deal. Equality and fairness must be the basis of any proposal which 
the government puts forth, not one province unequal with any 
other.
<P>
	The second point which was brought forth in the Deputy Prime 
Minister's speech interestingly enough in the words that she used, 
is that we have to stop referring to Canadians in some hyphenated 
fashion. We must get away from the hyphenated Canadianism that 
has been entrenched in our verbiage over the last 15 years. We must 
stop referring to ourselves as anglo-Canadians, franco-Canadians, 
Ontarians, British Columbians, New Brunswickers. Simply we 
must refer to ourselves first as Canadians.
<P>
	That is one of the first things the government can do. The Deputy 
Prime Minister referred to one of Canada's greatest heroes of 
recent memory, Major-General Roméo Dallaire. Major-General 
Dallaire as we all know is first and foremost simply a Canadian.
<P>
	This country has big problems. Solutions do exist to solve them. 
Canadians from coast to coast in every province demand, need and 
desperately want hope. The government's throne speech does not 
give them that. The government has a window of opportunity now 
to bring forth constructive solutions to address the problems that 
affect us all. Give people the hope that they demand. Give people 
the hope that they need. Put Canada on the course to the destiny 
that it can have.
<P>
	I believe, as I am sure almost every member in this House does, 
that we in Canada share not only a great past and a present, but also 
a superb future. It is our destiny to lead in some ways the world we 
live in today. Not many countries have that opportunity. Not many 
countries have that ability.
<P>
	Canada and Canadians have that ability. We have the strength, 
we have the knowledge, we have the ability and we have the 
international respect and recognition to be able to do this. Not only 
is it our destiny but it is also our responsibility. As Canadians, that 
is part of our destiny.
<P>
	One of the beauties of the country to which I emigrated from 
England is that we in this country have managed to bring together 
over 178 different ethnic groups to live in relative peace. There are 
many differences which separate us or that exist within us.  These 
differences need not separate us. These differences, rather than 
pulling us apart, can bring us together.
<P>
	We can look at differences in two ways: as a them versus us 
mentality, or as the differences that we have which bring us 
together and make us all stronger as individuals and as a group. We 
must use our differences in this country to make ourselves stronger 
because that also is part of our future as Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want to congratulate the hon. member for 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca for his comments. It is refreshing to hear 
comments such as those made by the Reform member, particularly 
given the fact that, in the last few minutes, we had to listen to the 
whining of the Deputy Prime Minister, who keeps harping about 
the same old things when giving her vision of Canada's future, but 
mostly its past.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	I would rather hear comments such as those just made by the 
Reform Party member. It goes without saying that I do not share his 
view on Canada's future, but we, sovereignists, recognize the 
greatness of Canada and of the Canadian people. Our views differ 
in that we also recognize ourselves, Quebecers, as a people, and 
feel that we have the right to control our destiny and have our own 
country.
<P>
	It is my belief that, once both Canadians and Quebecers have 
established themselves as peoples, it will be easier to create links 
that will unite us instead of dividing us.
<P>
	This is what I understood from the hon. member's comments, 
and again I want to congratulate him on his speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca): </B>Mr. Speaker, we love 
Quebec, we love the Francophonie and we love the French 
language.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	However we love Quebecers, we love Quebec and we love the 
French people and the French language as equals. That again is the 
basis upon which we have to have a discourse with the people of 
Quebec. I believe that myths have been put forward to the people of 
Quebec for decades. It is up to the government and all of us to 
dispel those myths, distortions and half truths which have been 
advanced for so long.
<P>
	The only way to do that in my estimation is for us to go into 
Quebec, listen to the people there and for them to listen to us as to 
where we stand and where we come from, in order to dispel these 
myths and distortions which have been put forth by both sides. If 
we can do that, then a reasonable question and a reasonable answer 
can come on the unity issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="106"> 106 </A></B>
<P>
	Speaking as a British Columbian and a Canadian, I will say that 
this Chinese water torture that Canada has been subjected to for 
the last 20 years with the referendum issue hanging over our heads 
has to end. Canadians are simply fed up with it and they want it 
to end once and for all. It will be up to the government to do this 
and it must be done soon so we can get on with our lives.
<P>
	Again, for the people of Quebec to make a reasonable decision 
on unity they must understand what Canada is offering them, what 
the true history of Canada is and what is taking place right now. If 
we rely on the separatist media to do this, the people of Quebec will 
not get the correct appreciation of what is taking place in this 
country. The only way to get the correct message across is for this 
to be done eyeball to eyeball in Quebec between all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
splitting my time with the honourable member for 
Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis.
<P>
	Our government has a reason to be proud of its record over the 
past 28 months. During that time we have focused on the 
government's jobs and growth agenda and there are now half a 
million more new jobs in the country. Canada has the highest 
growth rate in the G-7. Those are very important accomplishments 
and they are something to be proud of.
<P>
	At the same time, we still have problems. We still have 
unemployment. People in my riding come to me looking for ideas. 
They ask me where they can find jobs. They still need jobs. We are 
lucky in the Halifax area that we have a relatively low 
unemployment rate compared to the rest of Atlantic Canada, but we 
still have our problems and so does the rest of the country.
<P>
	We have more work to do as a government, but we must focus. 
We cannot do everything. That is the idea here of the throne speech. 
The idea of the throne speech is to set out the priorities and the 
focus of the government.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	The government has set out three main priorities in the throne 
speech. The first is to maintain its efforts on jobs and growth and 
even to strengthen those efforts.
<P>
	The second is to pursue security for Canadians in a number of 
areas.
<P>
	A very important third is to modernize our federation to ensure 
the unity of our country.
<P>
	Let me talk first about the issue of jobs and growth. It is very 
important that the government continue to pursue deficit reduction. 
It has met its deficit targets and is going to continue to meet them. 
It is very important that it do so. It is important to support a healthy 
economic climate. The government has to meet those targets but it 
can also do more.
<P>
	For example, there is the problem of sales taxes across the 
country: the GST and provincial sales taxes. In the province of 
Nova Scotia there is a tax on a tax and we are paying very high 
levels of tax. A lot of people in my area have complained about the 
way it works. They are constantly hit with that tax which they see 
all the time, especially when the goods have one price on the shelf 
and then they are hit with another price. It is difficult to accept.
<P>
	The government is now saying, let us harmonize these taxes. Let 
us work together with the provinces and have one system of sales 
tax. Then there would be one form for people in small business to 
report on and a simpler system for Canadians. It is very important 
to support a healthy economic climate for Canada and also create 
jobs and growth.
<P>
	However, growth alone is not enough. There has been growth 
over the past two years, the highest rate in the G-7 as I mentioned. 
However it is not creating enough new jobs. That is the concern of 
my constituents.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is right to challenge the private sector. It is 
time to challenge them to do more to create new jobs. What are the 
big companies and the big banks doing for Canada? They receive 
tremendous profits from Canada, in some cases bigger profits than 
ever before. What are they giving back? Big layoffs. Large 
numbers of people are being cut from these companies.
<P>
	I heard yesterday on television that the big banks are having a 
study done to determine whether they have a moral obligation to 
not lay off people, but to employ them. It is remarkable that 
someone should have a study done in order to decide whether they 
have a moral obligation.
<P>
	I could pick almost anyone in my riding to do the study and 
answer the question and it would probably be a lot cheaper than 
they are going to pay for this fancy study about their moral 
obligation to give people jobs when they are making such 
incredible profits. Or can they continue to make these huge profits 
and continue to cut jobs at a tremendous rate?
<P>
	The answer should be obvious to the big banks and corporations. 
I hope they will join what the Prime Minister proposed as a Team 
Canada partnership to create jobs, especially for young Canadians. 
Young Canadians are our greatest resource and are so important to 
our future. At the present time the rate of unemployment among 
young Canadians is 16 per cent. That is an atrocious rate. The 
government has a responsibility to deal with that. However, we 
must also challenge the private sector which has the main job of 
creating jobs for people, especially our young people.
<P>
	Yes, the private sector must be challenged but the government 
also has a role here. It is good that the government is going to 
double the number of summer jobs for students this year. That is 
very important because  students and their families in my area and 
across the country are concerned about their futures, the cost of 
education and other problems they are facing. They need help from 
the government and I am glad to hear it is coming.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="107"> 107 </A></B>
<P>
	Another area that the government is focusing on is trade. Trade 
has been the single most important factor in creating jobs and 
growth over the last two years. It is interesting to note that 20 per 
cent of the jobs in my riding of Halifax West depend on trade. It is 
not surprising considering the fact that Halifax is a port city. There 
is also manufacturing in Halifax that must be sold around the 
world. Trade is very important to us and that is why it important to 
continue the Team Canada trade missions the Prime Minister has 
attended around the world. Those missions have brought $20 
billion in new deals over the past 14 months. That is not singing in 
the dark. Those are important numbers. They are important because 
they mean jobs for Canadians, including those jobs in my riding.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	A moment ago I mentioned the port of Halifax. The port of 
Halifax is a key national entry point for trade. It has grown 
tremendously in the past few years. It has great potential for the 
future but it has to compete with American ports. Those are its 
main competitors especially for container traffic.
<P>
	I have a great concern about the issue of marine service fees. I 
have expressed my concerns very strongly to the new Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, his department and the commissioner of the 
coast guard about the need to ensure that whatever fee structure for 
marine services is brought in, it must be fair and must allow eastern 
Atlantic ports such as the port of Halifax to compete with its main 
competitors in the U.S. That is very important for the economic 
future in our region. It is very important for trade for this country 
too.
<P>
	I was pleased to see that the government plans to focus also on 
rural areas because rural areas have special challenges. I come 
from an urban-rural riding. I have a mix of mostly suburban but 
also quite a large rural area.
<P>
	In those areas some of the things that are important, as they are 
across Atlantic Canada, are things like access to capital, human 
resources development, infrastructure and access to the 
information highway. These are all things the government is going 
to pursue over the next year. Those rural areas need a special focus 
and we are going to give that focus.
<P>
	The throne speech also talked about security for Canadians. That 
is very important in many ways. The throne speech is really about 
values and that is what it should be about. We should be talking 
about the shared values of Canadians because those shared values 
are what make us Canadian. Values such as freedom, peace,  
tolerance, sharing and generosity are what set us apart from other 
countries and peoples in the world,
<P>
	Those are values that are very strongly shared across this country 
by all Canadians no matter what background, no matter what 
province, no matter what language. Those values make us 
Canadians.
<P>
	The throne speech set out those values and why they are 
important to us. Economic growth is important to pursue, but it is 
not enough by itself. It is not an end in itself as the Prime Minister 
has said.
<P>
	The government must pursue it for jobs and wealth creation for 
our country. At the same time the government must create 
opportunity. That is very important. We have been trying to do that 
over the past years and we must focus on that more. We must 
ensure that all Canadians can benefit when there is growth in our 
country, not just the big companies, big banks, for example. All 
Canadians have to take part.
<P>
	An important part of the distribution of the success of our 
country is that a secure social safety net is maintained. It is very 
important to Canadians. It is a very important value.
<P>
	Canadians are worried, in my riding and I am sure in other 
ridings, about the future of medicare. The government is 
committed to maintaining the five principles of the Canada Health 
Act. That is a very important commitment, and one that I endorse 
heartily.
<P>
	I was very pleased to hear that the government will put a floor 
under the cash component of the Canada health and social transfer. 
That is an important guarantee of continuing federal cash transfers 
to the provinces which, especially in Atlantic Canada, is very 
important. It is important for a strong nation. It is important for 
strong national standards. It is important for our future and for our 
values as Canadians.
<P>
	I have had many calls on the issue of pensions over the past 
while. With all the talk in the media about the future of the Canada 
pension system, the OAS and the GIS, Canadians are worried about 
this. While I am glad the Prime Minister has reaffirmed his 
commitment that we must protect current seniors and the pensions 
they receive, at the same time the system has to be examined to 
find ways to make the pension system sustainable for the long run 
for younger Canadians. For instance, when those our age retire the 
system should be there for us and others across this country.
<P>
	One of the things I was delighted to hear in the speech from the 
throne is the traditional Liberal and Canadian value of equality of 
opportunity. This value is very dear to the hearts of Canadians. It is 
a basic Canadian value.
<P>
	Equality of opportunity begins with children. The government 
has said it will make children a priority. That is no empty 
statement. It is a very important commitment that members in this 
party have been  working on for a long time. We have worked hard 
to see that the government does more on the issue of child poverty. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="108"> 108 </A></B>
<P>
I am delighted to hear the government say that it wants to move in 
that direction and I am looking forward to hearing more about that.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	The government says that it will improve the child support 
system to help single parents and low income working families, the 
working poor who have always been a big concern of mine 
especially when I was involved with food banks in the Halifax area. 
We found people coming to us who had jobs but who were working 
on minimum wage, for example, and could not put enough money 
together to feed their families for the whole month. They had to end 
up going through the degradation of standing in line at food banks. 
It is an awful thing to have to do.
<P>
	Food banks are certainly not the answer for our country. I am 
glad that the government is going to focus on this issue. I look 
forward to seeing measures in the budget in relation to poor 
children and young working families.
<P>
	Equal opportunity is also important for small communities and 
rural communities. For example, it is important for the black 
communities. In my riding are several small black communities 
that just finished celebrating Black History Month, which was a 
great success.
<P>
	It is important to recognize the black Canadians who have made 
an important contribution to making the road a little easier for 
others who followed them. Dr. Pearleen Oliver has recently written 
the book called <I>The Song of the Spirit</I>. It is a history of the 
Beachville United Baptist Church. In it she gives a record of people 
who have worked to build their community and to overcome 
prejudice and disadvantages in those kinds of communities. It is 
very important that she has recorded this kind of work and paid 
tribute to those people.
<P>
	It is also important that we implement the new employment 
insurance system but that we not do it hastily. The minister has 
committed us to review it. This plan has to be adjusted. He has to 
do that to make it fairer for all workers.
<P>
	We know that the system has not been fair enough in the past. It 
has to be made fairer for all workers across the country. At the 
same time we must ensure that we do not hurt unfairly those people 
who cannot afford it, those who need the system the very most. I 
am glad to see that it is in the throne speech and that we are going 
to see more of it. These are very important messages in the throne 
speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in all debates very often the most realistic judges are the 
ones who watch from the outside and who  do not take part. Their 
view is far more objective and realistic.
<P>
	In my own background, because I was born in a small British 
colony, I remember the time when we could not go to university 
there. There was no university. All of us young people had to exile 
ourselves and go far away to study here and there. Thus it is that my 
family is scattered. My brothers and sisters are all over the place. I 
have a brother in England, two in France. I have a sister and other 
brothers in Africa. I have cousins and family members in Ireland, 
in England, in the United States and as far as Australia.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	Speak to anyone outside of our country. Speak to Germans, 
parlez aux Français, speak to people from Niger or Nigeria, speak 
to Indonesians, speak to people in Hong Kong or China and they 
will always say the same thing: They view Canada with immense 
respect, as a country that is friendly, moderate in tone and action, 
peaceful and that is always attentive and helpful to people around 
the world who need support and help. Unfortunately at home we do 
not see Canada the same way.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Some among us would like to undo the Canadian experience. 
Some among us, regrettably, would like to break asunder the ties 
that bind Quebec to Canada. They would like to break apart this 
country of moderation, of tolerance, of peace and social justice, a 
country greatly respected everywhere in the world.
<P>
	Outside observers, whether my relatives abroad, whom I see 
often, my friends outside the country, or people I meet when 
representing Canada at various conferences, always ask me the 
same thing: ``What kind of spoiled brats are you in Canada? What 
is going on? You have so much, resources beyond value, a country 
in full flower of its growth, a country that is in some ways a model 
for others in the world, how can you want to put an end to that 
remarkable experiment''
<P>
	Today I feel terribly bad when I hear my colleagues in the 
official opposition referring so often to Quebec and English 
Canada, never Canada. It is always Quebec and English Canada, as 
if they were saying that people like Fernand Robichaud, Raymond 
Bonin and Don Boudria were not real francophones. Those millions 
of francophones living outside Quebec make up part of English 
Canada. This polarization by camps, by language, by culture is 
what is hard to explain to outside observers, what they find so 
sterile.
<P>
	If we have so many resources, if our country is so rich, with 
everything it could possibly need for success, can we not reach 
agreement, they wonder.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> A bankrupt country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="109"> 109 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln: </B>Madam, would you give me the chance to speak 
without interruption, please? Might I have that courtesy? Thank 
you.
<P>
	If we here with so many resources, with so much going for us, 
cannot get along because on the one side we are Quebec 
francophones and on the other we are supposedly the people of 
English Canada, what chance does a country with 24, 15, 30, 
maybe 80 different ethnic groups have? What chance do the 
smaller countries without any resources have? What chance do 
countries with more than one language or more than one religion 
have, when we who share the same historical tradition, whose roots 
lie in two European peoples with the same general culture and the 
same religion, cannot agree? What chance do other countries in the 
world have, when they have several ethnic backgrounds, several 
religions, several languages?
<P>
	It is unfortunate that we are quarrelling in this way, because the 
unemployed, the little guys looking for work or receiving welfare, 
do not read <I>Le Devoir</I>, do not read <I>La Presse</I>, do not read the <I>Globe 
and Mail.</I> Nor do they attend the congresses of the Liberal Party of 
Canada, the Bloc Quebecois, or the Reform Party. What they are 
telling us is that they are fed up, they have had enough of our empty 
rhetoric, they want to hear no more of it.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	The throne speech is particularly relevant where it says that we 
must get together and reconcile our differences, set our sights 
higher and look ahead to the future. We must be able to work 
undisturbed. We must restore the stability we had before.
<P>
	Look at what is happening today in Montreal, what political 
instability is causing all around us. There are too many examples to 
mention. Recently I met some business people involved in 
communications, aerospace, pharmaceuticals and computers. 
Today scientists are leaving and people are postponing investments 
because of the political instability all around us. I know some 
people will say they have heard it all before or that this is political 
terrorism.
<P>
	In fact, the premier of Quebec himself admitted there was a 
problem when he put one of his top ministers in charge of the 
renewal of Montreal. But to get the economy going again and have 
a genuine renewal, we must set aside this useless debate which is 
killing us, slowly but surely.
<P>
	I want to ask my Bloc Quebecois colleagues most sincerely, 
today, now that we have a window of opportunity with a new 
premier in Quebec and a new Leader of the Official Opposition, 
whether they are prepared to say: ``Let us postpone all our plans for 
separation for four or five years, to give us all a chance to work 
together in a spirit of conciliation on projects that will put people 
back to work and give them back their dignity''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is what all Canadians want. Whether they live in Quebec, 
Ontario, British Columbia or P.E.I., what people want first of all is 
for us to stop our quarrels. They are tired of that. They do not want 
it anymore. What they want is a dignity of life and work. This is 
what I hear from the speech from the throne. I hope all parties will 
join in to ensure that this will be our main objective in the years 
ahead.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with considerable interest to my colleague for 
Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis. I know that my colleague is 
knowledgeable about various countries, as he has mentioned. I 
know he lived a long time in South Africa or in Rhodesia, as 
someone in my riding told me. He was therefore able to get a close 
look at apartheid and such regimes. I trust him absolutely on the 
subject of respect for democracy. It took him 15 years to 
understand it, but he did.
<P>
	The gentleman is talking about pointless debate. The new 
premier of Quebec, who was the Leader of the Opposition here 
until Christmastime, said, in taking up his duties in Quebec City, 
that the accent would be on economic growth, on economic 
renewal, that constitutional debate would be put on the back burner 
for a while and that the state of public finances would be improved 
and the province managed as it ought to be.
<P>
	I am proud of that and I know that members of Parliament and 
that those in the party opposite us were proud as well. However, 
with the throne speech, they are the ones rekindling the debate the 
member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis has just rightly complained 
of.
<P>
	There was no more discussion on this side about the referendum. 
We lost it. The winners, however, are behaving like losers. They are 
poor winners. We are good losers, we accepted it. In his response to 
the speech from the throne, my leader said that we would respect 
the institution of the federal Parliament; we would not kick over the 
traces, as they say; we would respect the democratic process.
<P>
	I find it odd that the winners are the ones complaining. I find 
poor winners funny. I think they are just as rare as good losers. That 
is what Maurice Richard used to say.
<P>
	Still, it is the member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis who is 
talking about pointless debate. You are the one who started the 
debate. You are the one who raised it. We want to talk about 
improving the economy in Quebec and in the other provinces as 
well.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	We want you to come to the defence of the unemployed you are 
relentlessly pounding these days. This is what the speech should 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="110"> 110 </A></B>
<P>
have been about. Your philosophical debates on the perfect society 
are all well  and good, in their place. I remind my honourable 
colleague for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis that the referendum has 
been over since October 30. Move on to something else. Put your 
knowledge to use. You are an expert in environmental matters, talk 
to us about the environment. Talk to us about whatever you like, 
but do not accuse us of rekindling the debate, which is what you did 
yourself this morning.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, since we are all back, 
could you please address your remarks to the Chair; it will be less 
complicated next time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the hon. member for 
his comments. However, I did not come to the same conclusion as 
he did after reading the throne speech. I read this speech very 
carefully. I saw very positive measures. There is no mention of a 
referendum. We said that, should it ever happen, we would seek 
Canadians' views on their country. I think this makes perfect sense. 
At the same time, what we said on most pages of this throne speech 
is that we would take concrete action to promote employment 
among young people, double the number of summer jobs, and 
avoid introducing programs in areas of provincial jurisdiction 
without first holding extensive consultations with the provinces 
and obtaining their consent.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has invited all the premiers to meet with him 
to try to set an agenda for the future, to put Canada back to work. 
The throne speech touched on science and technology, the 
environment, employment, on putting Canada back to work. In 
fact, this was the central theme of the throne speech.
<P>
	I urge all my colleagues to get together and focus on the positive 
effects of the throne speech. The upcoming budget will indeed 
focus on the economy. There are so many things we can do together 
to revitalize Montreal, to revitalize the economy. I fully agree with 
the hon. Bloc member for Chambly that, if we put the Quebec 
referendum behind us and declare a moratorium on all this, all of us 
will benefit, especially those who need it the most, that is to say, 
those who will be looking for work tomorrow morning.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Could you tell me 
how much time if any I have remaining, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> If I am not mistaken, we are through with 
questions and comments. This leaves just five minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> We are through?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Yes, as far as questions and comments are 
concerned. Is there unanimous consent to extend?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> I would have liked to 
ask a few questions but, if we ran out of time, so be it.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Very well, then. Resuming debate. I give 
the floor to the hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
First of all, Mr. Speaker, I would like to set the record straight in 
relation to what the Deputy Prime Minister said earlier in 
responding to one of my colleagues and have her know that we in 
Quebec are so much a distinct society that our legislative assembly 
is called the National Assembly.
<P>
	This decision was made by federalists who agreed unanimously 
to change the name of our legislative assembly to National 
Assembly. Mr. Johnson Sr. was the premier at the time and he had 
the unanimous consent of the House to do so, which means that 
Jean Lesage agreed. The separatist PQ party did not even exist back 
then. This is a matter of tradition that I hope the Deputy Prime 
Minister will recognize.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	There is also the issue of June 24. All over the world, people 
celebrate midsummer day on June 24. It comes from an old 
aboriginal custom that we all share; it was being celebrated in 
countries as far away as Peru, in Machu Picchu, thousands of years 
ago. So, there is nothing new about celebrating the summer solstice 
on June 24.
<P>
	Now, this day is celebrated in many countries around the world 
in a similar manner; people sing folk songs, dance traditional 
dances and have fireworks or light bonfires on the beach or in an 
open field, where there is no beach.
<P>
	That said, June 24 is also the feast of St. John the Baptist. It is in 
the liturgical calendar of the Roman Catholic Church, which is 
almost 2,000 years old, and St. John the Baptist is the saint to 
whom we pay tribute on that day. However, there is a difference in 
Quebec's case. Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day is Quebecers' national 
holiday, regardless of their origin.
<P>
	So, in Quebec, we celebrate the 24th of June. It goes without 
saying that we do not object to French Canadians outside Quebec 
celebrating the 24th of June in their own way and in accordance 
with their culture. We certainly do not object to that. We do not 
even object to having English Canadians come to Montreal, paying 
the full fare this time, and celebrate June 24 with us, if they so 
wish. We have no objection to that.
<P>
	They can do like I did last year when, for the first time in my 58 
years, I came to see for myself what Canada Day means to 
Canadians. I must say I learned a good lesson in that I truly felt it 
was English Canada's holiday. I did not feel at home; I did not 
think it was my holiday. I also found it amusing that, when 
speakers spoke French and made jokes, nobody laughed. People 
had to wait for the English version to laugh. I realized that I was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="111"> 111 </A></B>
<P>
one of the few who could understand jokes in both languages  and 
that people had to wait for the English version to laugh.
<P>
	What I find even more surprising in the deputy Prime Minister's 
speech is that, all of a sudden, she starts raving about Canada's 
francophones and wants to protect them. Let me remind her of 
some recent events.
<P>
	It is true that she was just recently appointed Minister of 
Canadian Heritage and that she may not have had the time yet to 
become familiar with all the issues and to go through all the 
documents that could enlighten her about the situation of 
francophones outside Quebec, among other things. The 
commissioner of official languages released his report in February 
1996, which is rather recently, and he once again came to the 
conclusion that Canada's official languages policy does not work. 
The commissioner reminded us that sections 41 and 42, in Part VII 
of the Official Languages Act, were a dismal failure.
<P>
	Yet, the heritage minister attended with great pomp the world 
congress held by Acadians on the Acadian peninsula. She stated 
loud and clear that the masterpiece of her department and 
government was an act that was passed when Mr. Bouchard, 
Quebec's premier, was secretary of State. Yet, the commissioner 
talks about a dismal failure.
<P>
	He says that, according to his study, nothing indicates the 
existence, even after August 1994, of a systematic effort to ensure 
compliance with section 41 in the restructuring process of the 
government's institutions and programs, including through a 
transfer of responsibilities to the provinces or to volunteer 
organizations.
<P>
	The commissioner points out that, in fact, this restructuring was 
sometimes done in a way that reduced, instead of increasing, 
support to the development of minority official language 
communities, or recognition of the status and use of French and 
English.
<P>
	The commissioner says that the heritage minister's appeal to his 
colleagues to do their homework as regards sections 41 and 42 of 
Part VII of the act was made in vain.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	So it seems the policy is a failure, at the very moment the Deputy 
Prime Minister is about to make a 50 per cent cut in subsidies for 
francophones in Saskatchewan, in the agreement between the 
francophone community of Saskatchewan and Canada, and also at 
the very moment the assimilation rate ranges from 10 to 70 per 
cent. I think that instead of getting emotional and defending 
francophones or the francophonie or anything that is the slightest 
bit French, the Minister of Canadian Heritage should sit down at 
her desk, sign some decent documents and make sure her 
colleagues promote sections 41 and 42 of the policy I mentioned 
earlier, a policy that goes back to when the new premier of Quebec 
was secretary of  state under the Mulroney government. Laws may 
be passed in this Parliament, but people do not care whether they 
are enforced or not.
<P>
	To get down to the throne speech, the centrepiece of this 
government's second session, earlier the hon. member for 
Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis was terribly depressed to see that we in 
the Bloc Quebecois did not understand.
<P>
	In this document, which is about fifteen pages long-twice as 
long as the first one, which does not mean it will be more 
effective-the speech is divided into three parts. Part I is about 
ensuring opportunity and refers to a strong society, a strong 
economy. In the next four pages, the government tells us how it 
intends to make the Canadian economy strong. It says, for instance, 
that it will double the number of federal summer student jobs. So 
while the government is laying off 45,000 public servants, all of a 
sudden it can double the number of student summer jobs. Why? To 
make sure these students get a cheque with a maple leaf and 
remember that in the next referendum.
<P>
	Science and technology. The government promises to take care 
of that, but it will have to be a quick study, because the Canadian 
government is way behind. For instance, it has done nothing to 
protect Canadian culture during the two years it has been in power. 
I wonder how it will be able to catch up in science and technology, 
especially where the information highway is concerned.
<P>
	As for trade, I would love to see how specific the government 
will be about dealing with the threats aimed by the Americans at all 
those who trade with Cuba, because this will affect thousands of 
jobs in Canada.
<P>
	Finally, several measures have been announced to strengthen our 
economic framework, including the 1 per cent. The Prime Minister 
thinks he can, well, not force but at least encourage businesses to 
spend 1 per cent of their payroll on jobs for young Canadians. That 
remains to be seen.
<P>
	As for the second part of the throne speech, which is called 
ensuring opportunity: security for Canadians, this is a prime 
example of not practising what you preach. There is all this 
wonderful stuff down on paper, but you wonder what the 
government is actually doing to protect the environment. For two 
years, all the talk about the environment has centred on the <I>Irving 
Whale</I>, which is still at the bottom of the ocean, off the coast of the 
Magdalen Islands, and it is still a threat to the ecology and 
environment of Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	So what does a government that managed to do nothing for the 
past two years think it can do in the next two years, when there is an 
election down the road? It makes you wonder.
<P>
	As far as personal security is concerned, that is quite an 
incentive the Canadian government is prepared to provide, when 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="112"> 112 </A></B>
<P>
you realize it is cutting transfer payments  and the government says 
it wants old age pensions based on family income. As for 
unemployment insurance reform, which everyone objects to, the 
minister told us yesterday that he would table the same legislation 
again, with the former minister's promises to amend some very 
minor clauses that will in no way change the principle of the 
Unemployment Insurance Act.
<P>
	Finally, Part III is the most interesting one and also the longest, 
notwithstanding the hon. member opposite, who said earlier that 
my colleague was right to remind him it was the present Canadian 
government that was elected because it said: ``Vote for me, and I 
will never mention the Constitution''. It has been doing just that for 
two years. A bit more than a third of its second throne speech is 
about just that and, since the cabinet shuffle, the ministers have 
been heading off in all directions and we are not even able to figure 
out any more where the government stands on the future of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	However, one thing is that it has acknowledged the 50.4 per cent 
win, which means it would be prepared to acknowledge a yes 
victory of 50.1, as we have always said it must. Perhaps the figure 
could be 50.5, maybe even more. But, and perhaps this is the most 
interesting aspect of this speech, we might be led to conclude that 
the Prime Minister could reverse his antidemocratic stand and 
perhaps accept any outcome in excess of fifty plus one.
<P>
	It is hard for us to swallow, in the post-referendum context, that 
the government is informing us that it will be restricting its 
spending power to some extent with the consent of the majority of 
the provinces, while diverting-I do not wish to make accusations 
of fraud, which might be a little too strong-but I do not know what 
label one can use for taking five billion dollars from someone 
else's pocket, money that does not belong to you and to which you 
have not contributed a red cent, appropriating that money and 
saying: ``These five billion dollars belong to me''.
<P>
	That is more or less what they are doing with the unemployment 
insurance fund. They never put a penny into it, having arranged 
things so that workers and employers were the ones to contribute to 
it, and now they are saying: ``Thanks so much for having 
contributed so generously. You have been such good little workers 
and good little employers that now I am going to take off with the 
surplus as if it were my own. I am going to reduce my deficit, and it 
will not show too much''. In the meantime, it thinks we are not 
aware of it and that the people do not know about it.
<P>
	We are tired of expenditures. In the speech from the throne the 
government says it is still going to spend on programs; it is going to 
double things, but for that it will need the approval of the majority 
of the provinces. Those that do not want to take part can choose the 
famous course of opting out, so long as they meet the standards.  
We can see what it means in the case of the transfer payments at the 
moment, in having to meet health standards with cuts in transfers. 
The provinces are having to cut back in post-secondary education 
and in welfare in an effort to meet, with less money, requirements 
in the area of health first, because they are subject to standards set 
by someone paying less and less of the bill.
<P>
	There is another interesting point here, where it reads-I cannot 
tell you the page number, because it was probably printed quite 
quickly and they forgot to number the pages, but it is on the second 
last page of the French version, top paragraph-and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But as long as the prospect of another Quebec referendum exists, the 
Government will exercise its responsibility to ensure that the debate is 
conducted with all the facts on the table, that the rules of the process are fair, that 
the consequences are clear, and that Canadians, no matter where they live, will 
have their say in the future of their country.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition tried to find out what the 
government meant. One minister says it means a cross-Canada 
referendum, another says it means no such thing. I really wonder 
what else the government should do to make sure all the cards are 
on the table, the rules are fair, and the consequences clear.
<P>
	What did the federal government do during the last two 
referendums, in 1980 and 1995? It spent many millions; we do not 
know exactly how much it spent on these two referendums, and we 
have never been able to find out. As far as clearly outlining the 
consequences, the federal government told fibs to the people of 
Quebec, and used scare tactics; first, there was the Brink's episode; 
then, the elderly were going to lose their pension; troops would 
leave for God knows where; health care would be jeopardized. The 
federal government used every trick in the book.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	In 1980, all departments joined in a vast propaganda campaign. 
We were deluged under tons of propaganda extolling Canada, its 
beauty, greatness, grandeur, wealth, etc.
<P>
	In 1995, the government went so far as to appoint a minister in 
charge of the referendum. Many toured Quebec. In 1980, there was 
the Centre Paul-Sauvé. It could not be used again in 1995 as it had 
been demolished in the meantime. So instead, they went to Verdun. 
One must wonder if there is not some hidden symbolism in the fact 
that Verdun was chosen as the site for a memorable gathering. But 
that was not enough. A great outpouring of love was organized; 
from sea to sea, Canadians came to show their love, taking 
advantage of extremely low fares which were never accounted for 
by the no committee as election expenses.
<P>
	Regarding the next referendum, when the government talks 
about putting all the cards on the table and making sure that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="113"> 113 </A></B>
<P>
consequences are known and the rules are  fair, one has every right 
to wonder whether the House will vote a $50 billion budget for the 
no committee to ensure a victory this time, and give each Quebecer 
a little something so that, when the time comes to vote, they will 
remember where the cheque is coming from.
<P>
	When we witness such things, it is extremely hard to know 
where the government is going and where it wants to take us. It 
makes promises and, the very next day, gives us a distinct society 
which is distinct from nothing at all and is not negotiable, and 
grants us a veto that gives us very little rights. They speak of a 
modern and united country. We certainly have a long way to go 
before we can calls ourselves modern, because our country is 
bankrupt. It is so easy to declare bankruptcy here that you can do it 
one day, turn around and start your own business the next day, and 
nobody will do a thing about it. The rich get richer and the poor get 
poorer.
<P>
	People say we have a great country. Of course it is vast. As far as 
the total area is concerned, it is the largest country in the world 
since the dismantling of the U.S.S.R. Canada is probably a few 
square miles larger than the new Russia. But it is a country which 
does not react to demonstrations. It is a country which does not 
hear its population; it does not see how much people do not agree 
with the current policies of the government, it cannot listen to its 
workers when they say that the new employment insurance is really 
poverty insurance and they do not want it. It was said from coast to 
coast that we do not want that program , yet the government still 
promises to bring back the bill, maybe with a new number and a 
new title.
<P>
	I know my time is almost up, but if you look at the first throne 
speech and at the red book, you can see they amount to several 
pages of unkept promises. If the past is any indication of the future, 
this throne speech offers little hope to Canadians, unfortunately.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. House for giving me the opportunity to participate in 
this most important debate. I feel honoured to be able to offer my 
comments on the government's upcoming policies. I also wish to 
bring to the House what we as elected representatives have heard 
during the last recess in conjunction with the throne speech. In 
order for us to formulate policy and bring forth proposals it is 
important that we convey to our caucus and to our colleagues what 
the people who have elected us and who have given us the 
opportunity to be in the House have to say.
<P>
	As stated in the throne speech 28 months ago, Canadians elected 
a new Parliament and chose a new government. I was one of those 
people newly elected. I felt then as I do now that I have been given 
a great responsibility to represent those who elected me and to 
serve them to the best of my ability.
<P>
	In 1993 I campaigned on the promises made in the now famous 
red book. I felt very strongly that we would make a difference for 
the country, that we would help build a stronger and more united 
and fiscally sound country. I am pleased today to state without a 
doubt that we have to date kept most of our promises.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	In the past two years the Liberal government has delivered on the 
majority of the promises made in our last speech from the throne. 
One of the most important commitments we made was to make 
jobs a major priority. We have remained true to our word to date.
<P>
	I want to repeat a quote from our red book which speaks 
volumes: ``A Liberal government will put jobs and economic 
growth in the forefront of its objectives. We will also take long 
term measures to create jobs and growth by focusing on small and 
medium size businesses, setting the stage for an innovative 
economy, investing in people through training and apprenticeship 
programs, encouraging research and development and fostering 
trade initiatives''.
<P>
	We can only reflect on the unprecedented trade missions the 
government has taken over the last couple of years. They have 
resulted in billions of dollars of contracts and several hundred 
thousand jobs. A couple of weeks ago I was in Apollo Business 
Machines to repair a calculator. A gentleman approached me and 
said: ``We have just opened a facility in the riding of Scarborough 
Centre employing 65 people''. It specializes in refrigeration 
equipment. Had it not been for the trade mission 65 people would 
not be working today. I commend the Prime Minister, Team 
Canada, and I hope this effort continues in the future.
<P>
	As we move from a resource based economy to an information 
based economy the programs we have brought forth will with no 
question prepare the students of today for Canada's future. 
Nevertheless, as these programs unfold we must remember it takes 
two to tango, as we have often heard.
<P>
	Our record in the first half of our mandate speaks volumes. We 
have focused on job growth. The results speak for themselves with 
nearly half a million jobs, two hundred in the past year alone. 
Notice these statistics are not from any Liberal press release. They 
come from the pundits who on a daily basis analyse each move the 
government makes. They come from the media, not from Liberal 
press releases.
<P>
	We have had to date the lowest level of unemployment in the 
past five years and one of the highest growth rates in the industrial 
world. We have worked hard to get the fundamentals right. We 
have reduced the deficit from over 6 per cent of gross domestic 
product in 1993, not to the targeted 3 per cent we initially 
committed to in our red book but, as we heard the other day, to a 
projected 2 per cent by 1997-98.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="114"> 114 </A></B>
<P>
	We have avoided increasing personal income taxes, a promise 
made and another promise kept. We have cut the red tape and 
streamlined government services so that small and medium size 
businesses can concentrate on achieving better productivity.
<P>
	I am also proud to report that we have taken several initiatives to 
help small and medium size businesses, an important issue 
especially in my riding of Scarborough Centre which has an 
abundance of small and medium size businesses on which we 
depend very heavily at the municipal and national levels. These 
businesses are the engine of our economy and we must continue to 
find ways to support their efforts.
<P>
	I was a small businessman prior to entering the political arena. I 
realize how important business is and the role government must 
play. Over the last year and a half the corporate world has asked us 
to streamline our activities, to address our financial problems, to 
reduce the deficit, to downsize government, which we have done in 
a compassionate and humanitarian way.
<P>
	We have streamlined. We have reduced our spending. We have 
done our share. However, as the throne speech indicated, the 
corporate world also has an obligation. The throne speech was not 
just a statement but a signal to the corporate world which I believe 
has not been a good corporate citizen over the last couple of years.
<P>
	There have been record profits. We have all heard the banks have 
been reaching numbers like never before. The automotive 
industries have reached record profits but what is hurting here is 
that these corporations are continuing to downsize. It is just not 
fair. We are allowing the investors, the speculators to trigger the 
economy. What about the average individuals? Where do they go? 
Where do they seek job security and how can they do long term 
planning?
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	I am concerned and I am also extending this challenge to the 
corporate world. I have no problems about companies making 
profits but they have an obligation to offer long term job security to 
the Canadian worker.
<P>
	I have heard from my constituents how they are sick and tired of 
being nickelled and dimed to death by the banks. Everywhere they 
go it is service charge this, service charge that. The banks and the 
financial institutions also have an obligation to lead the way. 
Working together with this administration we will be able to 
recapture a healthy economy.
<P>
	It is not the government's responsibility alone to create jobs. A 
government cannot hire the people but the government's 
responsibility is to create a climate in which business and 
prosperity can flourish. The government has set such an agenda.
<P>
	We can look to the interest rates, the lowest they have been in 
decades. We can look to the deficit reduction that has been 
projected as we hear from the Minister of Finance. We can look at 
the formula unfolding and supporting small and medium size 
businesses. We have done our share. The corporate world once 
again has to step forward. There is, however, only so much that a 
government can do to encourage job creation and job growth. 
Without the help of the private sector the economy will continue to 
stall.
<P>
	The Liberal government has promised that it will continue to 
work alongside the private sector so that more jobs can be created. 
The government's mandate during the second half will continue to 
work with the province as well to bring down the trade barriers 
which are often stumbling blocks in creating more jobs.
<P>
	The partnership the Prime Minister indicated yesterday must be 
a real partnership because everybody can benefit from this type of 
partnership. I am concerned about our youth. I had the opportunity 
recently to speak to several students in my riding. They are 
concerned about their future and about the programs they are now 
into and whether there will be a job for them tomorrow?
<P>
	What I said to the students is, first of all, stay in school, 
complete your education, get the proper skills. I am encouraged 
about the apprenticeship programs the government is now 
enfolding. The co-op program, the training session they would get 
while in school certainly will help them get that first job. Those on 
the job skill sets are crucial to that first job opportunity they are 
seeking.
<P>
	If talking is a remedy, listening makes us a healer. The 
government is listening. Over the last month and a half or so which 
we had the opportunity to spend in our ridings, we heard what the 
people are saying. The throne speech has covered most of those 
areas. I was very pleased to hear that when and if we have another 
referendum, not only Quebecers but the rest of the people in 
Canada will have an opportunity to participate in that debate. I was 
also pleased to hear that the question and the process in the next 
referendum will be transparent, a clear and fair question.
<P>
	I say to my brothers and sisters in Quebec that we have the best 
thing going for us. We have Canada, recognized once again as the 
number one country in the world. We have the skills, we have the 
people, we just simply have to put it in motion.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	In addition to our youth initiatives, we will focus on investments 
in science and technology. This area is the way to go in the future. 
Twenty-five and 35 years ago, 75 per cent of the jobs that were 
created were resource based. Today we are moving onto the 
information highway. High tech is the way to go.
<P>
	In conclusion I congratulate the Prime Minister and this 
government for having the foresight to take this initiative today 
that will benefit the generations of  tomorrow. It is with pleasure 
that I give 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="115"> 115 </A></B>
<P>
my support to all the initiatives that were brought forth in the 
throne speech.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with regard to the hon. member's statement I 
would like to share some of the concerns of my constituents in 
Richmond, B.C.
<P>
	When I talk to my constituents they are worried about their 
future and their children's future. They want the federal 
government to get the deficit under control and they want a say in 
the future of our country. During and after the referendum, people 
in Richmond, British Columbia expressed their frustration at the 
way in which it was conducted. I passed this on to the cabinet and 
my caucus colleagues.
<P>
	This throne speech shows that the federal government is 
listening. Our government has made a commitment to ensure that 
in any future referendum all the facts will be on the table, the rules 
of the process will be fair, the consequences will be clear and that 
all Canadians get a say in the future of their country.
<P>
	The 1996 budget will set out the government's plan for hitting 
deficit reduction targets, bringing the deficit down to 2 per cent of 
gross domestic product in 1997-98 and ensuring that further 
progress is made in 1998-99.
<P>
	Deficit reduction is a major concern of my constituents and I am 
pleased to see that our concerns are being heard. Our government 
has come a long way in reducing the size of the deficit from 6 per 
cent of GDP to 3 per cent, but we still have work to do.
<P>
	On behalf of my constituents I urge the finance minister and the 
government to continue its steady but firm approach to deficit 
reduction to reach our ultimate goal of deficit elimination and 
paying down the debt. This throne speech is an excellent reflection 
of the discussion I have had with constituents about where our 
country should be going.
<P>
	I appreciate the statement from the hon. member and I 
congratulate him for a good statement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think my colleague put it so right. 
We have to address our finances. We have to bring them in order. 
We are on track in doing so, but at the same time I urge this 
government to keep focusing on job creation. The more people that 
are working, the quicker we are going to take care of our deficit.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to rise in the House today to address the 
second throne speech of the 35th Parliament.
<P>
	When our government came to power in October 1993 the 
Canadian people had elected us on a platform of promises and 
commitments to the voters that we believed in strongly enough to 
print boldly for the whole world to see in the famous red book.
<P>
	The greatest commitment that would affect all other 
commitments was to restore financial confidence in Canada and 
reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by the 1996-97 fiscal year.
<P>
	When this government came to power the annual deficit was 
more than $42 billion. By the end of the 1995-96 fiscal year, which 
will end in just a few weeks on March 31, we expect to reach the 
deficit reduction target of approximately $32 billion. We will be on 
target of the original goal and we will by the end of fiscal year 
1996-97 be around a deficit of $25 billion to $27 billion. The 
Minister of Finance has already set new rolling targets to take us 
into the second half of our term and that will reduce the deficit to 2 
per cent of GDP by fiscal year 1997-98. By the turn of the century I 
personally hope to see a deficit of zero and a balanced budget.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	Why is this so important? It is important because it has reduced 
interest rates. It has reduced unemployment. It has reduced 
mortgage rates and has provided a healthier financial environment. 
It is important also to let Canadians know that we have set realistic 
targets and that we have made the tough cuts in spending to meet 
those targets.
<P>
	Our finance minister has shown strong leadership and our 
government has shown great political courage to do the right thing, 
not always the politically popular thing. I am proud to be a member 
of the Standing Committee on Finance and I am equally proud of 
the advice and support that the Canadian people have offered us in 
the consultative process.
<P>
	The kept promise of financial responsibility was of number one 
importance in order to keep the promises of our government 
programs. As well, the greatest promise of all, the all 
encompassing commitment was the contract with the Canadian 
people to insist on the highest standards of integrity and honesty of 
all ministers performing their duties in this 35th Parliament. Our 
Prime Minister has kept that promise.
<P>
	By setting and meeting realistic goals and by delivering an 
honest government with integrity, we have restored credibility and 
confidence in our elected representatives. This is not only good for 
Canada at home but it is very good for us globally as other 
countries view Canada with great respect. What is it about Canada 
that causes other countries and the United Nations to declare it to 
be the number one country in the world to provide the best quality 
of life?
<P>
	We as a government have shown leadership in getting our 
financial house in order, in reducing the public service and in doing 
the business of government more efficiently. Now we can ensure 
the continuance of our highly valued social justice system that 
provides this high quality of life that the world views in awe.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="116"> 116 </A></B>
<P>
	The throne speech highlighted the fact that our government 
respects the values that Canadians hold dear. In respecting those 
values our government must ensure economic opportunity as well 
as security for all Canadians. Economic growth alone does not 
make a nation. Canadians have told us what defines greatness in 
nationhood is: the opportunity to work; the national health care 
system; a fair judicial system; and compassion and respect for all 
human beings to live in one united Canada.
<P>
	We have delivered on what the majority of Canadians asked for 
in the first half of our mandate. Now we are committing to those 
values that Canadians have identified and asked for, values that 
bind this country together in Canadian unity.
<P>
	We are committing to income security for the elderly and the 
availability of old age security and the guaranteed income 
supplement. Measures will be taken in this Parliament to ensure the 
sustainability of our elderly benefits system into the future. Let 
there be no doubt that we will look after our elderly.
<P>
	We are committing to our youth, to double the number of federal 
summer jobs this year immediately, which will help them pay for 
their post-secondary education. We will challenge the private 
sector and other levels of government to create opportunities in 
assisting young people in finding their first job. Our youth must be 
our priority.
<P>
	Recently I was honoured to announce funding to establish a new 
Bachelor of Science degree program in aquaculture, that is fish 
culture, at the Nova Scotia Agriculture College in Truro. This 
program is extremely important to the Atlantic coast as it provides 
an opportunity to train our young people in a new field that has 
tremendous potential for growth in world markets for Canadian 
fish products.
<P>
	We have committed in the throne speech to the five principles of 
the Canadian Health Act. We will work with the provinces to 
ensure the future of our publicly financed health care system which 
remains the number one health care system in the world.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	We have committed to the security and protection of our 
environment and we will modernize the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act. We will introduce an endangered species protection 
act and legislation to ratify the UN straddling stocks agreement and 
the law of the sea convention.
<P>
	Canada will continue to participate in the G-7, in NATO and in 
the United Nations for a more stable and peaceful world. We will 
commit to advancing human rights and the dignity of all people. 
We will work vigorously to eliminate the exploitation of child 
labour and child prostitution throughout the world.
<P>
	Many people listening to my voice today will know that very 
often I speak in this House on issues on rural Canada. I was very 
pleased to see that this throne speech addresses the problems facing 
rural Canada and acknowledges the fact that our government must 
tailor policies to meet those needs.
<P>
	Quite often the problems of urban centres overshadow rural 
needs and we lose sight of the great richness of the human 
resources and the great contributions made by rural people to this 
country. The Prime Minister has heard our voice speaking on 
behalf of rural Canada. I feel confident that he recognizes that in a 
strong, united Canada we must ensure that both rural and urban 
needs are met and that both rural and urban Canadians benefit from 
the wealth of this great country and share in its economic 
prosperity. I look forward to seeing the words rural Canada 
becoming key words in all of our policy proposals in this session of 
Parliament.
<P>
	These past two years have created much anxiety as many 
programs were cut to take swift action against the deficit. It has not 
been easy for anyone and it is not over. I am sure members will 
agree that had we not taken the prudent steps of compassion, if we 
had taken the steps of slash and burn as recommended by some 
parties, it would have been even more painful. We have shown 
compassion while being responsible and accountable in fiscal 
matters.
<P>
	There is still much to be done. When the hon. Minister of 
Finance presents his budget next Wednesday afternoon, we will 
need the co-operation and the continued trust of the Canadian 
people. We need their support so that we can create the economic 
climate for investment and job creation while still funding 
programs that represent Canadian values.
<P>
	We will serve the Canadian people in the second half of our 
mandate with the same integrity, honesty and dedication as we have 
in the past two years. We will pass legislation that ensures and 
serves all Canadians with a sense of fairness and equality in a 
united Canada.
<P>
	I look forward to hearing the views from my constituents of 
Cumberland-Colchester. I thank them for giving me the privilege 
of serving them in this 35th Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with my colleague from Edmonton 
Southwest.
<P>
	I am pleased to rise in the House to reply to the speech from the 
throne. I might start by saying that some of what I heard in the 
throne speech, such as the government pledge toward the 
devolution of power, was encouraging. Unfortunately, it also 
appears that once again this government is relying on reworked 
policies from the failed Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords. 
Once again it is relying on half measures.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="117"> 117 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not know what it is about this government but it cannot 
seem to bite the bullet on any of the big issues that face us, 
whether it is really coming to grips with the justice system, the 
Young Offenders Act, the debt, the deficit or parliamentary 
democracy. These things are not confronted in proper style. It is 
half measures and that is all that we are about to get.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	I was also disappointed that the speech contained such vague and 
fleeting references to a subject that I have tried very hard to 
implement since being elected in 1993. I speak here of 
participatory democracy.
<P>
	The speech mentioned this subject on only two occasions. With 
reference to national unity, the government says in the speech: 
``The government welcomes public participation in the debate 
about Canada''. It goes on to say: ``Canadians no matter where they 
live will have their say in the future of their country''. Good words. 
I would that the government would invoke them and truly reach out 
to the people of Canada and say we want your opinion.
<P>
	I have heard the Deputy Prime Minister on the one hand saying 
one thing about the possibility of going to the people of Canada in a 
referendum on national unity and I hear the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs saying something quite different. I have 
heard the same dichotomy between the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. I would that the government 
could make up its mind. Does it want to go to the people or does it 
not?
<P>
	The government puts forward nice words but if we examine the 
Liberal track record it is quite clear that they have little meaning.
<P>
	In the 1994 throne speech two years ago the Liberals promised: 
``A national forum on health, chaired by the Prime Minister, will be 
established to foster, in co-operation with the provinces, a national 
public dialogue on the renewal of Canada's health system''. That 
was the promise made two years ago in the throne speech. In reality 
that committee met only once, said nothing and will not report 
before the next election.
<P>
	While this in itself is evidence of the government's 
unwillingness to keep its promises, the February 13 Calgary <I>Herald</I> 
report on the forum's visit to Calgary shows the Liberal's promise 
of public dialogue was nothing more than lip service. According to 
that report the health forum consultations are ``restricted to 
selected participants and are closed to the public and the media''. 
So much for consulting with the public.
<P>
	The government is not living up to the promises it has made and 
it is certainly not interested in participatory democracy.
<P>
	While I am saddened by this turn of events, I am certainly not 
surprised, for this government often talks of  involving Canadians 
in the decision making process but seldom walks the talk. Instead 
we have a Prime Minister who punishes his own MPs who have the 
nerve to vote the will of their constituents on issues such as gun 
control or sexual orientation. In fact he has even gone so far as to 
threaten not to sign nomination papers for those in the Liberal 
caucus who have the integrity or nerve to vote on behalf of their 
constituents rather than blindly toe the party line.
<P>
	To someone who believes as strongly as I do in participatory 
democracy, these actions are an affront to the very principles of 
democracy. Yet to the Prime Minister it is just business as usual. 
What else should we expect from a man who feels his views are 
more important than those of the people who elected him?
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	Two years ago on February 16, in response to a question from a 
Reform colleague on the issue of voting the will of constituents, the 
Prime Minister said: ``This notion that we should be replaced by 
polling is revolting to me''. How interesting that what I see as the 
legitimate right of Canadians our Prime Minister views as 
revolting.
<P>
	Based on these example, I fear that even the vague government 
promises of consultation contained in this throne speech are merely 
more Liberal smoke and mirrors.
<P>
	However, against the remote possibility that the Liberals are now 
willing to live up to their promises of consulting, I would like to 
offer them some advice on how true participatory democracy 
works. For the past two years, voters in my riding of 
Nanaimo-Cowichan have had an opportunity to express their 
views on numerous issues through the use of a telephone voting 
system.
<P>
	On a monthly basis, voters respond to questions posed on the 
public opinion survey system. Their input helps guide me on both 
local and national issues. It has also assisted me in the decision 
making process on such issues as international travel by MPs.
<P>
	My constituents, indeed all Canadians, deserve to be heard in the 
House and all of us have a duty to do what we can to make this 
process as simple and as transparent as possible. That is why I have 
taken the basic voting system that I have just described to the next 
level. Through the use of state of the art Canadian made computer 
software, participatory democracy is fast becoming a way of life 
for voters in Nanaimo-Cowichan.
<P>
	As a result of the initial vote late last year, I will soon be 
introducing a private member's bill in the House calling for a 
national referendum on reinstatement of capital punishment as part 
of the next general election. Again, reach out to the people, get 
their opinions and then do something about it. This will be the 
second private member's bill that I put forward after soliciting the 
input of my constituents.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="118"> 118 </A></B>
<P>
	Next month, my constituents will have their say in the unity 
issue as participatory democracy takes yet another step forward 
in Nanaimo-Cowichan. I will once again bring their views 
forward to the House. Since I am a believer in true democracy 
it is my duty to do so, even though the Prime Minister feels that 
such behaviour is revolting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first I would like to congratulate my hon. colleague for his 
fine speech. I would also like to tell the House that my hon. friend 
is displaying some of the finest elements of democracy by asking 
his constituents what they think about the issues of the day and 
enabling them to have an effective role in this House through their 
elected member. Other members of Parliament should take heed of 
what my hon. friend has done in his riding and in how he employs 
those ideas.
<P>
	My hon. colleague brought before us an area that is of some 
great concern to me professionally and also to members that live on 
the same island as both of us. In fact, it affects all Canadians: health 
care in this country.
<P>
	One of the great disappointments of the throne speech was its 
inability to put forward any constructive solutions to the problems 
affecting the health and welfare of Canadians. The situation is 
unsustainable, which has been admitted by both the government 
and all members of this House. It cannot continue to go on as is. 
When it falls apart, it will only hurt those who are in greatest need, 
those who are sick.
<P>
	We have to put forward constructive solutions to put publicly 
funded health care on a long term sustainable footing. I saw 
nothing about that in the throne speech. It is a great disservice for 
us to sit here and argue on the basis of philosophical grounds to 
maintain the Canada Health Act as a status quo. The government 
has mentioned that it does not want the status quo but it has not 
provided any alternatives.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Does my hon. colleague support choice in health care, enabling 
Canadians to choose alternative ways of getting health care through 
a two-tiered system which would enable them to buy their health 
care if they so choose while maintaining the status quo in publicly 
funded health care. This would give individuals the ability to get 
their health care free of charge in a publicly funded health care 
system but in a health care system that provided all Canadians with 
essential services in a timely fashion? Would my hon. colleague 
support such a move?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to my colleague, 
absolutely. If we have the ability for Canadians who have money to 
go and purchase health care that they wish, it would simply shorten 
the line for other Canadians who are forced to stand in line.
<P>
	The government is unable to give the subsidies to the provinces 
that they require, therefore the lines get longer and longer. It would 
shorten the lines.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to join this debate, the first in this second 
session of the 35th Parliament.
<P>
	I would like to confine my comments on the throne speech 
debate to two items that in my opinion are serious land mines in the 
future of our country. These are land mines planted by the 
government and referred to in the throne speech that, sooner or 
later, our country will encounter going down this road and boom, 
we are going to have an explosion the likes of which we have not 
envisioned.
<P>
	The problems to which I refer are two. That is the notion of 
enshrining within our Constitution a veto and the concept of 
distinct society.
<P>
	When I was first elected a couple of years ago, along with 
everyone here, I received a letter from a constituent. The 
constituent's letter was to wish me well. It was a letter of support. 
The constituent wrote in the body of that letter that there are two 
kinds of people who get involved in politics. There are politicians 
and statesmen. The distinction was drawn between a politician and 
a statesman thus: a politician thinks about the next election and a 
statesman about the next generation.
<P>
	I thought about the words and the feeling put into that letter by 
that family from Edmonton Southwest. A thought occurred to me 
as I was watching my four and a half year old grandson last week as 
he was speaking on cellular phone to his uncle at the same time as 
he was shutting down a Windows '95 program on a computer. He is 
four and a half years old.
<P>
	I was thinking about our responsibility as statesmen, what my 
responsibility is as a statesman and what our collective 
responsibility is to future generations. Our responsibility is not to 
our grandparents. Our responsibility is to our grandchildren. Our 
responsibility is to the future, not to the past and that is where we 
should have our eyes firmly fixed.
<P>
	I was thinking about my responsibility to my grandson and to our 
grandchildren, the future generations of Canada. I was thinking 
about this veto. I was thinking, what does that do? I put it into the 
context of the great debate that raged in the land south of us in the 
United States.
<P>
	About 220 years ago, they were in the midst of putting together 
their constitution. It starts with the words: ``We, the people-''. 
One of the architects of the American constitution, Thomas 
Jefferson, had as one of his primary advisers a man by the name of 
Thomas Paine, who wrote the book that many will know, <I>The </I>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="119"> 119 </A></B>
<P>
Rights of Man. I believe the central thesis is contained in the 
phrase: ``Each generation has the right and the responsibility to 
govern for its time and should no more  bind future generations 
than past generations should bind today''. He referred to the notion 
of binding future generations to decisions of today as the greatest 
tyranny of all, the tyranny of ruling from beyond the grave.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	We in our generation and the generation that preceded us are 
already ruling from the grave in one respect. We will be saddling 
future generations with a debt we ran up, a debt we used so we 
could live beyond our means and live better today at the expense of 
future generations of Canadians. That is wrong. That is tyranny.
<P>
	To put a veto for any particular group, no matter how well 
meaning or no matter how well deserving, into the Constitution of 
the country binds future generations to decisions of today. It will be 
virtually impossible to change our Constitution. The beauty and the 
majesty of a Constitution is its ability to change and to evolve, to 
represent the people of today.
<P>
	By putting a Constitutional veto into our Constitution we remove 
the ability of future generations to adapt and to change the 
Constitution and our relationship one with another in the future.
<P>
	What is the natural consequence of removing the ability to 
accommodate change in the future? Imagine today if we did not 
have the ability to evolve, to change the relationship one province 
to another. Would we be able to even sit at a table with Quebec and 
say this is how we think we can make the country work better for 
everyone? We would be removing the ability to be flexible in the 
future. That is a significant road block, a significant land mine in 
the future destiny of the country.
<P>
	In the immediate future the effect of a veto for regions in the 
country that do not include every single coequal province is this. I 
guarantee House and the people of Canada that the day Albertans 
become second class citizens because we do not have a veto, just as 
the individual provinces in the maritimes do not have a veto, or the 
Northwest territories or Saskatchewan or Manitoba, all hell is 
going to break loose.
<P>
	Guess what, folks? We in Alberta get to give, give, give: ``You 
are just about equal but you do not have a veto like everybody else. 
You do not have a veto like Quebec, but by the way, send money''. 
How long do we think that will last? That is a very real and a very 
significant problem which the government does not seem to want 
to address.
<P>
	It is wrong for future generations because it ties their hands; it 
makes it impossible to change. It is wrong because it puts a red flag 
in front of one of the most prosperous, dynamic provinces in the 
country which will be so upset that if the government thinks it has a 
problem with Quebec, it will look back at its problems with Quebec 
now as the good old days. I guarantee that is what will happen.
<P>
	I did a little figuring the other day. The Prime Minister once 
again mentioned that he has been in the House for 32 years, which 
is quite remarkable. I added the number of hours in 32 years. If we 
divide the number of hours he has been an elected politician by our 
national debt it works out to $2,090,000 an hour for every hour he 
has been elected. We cannot stand any more of that. It is too 
expensive. We must have some fiscally responsive leadership. Two 
million dollars an hour for the last 32 years; that is our national 
debt.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	The other real problem is distinct society. I am not raising this 
for the first time. I have raised it before and I use as my authority of 
the problems with distinct society Eugene Forsey. Eugene Forsey, 
as many people know, was Canada's pre-eminent constitutional 
scholar. There is no single Canadian acknowledged to have a better 
understanding or who has done more work in determining or 
considering what brought Canada together.
<P>
	Eugene Forsey left the New Democratic Party at its founding 
convention because the New Democratic Party embraced the 
notion of two nations. He could not abide that and he left the party 
because of it. The New Democratic Party at the time was trying to 
make inroads in Quebec. It figured that if it embraced the notion of 
two nations somehow it would help. Look what happened to the 
New Democratic Party in Quebec-nothing. It did not help.
<P>
	Eugene Forsey constitutionally went right back to ground zero 
and the Fathers of Confederation, especially the French speaking 
Fathers of Confederation, including Cartier. They made the point 
that Canada did not work as two separate entities. That was the 
whole reason we came together.
<P>
	Let me read a quote from his book: ``The Canadian Fathers of 
Confederation, French speaking, English speaking, made it plain 
emphatically in both languages that they considered they were 
founding a new nation, a single great nation, a political nationality 
independent of national origin. Cartier and Macdonald spoke of 
joining these five peoples into one nation''. The five peoples being 
the French, English, Irish, Scottish and others, perhaps the 
aboriginals.
<P>
	He added: ``We make the confederation one people and one 
government instead of five peoples and five governments, with 
local governments and legislatures subordinate to the central 
government and legislator''.
<P>
	Mr. Forsey said if we recognized a distinct society for anyone, it 
is not to say we do not understand there are differences in Canada, 
that we have special status for different provinces. We do. The 
maritimes have special status. Different provinces have different 
requirements. To base a distinct society on race and language is in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="120"> 120 </A></B>
<P>
itself  racist tribalism. That is the bottom line. If we have a country 
based on race and language, that is what it is.
<P>
	Eugene Forsey's point was that the minute we as a nation give 
the official imprimatur to the notion of two nations, we are giving it 
legitimacy. Guess what? He was right. We gave the nation of two 
nations legitimacy. Now we will give distinct society legitimacy so 
that every law, every consideration based on the province of 
Quebec will be based on its notion as a distinct society. It might as 
well be a different country.
<P>
	What we are trying to do is form a country of equal people in 
equal provinces where equality is the defining feature, not 
differences. We need to get rid of the hyphens.
<P>
	There are a lot of things in this throne speech, most of which are 
motherhood window dressing that do not mean a whole heck of a 
lot.
<P>
	In debate we have heard from time to time references to the fact 
that government has cut back all this spending and how it did its 
part and now it is up to the private sector to carry its burden. To 
some degree that is correct. The problem is that the cuts really have 
not taken place yet and the business of the private sector is to create 
profit. Profit is not a dirty word.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	When corporations make a profit and if their profits are 
excessive what we should be doing is ensuring there is competition 
because competition keeps prices down. Competition prevents 
excessive profits and creates employment.
<P>
	Let us be very cognizant that we are in real trouble with distinct 
society and the veto.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my colleague mentioned competition. I do not think anybody is 
against competition. I do not think anybody is against corporations 
making profit. However, when we look at the consolidation and the 
financial institutions today, they are trying to move in on the 
insurance industry. We are talking about thousands of jobs in 
communities that have been served for years.
<P>
	What is the member's answer to that? What is his answer to the 
banks and auto companies making profits, although I am glad they 
are? How does he respond to the downsizing still taking place 
today?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, we cannot on one hand say we 
want to have the most efficient world class industries and 
businesses and on the other hand say by the way, do not make a 
profit. The business of business is business.
<P>
	Let us talk about the banks because banks are organizations that 
people love to hate, by and large with good reason. Why are the 
banks making these outrageous profits? Are they making these 
profits because of their lending practices or because they are so 
smart at what  they do and they are finding opportunities to make 
money? Partly. However, every time we go to the bathroom we end 
up paying the banks something somehow. It is like a utility. They 
have service charges on everything. There is a service charge for 
opening the door. They are also making huge profits because of the 
amount of credit we are all using through bank credit cards.
<P>
	One of the reasons business is slow is the per capita consumer 
debt in Canada is 88 per cent of the average Canadian's expendable 
income. Everybody is in debt. Ten years ago it was 65 per cent.
<P>
	The way to ensure there are not obscene profits in any industry is 
to ensure fair, open competition. Bank are owned by shareholders 
who then get the profits and reinvest in the country. If we think the 
banks are making too much money, let us open up the flood gates of 
competition.
<P>
	I do not think the banks should be in the direct selling of 
insurance unless insurance companies can be in direct selling of 
banking. We can open up the competition of the banking industry to 
everybody in the insurance business by saying if you want to be in 
business, fine, get in the business. However, the new people who 
get into business should not do it on the backs of the taxpayers. If I 
am to get involved in a business I should be paying for that. I 
should be able to reap some of the rewards and I should be able to 
keep some of the profits, which is the nature of free enterprise.
<P>
	It seems when we get involved in and start talking about this we 
have to look at our tax system. We need to see if everything in our 
tax system motivates people to invest and risk their lives, their 
livelihood, their security and their capital in getting more, which 
then creates employment. That is the kind of foundation we should 
have if we want to create jobs. We need a foundation that rewards 
entrepreneurship, risk and initiative. We do not need a foundation 
that rewards passive investment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my hon. colleague mentioned the tribalism that has 
descended into the country through offers such as 
constitutionalizing the distinct society clause and vetoes to one 
province and not to others.
<P>
	What would he would do to bring Canada together under the 
framework of equality for all Canadians?
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, what we have to do is stop this 
whole notion of lists. We are all equal by virtue of the fact that we 
are human beings.
<P>
	When we gathered under the oak tree and decided that for our 
mutual comfort and support we were going to have governance and 
that we were going to work as equals together for this governance, 
we did not say: ``Oh, by the way, you are going to be separate 
because  of the colour of your skin, your sexual orientation or 
because you are male or female''. We said that for our common 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="121"> 121 </A></B>
<P>
good as human beings we were going to come together and have 
governance.
<P>
	In my opinion that would be the single thing we should do to 
make us work together and to say we are all equal, period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my colleague from St. 
Boniface.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity to speak in response to the speech 
from the throne, no doubt the last before the next federal election. I 
would like to focus on some areas that I find especially important.
<P>
	Much has been said about the values, the beliefs, the hopes, the 
expectations and the personal and community goals that we all 
share. Being common to most of us, they act as a unifying force 
that helps to give us a sense of identity, a distinct perception of 
what it is to be Canadian.
<P>
	I expect and anticipate that my friends, my neighbours and my 
fellow citizens would be as compassionate, understanding and as 
caring about others as is humanly and realistically possible.
<P>
	The term others has far reaching connotations. It is a word that 
includes everyone. No one is excluded because of race, religion, 
colour, ethnicity, sexual orientation or political affiliation.
<P>
	Thus I turn to the Liberal Party of Canada, the only political 
party that is broad minded and all encompassing in its basic beliefs 
and policies to include all Canadians from sea to sea to sea. All 
other political parties cater to the agendas of special interest groups 
at the expense of all other Canadians.
<P>
	Members can see why I am pleased in general with the content of 
the speech from the throne. It continues to build on that stable, 
solid foundation of liberalism that has been maintained and 
reinforced by not only the present Liberal government but by all 
Liberal governments in the past.
<P>
	In particular I am proud of our commitment to aid Canadian 
youth in their quest for employment. We will be implementing 
initiatives which will allow our youth to make the move from 
school to the workforce. We will also be doubling the number of 
federal student summer jobs this year.
<P>
	By working with private sector employers, we can offer youth 
more opportunities to obtain much needed work experience. We all 
know that when one has work experience one's chances of finding 
employment are greatly improved.
<P>
	However, it is quite evident that we have reached the point in our 
society where all our formal educational institutions, the 
elementary schools, the private colleges,  the public colleges and 
universities, our high schools, the private sector, all our agents in 
the private sector and employers must search for creative 
techniques and ventures to produce more jobs for the youth of the 
country. It can be done.
<P>
	I warn all those concerned that we will never solve the problems 
of today and the immediate future by using the strategies and the 
principles of the past. We want our young people working and that 
is why we are following up with these initiatives. I am confident 
that the opposition parties will support the government in its job 
creation strategies.
<P>
	Having implemented a successful strategy for deficit reduction, 
we must be careful not to lose sight of or be insensitive to the 
consequences of our policies. We must not be pushed by the 
self-serving, self-centred and shallow agendas of the opposing 
political parties. We must carefully plan with the input from as 
many of those affected as possible.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	I am proud to announce that in the past two years the government 
has clearly indicated not only to the people of this country but to a 
great number of interested parties in a variety of countries who are 
really concerned and interested how we get the public involved. 
From the level of standing committees to the small forums that 
each of us has in our constituencies, information has been flowing. 
This information has been analysed, absorbed and has had a great 
impact on many of the policies the government has put forth in the 
last two years. This dynamic democratic process will continue with 
our support.
<P>
	The throne speech has reassured Canadians that we will maintain 
a highly cherished social safety net. Introducing improvements and 
efficiencies in our social assistance programs will ensure their 
preservation. This is a task that the government is keen to take up 
with great vigour.
<P>
	We will preserve the most envied health care system in the 
world. We will preserve a system of employment insurance. We 
will preserve the Canada pension plan. These are commitments the 
government, my Liberal administration and any Liberal 
administration would adhere to as a matter of ideological principle. 
However, our programs are not stagnant. They are dynamic and 
continually change to meet the needs and demands for reform.
<P>
	I have received letters from constituents in my riding of Thunder 
Bay-Atikokan that praise us for having met so many red book 
commitments. Three-quarters of the promises have been 
successfully achieved, while others are yet to be carried through to 
fruition. The federal government is dedicated to keeping its 
promises. For example, it is committed to replace the GST. It is 
committed to a national child care program as well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="122"> 122 </A></B>
<P>
	Over the past two years Canadians have consulted as to what 
should be done with the GST. Our countrymen have expressed 
their support for having federal and provincial sales taxes 
harmonized. However, it is extremely difficult for the federal 
government to act without provincial co-operation in this respect.
<P>
	This difficulty also exists in the case of national child care. The 
red book indicates the importance of establishing child care across 
the country. However, once again we cannot act alone. The support 
of our provincial counterparts is essential in this matter. It is for 
this reason that progress on some commitments may at times 
appear to be developing at a slower rate than we might like.
<P>
	The apparent difficulty of obtaining the necessary co-operation 
in joint ventures has influenced to a degree the federal 
government's decision to keep away from creating new, shared cost 
programs in areas of provincial jurisdiction without the consent of 
the majority of the provinces.
<P>
	I would also like to discuss some of our citizenship and 
immigration policy initiatives. As a member of the Standing 
Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, I am aware of the need 
to introduce legislation which will revamp the Citizenship Act, an 
act which has not been revised since 1977. These changes will 
make the process of citizenship that much more efficient and fairer. 
Moreover, these changes will reflect current Canadian views of the 
rights and responsibilities of citizenship. This will hopefully also 
serve to remind Canadians of what we have in common.
<P>
	This is a very important point because we share a lot in common 
as Canadians. That we have two official languages and a diversity 
of cultures does not mean that we are significantly different from 
each other in the ways that really matter. Quite the contrary; it is 
these differences and diversities that serve to bring us together. 
Quite the contrary; it is these differences and diversities that serve 
to bring us together.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	The federal government believes that differences can serve to 
bring us closer together while at the same time acknowledging the 
distinctiveness of Quebec. The throne speech clearly indicated that 
Quebec is different in some respects from other regions of the 
country.
<P>
	It is my opinion that the underlying theme in last Tuesday's 
throne speech was one of common sense in that we are building on 
our differences to ensure a strong and united Canada, common 
sense in that we are on our way to getting our financial house in 
order, building a stable foundation-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully to the speech of my hon. colleague. I  regret to have to tell 
him that he is merely the mouthpiece of this government, which is 
quite good at improvising.
<P>
	It has improvised on job creation. It had said that, yes, it would 
create jobs, but did not elaborate, did not say how it was going to 
do that. How is the gouvernment going to remove the barriers to 
job creation, how is it going to put Canadians and Quebecers back 
to work? It does not say.
<P>
	Nor does it say a word about contradictory statements by ions 
between the words of various ministers regarding Quebec 
partitioning. I would have liked to hear what my colleague has to 
say on the subject. Does he share the point of view of the Minister 
of the Intergovernmental Affairs who, by the way, was contradicted 
by several members of the Cabinet regarding Quebec partitioning? 
I would like his opinion on the subject.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dromisky:</B> Mr. Speaker, regarding the creation of jobs, I 
think my colleague from Quebec is quite aware that the federal 
government in essence does not create jobs by itself. It is a 
co-operative venture, as was clearly indicated by the infrastructure 
program we initiated two years ago. It was extremely successful 
and produced over half a million new jobs in this great country of 
ours. Even the province of Quebec benefited immensely from that 
infrastructure program.
<P>
	However, as I pointed out in my delivery, it is a co-operative 
venture. It is the needs that are identified and have to be catered to 
by the people who are involved.
<P>
	In the province of Quebec I am anticipating that not only might 
all three levels of government be involved in a co-operative venture 
but that the people who are employing and the employees 
themselves through their various agencies and associations may 
have the opportunity to contribute to this decision making process. 
The people in the community may also have the opportunity to 
contribute.
<P>
	What I have said is clearly indicated in my speech. We must 
change our ways of the past. We must not have the same 
expectations that one authority, one government is totally 
responsible for the creation of jobs. This government, in 
co-operative efforts with all other levels and all other agents, must 
work together to create those jobs. This is a completely different 
approach to the job creation philosophy versus the philosophy of 
job creation that we have maintained in this country for so many 
years.
<P>
	We are active participants in a very co-operative, dynamic 
venture. We hope that citizens as well as the various levels of 
government in the province of Quebec and in all other provinces 
will join in a united effort to help nurture and create the kinds of 
jobs our young people and others need to meet the challenges of the 
next century.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to stand in the House today to make a number of 
comments with respect to the speech from the throne.
<P>
	Recognizing that as a member of the government I might be 
tempted to be somewhat generous in my commentary, I decided to 
approach it in a unique way. I have looked at what a number of 
newspapers have said. I have selected excerpts from various 
articles. I have some from almost 20 newspapers across the nation.
<P>
	The first is from the <I>Guardian</I> in Prince Edward Island. It refers 
to the speech from the throne as a ``take charge throne speech''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	What did <I>Le Soleil</I> say? ``A government which governs follows 
the quality criteria expected in such a message at mid-term. It 
gives, in a surprisingly clear and precise way, the objectives the 
government will follow, but it keeps practical details for the future. 
Jean Chrétien decided to show a Canada that works''.
<P>
	And <I>Le Devoir</I>, what did it say? ``Will give priority to children's 
rights''.
<P>
	<I>Le Droit</I>: ``Good speech and ambitious program''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The <I>Gazette</I>: ``Ottawa outlines a promising unity plan. Throne 
speech promises to end illusions''.
<P>
	The Toronto <I>Star</I>: ``Chrétien program should rally nation''. 
``Welcome words. The Liberal government hit all the right notes in 
the throne speech: promises to strengthen the economy, maintain 
social programs and promote national unity''.
<P>
	The <I>Financial Post</I>: ``Economy key in throne speech''.
<P>
	The <I>Globe and Mail</I>: ``The throne speech promised the 
government will work with the private sector and provinces to 
make the collective investment required to produce hope, growth 
and jobs. But it will also be compassionate toward the losers''. It 
goes on to say: ``Spend on jobs, Prime Minister tells business.'' We 
have heard a bit about that.
<P>
	The Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>: ``In the main, this is the best course to 
re-establish Canadian unity: improve the governing of the 
federation, confront the separatists head on and avoid futile 
arguments about constitutional amendment''. Again: ``Liberals 
tackle reform of pension system.'' And again: ``shows the 
government is aware that Canadians are worried about finding a 
job, getting a pension and continuing to live in a united 
country-the government promises to tackle these problems''.
<P>
	The Winnipeg <I>Free Press</I>: ``Liberals face child poverty''.
<P>
	The Saskatoon <I>Star Phoenix</I>: ``Premier Romanow says the 
throne speech is positive''. ``The federal government is giving up 
powers to the provinces to keep the country together, but will play 
hardball if there is another Quebec referendum''.
<P>
	The Regina <I>Leader Post</I>: ``Saskatchewan Premier Roy 
Romanow-saying Chrétien seems to see Confederation as a true 
partnership''.
<P>
	The Edmonton <I>Journal</I>: ``Government willing to give up powers 
but vows to get tough if separatists force another vote''.
<P>
	The Calgary <I>Herald</I>: ``Throne speech puts Canadian youth 
first''.
<P>
	The Calgary <I>Sun</I>: ``Unity message delivered''.
<P>
	The <I>Province</I> in Vancouver: ``The feds vowed yesterday to play 
less of a role in several areas in an effort to beef up provincial 
responsibilities and national unity''.
<P>
	The Vancouver <I>Sun</I> says: ``Promises for the future at home and 
abroad''. ``A helping hand and an era of co-operation are promised 
in throne speech.'' ``The federal government's continuing 
commitment to deficit reduction is essential and most welcome.''
<P>
	I did not say that, nor did my colleagues on the government side. 
Those are excerpts and headlines from various articles which 
appeared across this nation in response to the speech from the 
throne.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is what people without any connection with the government 
said.
<P>
	As we can see, their messages are quite different from the one we 
get from the people opposite.
<P>
	Now I would like to review briefly some of the subjects, some of 
the themes which were identified by the government. First of all a 
strong economy. The government will work with the private sector 
and the provinces to make collective investments to create hope, 
growth and jobs.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Youth is another theme. The government will challenge the 
provinces and the private sector to enter into a domestic Team 
Canada-like partnership to foster hope, create opportunities and 
create jobs for our young people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	With respect to business involvement in national economic 
rejuvenation it goes on to say the government has issued a call to 
the business community to join with the government to create jobs 
for Canadians. Profitable firms are challenged to channel some of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="124"> 124 </A></B>
<P>
their revenues  into job creation. Jobs for all Canadians and in 
particular firms are challenged to help create job opportunities for 
youth. Jobs for all Canadians and in particular for youth.
<P>
	We are simply asking the business community to respond to 
some of the polling data which shows that over 90 per cent of 
Canadians worry about the problems young people have entering 
the labour market. We believe that the private sector can make a 
significant contribution. The government is acting on its part by 
creating a positive economic environment and doubling the funds 
for youth summer jobs.
<P>
	Perhaps I can summarize this issue best by quoting today's 
Winnipeg <I>Free Press</I>: ``But the most compelling bit was the direct 
challenge to corporate Canada to put its profits to work, to reinvest 
in the people who generate those profits and to take a more active 
role in creating jobs for Canadians. Private sector leaders cannot 
ignore the challenge. They have been silent about jobs for too long. 
It is time their voices, and their pocketbooks, were heard''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As I just mentioned, business plays a vital role in stimulating the 
economy is vital. We must create jobs for all Canadians. In 
particular, we must focus on young people who are unemployed, 
but who are well qualified, who have a number of diplomas and all 
sorts of skills, but who cannot reach their full potential.
<P>
	That is what we must do and we are only asking the business 
community to respond to what Canadians have said. Canadians 
want the private sector to get more involved. It is fine to make 
profits, but these profits must be used for the well-being of Canada 
and its citizens. That is the role the private sector must play; it 
cannot and must not overlook it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Science and technology is another important theme. We all know 
that research and development is the key to success. It is the key to 
success in terms of jobs. It is the key to success in terms of getting 
the edge on the competition, on being competitive. It is the key to 
success to being in the forefront, to being leaders rather than 
followers.
<P>
	The government is undertaking a number of initiatives. It will 
launch a Canadian technology network to facilitate our growth in 
that area. It will continue to expand access to SchoolNet and 
community access programs. Those are but two of the initiatives in 
that area.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As I just mentioned, science and technology is a key to creating 
jobs and ensuring that we are leaders rather than followers.
<P>
	We should also identify another theme, trade. You certainly 
know that the Prime Minister of Canada, with a  number of 
premiers from the provinces and territories, travelled outside the 
country to promote Canada, to sell our services and products. It has 
to be realized that for every billion dollars of exports, we create 
11,000 jobs. Every billion dollars of exports means 11,000 jobs.
<P>
	When we look at what the Prime Minister and Team Canada 
have done, we realize that almost $20 billion in contracts were 
signed. Some pessimists will say: ``What good will a signature 
do?'' I guarantee that most of these contracts will materialize. Do 
not forget that for every billion dollars of contracts, 11,000 jobs are 
created for Canadians.
<P>
	There will be other Team Canada missions. There will be others, 
and they will yield roughly the same results, perhaps even better 
results.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is also the necessity to create a climate for economic 
growth and job creation. My colleagues across the way who are 
concerned about the deficit and the debt will no doubt recognize 
that we have made some significant progress. Of course we have 
not made as much as we would have liked, but we have made some 
progress. What offends me and offends Canadians is that they are 
unwilling to accept that. Of course they are unwilling to accept that 
because if they were to accept it, their very existence which has 
been put into question several times would absolutely come to an 
end.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	So what has happened? In the 1996 budget we expect to reduce 
the deficit to 2 per cent of the GDP by 1997-98 and we will. We are 
currently having discussions to try to ensure that the GST is 
harmonized with other taxes and that will be realized. Here again 
people will ask for miracles. People will say we should snap our 
fingers and it ought to be done. That is what the Reform Party 
philosophy is all about: simplistic solutions to complex problems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As for the security of Canadians, the gouvernment will ensure 
that the Canadian health system remains viable and accessible. It 
will ensure the survival of a public pension plan and ensure that 
Canadians are secure in their homes and in their communities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We want a secure social safety net and we will work toward that 
end with a great deal of enthusiasm and energy.
<P>
	I do wish I had more time because I can tell that my colleagues 
across the way would have loved to have heard what I had to say in 
the area of personal security. We are going to focus on high risk 
offenders.

	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
shame that my colleague took three-quarters of his time to quote 
some headlines. Of course, he picked those he found most 
appropriate, because he knew that if he were to go over everything 
that has been said or written since the throne speech, he would find 
that 25 per cent of the headlines are for the government and 75 per 
cent are against.
<P>
	I will try to get from him an answer to a question I put to one of 
his colleagues earlier. It is the same question. Given the 
contradictory statements by ministers on the issue of partition, 
could my colleague tell the House if he agrees with the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, there were several points to be 
made about the little speech we just heard.
<P>
	The first is on quotations. My colleague says that 75 per cent of 
the headlines are against the government and 25 per cent are for the 
government. It would then appear that I only read from the 25 per 
cent in support of the government. It is not true at all. The hon. 
member should prove what he claims. I do not believe him. I am 
not trying to impugn his motives, but I think he is having trouble 
with figures this morning for some reason. Maybe it is because of 
the other questions he asked.
<P>
	Earlier, he asked what we were doing to create jobs. First of all, 
we have to ensure that our financial house is in order. The hon. 
member knows full well that the Minister of Finance, the Prime 
Minister and the Government of Canada have seen to it. We are 
gradually making progress, and the problem will be solved. But 
there is more. Everyone knows that we set up an infrastructure 
program, which created more than 100,000 jobs. And it is not over 
yet. Everyone knows that more than 500,000 jobs have been 
created since 1993. Not by ourselves, but with some help. 
Everyone knows about the major challenge issued in the throne 
speech, whereby the private sector is asked to get involved and to 
help us create jobs.
<P>
	On the issue of partition, my colleague knows very well what the 
government's position is. It is very clear and it continues to evolve, 
as it should.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we listened to the member for St. Boniface and what we 
have heard is a typical Liberal operation.
<P>
	The member talked about involving the business community and 
the private sector in creating hope in the economy and creating 
hope for the youth of our country. This is just typical Liberal 
fashion. The Liberals are offloading the responsibilities they have 
not been able to take over the last two years on to the private sector. 
For more than two years businesses in the private sector have  been 
telling government to get out of their face. Get out of their face so 
that they can get on to doing business. If we are to believe what the 
hon. member for St. Boniface is saying, the Liberals plan on 
getting back in the face of business in a way that they have never 
been there before.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Business has been saying, leave us alone. If government wants to 
do something, lower our cost of doing business, lower the taxation 
levels so that we can make some more money, so that we can 
invest, so that we can hire people, so that we can give some hope on 
our own to the people. What this member is saying ain't gonna 
work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the question. My 
colleague's solution is simplistic. Let business take care of the 
country. Let business pocket the profits. One does not have to care 
about one's fellow Canadians. Just stuff more and more in and it 
will all resolve itself.
<P>
	I am sorry but those simplistic solutions to complex problems 
have never worked and they will not work in this instance either. 
The corporate sector has a responsibility to its fellow Canadians. If 
it is going to make money, let it make darn sure that Canadians are 
employed. It is those Canadians who are employed who help them 
make more money.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SPEAKER'SRULING-GOVERNMENTBUSINESS-MOTIONNO.1">SPEAKER'S RULING-GOVERNMENT BUSINESS-MOTION NO. 1</A></H4>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, before recognizing the 
hon. member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, I must rule on 
the point of order that was raised the other day. Here is the 
Speaker's ruling on the point of order raised on February 27 by the 
hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie regarding the procedural 
acceptability of government business Motion No. 1 standing in the 
name of the hon. government House leader.
<P>
	I also wish to thank the hon. members for Lethbridge and 
Winnipeg Transcona, the government House leader and the chief 
government whip for their contributions to the debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Reinstatement of business from one session to another is not 
uncommon in our practice. In our parliamentary experience, there 
are a number of occasions where bills and other forms of business 
from one session have been brought forward to another session 
either by unanimous consent or, more recently, as was the case in 
1991 by way of a government motion moved after notice.
<P>
	The question before us is not whether business can be reinstated 
from one session to another, but whether  Government Business 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="126"> 126 </A></B>
<P>
No. 1 which provides a mechanism where bills from the first 
session may be reinstated to this session is procedurally in order.
<P>
	Speaker Fraser noted in his ruling of May 29, 1991-much 
referred to in the debate-at page 734 of the <I>Debates</I> that he could 
find nothing in our rules or practices to preclude the reinstatement 
of bills by way of motion. He therefore permitted debate to proceed 
on the government motion that had been moved. He was concerned 
that members would be afforded an adequate opportunity to 
express their assent or dissent on each item to be reinstated and 
therefore ruled that separate questions be put on each bill to be 
reinstated.
<P>
	The same concern has been expressed most eloquently by hon. 
members with regard to the proposed government motion. In our 
current circumstances the motion does not list specific pieces of 
legislation to be reinstated. Rather it provides a mechanism 
whereby both private members and the ministry would have an 
opportunity to revive legislation from the last session. There is 
nothing procedurally objectionable per se to the adoption of a 
motion setting in place such a mechanism.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	However, as the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona pointed 
out, pursuant to Standing Orders 68(2) and 69(1), motions for leave 
to introduce a bill and for first reading and printing shall be deemed 
carried, without debate, amendment or question put, that is to say, 
in the words of Speaker Fraser, without the hon. members of the 
House having a say in the matter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I remind hon. members that our proceedings are generally 
arranged to provide hon. members with the opportunity to express 
their views on matters that come before the House. While the 
House would, of course, be able to vote on reinstated bills at 
subsequent stages of the legislative process, the Chair 
acknowledges the hon. members' concerns that under the terms of 
the third paragraph of the motion in issue, hon. members would not 
be able to take any decision on the bills that had passed all stages in 
the House and which were under study in the Senate when 
Parliament had prorogued.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	While I do not believe it is within my power to unilaterally 
amend a motion which is procedurally in order, I would remind 
hon. members that during the course of the debate on this motion 
there will be ample opportunity for them to propose amendments to 
provide the members of the House with the means to express their 
assent or dissent on the reinstatement of each bill in issue. Of 
course, members may also choose to vote against the motion.
<P>
	Both elements of this motion, that is, the first element dealing 
with the mechanism for the reinstatement of bills  and the second 
element dealing with amendments to the standing orders dealing 
with supply, specify how certain items of business will be dealt 
with during the first part of this session. As both elements relate to 
the business of the House, the motion is not a complicated 
question. Therefore, one debate will be held on the motion and one 
question will be put on the motion.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to speak in reply to the speech 
from the throne because, over the past few months, we were able to 
get in touch with our constituents and finally stock up on the ideas 
they want us to put across in this House so that Quebec and Canada 
will be more in line with what the people of Quebec and Canada 
want.
<P>
	The first message that was systematically conveyed to me by 
every person I was able to contact, which is not reflected in the 
speech from the throne, is to the effect of rejecting the unfair 
application of the marketplace rules of the road.
<P>
	In this speech from the throne, there are many instances where 
the government gives up exercising its duties as a government.
<P>
	Take the UI reform for example. On this subject, the speech from 
the throne says that it will go on as scheduled, that this plan to cut 
$2 billion will go ahead as scheduled, without any changes to the 
fiscal parameters. This is in direct contradiction with the first few 
paragraphs of the speech, in which the governor general speaks of 
the compassion of Canadians. There is a contradiction between 
what the government is advocating and the objectives we have 
always pursued in Quebec and in Canada.
<P>
	How can the government talk about compassion and honouring 
Canada's traditional values while at the same time requiring, for 
instance, that any first-time UI claimant have accumulated 910 
hours of work? These 910 hours amount to 26, 35-hour weeks of 
work, but previously, the unemployed needed only work a 
minimum of 15 hours a week during 20 weeks, or a total of 300 
hours, to qualify for unemployment insurance.
<P>
	The baseline has now been raised to 910 hours. Might as well 
condemn every young person and anyone working in a seasonal 
industry to live off welfare for the rest of their lives. This is clearly 
and simply an incentive to moonlight. This government is 
systematically encouraging moonlighting.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="127"> 127 </A></B>
<P>
	Another aspect of the speech from the throne that deals with 
the UI reform and which will certainly prompt members from the 
Maritimes to jump to their feet and respond has to do with the 
rule regarding the number of weeks of work. The current UI 
reform penalizes seasonal workers because they work in seasonal 
industries. Does the government intend to maintain this type of 
situation? Will it stick to the principles underlying Bill C-111, or 
will it do as it is being asked to by everyone, that is withdraw 
this legislation and start over again, from scratch, and propose a 
UI reform that truly reflects the values dear to Quebecers and 
Canadians? Did the government not get the message? Have all 
MPs from the maritimes not been told by their constituents that 
this reform was unacceptable, that it did not at all reflect the 
values of Quebec and Canada?
<P>
	Old age pensions are another component of social program 
reform where the government shows no compassion.
<P>
	The speech from the throne says that it will be necessary to 
reform the Canada pension plan so as to maintain its viability. The 
government no longer talks about ensuring the survival of old 
people through a minimum income that would allow them to have a 
decent quality of life. Not at all.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	The government is only concerned with the plan's viability. 
Once again, as with the UI reform, the issue becomes strictly a 
matter of dollars and cents. The government will do to old age 
pensions what it did to unemployment insurance, that is make the 
most vulnerable people pay. Is this what a government which is 
now half-way through its mandate should do? The government 
should ask itself why it was elected and where it is headed.
<P>
	The measures proposed in the speech from the throne do not 
reflect the demands of Quebecers and Canadians in the least.
<P>
	There is another issue that my constituents keep referring to. 
They told us that they expected their governments to create jobs. 
We have to find ways. I will tell you what a worker told me: ``We 
need to find a way of taxing machines.'' New technologies have 
transformed the workplace over the last few years and everyone 
knows that we cannot stop progress, but as these new technologies 
are being implemented, as eight out of ten jobs disappear, the 
government has the responsibility to ensure that quick and effective 
retraining programs are available, especially for unskilled workers. 
These people must not become the victims of technology. There is 
no reason why workers should be pushed aside because of 
technological change.
<P>
	We must accept technological change, we must make sure that 
we are competitive, but we must not act in a way that does not 
respect the human being and the right  of each individual to develop 
his or her full potential and use it for the benefit of society.
<P>
	I do not see anything along these lines in the speech from the 
throne. Have you found, in the speech from the throne, things that 
lead us to believe that the government will give the highest priority 
to job creation, to the use of workers and to the development of 
each individual's skills? Have you seen any of that in the speech 
from the throne? I have found nearly nothing on that subject.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Minister of Human Resources Development had 
to give some clarifications on youth employment. The text says 
that the government will double the number of federal summer 
student jobs. The minister has since told us that it will not only be 
in the federal public service, but everywhere.
<P>
	Should we believe what is in the text or should we believe what 
the minister says? For now, according to what we see in the speech 
from the throne, there will be lots of jobs in every area where there 
are federal departments, and it so happens that there are lots of 
them in the national capital region.
<P>
	But will the measure promised in the speech from the throne 
have the desired result in the areas where federal departments are 
less present, for example in La Pocatière where the experimental 
farm has been closed down, where there are fewer and fewer people 
in the Canada employment centres and where you can count federal 
employees on your fingers? Never in a million years!
<P>
	We will get the opposite effect to what we want if we concentrate 
jobs where they are less needed and allow for fewer of them where 
they are cruelly needed. The government must correct its range and 
adjust to what has to be done.
<P>
	Perhaps the main point that people everywhere mentioned to me 
is that they want to be respected. There is nothing like that in this 
speech from the throne. They say to Quebecers: ``We are going to 
control the way you will be consulted on your own future''. 
Quebecers are told that all Canadians will have their say about 
Quebec's own future; this shows a blatant lack of respect. It proves 
that they have completely lost touch with the people of Quebec. It 
shows that they have in no way understood the result of last fall's 
referendum.
<P>
	The government must clearly and definitely change its position 
on that and say unequivocally that it will respect the choice 
Quebecers made, just as sovereignists did in 1980 and again in 
1995; it must recognize that there is a democratic process to be 
followed and accept the people's choice.
<P>
	Quebecers have a right to be respected and expect the Canadian 
government, the Canadian Parliament to do so.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I will continue after question period.

	I urge the Minister of Finance to recognize in his budget that our 
colleges and universities are already involved in all of these throne 
speech themes and are greatly affected by the block transfers. They 
are one of the great focuses for our young people. They provide for 
and encourage the movement of Canadians within Canada and they

certain ministers of the government, Stéphane Dion in particular, 
now we have the Minister of Justice following suit.

on the legality of a future Quebec referendum.

by the government to appease Canadians about the deplorable state 
of our economy, to comfort them about our social programs and to 
reinforce their vision of a united Canada. Now the government 
must deliver all the promises in the red book. Canadians will not 
tolerate any more rhetoric and false promises.
<P>
	Job creation should have been the number one priority of the 
government and the impending budget has to address this issue if 
Canadians are to continue to have faith in the Prime Minister. 
Throughout the first half of his mandate economic growth has been 
dismally lacking and job creation has been almost non-existent. 
Nothing short of full employment can bring national unity and 
prosperity to Canada.
<P>

	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Mr. 
Roland Veilleux, the spokesperson for the no committee in Beauce 
and owner of Groupe RGR, is at it again. Last fall he threatened to 
pull out of Quebec if the no side won. Now he is justifying the 
closing of his factory in Saint-Georges-de-Beauce by blaming it on 
the fact that the results were too close.
<P>
	But, as it happens, Mr. Veilleux is currently negotiating with his 
workers, and that is what brings about the threat of closure. He has 
used the same tactics in previous negotiations. It seems therefore 
that his blame keeps switching from one guilty party to another, 
sometimes the sovereignists, sometimes the union, as it suits him. 
This is strangely reminiscent of the good old industrialists of the 
19th century.

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I draw to the attention of the House the serious issue of 
impaired driving.
<P>
	In 1994, 1,414 people were killed as a result of impaired driving, 
three times the number of murders.
<P>
	Those who end up killing someone while impaired routinely are 
given excessive light sentences, generally between one and four 
years.
<P>
	This morning I introduced a private members' bill which would 
see a minimum of seven years imposed on those convicted of 
impaired driving causing death. Those who drive impaired must be 
held responsible for their actions. They choose to be impaired, they 
choose to drive. We are all potential victims and we must do 
everything we can to deter impaired driving and keep impaired 
drivers off our streets.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
American decision to punish everyone who does not hold to their 
view on Cuba is truly objectionable, if not laughable in some 
respects.
<P>
	When it comes to the issue of using property confiscated in 
revolutions, are they suggesting that whatever property in the U.S. 
which might have been lost by United Empire Loyalists should be 
similarly treated? Hardly. Nor are they suggesting that countries 
like China and a host of others with lousy human rights records 
should be sanctioned like Cuba is. Why not?
<P>
	Could this hypocrisy be possibly related to the fact that Cuba, 
like Canada, is in the so-called American sphere of influence and is 
supposed to behave like a good little neighbour. However, when it 
comes to Cuba Canada has shown a streak of independence that we 
do not always show on other issues.
<P>
	I urge the Minister of Foreign Affairs to carry on this tradition 
which goes all the way back to John Diefenbaker and resist in every 
political and diplomatic way possible this latest manifestation of 
the bully in the American psyche aided and abetted by some 
electoral domestic politics.
<P>
	At the same time the Cuban government might reflect on how 
wrong it was politically and morally to have shot down those 
planes the way it did.

	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in commemoration of black history month, I am pleased 
to acknowledge Robert Sutherland, Ontario's first black lawyer and 
one of Queen's University's earliest benefactors.
<P>
	Robert Sutherland graduated from Queen's in 1852 with an 
honours degree in classics and mathematics. He later studied law at 
Osgoode Hall and was called to the Ontario bar in 1855.
<P>
	After being called to the bar, Mr. Sutherland settled in 
Walkerton, Ontario and practised law until his death in 1878 at age 
48. On his death he left his entire estate of $12,000, a considerable 
sum for that time, to his Alma Mater, Queen's University. It was to 
date the largest single bequest Queen's had ever received.
<P>
	Robert Sutherland's commitment to academic excellence at 
Queen's stands as a reminder to us all of the limitless potential all 
people possess regardless of racial or ethnic origin. His early 
accomplishments and subsequent generosity are another proud 
reminder of the  substantial contribution black people have made to 
Canada.

make it responsive to the needs of future generations.
<P>
	My constituents also endorsed the concept that Canadians will 
be consulted on the available options and the changes that are 
necessary to preserve the Canada pension plan.

which gave rise to a host of activities across the country, was for us 
an opportunity to get better acquainted with the children of 
Matthew Da Costa who have chosen to make our destiny theirs as

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at 10:10 this morning, a Canadian Press release revealed 
the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Stéphane Dion, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, has reiterated that 
a cross Canada referendum is not out of the question. In a telephone press 
conference, Mr. Dion said no means of consultation had been ruled out. He did 
say that the government did not want a referendum with all the trauma it would 
entail.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We will remember that, on Wednesday morning, the Deputy 
Prime Minister completely ruled out the possibility and did not 
answer my question yesterday afternoon during question period.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. I would like to know from 
the Prime Minister, because it is he who set match to kindling by 
raising the possibility of a cross Canada referendum in the throne 
speech, and because even his ministers are confused by his 
remarks-two of his ministers are contradicting each other-, 
whether he would be kind enough to clarify the issue once and for 
all so we can get on with other things and tell us, yes or no, whether 
he intends to hold a cross Canada referendum on the future of 
Quebec?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister expressed what we are all thinking, which is 
that we do not want another referendum. No one wants a 
referendum.
<P>
	I hope the hon. Leader of the Opposition does not want a 
referendum and that he subscribes to the theory of Jacques 
Parizeau, who, on the night of the referendum, was going to tell 
Quebecers and Canadians that the result was irreversible, that 
democracy had spoken, that the page had to be turned and that 
everyone should rally behind the choice made. We are rallying 
behind the choice Quebecers made, we are going to stay in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, needless to say the Leader of the Opposition is rallying 
and does not want a cross Canada referendum, because it is up to 
Quebecers to decide their future.
<P>
	The official opposition feels it is up to Quebecers to decide their 
future, does the Prime Minister share this opinion?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am of the same opinion as the Premier of Quebec, who is 
asking people to attend to public finances, to work to create jobs. 
This is what Quebecers  want at the moment. This is what the 
speech from the throne proposed.
<P>
	We proposed that we create jobs, especially for young people. 
We have proposed a program to improve the federation. I hope the 
Leader of the Opposition will take the time at least to read this part 
of the throne speech. It seems he read the word ``referendum'' in 
the throne speech, when it was not there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first, is the Prime Minister aware that he is the one who 
wrote the throne speech and not the Leader of the Opposition?
<P>
	Second, all Canadian political observers, without exception, 
have raised the matter of the cross Canada referendum as a threat 
hanging over Quebec. I did not invent it, all the observers pointed 
that out.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister aware that his double talk and his thinly 
veiled threats to Quebec are today preventing us from moving on to 
other things, as he claims he wants? He is the one in the way.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have just said that the throne speech focussed on the real 
problems of Quebecers and all Canadians, that we spoke of job 
creation, that we challenged business to come up with jobs now 
that the Minister of Finance and this government have managed to 
clean up public finances. Those are the real problems.
<P>
	If the member is talking about the referendum threat, the matter 
is very clear: let him tell us that there will be no referendum in 
Quebec, and political stability will return, jobs will come back to 
Quebec and prosperity will reign anew in the city of Montreal.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr.

speech, the government announces that it will withdraw from a 
number of areas of jurisdiction. Curiously enough, these 
areas-namely job training, forestry, mining, and recreation-all 
come under the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces. With a few 
exceptions, the areas in question are the same as those listed in the 
Charlottetown accord.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister confirm that his new constitutional 
position is based on the Charlottetown accord, but with something 
missing?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, improving federal-provincial relations is a matter of 
public administration. We decided to improve the situation.
<P>
	I had the opportunity to discuss the matter with the premiers, 
during our trip to Asia for instance, and everyone agrees that the 
time has come to improve the  federation. This is a plan that we put 
<P>

<B><A NAME="133"> 133 </A></B>
<P>
forward unilaterally. We will hold a federal-provincial conference, 
which I hope the premier of Quebec will attend. We will review all 
the possibilities and find a solution that will allow us to restore 
Canada's political stability, thereby promoting economic growth.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, how can the Prime Minister believe for one moment that 
his timid constitutional proposals can meet Quebecers' 
expectations, when the Charlottetown accord-whose content the 
Prime Minister is obviously trying to water down in order to 
respond and make his proposals acceptable to the rest of 
Canada-was rejected by a majority of Canadians and Quebecers?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are working and will be working with the provinces to 
ameliorate the federation for the 21st century. We put forward, on 
our own initiative, some propositions that seem to have been quite 
well received by the premiers and the provinces.

propositions which are aimed at making the federation work better.

about the delivery that it has been; drifting targets that leave the

disposable income-no clapping now. There is no prospect for tax 
relief, despair instead of hope and a near defeat in the Quebec 
referendum. Applause, please. None, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister have the nerve to claim victory? No 
clapping now. How can he claim victory when $50 billion a year is 
going to pay just interest on the national debt. The average 
Canadian paycheque is $200 less a month than it was in 1989 and 
the prospect of tax relief is absolutely nowhere in sight. What kind 
of victory is that?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, two years ago in this House the hon. member was 
complaining about the level of interest rates in Canada compared to 
the United States. The level of interest rates between Canada and 
the United States today for the short term is exactly the same.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> For every point in reduction in 
the interest rates, the treasury is saving $1.7 billion a year. The 
finances of the country have improved tremendously. That is the 
judgment of the market. Of course, it will never be enough for the 
Reform Party because it wants to get rid of medicare and the social 
network that protects Canadians. We have a balanced approach.
<P>
	We can run the affairs of the nation and at the same time make 
sure that people are not going into the streets as a result of a

broken the back of the Canadian taxpayers who are leading the 
battle in making ends meet. The best way to create real, sustainable 
jobs is to lower taxes. The best way to do that is to eliminate the 
deficit.

in Air Canada's safety systems.
<P>
	We are looking into the matter which occurred some six weeks

failed to balance the budget; failed to provide tax relief; failed to 
abolish the GST and failed to create the economic environment in 
which businesses can create jobs. His government is failing.

	My question is for the Prime Minister. Who is responsible for 
job creation? The government or the private sector?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

to prepare a climate for the private sector to invest. That is exactly 
what we have done.
<P>
	A big problem for the business community was that the interest 
rate spread between Canada and the United States was too wide. 
This has been completely eliminated and it is a big achievement for 
all of us.

579,000 new jobs since we formed the government. For a failure 
that is not bad.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, now the 
Prime Minister wants businesses to create more jobs, not the 
government. I am trying to find out if in fact he still believes in the 
infrastructure program.
<P>
	The way to create jobs is to lower taxes so taxpayers and 
businesses have more disposable income. To lower taxes there 
must be a balanced budget. The government is adding to the debt, 
not reducing it. Funding must not be decreased the way this 
government has done with its social and health transfer and 
education.
<P>
	The government should look at the way it is handling everything 
to do with the economy and let the private sector grow and create 
the jobs it should create. The government has not done its part. The 
government must look at the debt and look at its budget and present 
a balanced budget.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. In the speech 
from the throne delivered on February 27, we read the following, 
and I quote: ``The government will propose to Parliament measures 
to sustain Canada's elderly benefits system for the future''. 
Yesterday, no less than 18 Quebec associations for seniors opposed 
the federal government's intention to determine old age pensions 
based on family income.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance reassure the elderly by confirming 
that their pension will not be determined by using the family 
income criterion?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
had the opportunity to meet these associations a week ago. I told 
them that it was my intention to meet with them again after the 
budget to discuss the need to ensure the long term viability of old 
age pensions, that is old age security and the guaranteed income 
supplement.
<P>
	I also took this opportunity to assure them, as did the Prime 
Minister in the House yesterday, that, as regards old age security 
and the guaranteed income supplement, those who are already 
retired will not be affected. Our goal is to make sure that the plan 
still exists for younger generations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister leaves an element of doubt as to whether 
pensions will indeed be based on family income. Can the minister 
at least tell Canadians that retirement age will not be raised from 65 
to 67 years?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as 
the hon. member knows, during the meeting of provincial finance 
ministers, we agreed with our Quebec counterpart to hold public 
hearings on the Quebec pension plan and the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	One option is to push retirement age to 67 years. I said that this 
was definitely not my preferred choice, but it is an option that was 
put forward by some provinces and we have to look at it. But again, 
I want to make it clear that it is certainly not this government's first 
choice.

	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister for International Trade, but first I 
would like to congratulate the minister on his new appointment.
<P>
	It seems that President Clinton has agreed to pass a bill on Cuba 
that could seriously harm Canadian companies with investment and 
trade interests in Cuba. I would like to ask the minister what 
avenues he is pursuing to make sure we are protecting Canadian 
interests.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his 
congratulatory comments.
<P>
	While the government joins the United States in condemning the 
Cuban action in shooting down two civilian planes, we are 
disappointed by what is resulting in the Helms-Burton bill. We are 
disappointed by the effect it will have on Canadians and business 
people from other countries in terms of access to the United States 
for these business people as well as the potential of lawsuits against 
them.
<P>
	We have yet to get the details of the legal text of the bill. We 
hope to get that later in the day. When we do, we will be looking at 
it in terms of the options for action the government can take. In 
terms of NAFTA, in terms of the trade obligations the United States 
has with respect to that, we want to make sure they uphold their 
part of that agreement. We want to make sure Canadians continue 
to have access in the United States and are able within Canadian 
law to continue to deal in a business fashion with Cuba and other 
countries.
<P>

	We will take action on that after we have looked at the options 
before us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I address 
my supplementary to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The leaders of Canada and the United States have always had a 
good relationship. Indeed, the Prime Minister has often spoken 
about the warm relationship he has with President Clinton.
<P>
	Given that warm relationship and given that this is such a hot 
issue which is before us right now, can the Prime Minister tell this 
House if he has called President Clinton on this issue in order to 
protect Canadian interests and if so, what were the discussions 
regarding this issue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be pleased to answer the question.
<P>
	The hon. member is quite right. We have a number of different 
relationships with the United States. Fortunately for us many of 
them are done in a very co-operative fashion. We want to maintain 
the opportunity to continue a very good and fruitful dialogue with 
the government and the people of the United States.
<P>
	On the specific issue dealing with the Helms-Burton bills, the 
Minister for International Trade has said it is one item on which we 
have strong disagreements with the  approach being taken. I can 
assure the hon. member that a number of representations have been

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Somalia inquiry is currently going on in Ottawa. Several of those 
responsible for it have raised the possibility of a conflict of interest 
concerning the legal counsels of the Department of Justice.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Justice acknowledge that having legal 
advisers from his department representing both the crown and the 
defence in the investigation of senior officers places the 
department in a conflict of interest situation, a point that has been 
raised by chief commissioner Judge Létourneau?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, from the outset in this as in any 
other commission of inquiry, the possibility of conflict has been 
acknowledged. Whenever government lawyers act for government 
institutions as well as individuals, that possibility can arise.
<P>
	Equally from the outset, we have made provisions for such 
conflicts. To date 13 individuals have been invited to retain their 
own separate counsel at the expense of the government and that has 
been done. In addition to that, additional safeguards have been put 
in place to ensure that any person who is interviewed as a witness 
or who is brought before the commission is given the opportunity 
to have separate representation if their interest is different from 
that of the government.
<P>
	I can inform the hon. member and the House that earlier this 
week my deputy minister met with one of the commissioners, 
Commissioner Létourneau, and discussed this matter in detail. We 
are now preparing a written response to the letter we received last 
week on this subject. I am confident that procedures can be devised 
to address this difficulty while maintaining the responsibility that 
this department has to represent the government in the inquiry.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does 
the Minister of Justice acknowledge that the sole purpose of using

protect those officers at the expense of the lower ranks who were 
represented by their own lawyers, and continue to be so 
represented?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

foundation on the facts for that allegation. It is simply unfair.
<P>
	Our interest from the outset has been to ensure that the facts 
come out before the commission. The Minister of National 
Defence created the commission for that purpose. I repeat that the 
Department of Justice throughout has made it possible for anyone 
who is in a different position from ours to have separate 
representation. We will continue in that regard. If the hon. member 
is aware of any instance in which that principle is not honoured, I

<P>

director of Confederation Life. When Confederation Life 
collapsed, the same director did not notify Bell of the difficulties.

silent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the heart of the matter 
the hon. member brings up is an issue of corporate governance. The 
issue of corporate governance is one that the Minister of Industry is 
looking at in his department. They have released a series of papers. 
The Senate banking committee is looking at the issue of corporate 
governance. The studies will form part of my own white paper on 
the financial institution legislation.
<P>
	To refer to the actual incident the hon. member brings up, I will 
not give him a legal opinion as I am certainly not a lawyer and as a

can of course abstain from voting on those matters.

Paul Martin is working on a bribe to persuade the four Atlantic

<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask the hon. member to please just use the 
title of the minister rather than his name.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, the quote states: ``The finance 
minister is working on a bribe to persuade the four Atlantic 
provinces to harmonize their sales taxes with the GST''. If 
harmonization is so great, then obviously he ought to be able to sell 
it on its own merits.
<P>
	Is the finance minister seriously going to go ahead with a 
proposal that is so bad he cannot sell it on its own merits and he 
actually has to bribe the provinces to go along?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the arguments in favour of harmonization are overwhelming. 
Consumer associations across the country argue in favour of 
harmonization. Small and medium size business argue in favour of 
harmonization. The Canadian Tax Foundation argue in favour of 
harmonization.
<P>
	In this day when what we are trying to do is to find new vehicles 
for the delivery of government services, what we want to do is 
rationalize them. Surely to heaven the ability of the federal and 
provincial governments to co-operate is not something that should 
be denigrated but something members opposite should be 
applauding. The only thing I would say on that basis is that a 
number of provinces understand the benefits of harmonization. I do 
not think that it speaks well of the Reform Party to say that any 
provincial government would allow itself to be bribed. It is an 
insult to the people of their provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member for York South-Weston when referring to the Prime 
Minister recently said: ``He made a promise; we all made promises. 
We went door to door to scrap the GST and if we do not keep that 
promise it will be very difficult for Liberal MPs to go into an 
election knocking on the same doors asking support once again 
from people they lied to in the last election campaign''.

disguise, not to fudge, not to tinker with, but to eliminate the GST? 
That was his promise.

views.
<P>
	There will be a federal-provincial meeting of the first ministers. 
The people will be represented at that meeting by the Prime 
Minister of Canada and the premiers. There are also organizations 
which are expressing their views at this time by sending briefs to 
the government. They are meeting with their members of 
Parliament. We are receiving briefs from many people on that 
subject.
<P>
	At this moment we have put forward a plan of amelioration of 
the federation. We want to discuss that with the first ministers. That 
is exactly what we have in mind for the time being.
<P>
	I hope the Reform Party will approve the plan we have of 
offering some clarification, some devolution of powers, some 
improvement in the relations between the federal and provincial

<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
apparently when the Prime Minister meant that Canadians would 
be able to express their views, he meant only the 11 first ministers 
of the country. Nothing has changed.
<P>
	Yesterday when the hon. member for Beaver River was asking 
about this, the Deputy Prime Minister responded: ``We believe that 
Canadians do not want more constitutional wrangling''. If that is 
the case, I would like to ask the Prime Minister why did the 
government propose in the throne speech to constitutionalize the 
distinct society notion, to change the amending formula of the 
Constitution? Why is it proposing to reopen the wounds of Meech 
Lake, Charlottetown and the patriation of 1982?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have always said that we hope this will be 
constitutionalized. We said that when we had votes in the House of 
Commons on that. We have always said that is what we wanted to 
do.
<P>
	In order to have the reality of Canadian life that Quebec is a 
distinct society in the Constitution we need seven provinces to 
approve it. I hope that the hon. member would support that. For 
changing the amending formula, I have always been in favour of a 
veto for the regions and this was expressed in a bill in the House of 
Commons and you voted against it. It was a formula that was 
accepted by all the provinces at the time of the Victoria discussion. 
There is nothing new. It is something that was acceptable even to 
the Socred government of Alberta which you are the grandson of. 
There are many ways to consult with the public. There is one that 
will come soon. That will be the day a lot of these guys will

<P>
	Recently Canada and the United States signed a softwood 
lumber deal that will secure Canada's access to U.S. markets for 
five years. Why did Canada enter into this agreement with the 
United States rather than take the softwood dispute to the NAFTA 
panel, a panel process that Canada has won on all previous 
occasions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the problem was that between the last dispute 
and this one, the law changed in the United States.
<P>
	According to the rules of NAFTA and NAFTA panels, the 
NAFTA panel only has to determine whether or not a country in the 
agreement follows its own laws. Because of the change in the law, 
it created a great state of uncertainty about our ability to succeed in 
a further countervail measure if we should challenge it through a 
NAFTA panel.
<P>
	We dealt with the provinces and with the industry in each of the 
provinces across the country and were able to come up with a good 
solution. It is different for the different provinces but is one they all 
subscribe to. It is one we were able to bring together under an 
overall Canada umbrella to work as a team with the provinces and 
with industry to come up with a solution that gives them secure 
access to the United States market for the next five years. This is 
something that has never been achieved before without any

	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Vancouver South, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is also for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	As the minister knows, serious concerns have been raised about 
security and law enforcement at our ports, specifically, the port of 
Vancouver under the new marine police.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Transport assure British Columbians and all 
Canadians that the security of our ports will not be compromised?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I can assure the hon. member that the security at our ports 
is a major concern to me, the Solicitor General of Canada, the 
Minister of Justice and every member of the government.
<P>
	We want to ensure that in the transfer to local port authorities the 
policing function is at a level which is as effective as previously, if 
not more so. We will be working as best we can to make sure that 
the level of security at the ports of Canada, particularly the major 
ports, is just as high as it has ever been or in fact augmented.
<P>
	I can assure him that this will be the case in Vancouver and 
elsewhere.
<P>
	However, I must also point out that as local authorities take more 
control they may have variations in the existing system which we 
will have to consider. I want the whole House to understand that the 
level of security will be maintained.

Speaker, I am pleased to resume the debate after question period. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="141"> 141 </A></B>
<P>
When the first part of my speech was interrupted, I was talking 
about what is most important  according to my constituents, 
namely what the government is going to do in the coming months.
<P>
	I was referring to something that is very important to both 
Quebecers and Canadians, in that people must feel respected as 
citizens of a country, whether it is Quebec or Canada. And that is 
something that Quebecers obviously do not find in the throne 
speech. When told that the decision on their future may well be 
made by all Canadians, they are obviously very unhappy about this; 
they do not identify with that part of the throne speech.
<P>
	The speech contains another, more concrete part that is more 
difficult to address, but I think it is essential to do so. My fellow 
citizens everywhere have criticized the Prime Minister for his 
behaviour in assaulting Bill Clennett. I think it is not too late for the 
Prime Minister to apologize to Mr. Clennett, because his action had 
a very negative impact on all young Canadians. I am talking about 
the children who talked about that incident and asked their parents 
whether such actions were acceptable. I think it is unacceptable. 
We are replying to the throne speech, but at the same time there is 
something in this that I find unacceptable.
<P>
	Another demand made by an increasing number of people across 
Canada is to simplify the system in which we live, so that we can 
properly assess government effectiveness.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	We should have more clearly defined jurisdictions, and a simpler 
fiscal system, to make it easy to see whether or not everyone is 
doing his share. In order to move beyond phrases like ``make the 
rich pay'', we need to be able to determine if indeed we are all 
pulling our weight in this society of ours. Are the tools available to 
all taxpayers to claim, for instance, every tax deduction they are 
entitled to? Do companies, the wealthy, and ordinary people have 
an equal chance of using the tax legislation to their best advantage? 
Do they have access to all deductions? As matters stand, the answer 
is no. It is pretty obvious that only the wealthy and big companies 
can afford to hire tax experts to find every last loophole in the tax 
legislation, not the common man. Nothing in the speech from the 
throne indicates that the government is prepared to head that way. I 
think this is a change the government should consider.
<P>
	I shall call this eliminating the expert bonus. That is when a 
company can afford to hire a tax expert to find the tiniest loophole 
in the Income Tax Act, enabling this company or an individual with 
a large income to get a better deal than someone else, who does not 
have as good an income. It is somehow similar to the systematic 
hunting down of UI abusers. Of course we must make sure that 
everyone obeys the law, but we must make sure that governments 
have the same kind of requirements for big companies, those that 
were once referred to as corporate welfare bums. There is a need to 
guarantee a degree of fairness in this regard, and there is no  
indication of anything of the sort in the speech from the throne.
<P>
	Another paragraph of this speech caught my eye because I watch 
so closely over the interests of my riding, which is located in a rural 
area. It reads: ``The government is committed to the economic 
renewal of rural Canada.'' It is very well to mention rural Canada 
in the speech from the throne. I think it is a good idea to call the 
attention of the House to this issue, but at the same time, several of 
the government's initiatives adversely affect rural Canada. How 
can the government advocate at the same time the development of 
rural Canada and the pursuit of its current UI reform, which will 
systematically penalize rural areas across Canada, fostering the 
off-farm migration of the young people when the rural 
communities need them to take over in time. There is an 
inconsistency in all this that is unacceptable.
<P>
	We will also be able to judge the government on how it will 
review the mandate of Canada Post. A committee has been set up 
by the minister to hold hearings in six Canadian cities. In the next 
year, we will be able to see whether the government truly takes into 
account the needs of rural areas and whether it ensures that the CPC 
not only delivers the mail but also contributes to the economic 
development of every region in Quebec and in Canada. These will 
be good tests that will show whether the government really cares 
about rural development.
<P>
	How can rural development be reconciled with the current 
exercise, which consists in closing Canada employment centres 
right across the country and centralizing operations in every 
region? The government is recreating small centralized units in 
very large regions. This means that many Canadians who 
previously enjoyed more accessible services will no longer do so. It 
also means that there will be fewer opportunities for workers to 
adjust and to get adequate counselling. In my opinion, these 
measures are unacceptable and they also contradict the will 
expressed in the speech from the throne. There is no connection; 
the government fails to reach its objectives.
<P>
	I want to mention another point in the speech from the throne. I 
was very surprised when I read it. I find it interesting to see a 
reference to aboriginal people, they are recognized; however, 
nowhere is there any mention of the Quebec people. The 
government wants to ignore the wish expressed by many 
Quebecers, close to 50 per cent of them, at the last referendum. If 
Quebecers were asked whether they form a people, a vast majority 
of them would say yes.
<P>
	Had the government wanted to send a clear signal that it got the 
message, it would have done so in the speech from the throne. It 
would have clearly indicated that it recognizes Quebecers as a 
people. But there is no such mention in the speech. Obviously, this 
government-perhaps because it does not know what  really goes 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="142"> 142 </A></B>
<P>
on in Quebec-did not manage to get the message sent by millions 
of people. It could have said things differently in its speech from 
the throne.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to say that the touchstone of a good 
throne speech is the feeling of confidence in the future it inspires in 
citizens. Do they think the government has put forward adequate 
measures to settle current problems?
<P>
	Employment is the great issue on everybody's mind. Everybody 
seems to think that, over the last 10 to 15 years, we have set up a 
system in which very productive people can manage. But at the 
same time we have deliberately chosen to toss aside people who 
may be overtaken by new technological requirements and those 
who have experienced in their life an unfortunate event that 
prevents them from re-entering the labour market. This is a 
shameful waste of human resources.
<P>
	If there is one clear message which the throne speech ought to 
have got across to give a flicker of hope, it is the message that 
workers will get a real chance to find a job. The throne speech 
should have given them that hope. Yet, not a word is to be found in 
the throne speech about people who are 40, 45 or 50 years old, 
about workers who have been displaced by technological change, 
about people who have been working for 5, 10, 15 or 20 years for 
the same company and find themselves unexpectedly unemployed 
overnight.
<P>
	What is the government going to do for them? There is not a 
single word about the help they might be given. There is no hope 
for the future to be found in the throne speech, and it does not meet 
at all the needs of Quebecers and of Canadians. It needs to be 
amended in the way suggested by the Leader of the Opposition. I 
hope this House will consider the amendment moved by the Bloc.
<P>
	How can a government be so short on creativity after only two 
years in power? Is it because the men and women who are part of 
the government lack the necessary skills? I do not think that is the 
case. There are men and women on both sides of the House who 
have all the necessary qualifications to do the job. There is a more 
fundamental reason. It is because Canada is an ungovernable 
country. As long as it does not decide on a fundamental structural 
change, as long as it does not accept to set up a new relationship 
between its components, it will go on trying to tinker with old 
plumbing instead of dealing with structural problems.
<P>
	On this side, we have taken due note of the message for 
Quebecers and Canadians contained in the referendum results. We 
have been told: ``We are not ready yet''. We accept the result and 
that it would take 50 per cent plus 1 to have a majority, which result 
has not been reached. We have acknowledged the result. On the 
other hand, there is a very clear message sent to Canada and 
Quebec: a significant change is needed. This change lies in the 
recognition that there are two peoples in Canada and that we in 
Quebec must have all the powers we need to be able to develop and 
in order to have a partnership between the two countries, not an 
tangled mess like the one that is proposed in the speech from the 
throne.
<P>
	If we were to implement what is proposed in the speech from the 
throne in constitutional matters, we would find ourselves in an 
even more complicated situation. Ten years from now, it would be 
worse than it is now. We should have gotten out of the rut. That is 
what the government has not managed to do and what it would have 
the opportunity to do if it decided to change its position in order 
that Quebecers and Canadians can finally see a reflection of 
themselves in the government now representing them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank you for 
giving me the floor. I wish to put a few questions to the hon. 
member. He spoke in particular of the referendum results in 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	Of course, we lost the referendum with 49,4 per cent of the vote. 
The government, the Prime Minister, keep on repeating that we 
should accept our defeat, and the Canadien government recognizes 
that we have lost.
<P>
	If the Canadian government recognizes that we lost the 
referendum, should it not also recognize that with 51,4 per cent of 
the vote, Quebecers would have had a legitimate victory?
<P>
	There is another striking example. Would the province of 
Newfoundland, having decided to join the Canadian confederation 
in a referendum, also be free to leave it in another referendum? 
Would that not be logic? I wonder why there are these great debates 
to say that you need 60, 65 or 70 per cent of the vote to leave the 
Canadian confederation. It looks completely ludicrous to me. You 
need 50 per cent plus one. This is the democratic rule we work 
with. This is our culture and democracy as we know it.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member to elaborate a bit on the matter 
because the Liberal government seems to be hard-of-hearing on 
this issue.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member for Longueuil. Of 
course, it slipped out of my mind, but since we have known each 
other for a long time I hope you will accept my apologies. It will 
not happen again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a very interesting question, 
because the Speech from the Throne is full of contradictions. For 
instance, there is one sentence I would like to quote that is along 
the same lines and bears out what the hon. member for Longueuil 
just said. It says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="143"> 143 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On October 30, the people of Quebec voted in a referendum to stay in Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If the government says in the Speech from the Throne that we 
voted to stay in Canada on October 30, on the basis of the close 
results we had, to me this means that if the outcome had been 
reversed, the government should have said: ``The people of Quebec 
voted in a referendum to create the nation of Quebec'' and then 
acted accordingly as the Government of Canada.
<P>
	That would have made sense, but it is very difficult to make 
sense of the current statements and positions of the Prime Minister 
and his Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. It is the old double 
standard. We win if it is 50 per cent, but for you to win, it has to be 
60 per cent. This is a complete denial of a democratic system that 
has been the pride of Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	It is pretty hard to make sense of all this. I think the Government 
of Canada should confirm that the next time Quebecers vote on the 
national question, the results will be recorded and will be binding 
as they were in 1980 and in 1995, with this difference that 
Quebecers will decided to create the nation of Quebec.
<P>
	I think there is an increasing body of evidence that the only way 
we can resolve this question in Canada is to ensure that Quebecers 
will be in a position to establish, from nation to nation, as equals, a 
relationship and a partnership that is mutually advantageous for 
Quebecers and Canadians. This will be possible once Quebecers 
have voted again.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Government of Canada should remove the 
implication in the Throne Speech that it will keep Quebecers in a 
straightjacket by calling a pan-Canadian referendum.
<P>
	We must know what the government's intentions are as soon as 
possible, so that it will be clear to Quebecers and Canadians that 
the government will abide by the choice made by Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to congratulate my colleague from 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, because, in my opinion, he went 
to the heart of the matter.
<P>
	He just said that we are two founding nations. I think everybody 
recognizes that, but I cannot understand how we can have two 
nations and only one country.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	We, Quebecers, we want our own country. The throne speech 
mentions only one country. In view of the fact that there are two 
nations, I would like my colleagues opposite to understand the 
right we have to demand our own country.
<P>
	We all went to the Senate to listen to the speech. The atmosphere 
was quiet and peaceful. Some were happily resting, others even fell 
asleep during such an important speech. For my part, I was 
standing and I could not help  thinking: ``How will it be received by 
my fellow citizens in Matapédia-Matane who are watching on 
television? They always have good questions for me.''
<P>
	Even though they might be unemployed, people in 
Matapédia-Matane will not allow their children to be bought by 
offers of free trips across Canada during the summer holidays, at 
public expense. It is nice to travel and to show our young people 
how vast, great and beautiful Canada is. Indeed, it is. But if their 
father is out of work, and their mother cannot feed them, they are 
not interested in travelling across Canada, for the time being, at 
least.
<P>
	In my area, people have taken to the streets; women are worried, 
the elderly are too. I would ask my colleague whether he found in 
the throne speech concrete steps dealing with our young people, 
farmers, the elderly and the unemployed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague's comment brought to 
mind one thing we could change in the present system, since we 
can propose changes.
<P>
	When I went to the Senate to listen to the throne speech, I 
realized something that we could call absurd nowadays. Why is the 
throne speech delivered in the other place, where members are not 
elected and where elected members are not even allowed in?
<P>
	It is all very technical and symbolic, but at the same time, the 
following change could really improve things. Why would the next 
throne speech not be given in the House of Commons, right here, 
where we would invite senators to join us if the Senate is not 
abolished by then? Would that not be more respectful of 
democracy?
<P>
	Senators are real good people, they have been chosen for 
multiple reasons, often for their political opinions, but in the end, 
when the image of the people listening to the throne speech is 
broadcasted on TV, everybody can see the many empty benches. As 
for the decorum of the Supreme Court justices, I wonder if that is in 
line with the democracy we all have to respect. I think we could 
propose some changes concerning decorum and protocol. Next 
time, if there is a throne speech here and if I am present at the time, 
I hope we can hear it in the House and we can invite the senators. I 
think that would be a way of supporting democracy.
<P>
	Personally, I also believe there are substantial savings to be 
made as regards the non-elected House but we could discuss that 
more thoroughly at the time of the next budget speech.
<P>
	My colleague's other remark deals with the references in the 
throne speech to young people, farmers and senior citizens. 
Regarding young people, there is a reference to employment within 
the federal administration. Yesterday, the Minister of Human 
Resources Development said that the text was not properly worded 
and that we should read jobs within the whole of Canada. We are 
going to wait and see what the reality will be, because the throne  
speech talks about jobs only where it deals with the public service. 
In areas where employment centres were closed, or in an area like 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="144"> 144 </A></B>
<P>
my riding where the experimental farm of La Pocatière was closed, 
there are no departments where students could work.
<P>
	Therefore, it is not necessarily a measure which will do a great 
deal in areas where the need for jobs is the greatest; on the contrary, 
it will widen the gap between an area like the national capital and 
other regions of the country. This does not make much sense.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	Turning to farmers, there is not much for them in the speech. 
There is the paragraph I was referring to earlier which deals with 
rural Canada, but specific measures which will help the farmers of 
Quebec and Canada face the future, face the new international 
agreements, will have to be assessed when they come out, because 
there is nothing concrete in the speech.
<P>
	The sentence of the throne speech which is the most worrisome 
deals with senior citizens and talks about measures to sustain 
Canada's elderly benefit system for the future. The sustainability 
aspect does not mean that we will preserve the quality of life of our 
senior citizens. It does not mean that we will maintain what we 
have developed over the past 20 years. It means there will be cuts, 
that there will be less security for older people, and I invite them to 
be extremely vigilant and make every possible representation to 
make sure that these measures will not have a negative impact on 
their quality of life. There is no doubt that opposition will have a 
role to play in this regard.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to start by reiterating, for the benefit of the 
opposition critics, my commitment to creating a spirit of 
co-operation between the opposition and the government as far as 
foreign affairs are concerned.
<P>
	During the debate on Haiti yesterday, I could not help but notice 
the open-mindedness and absence of partisanship in their speeches. 
I am convinced that we can rely on their co-operation, in the best 
tradition of our Parliament, to further the interests of Canada as a 
whole on issues of major consequence for the representation of 
Canada abroad.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A throne speech is not just an agenda for a government. It is an 
agenda for an entire society. It seeks to articulate an agenda by 
which we can make commitments, responses and actions required 
as we face new conditions and new developments.
<P>
	The throne speech we received this week is a positive agenda. It 
is trying to take today's issues and meet them with a sense of 
confidence, aware of difficulties, aware of hazards, aware of all the 
dangers out there, but at the  same time ensuring that we face those 
dangers, not hide from them.
<P>
	It is in contrast to all those who work upon fear, who cling to 
yesterday's solutions, who refuse to confront challenges as they 
exist and who instead try to find ways to exploit and develop 
people's sense of insecurity and anxiety.
<P>
	The throne speech is about a renewal of this country, renewing a 
spirit within, renewing ourselves and renewing what the country 
can represent. It is not a prescription to run and hide.
<P>
	One thing that is important to impress as part of the throne 
speech is the very important international dimension this agenda 
has.
<P>
	No one can escape from the major impacts and influences of the 
world we live in. Jobs in a competitive economy and globalization 
are affected every day in every way. There must be international 
co-operation and understanding to make sure that we work together 
to create the climate and initiatives for employment.
<P>
	Our financial system is a totally global one. We must find ways 
to break rules and establish conventions to ensure that it works in 
an orderly, fair and just way. Our own democratic way of life can 
also be threatened by instability beyond our borders and by the 
denial of rights of other people. These can soon haunt and reflect 
on ourselves.
<P>
	We have a system of health in which viruses can travel across 
borders without any interference and all of a sudden we are faced 
with a need for massive international action.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	Even now we can visit the Internet where hate literature, 
propaganda and the violence of words can be screened across 
electronic communications to reach the minds of our young people 
within seconds.
<P>
	Canada is intellectually, indelibly and forever a part of an 
international system. As part of that system we must be deeply 
concerned about the rise of the counter culture playing on people's 
doubts and insecurities in languages increasingly shrill, against 
enemies finding someone to oppose. It fragments society when 
there is an urgent need to strengthen it.
<P>
	I listened with shock and dismay to the member for Matapédia 
when he said: ``As a founding people we deserve our own 
country''. How often have we heard that around the world in recent 
generations, where one culture or language group has demanded its 
own country? As a result, there has been war, conflict and even 
worse by that very same attitude that was expressed a few minutes 
ago. It is shocking and awful to hear this in the House of Commons 
when we as a country have worked so hard to build on diversity, 
tolerance and openness to give all people a fair and equal chance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="145"> 145 </A></B>
<P>
	The charter of rights gives everybody a fair degree of 
opportunity, liberty and rights. No country in the world has a 
greater sense of liberty. The reality is that it is being denied. This 
sense of liberty is something we can hold up as a model to the 
world. We can show the rest of the world that we know how to 
be tolerant to make different languages and cultures work together. 
We are the prototype of the 21st century. We are a nation state 
that understands that in order to accommodate and work in a 
global economy we must build on the strength of that diversity.
<P>
	With all my heart and passion I oppose the kind of attitude we 
heard from the member opposite and what he represents. That does 
not represent the best and finest of this country. Part of the 
international dimension is to oppose that view.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	Canadians understand that it is in our best interest to develop a 
more open relationship with foreign countries. We must ensure that 
young Canadians will be able to export Canadian know-how, 
Canadian expertise and Canadian culture. Youth employment 
programs give young Canadians numerous opportunities to 
develop their skills, be it only through job experience in the third 
world or by working for the advancement of human rights. These 
are opportunities that are open to young Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is what the international dimension is all about. It is wrong 
to retreat into isolationism and separatism. It is why it is so 
important that we as Canadians stand as a model that we can 
advance round the world.
<P>
	Philosopher George Steiner said not too long ago that life in 
many parts of the world is becoming a series of dangerous 
reversions in the face of rapid change. I understand that. It is one of 
the callings of Canadians to fight against that reversion, fight 
against that inward look and fragmentation and work in the world 
with a much more broad and expansionary view.
<P>
	We see it in the incidents Canada is facing today relating to what 
is happening in Cuba. Americans are justifiably angered that a 
small civilian aircraft was shot down. We have supported their 
efforts to go to the United Nations and ICAO.
<P>
	It is equally wrong to pass legislation that in itself contravenes 
international rules and practices to unilaterally affect individuals 
and companies in another country against basic treaties and 
conventions that have been signed and against the expressed desire 
of the United States government to have a new set of rules of 
investment to make sure there is openness and fair trading. It is 
wrong to introduce that kind of legislation in order to correct the 
other possibility. That is why we object so strongly to it.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	Flagrant unilateralism, great or small, cannot be tolerated. We 
must have a world of rule, of law. We must have a world governed 
by a set of standards we can all adhere to. That is what we 
Canadians have to stand up for internationally.
<P>
	The answer in Canada is to build bridges, not walls. That is the 
Canadian way and has been for many generations. It is what I 
believe Canadians want us to express as a government: to help 
people reach out, to help build those bridges, to bring a partnership 
between government and people, to do it domestically, to bring a 
partnership of business and labour together to help create jobs for 
young people, to build partnerships and bridges between the 
regions of the country so we can share in our diversity, to build 
bridges and partnerships between different generations and 
different ages. The fundamental role of this national government is 
to help build those bridges, not to bring up the walls as others in the 
House seem to espouse.
<P>
	I have been struck, since taking on the responsibility of foreign 
minister, with how constant and ongoing the expectation is of 
people around the world that this is what Canadians will provide. 
They recognize that over the years we have been able to acquire 
and adopt an important and significant role. People around the 
world look to Canadians for solutions, for good ideas and for 
leadership.
<P>
	Let us consider the kind of initiative we debated in the House last 
night. We are being asked by the world community to take 
leadership in Haiti. Why? We are a country of two founding 
peoples with two languages and are able to bring together the 
strength of our two great cultures to offer an opportunity to the 
world.
<P>
	What an enormous, incredible, important and significant 
contribution we have to make as a country as we now stand. Those 
who want to break it apart, to separate it and fragment it are 
certainly making a serious mistake. As former Prime Minister 
Trudeau said in the U.S. Congress many years ago, it would be a 
crime against humanity to have Canada separate simply because of 
what we have to offer to the international world.
<P>
	An American himself, Adelai Stevenson, one of those kinder and 
gentler Americans, in a speech he made in Canada said that Canada 
has never claimed the status of a major power but it has been 
influential beyond its means because it is a patient, level headed 
poise in the world. We can ride out convulsions. He said the rest of 
the world needed the built in gyroscope that Canadians seem to 
acquire when dealing in world affairs.
<P>
	Forty years later the world is still in great convulsion. We face 
storms of our own time. I think if Adelai Stevenson were alive 
today he would agree that the gyroscope, the special skill and 
aptitude of Canadians is still working.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="146"> 146 </A></B>
<P>
	We seek to be an activist, a partner nation encouraging global 
systems of security and human improvement, helping to shape 
rules and procedures, advancing the cause of human rights and 
strengthening the ties of trade so we can help people grow and 
prosper. The throne speech indicates those spheres of action where 
we can make a difference.
<P>
	We have to set priorities in our foreign policy. If we have a 
priority for everything then there is no priority. The first priority is 
to ensure the fundamental defence and protection of Canadian 
interests both here and abroad. The fundamental responsibility of 
government is to make sure Canadians have the best representation 
possible and I can guarantee they will receive that from this 
government.
<P>
	However, security goes beyond simply the protection of one's 
own boundaries and interests. So much in the world today is now 
bound up in the much broader global scope. The best way we can 
defend our interests as a country is to defend them in our 
international institutions and forums, to build those rules and 
institutions that allow Canadians to get the kind of protection they 
need.
<P>
	Since taking on this responsibility, I have said that I am deeply 
concerned about the state of affairs of the United Nations and the 
fundamental need to reform its finances, its institutions and its 
outreach to ensure it can become an institution that enables us to 
provide a way of life and a way of mediating conflicts, responding 
to poverty and defending rights around the world.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia, Croatia and Haiti must be 
maintained. Beyond the military action, we want to help rebuild 
their civilian society.
<P>
	I think a new concept of safety has now emerged, including 
personal safety and social, environmental and economic security.
<P>
	We may not be a great power, but have been favoured by our 
position. Our two official languages, French and English, our 
diversified population, our expertise as a trading nation and our 
respect for democratic values enable us to play a crucial role as a 
link, for instance, between Europe and America.
<P>
	In my opinion, Canada might be able act as a bridge to help 
reopen the transatlantic dialogue between Europe and North 
America. We can build new partnerships in terms of financial, 
technical and training assistance for Canadian and European youth.
<P>
	That is why I pointed out the fact that the European Commission 
had decided to strengthen the links between Europe and America.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	At the same time, our security as Canadians is also deeply and 
inextricably tied to the way we deal with the problem of arms in 
this world. Canada has a long and historic tradition of working 
against the build up of arms and to secure disarmament and arms 
control. We must work effectively for the policing of the 
comprehensive test ban treaty and include a ban on the ghastly 
cheap weapons that haunt every countryside of warfare with the 
awful land mines that are dismembering thousands of people 
around the world today.
<P>
	Security also depends on good law and good regulation. The 
throne speech clearly enunciated our commitment to fulfil the 
mandate of the law of the sea to protect the increasingly scarce 
resources, to cherish the sea as the sustainer of life and not as a 
waste pit.
<P>
	We also need to temper and balance the workings of the 
international marketplace with proper rules and standards, which is 
perhaps the most serious and important dialogue that members of 
Parliament will have. We have discovered in our own domestic 
economies and societies that there has to be a good framework of 
law to make the marketplace work. We need the same framework 
internationally. We need to be sure that the disputes are properly 
handled. We need to clearly demonstrate the practices that will 
ensure basic standards of rights for people within that framework.
<P>
	That is why the throne speech made a very strong commitment to 
making a real difference as a country in developing new labour 
standards, particularly as they apply to the exploitation of children.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Regarding human rights, Canada can play a leading role. 
Children's rights high are among this government's priorities. We 
are currently seeking an international consensus to curb child 
labour.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In addressing this very important issue, I believe we can begin to 
move to protect and promote children's rights, as we debated in this 
House on a resolution I sponsored almost eight years ago, but we 
must first ensure that there are proper rules, laws and covenants 
that can ensure that children's rights are protected. This means 
working at the multilateral level, the commission of human rights 
in Geneva and through the ILO, and taking the lead in negotiating a 
protocol on the abolition of child sex trades in this country.
<P>
	We also have to ensure that those countries which are facing 
problems of child labour have the means and capacity to respond 
and change. We have recently given a major donation of $700,000 
to the International Labour Organization so it can be helpful in 
developing these new standards.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="147"> 147 </A></B>
<P>
	We also have to work bilaterally, as we are now in Africa 
working with 15 countries on that continent to establish programs 
for the education of girls. Education is the alternative to exploitive 
labour. Where we can make a real difference as Canadians is to 
help those young children receive the education they deserve.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	We also need to look at the voluntary actions of Canadians and at 
the codes of conduct for businesses building on a consumer 
oriented approach like the Rugmark. We need to have an outreach 
among Canadians to ensure they understand that a purchase of an 
article created through the travails of a young child is contributing 
to that exploitation.
<P>
	I look forward to the views and suggestions of members of 
Parliament on this very important priority. It will take a full 
consensus, not just internationally but within Canada, to make this 
an effort that can demonstrate just how important and how effective 
Canada can be.
<P>
	I also suggest we take an important leadership role, working with 
like minded countries, to promote a reduction in the demand for 
arms. We must begin by tying economic and international 
development to the spending on military weapons and armaments 
to ensure there is a proper ratio between the two. This will enable 
us to provide a bonus system for those countries that are willing to 
reduce their arms expenditures. By providing that kind of 
consensus internationally, we can make a difference.
<P>
	There are many other areas we can talk about, but the most 
important one, which does not have a substance, a policy or a 
program, is just basically the Canadian way of doing things. Call it 
creative realism, as Lester Pearson, our Nobel prize winner, once 
called it, building consensus, developing alliances or forming acts 
of careful conciliation. It is a way of ensuring that the values by 
which we live do not become ideologies, do not become hard and 
rigid, but in fact we find ways of building bridges between people 
so that various values and interests which compete can also find 
co-operation.
<P>
	One must believe that one cannot have everything that one wants 
to have. We must search for overarching ways of providing 
connections and liaisons between people. To do that we must 
substantially engage Canadians in this new search for our 
international dimension. The new technologies of communication 
have outpaced the traditional meeting places of committees and 
councils. It is probably an overstatement, but the fact is fax 
machines helped circumvent the Soviet dictatorships that tried to 
reimpose the old suffering.
<P>
	Each month millions of people add to the new networks of the 
web to get worldwide information. As I speak today, students in my 
own city of Winnipeg have an Internet connection to Pacific rim 
countries talking  about their common problems. There is a young 
teacher from New Brunswick who is now connecting with groups 
in Scotland to find out ways of training young people.
<P>
	The opportunity the Internet provides is a form of electronic 
peacekeeping. It brings ideas, information and research and 
development around the world in an instantaneous way. One place 
Canada can make a difference is in the grand field of international 
communication and helping to build that consensus with the means 
that we have.
<P>
	I believe that if we take a look at the area of national life that is 
so much affected by our international dimensions, no area is 
untouched or uncovered. That is why in this throne speech we go 
out of our way to make sure that foreign policy is not just a closed 
door exercise, some esoteric discipline taken behind the area with 
whispers or by elites, but becomes the grand engagement of all 
Canadians. In particular, we want to reach out to young Canadians 
because they will be the true citizens of this new global world as we 
move into the 21st century. It is not just a matter of the policy and 
the programs, it is also bringing it about.
<P>
	I welcomed the expressions last evening from members of the 
opposition wanting to work in this Parliament, wanting to make it a 
place for global dialogue and a place where Canadians believe they 
have the opportunity to make a difference with their views, their 
ideas and their suggestions so that we can truly give them a sense 
that they are engaged as world citizens in the 21st century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when the minister talks about building something together, I am 
with him. When he talks about a consensus, I am also with him. 
When he talks about building bridges, everyone agrees with this.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	But I would remind him that, since Mr. Lesage, we have been 
trying to build such bridges year after year. One after the other, the 
Liberal Party in Quebec, the Union Nationale, the Parti Quebecois 
tried to negotiate in the best of faith, and without bias as even the 
Liberals then in power met with failure. When Jean Lesage coined 
the phrase ``Masters in our own house'', he knew what he was 
talking about.
<P>
	The minister referred to Mr. Trudeau earlier. If I understood 
correctly, he was saying that Mr. Trudeau kind of brought people 
together at some point. I am sorry, but if there is someone who 
isolated Quebec, it is Mr. Trudeau himself. So how can you tell me 
that Mr. Trudeau tried to bring Quebec into the fold.
<P>
	The minister said earlier that he was insulted by the fact that I 
was referring to two peoples. I must repay him in kind by saying 
that he in turn has insulted the people of Matapédia-Matane, 64 
per cent of whom voted for an  independent Quebec. Sixty-four per 
cent of the people in my riding said yes so that we can have our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="148"> 148 </A></B>
<P>
own country. That is a lot of people, and not only the member for 
Matapédia-Matane.
<P>
	On another point, as I said earlier, there are many unemployed 
people in my riding. It is the minister himself who put forward the 
proposed employment insurance reform. In my riding, they called 
this poverty insurance. They say, and I think they are right, that the 
fund comes from employee and employer premiums. How can they 
take money from people who are hard-pressed to earn $20,000, 
$22,000 or $23,000 a year?
<P>
	Our forestry workers work with chain saws in the heat of 
summer from five in the morning until late in the evening. It is 
back-breaking work. Those who have never done such work should 
try it.
<P>
	I therefore make a suggestion to the minister who, I think, was 
behind this employment insurance: Since there will be a $5 billion 
surplus in this fund next year, why not distribute it among the 
regions to create jobs instead of unemployment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I 
want to tell the hon. member that he is not the only person 
interested in partnership. I have been a member of this House for 
many years and I work very hard to develop a partnership in 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Part of the problem, as I said in my speeches, is looking at this in 
isolation. There are many members of the House who have gone 
into their own regions. When the Meech Lake accord came in front 
of the House, it was not exactly the most popular proposal in my 
constituency in Winnipeg, but it was presented as a way of reaching 
out and forming a partnership. I voted for it and so did my friend 
from Winnipeg Transcona. It was done even though public opinion 
at the time in western Canada was very much against it. However, I 
believed it was a way of building a bridge.
<P>
	I do not need to be lectured by this hon. member about what it 
takes to try to build bridges. I have not given up on that. I still 
believe in this country. I still believe in building bridges. I still 
believe there is an enormous advantage for all of us in working 
together, not only for ourselves as I said in my speech, but for the 
rest of the world. If we can prove that it can happen, that we do not 
have to separate and form little countries around small groups of 
people, that we can find strength in diversity and build those 
bridges, then it is a model this world desperately needs and 
desperately cries out for.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member talks about employment insurance. Perhaps 
one of the reasons people in his riding did not respond is that I am 
not sure he told them what was in  the bill. He did not tell them that 
in the employment insurance bill was an absolute guarantee of 
income for low income Canadians. For the first time in the history 
of that act the people he is talking about are now guaranteed a basic 
income, something we have been talking about in this House for 30 
or 40 years.
<P>
	I bet the hon. member did not have anything to say about that. He 
did not talk about the fact that hundreds of millions of dollars are 
going to be reinvested to find jobs. I have never heard a Bloc 
member credit the fact that what we are saying to the poor people in 
his riding and everywhere else is that the best way out of poverty is 
to have a job. And the best way to get a job is to make sure that one 
has the opportunity to have that job is to reinvest in skills, to 
reinvest in developing that job, to reinvest in changing the 
economy; in other words, to be really ready to face change and not 
hide from it, not fear it, not exploit it, but to face change-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must face the need to adjust the economy, for the benefit of 
all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to the minister's presentation. I was particularly 
interested in his comments when he was talking about Canada's 
place in the world and the importance of rules based organizations 
to look after Canada's interests. I certainly agree with him on that 
point.
<P>
	Canada has been a world leader in trying to develop trade rules 
ever since the second world war and has been successful in pushing 
for a settlement of the latest Uruguay round of the GATT 
agreement. That is to our credit. As an exporting country it is 
certainly of interest to us. It is important that we have a rules based 
organization to rely on in areas of trade disputes.
<P>
	We have had trade disputes with the United States on softwood 
lumber where we have won panel decisions three times. Is it not 
time to test those new organizations such as the World Trade 
Organization and ask them to make a ruling? I feel we have a very 
strong case. Instead of accepting caps on exports, such as we did on 
wheat and softwood lumber, is it not time to test the strength of 
those organizations that both ourselves, the United States and 120 
other member countries have signed?
<P>
	I would ask the minister to give consideration to asking a wider 
body for a ruling on this, rather than having the trade frictions that 
exist between Canada and the United States on these issues?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I ask the hon. minister to give a very brief answer 
if it is possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. 
First I thank the hon. member for focusing on that point. I believe 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="149"> 149 </A></B>
<P>
one of the most serious priorities we  face is to establish the 
validity and legitimacy of many of these organizations.
<P>
	As I said earlier in my speech, what I find disturbing about the 
present debate in the United States on the Helms-Burton bill is that 
the United States has been a great advocate at the OECD, for 
example, for developing a multilateral set of rules on investment. 
Now it has brought in domestic legislation which fully contradicts 
that whole notion of having a free market of investment based on 
an international set of rules.
<P>
	Sometimes it is difficult to make changes as we are still working 
in a world of nation states. We have to use our powers of persuasion 
as much as we can. At the same time the hon. member has a useful 
suggestion to make. If the rules are there we should begin using 
them. That means we also have to accept the fact that people are 
going to use the rules against us and we must be prepared to abide 
by that as well.
<P>
	I have talked to the hon. member's colleague about how we can 
bring these matters before the committee and have a really good 
dialogue about them so that we can begin to see where there is 
agreement in this Parliament. If we have Parliament agreeing, it 
strengthens the hand of the government to pursue these kinds of 
actions.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to begin by thanking the Reform Party for allowing me 
to take 10 minutes of their time. I asked yesterday that the NDP be 
allowed to speak after the three official parties in this House had 
spoken. We were not successful in that.
<P>
	Afterward, the Reform Party offered me this spot. I appreciate it 
but, of course, we still feel that on matters of major importance we 
should be allowed that role. We will be seeking it in the future. In 
the meantime, I am appreciative of the opportunity being granted to 
me at this time.
<P>
	I am also appreciative, by coincidence, that I happen to be 
speaking just after the Minister of Foreign Affairs. It was a 
surprise. Without being too much distracted from what I planned to 
say, I want to say that I listened carefully to the minister's spirited 
defence of multilateralism. That is both within the tradition of the 
Liberal Party and within the tradition of a broader Canadian 
consensus.
<P>
	It is also within the tradition of Canadian foreign policy that at 
times we realize the limits to multilateralism, that we have to act on 
our own on occasion and show leadership. Certainly that is what I 
was trying to do when the government brought in the legislation to 
implement the WTO.
<P>
	The NDP moved amendments that would have done two things. 
First, it would have prohibited the  importation of goods produced 
by child labour pursuant to the ILO definition. Second, it would 
have called on the government to report on a regular basis what it 
was doing to build a social clause into the WTO.
<P>
	I understand that the minister does not feel that Canada can act 
unilaterally on child labour, that he wants to build a consensus. 
There is also a role for regulation in the WTO. Maybe that follows 
the consensus.
<P>
	Certainly there is a role for the Canadian government to report 
back to Parliament, on a regular basis, what it is doing in order to 
create that very thing. You could say that the social clause that we 
wanted you to report on and which you voted against at that time is 
the very kind of thing you now want to create.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I simply want to remind 
everyone to please direct comments through the Chair to the 
minister or whoever.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> My apologies, Mr. Speaker. I want to talk about a 
couple of things. First is the whole question of national unity.
<P>
	Canada is threatened on two fronts having to do with unity. First 
is the ongoing problem with respect to how we accommodate the 
obvious need in Quebec for its cultural distinctiveness and desire 
for more autonomy to be recognized within the Canadian context.
<P>
	The second one-they are related-is the pressure on the 
Canadian social contract that was built up in the post-war world. 
The pressure on that social contract is a result, partly, of an 
ideological trend against seeing government as a positive force in 
the economy and in society.
<P>
	Also partly ideological-some people call it globalization-are 
the pressures from so-called competition and the debt, which is a 
result in large part of that globalization and our inability to 
maintain our revenue base.
<P>
	All these things are putting pressure on the kind of Canada that 
Quebecers voted to stay in in a substantial way in 1980. Two things 
have to happen in my judgment. We need to find a way of taking 
into account Quebec's cultural distinctiveness and need for more 
autonomy within the Canadian context and we need to build, to 
recover, to maintain a kind of social democratic Canada. There was 
a social democratic consensus in the country about what kind of 
country we wanted. To the extent that that has been eroding it has 
created a Canada about which not just Quebecers but also many 
other Canadians are anxious and wondering about the future. I say 
that those are the two fronts on which the government must work.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	The failure to meet Quebec's needs is being exploited by people 
who were separatists all along. But it has also made separatists out 
of people who were not. We need to  recognize that. It is an ongoing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="150"> 150 </A></B>
<P>
failure the government must address. I do not have any long or 
brilliant suggestions to make as to how it ought to do that today.
<P>
	However, I do want to put on the record something which has 
bothered me for a long time. Along with a handful of other MPs, 
including the member for Winnipeg South Centre, I was here in 
1981 when we repatriated the Constitution. We, who were not from 
Quebec, by voting for that repatriation package, in no way intended 
to deliver an insult or any humiliation to Quebec. We were in the 
House with 75 MPs from Quebec, 74 from the Liberal Party at that 
time. Those of us from outside Quebec were assured over and over 
again by all our Quebec colleagues in the House that this was not an 
insult to Quebec, that there was support for this in Quebec. For 
anyone in Quebec to suggest that those of us outside of Quebec 
were engaged in some kind of nefarious activity against Quebec at 
the time is quite unfair and inaccurate.
<P>
	What is true is that most of us from outside Quebec for a number 
of years in the House and elsewhere have been constantly reduced 
to spectators in a debate that is really taking place between 
Quebecers themselves, whether it is Mr. Levesque and Mr. Trudeau 
or Mr. Bouchard and the current Prime Minister. I think Canadians 
outside of Quebec are tired of being spectators to this debate taking 
place in one part of their country about the future of the whole 
country.
<P>
	Although I do not necessarily know the details, in that sense I 
applaud the notion that somehow next time round the whole 
country will be involved in what transpires with respect to Quebec.
<P>
	I want to say a bit about jobs. The Prime Minister has challenged 
the private sector to create jobs. He said that the government had 
done its part and now it is up to the private sector to do its job.
<P>
	I do not think the government has done its job with respect to job 
creation. It says it is getting the fundamentals right. I am not sure 
that the fundamentals are as fundamental as it thinks they are. 
However, let us take it for a minute that the fundamentals are right. 
The government still has not addressed other fundamental issues 
such as the fact that the world trading system, the global economy 
the minister spoke about is siphoning off jobs from the so-called 
industrialized world into other lower wage economies and labour 
markets.
<P>
	Unless we set ourselves against that trend we are going to 
continue to have a very difficult problem generating the kind of 
employment we want in the country. It is not about creating any old 
job. It is partly a question of creating jobs that pay Canadians 
enough so that the middle class of the country, and others who 
aspire to be so, can continue to dream the kind of dreams we 
dreamt in the past and to live the kind of life we dreamt of in the 
past, albeit within some diminished expectations related not to the 
economy but to the environment and the need  for us to realize the 
limits of the planet when it comes to growth, but not the limits to 
justice.
<P>
	I am prepared to recognize limits to the environment when it 
comes to economic growth but not limits to justice. It seems to me 
there is not that kind of effort on the part of the government. I know 
that is a big project but I do not see progress. I see too much 
acceptance of the way things are on the other side of the House and 
not enough resistance. I know the resistance was there when they 
were in opposition and particularly when the member for Winnipeg 
South Centre was on the opposition benches. I hope he has not 
given up on resisting those trends.
<P>
	I have some concrete suggestions in terms of job creation. I do 
not think the corporate sector is going to meet the Prime Minister's 
challenge. In order to be challenged one must be a moral agent.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	In order to accept the challenge of another human being one 
must be a human being. In order to accept the moral challenge 
implicit in the Prime Minister's challenge, one must have a 
particular mind set. The mind set that our corporate elite and 
corporate sector have now is by definition amoral. I might want 
sometimes to say even immoral, but it is at least amoral. They do 
not recognize the economy is a moral sphere at all, which is why I 
do not think this challenge will be picked up. I hope it is. There 
may be some companies that are exceptions but we continue to see 
company after company whose profit margins are in good shape 
laying off employees, or as my colleague from Kamloops recently 
said, casting off employees.
<P>
	The other day the member for Kamloops unveiled something he 
is promoting which we are promoting with him, a Canadian code of 
corporate citizenship. This tries to instil in the Canadian business 
community some sense of its responsibility to the community, but 
that is very hard to do in a world of free trade and globalization 
which basically says there are no borders, there are no 
communities, it is all just one big marketplace.
<P>
	We are fighting the very kind of mindset that has been enshrined 
in these agreements when we try to do this, when the government is 
trying to do it or when the NDP is trying to do it or when anybody is 
trying to do it. We are tilting against a windmill when it comes to 
talking about responsibility in a world trading system, in a global 
economy which basically pooh-poohs that kind of thing.
<P>
	The government should be looking at ways it can encourage 
corporations to create jobs. There are all kinds of tax breaks that 
discourage job creation and mitigate against the preservation of 
employment. We have tax breaks for research and development and 
technologies that eliminate jobs.
<P>
	The banks have taken advantage of tax credits to introduce their 
automatic teller systems. We have tax  breaks that favour mergers 
which lead to layoffs. We have tax breaks that favour greater RRSP 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="151"> 151 </A></B>
<P>
investment outside of the country which creates jobs outside the 
country.
<P>
	Instead we need to get rid of those tax breaks. Let us have a tax 
on overtime. I have people in my riding who have to work overtime 
at the CNR and there are hundreds of people laid off there who 
would be dying to get back in there and work. They cannot get back 
in there but the CNR and other corporations like it are allowed to 
make people work overtime who do not want to work overtime.
<P>
	Why do we not have a tax on overtime? Why do we not have 
taxes and other incentives to make family friendly schedules, 
benefit requirements that do not discriminate against part time 
workers to allow people to work part time rather than full time and 
still have benefits? There are many things we can do like that to 
create jobs without challenging the global economy. I hope next 
week we see some of that in the budget.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a few 
comments and questions I would like to put to the member for 
Winnipeg Transcona. First, he talked about always working for 
Canadian unity. I would simply remind him that an NDP member 
scuttled the Meech Lake accord.
<P>
	I do not know what the NDP did to prevent its members from 
blocking the Meech Lake accord. Perhaps he could give us an 
answer. This is a sensitive question for an NDP member.
<P>
	The government talks a lot about dialogue with the provinces in 
the speech from the throne. I would like to ask the hon. member for 
example what he thinks of the government's behaviour since 
October 30 and its statements, which are rather sources of 
provocation for Quebec.
<P>
	What, for example, does he think of the Minister of Indian 
Affairs, who said that the Government of Quebec intended to use 
the army to clear native peoples out of Quebec after it became 
sovereign. Is this confrontation or dialogue? What does he think 
about Quebec being divisible? If Quebec is divisible, it could also 
take part of Ontario or New Brunswick. I would like to know what 
he thinks of that.
<P>
	I would also like to know what he thinks of the fact that the 
speech from the throne intimates that the offers are like those in the 
Charlottetown accord, that the vision is the same or less than that of 
Charlottetown. It is less than Charlottetown. It is an affront to 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	In my opinion, this is no dialogue. It is not an offer that can be 
easily accepted. It is, rather, a confrontation, because we turned 
down the Charlottetown accord in  Quebec, because it did not 
provide enough for Quebec. English Canada turned it down, 
because it gave Quebec too much. I would like to ask him about 
this as well.
<P>
	Of course, we in Quebec have said we wanted to destroy Canada. 
They say the separatists want to destroy Canada. I would like to ask 
him a question on this as well, because we have no intention of 
destroying Canada. On the contrary, we have extended an offer of 
economic and political partnership. I would like him to clarify his 
remarks somewhat in this regard.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Somehow I have a particular 
sense that the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona would love to 
answer all of those questions more extensively but I ask him within 
the framework of two minutes to summarize his comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel obliged to answer the member 
quite comprehensively but I will take your advice on the matter.
<P>
	With respect to what the hon. member said about an NDP 
member of Parliament being the one who destroyed the Meech 
Lake accord, of course that is not true. There were no NDPs who 
did that. I presume the member is referring to former NDP MLA in 
the Manitoba legislature, Elijah Harper, who has since become a 
Liberal member and who now sits in the House.
<P>
	With respect to Meech maybe that is not a coincidence because if 
memory serves, it was the Liberal Party which either talked out of 
both sides of its mouth on Meech or had people in both camps or 
had people who were responsible for starting the brush fires that 
eventually consumed the accord. I am thinking of the leader of the 
Liberal Party in Manitoba, the Liberal premier of New Brunswick 
and a number of other people who were first to jump on the 
anti-Meech bandwagon which then grew.
<P>
	When the Meech Lake accord was originally arrived at in 1987 
there was a great deal of consensus about the importance of the 
achievement that it represented on all sides of the House. The hon. 
member should know because he was here that the NDP caucus did 
not waiver in its support of Meech. From time to time it sought 
amendments as the pressure grew and might have saved it but 
certainly does not deserve any way the accusation the member 
made.
<P>
	With respect to the status of the Cree in northern Quebec, that is 
a matter which the PQ government, the new premier and the Bloc 
Quebecois have to take very seriously. To some extent this whole 
thing about Quebec has been a bit of a parlour game in this country 
for a long time but it is not a parlour game anymore.
<P>
	There is a reality called the aboriginal people in Quebec who 
inhabit a territory that was not always part of Quebec. They have a 
case to be made, a case that runs counter to the consensus that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="152"> 152 </A></B>
<P>
exists in a lot of parties over a lot of time about the nature of 
Quebec's self-determination.
<P>
	Aboriginal people have also made the case for their 
self-determination in the last 10 or 20 years. If push does come to 
shove and we do have a Quebec that seeks to separate that will be a 
very ugly situation. Anybody who pretends that is not so is not 
doing a service to either the Canadian people or to the voters of 
Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems we have 
been meeting this way quite often lately, including last night.
<P>
	I want to express the views of my constituents primarily, what I 
have heard them talk about when it comes to this throne speech. I 
have been listening in the House and I have not heard a lot of 
people referring to the throne speech and yet this is the throne 
speech that we are talking about. I want to direct myself at that and 
keep on that topic.
<P>
	I think Canadians have been looking forward to this. This is the 
mid-term of the government. There has been great anticipation as 
to when things are going to get started and when something will 
actually be done.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	All of us as members of Parliament have been listening to our 
constituents tell us they are concerned. They are passed concern. 
They are outright worried about what is happening to the country. 
Whether it is town hall meetings or whether it is when we are door 
knocking or whether it is TV phone-in shows or whatever, the 
message is loud and clear: they are unhappy and concerned about a 
number of things.
<P>
	I will talk about how they were dealt with or not dealt with in the 
throne speech. I will start with official opposition status. Obviously 
there is a concern that a regional party represents all parts of 
Canada when it is from one province and conduct only the concerns 
of one province. There is an outright repulsion by this whole idea. 
This is not good for anybody in the country. I trust the party in 
power realizes that as well.
<P>
	The people are ahead of the politicians, as they so often are. I sat 
in a seminar with over 500 farmers. In that room there were more 
people with more common sense and more entrepreneurship than I 
have found anywhere in Ottawa among bureaucrats or politicians. 
They are ahead of us. They know what is happening and they are 
saying: ``The message must come from us to government through 
you guys. You must carry the message that way''. They do not see 
that happening.
<P>
	I am sure when they look at the throne speech they will only have 
their outright concern brought forward even more dramatically. 
The people are saying the are concerned about jobs, about the 
security of their jobs, their hope for the future. Band-aid solutions 
are not the answer. Infrastructure programs, government make 
work programs are not the answer.
<P>
	We need to get creative. We need to look at things like a total 
reform of the tax system. That will certainly cause a whole change, 
a light at the end of the tunnel for business and for individuals. We 
will see something happening. That is what people are demanding, 
not a government run by a bunch of bureaucrats.
<P>
	Canadians are concerned about their pensions. They hear that 
from ministers. They hear that from provincial politicians. They 
hear that from everyone. Their pensions might be threatened. That 
is real, not something they are imagining. They are hearing it.
<P>
	We need a plan. As representatives of the people we have come 
up with a plan similar to one Chile adopted 11 years ago in which 
people are responsible for themselves. They do not count on UI or 
on government because government has failed miserably in these 
areas. We need to look at these and give people some hope, some 
light, but the throne speech did not do that.
<P>
	Canadians are concerned about health care. They want a plan. 
They want to know where it is going. They feel threatened. Lines 
are getting longer. Service is poor. Why is that? There is no long 
term vision to get a national standard and then let the provinces 
handle the administration of it. We know that is a major part of 
Canadian society and we need a vision.
<P>
	When I was elected the debt was $489 billion. Now it is $577 
billion. When we go back to the polls it will be $600 billion plus. 
That is a lack of vision. We are not doing the job here and that is the 
message we are getting. The $50 billion in interest payments is 
destroying our social programs. That is what is destroying us.
<P>
	In the province I come from I cannot believe the pride and the 
whole sense of accomplishment because we have balanced our 
budget. The people are proud it. They say: ``I did not vote for those 
rotten-'' whatever the government is, but they are proud of them 
anyway. There is pride, there is hope and they see light at the end of 
the tunnel. That is what the federal government has to realize.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	We could talk about the criminal justice system. We could talk 
about the light that is needed in that. We could talk about 
government waste. We could talk about the other place and the 
disgust people have for it. We could talk about accountability. Give 
people the accountability they are asking for.
<P>
	We need free votes. We need recall. We need to be able to get rid 
of MPs who do not do their jobs. We need that sort of thing to build 
the trust, hope and vision for Canadians.
<P>
	I will touch on the area of foreign affairs in response to the 
foreign affairs minister. I listened with great  interest and I trust we 
will have the co-operation we have talked about and that in 
committee there will be meaningful meetings where instead of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="153"> 153 </A></B>
<P>
partisan politics 15 people can work together for the good of 
Canada. That is an area in which it can be done.
<P>
	We want to become a strong middle power. We want to have 
leadership. In those areas where we can we want to do really well. 
If it is peacekeeping, then let us be sure we have the very best 
trained with the best morale. Let us pick and choose the missions 
and then let us do our best so that the whole world will see us as the 
best. The pride Canada will gain from that will have great domestic 
value as well.
<P>
	Let us talk about diplomacy. We should be the world's leading 
diplomats. We have the best reputation. We do not have a colonial 
record. We do not have any kind of aggressive record. We have the 
best record. Canadians are very shy. We tend to have an inferiority 
complex when we are outside the country. We must get over that 
and the government has to lead the way on it.
<P>
	We need to promote our country because we are a trading nation. 
We need to lead in demanding and helping with UN reform. The 
UN is not working. It is a bureaucratic nightmare, one that has 
become corrupt with time. It is 50 years old. It needs to be 
reformed dramatically. We should emphasize the details of that.
<P>
	As an example, we are still fiddling around with Haiti and the 
mission expires today. It is gone today, yet there is still no 
agreement. We are still getting changes. The UN is not doing the 
job set out for it and we must work on that.
<P>
	I could go on with this vision. I hope I got my message across 
that it is leadership we need. We need leadership to show the 
Canadian people that we do have a vision for the country and that 
we are sincere in what we are doing.
<P>
	Probably the best quote I picked up in the last three days of the 
throne speech debate just happens to be from the member for 
Beaver River: ``Canadians have told us they want a nation where a 
person's dreams are not hollow, where ambitions can be pursued 
and ultimately realized. They want a country where people can 
look to the future with excitement rather than fear, where a mother 
or father not only hopes but honestly expects that their children's 
lives will be better than their own. They want a country where 
every individual feels safe enough to explore, confident enough to 
innovate, secure enough to take risks. They want an environment 
where accomplishments are celebrated and setbacks are only 
temporary. They want a country where people can feel secure in 
their homes and their communities, where every member of society 
can live with dignity and where men and women can grow old 
without fear''.
<P>
	That summarizes the vision I see for this country. I hope other 
members share that vision with me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, listening to 
the remarks of the member opposite it is no wonder people in 
society are showing their disrespect for MPs and for government. I 
am surprised at how the member downgraded the members of 
Parliament in the House by saying that they are basically not 
intelligent enough to present good ideas.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	To quote John Ralston Saul: ``People become so obsessed by 
hating government that they forget it is meant to be their 
government and is the only public powerful force they have 
purchase on''. He goes on to say: ``My point is that the individual 
and the government are linked together by an artery. If we act to 
sever that artery by replacing or opposing a central role for 
government, we cease to be individuals and revert to the status of 
subject''.
<P>
	One of the things we are seeing promoted by the Reform Party is 
to get government out of everything. I would like the member to be 
more specific than he was in his remarks. Does he see a role for 
government at all?
<P>
	The unemployment insurance program he talked about is very 
important to this country in terms of ensuring that we do not have 
the same situation which happened last year when people from 
Atlantic Canada competed for jobs in London, Ontario because 
there were no jobs in Atlantic Canada. This country needs a 
program such as UI, or EI as this government is proposing, which 
allows people to live in the off season and keeps them in their 
regions as full time workers in seasonal industries. Those programs 
are needed.
<P>
	Could the hon. member tell me specifically what he is saying the 
role of government should be? Could he be specific in terms of 
what he is asking us to get out of and to stay in?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can certainly give the 
member a copy of our 20-20 vision of the new Canada. It would 
take more time than I have to answer.
<P>
	Basically what I heard was a fairly elitist attitude and one I 
would expect from someone who is entrenched in this place with 
looking at the status quo as being the only way where government 
has all the answers and people have none of them. That is a total 
lack of respect for the people of this country. That kind of lack of 
respect has to be beaten down.
<P>
	There is no place for government to have the domineering 
attitude that it knows best. We would expect that. That is why most 
of us are here. That is why there are 105 people who came here 
saying the same thing: We demand change for this country.
<P>
	As far as the whole UI matter is concerned, there is a plan for 
that. Look at the plan. The plan is to give back to people the 
responsibility for themselves. When a person is 20 years old, they 
start contributing 10 per cent  of their salary to their own plan, one 
that the person monitors. That person gives 10 per cent and watches 
the amount grow month by month. If that person becomes 
unemployed, the government allows them to take some of the funds 
out. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="154"> 154 </A></B>
<P>
That person is not going to abuse that system because it is their 
system. It is their future.
<P>
	Those are the kinds of new ideas we need. We can apply this to 
health care. We can apply this to all other areas. The federal 
government will always have a role. Its role is to make Canada 
work and to be the umbrella under which all the units will operate. 
That is what the provinces are demanding. That is what they want. 
That is what the Prime Minister is saying he is going to deliver.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to participate in 
this important debate.
<P>
	The throne speech is a blueprint for the federal government. We 
have reached the midpoint of our first term. Now is the time to 
evaluate our successes, build on our achievements and prepare for 
the new challenges we will face.
<P>
	Today I will focus my remarks on Canada's youth. When I was 
elected to represent the people of Annapolis Valley-Hants, I made 
a commitment to work with the local youth. I promised the people 
of Annapolis Valley-Hants that I would do everything I could to 
ensure that young people had every opportunity to reach their full 
potential to learn, adapt and succeed in the job market and in our 
society. This has continued to be a key priority for me over the last 
28 months. I will continue to make this a priority in my work both 
in Annapolis Valley-Hants and here in Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	Our future depends on our youth. If we can ensure they are 
provided with the tools and the opportunities to gain education and 
experience now, we can help ensure a healthy future for Canada. I 
was therefore very pleased to see the focus on youth in Tuesday's 
throne speech.
<P>
	During our first two years we have introduced a number of 
important initiatives to help achieve this goal. One such program, 
Youth Service Canada, has had an extremely positive impact in 
Annapolis Valley-Hants. I have seen firsthand how local youth 
have benefited from the Youth Service Canada program.
<P>
	In April 1995, under this initiative a program entitled ``Hants 
County youth for youth'' was established with my co-ordinating 
efforts and with the help of a number of local partners. This project 
is serving 20 unemployed youth between the ages of 18 and 24. 
What has made this program so unique is that it is designed by 
youth for youth.
<P>
	This group has identified a number of local priorities and areas 
where they can make a difference in the community. The 
participants are providing community  related work through the 
development of a youth oriented newsletter, tourism development 
and the operation of a youth centre. Through Youth Service Canada 
they are truly making a difference. As a result of their success, this 
program has been extended with the support of the federal 
government and our community education partners.
<P>
	My riding has also been fortunate to host a group of young 
people involved with Katimavik. This nationally based program 
which is being funded through Youth Service Canada has allowed 
young Canadians from all over the country to come together to gain 
work experience, to travel and to learn about the regions of our 
wonderful country. I have been truly impressed with just how 
successful this program has been in terms of building a sense of 
accomplishment, a sense of self-reliance and self-esteem.
<P>
	I have also seen firsthand the success of the youth internship 
program. The youth unemployment rate is far too high and every 
year thousands of young Canadians cannot find work. At the same 
time, half of Canada's software product companies were unable to 
fill jobs in 1994. Seven thousand jobs went unfilled and this is just 
one sector. In order to help bridge this school to work transition, 
our government with the co-operation of educators, non-profit 
organizations and the private sector developed the youth internship 
program.
<P>
	In my riding of Annapolis Valley-Hants there are currently two 
internship programs up and running. In January 1995 our 
government approved a proposal for the Hants West District School 
Board. This program involves 80 students between the ages of 16 
and 24. The participants are all associated with the adult high 
school program. They are combining classroom learning with 
valuable on the job training.
<P>
	Similarly, an internship proposal was developed by the Kings 
County District School Board and has recently got under way. This 
project involves 200 students. Participants are gaining valuable 
educational skills and training in occupations with job potential.
<P>
	Clearly, if we want to use the constituency of Annapolis 
Valley-Hants as an example, we are making a difference for local 
youth. However, our efforts do not stop there. Our government 
recognizes that an important part of education and learning is 
through summer employment. Not only does it provide valuable 
income to allow students to further their education, but it allows 
our young people to gain experience they can take into the 
workforce in later years.
<P>
	I was pleased therefore to see the commitment in the throne 
speech to introduce measures to double the number of federal 
summer student jobs this coming year. However, measures to 
promote education and employment are not enough. We must build 
on these programs. I propose that we explore ways to partner these 
existing programs with the private sector in order  to double the 
benefits for youth and create economic growth. In that regard I will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="155"> 155 </A></B>
<P>
be exploring new partnerships in my riding of Annapolis 
Valley-Hants.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Last June I had the opportunity to participate in an international 
symposium on education and the economy at Acadia University. 
This conference brought business leaders, educators and youth 
together to discuss new partnerships and ways to forge closer links 
between education and business.
<P>
	I will be working with the mayor's committee on youth in the 
town of Kentville in my province of Nova Scotia. This committee 
intends to explore new ways to find opportunities for local young 
people.
<P>
	In recent years we have seen disturbing statistics with regard to 
the levels of child poverty in Canada. Canada is consistently rated 
as the number one country in the world in which to live. We are 
envied by other countries and yet one in five children still lives in 
poverty. These children often live extremely disadvantaged lives. 
They often live in poor housing conditions. They have a greater 
likelihood of experiencing unemployment in their families and 
they are more likely to drop out of school.
<P>
	What is even more telling, however, is that close to 60 per cent 
of all female single parents live in poverty. In March 1994, I had 
the opportunity to speak to this issue in the House of Commons. I 
called on the government to re-evaluate how we tax child support 
payments in order to ensure more money was reaching the children 
of separated families. All too often our current child support 
provisions have produced awards that are varied, unpredictable, 
sometimes inadequate and often unpaid.
<P>
	I said in my speech, which I will reiterate now, we must ensure 
that children are not unfairly targeted by a system that no longer 
works the way it should. I was pleased to see entrenched in the 
throne speech a commitment to change the rules governing child 
support payments. As the governor general stated in his remarks, 
equality of opportunity is a basic value in Canada and begins with 
children.
<P>
	I will touch on the important role young people can play in 
bringing Canadians together and promoting national unity. 
Although we sometimes forget, our similarities as Canadians far 
outnumber our differences. We have a common history and we 
share a common collective experience. It is important to dispel the 
regional misconceptions that sometimes divide us. In order to do 
that we must promote greater dialogue between all of our regions 
and in particular with the people of Quebec.
<P>
	I strongly believe the government can play an active role in 
helping achieve this through the promotion of exchanges among 
students and young people. In doing so, we can help ensure that 
future generations will have an opportunity to build ties that are 
based not solely on  national politics but on friendship and on the 
understanding of our differences and, more important, our many 
similarities.
<P>
	This is an idea that I have actively promoted among constituents 
in my riding. I have been meeting with local educators, business 
organizations, school groups, government officials, and we are 
looking at ways of funding and making this idea work. I am pleased 
to say that one school in my riding, Horton high school, is now 
preparing to participate in such a venture in Quebec. I believe we 
have made some important inroads in the last two years. I am also 
pleased that focus is given to youth in the throne speech.
<P>
	It is certainly the time to build on our accomplishments and to 
construct partnerships to ensure that all of our young people have 
the opportunity to reach their potential and contribute fully to our 
society.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am proud to speak on behalf of the people of 
Guelph-Wellington in support of the speech from the throne 
which has begun the second session of the 35th Parliament. I look 
back on the first session with a sense of accomplishment and I look 
forward to the second session with hope and anticipation for 
continuing the jobs and growth agenda begun in October 1993.
<P>
	The people of Guelph-Wellington witnessed a number of firsts 
in the past 24 months. For the first time in 20 years their federal 
government is reducing the deficit. For the first time in history 
their federal government has reduced the pension plan and benefits 
for members of Parliament. For the first time in a long while they 
have a government that does what it says, keeps its promises and is 
working on their behalf rather than in its own interests.
<P>
	Over the past 24 months I have participated in the opening of 
community centres, roads, schools, sports fields and other projects 
generated because we kept our word on the infrastructure program. 
It has created a tremendous amount of growth in communities all 
across Canada.
<P>
	I congratulated the employees of Nipponia Export, Armtec and 
Skyjack who have benefited from our Team Canada missions to 
Asia and South America. We just heard a Reform colleague talk 
about vision and about what the Prime Minister is doing in that 
area. For goodness sake, he is going firsthand and leading these 
missions. How grateful we are to have him.
<P>
	I worked with small business and the banks in improving 
relations and increasing dialogue. Our community said no to the 
former Leader of the Opposition when he travelled abroad 
promoting separation. Most important, I have seen the beginning of 
a transformation in the people of Guelph-Wellington.  They want 
to work with the government to create jobs, foster growth and build 
on opportunity.

	The speech from the throne offers good news to the people of 
Guelph-Wellington. They are concerned about the economy and 
with the way the federal government spends their money. By 
meeting our deficit targets we have listened to the constituents of 
Guelph-Wellington who have told me not to mortgage the future.
<P>
	We have placed a new emphasis on youth, science and 
technology and trade. For a community that is home to the finest 
university in Canada, this is good news indeed. For businesses that 
produce the finest goods in Canada and are looking for new 
markets, this is good news. For people concerned about their 
personal safety, for our children who want a good future and for our 
seniors concerned about the future of their health care, this a 
blueprint for their future.
<P>
	The speech from the throne, like the red book before it, promises 
to put the interests of my constituents first. It promises not to 
destroy the very foundations of our country.
<P>
	Let me remind every member of the House, our parents and 
grandparents have built the greatest nation on earth. They have 
done so through our health care system, our social safety net and 
our work ethic which is second none in the world.
<P>
	The people in the House who wish to destroy what they built 
must remember that we are the envy of the world. Canada has been 
selected as the best nation on earth because we care for one another 
and we have social programs which protect those most in need and 
care for those most vulnerable in society.
<P>
	This session, like the last, will show the people of 
Guelph-Wellington the real difference between the Liberals and 
the opposition parties. They already know the fundamental 
difference is between a party that built this nation and parties that 
want to destroy it. They also know that our goal is growth, 
employment and opportunity while theirs is despair, destruction 
and doom.
<P>
	Let us look at the Reform Party. No matter how hard they try to 
smile, Reformers cannot hide their real agenda. Reformers like to 
say they want to trim the fat. We know they really mean they are 
going to fire the butcher and close the shop to boot.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	They have replaced hope, growth and opportunity with me, 
myself and I. With Reformers national standards will be replaced 
with regional disparity. The principles of medicare will be replaced 
with the principles of money. Who has the most money can get 
health care.
<P>
	Reformers look at us as consumers. We look at all Canadians as 
our neighbours, our friends, people we care  about, people we need. 
We want to offer a hand but they want to give those in need the 
boot. Reformers see wrong in our federation. They search for bad 
in our institutions. I take this opportunity to remind them of Pogo's 
famous saying the next time they look for what is not working: 
``We have met the enemy and he is us''.
<P>
	Every new Parliament sets challenges for itself. We begin in the 
next few weeks to build on the values that have been established by 
our parents and grandparents. Our challenge in the second half of 
our mandate is to continue to protect our seniors, provide a future 
for our youth, which this throne speech does, and give real 
meaningful employment to those looking for work. We must 
remind every Canadian in the process their participation in the 
future of the country is vital in order for us to grow and prosper in 
the next century.
<P>
	My constituents have asked me to work on their behalf to 
strengthen our nation, to provide them with a future that includes 
every Canadian from sea to sea. They want to work with all parts of 
the country, every region, all people, all provinces to build a better 
country. They know it is harder to create than it is to destroy. They 
know it is easy to take an axe to cut down but it takes patience, 
persistence, time and energy to build up.
<P>
	Our opposition parties want to either break up our nation or 
destroy the programs that have made it great. There are similarities 
between the two parties. One, the Bloc, wants to take a great 
province from the country and the other, Reform, wants to take the 
heart out of our nation. That is the difference between Liberals and 
the other parties.
<P>
	The people of Guelph-Wellington have faith in themselves and 
in their Canadian family. They reject those that want to destroy, but 
they welcome opportunity for their future, hardship for the sake of 
value and change for their betterment.
<P>
	We have many challenges facing us in the next few months. We 
must continue to improve our social safety net in order to protect 
those most in need. We must ensure our public pension system 
provides protection into the next century. We must always work to 
keep Canada united and strong.
<P>
	I began speaking about some of the many accomplishments we 
have shared in Guelph-Wellington during the past two years. The 
people of Guelph-Wellington will support our efforts to reduce 
the deficit. They will welcome programs that create jobs and 
expand growth and they demand excellence. They do not want me 
and the government to forget the human element in every single 
thing we do and every single action we take.
<P>
	This July marks the 100th anniversary of the election of Wilfrid 
Laurier as Prime Minister. I end with his words and may they guide 
us in this second session, all of us: ``I am a Canadian. Canada has 
been the inspiration  of my life. I have had before me as a pillar of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="157"> 157 </A></B>
<P>
fire by night and a pillar of cloud by day a policy of true 
Canadianism, of moderation, of conciliation''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the hon. member's 
comments, particularly her closing comments by Sir Wilfrid 
Laurier. If I may take a moment I would like to offer some 
comments by Mackenzie King, who I understand was a Liberal, 
that may be appropriate for this time in our political history. I may 
not get this right, but you will understand the context of it. He said: 
``When control of our currency and our credit is taken away and 
usury takes over, then all efforts and hopes of democracy are both 
useless and futile''.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	We have a situation in this country where we have lost control of 
our financial house. We have a debt of over $500 billion. We have 
interest payments of $50 billion which are continuing to rise.
<P>
	The point I want to make is that despite all the nice words 
contained in the throne speech about hope and optimism, despite 
all the words spoken by hon. members from the government, the 
fact is that every single discussion, every single decision made in 
the House is influenced by the severely impaired financial state of 
the country.
<P>
	Reformers have been saying that we must begin to restore hope 
and optimism for people of all ages from students who are trying to 
get an education and find it a tremendous financial burden, people 
who are out of work and are living on welfare or no money at all, 
people who are trying to build careers and raise families. Every 
decision the government makes is impeded by our financial state. 
No matter what words we use to offer hope, the fact is that we have 
to get our financial house in order. It is so important. We cannot 
even talk about making democratic decisions because we are so 
influenced by the financial crisis.
<P>
	What positive steps do we see? How are we going to reach a 
balanced budget? When are we going to reach a balanced budget? 
How do we explain to the Canadian people that the $50 billion we 
are paying in interest is something we have to live with? This $50 
billion is taking away from our social programs, our health care, 
our education payments. It has a hold on us to such an extent that 
we almost cannot function as a government until we get this 
financial mess straightened out.
<P>
	What kind of answer does the government have? There is none in 
the throne speech. There are a lot of fluffy words but there are no 
concrete answers.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Mr. Speaker, with due respect to my hon. 
colleague who I am on committees with and I am friends with, it is 
hard to begin. The balanced budget that is driving the Reform Party 
would kill this country if  it was done with the speed and haste the 
Reform Party suggests.
<P>
	Reformers talk about trampling, taking away programs such as 
medicare and punishing the poor. The list goes on. The reality is 
that the government is proving on a daily basis that it is reducing 
the deficit. The reality is that the deficit by 1997 will be cut in half. 
The reality is that the government will have chopped $29 billion in 
a humane and proper way, in a way that will continue to give us 
medicare, help for the poor, reduce regional disparities.
<P>
	With all due respect I feel badly that the Reform Party continues 
to only look at a balanced budget and not think about the human 
element, to not care about the people.
<P>
	I would not suggest that the member from the Reform Party as an 
individual does not care about people. Unfortunately, I feel 
strongly that for some reason the agenda of the Reform Party of a 
balanced budget at all and any cost would seriously cut the heart 
out of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, while I appreciate the 
optimism in the words of the member for Guelph-Wellington, 
they do not represent reality.
<P>
	In Quebec, for example, reality means 11 per cent 
unemployment and far more people on welfare because 
unemployment insurance is harder to get, so there are more people 
in Quebec not working than in the past. That is reality.
<P>
	While she is speaking about putting public finances on a 
healthier footing, I am thinking about the $32.7 billion deficit we 
will have again this year. Her words are fine, optimistic, 
encouraging, for those who do not know the real situation. The 
reality is exactly the opposite. The government has not succeeded 
in creating jobs. The government has not succeeded in cutting 
expenditures sufficiently to produce a normal deficit. I feel the hon. 
member ought to be more realistic in what she has to say, so as not 
to deceive the public who hear her words.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Mr. Speaker, Quebec is quite different but 
Quebec is part of Canada and we are all Canadians, first and 
foremost.
<P>
	The former leader of the Bloc has left the party and become 
premier. He has pledged as his first duty to make sure he looks after 
the finances of Quebec. We hope that the trust the member and his 
party put in their leader that that will be done.
<P>
	The hon. member talks about what we have done. 
Unemployment has gone down by over 2 per cent since we took 
office in 1993. We have created over 500,000 jobs. Consider each 
trade 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="158"> 158 </A></B>
<P>
mission including the last one  with $8.1 billion. Each billion 
dollars in trade is equal to 11,000 jobs.
<P>
	Youth was referred to in the throne speech. It was mentioned that 
the government would double the student jobs. That means for 
Quebec too. We have done a lot and I am proud of it. I thank the 
member for drawing attention to it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, going 
back to the closing words of my colleague from 
Guelph-Wellington when she was calling for moderation and 
conciliation, I would like to point out to her that it is rare for 
moderation and conciliation to go along with the self-affirmation 
that one's country is the greatest in the world.
<P>
	Every time politicians and political leaders have said that theirs 
was the greatest nation in the world, this has been bad news for 
their citizens, their minorities and their neighbours.
<P>
	This government was elected on the slogan of ``jobs, jobs, jobs''. 
It was to solve Canada's problems. After managing to hide the real 
situation, it found itself faced on October 30 with a Quebec that 
almost voted for sovereignty. This amazed people all across 
Canada; 54,000 votes prevented the Quebec referendum from 
succeeding.
<P>
	One would have expected this government to be interested in this 
important issue. That it would have felt fear, that it would have felt 
responsible, and that it would have therefore made every effort to 
ensure the situation would not be repeated. As a result, one would 
have expected sincere and moderate federalists, of whom there are 
many in Canada, to have demanded that their government seek to 
convince the people of Quebec to remain within Canada by paying 
attention to their problems and their needs.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	So what did this government do? What did it do next? Back in 
the House, it tabled two feeble measures, worse than minimal, 
which included a definition of a distinct society which did not even 
approximate the one in the Meech Lake accord and was not 
enshrined or even ``enshrineable'' in the Constitution, and a 
multiple veto which, instead of meeting the expectations of 
Quebecers, would make these even more difficult to achieve.
<P>
	Did this government act responsibly? No. So what happened 
next? Well, I must say I was very upset when I read about it in the 
newspapers. The caucus had a meeting in Vancouver. We read that 
these members, with whom we have worked side by side, talked 
about only one thing, and that was how to prevent us from 
achieving sovereignty. It was not about considering our needs, or 
about recognizing that we are a people. It was all about preventing 
and scaring us. They found some new saviours  from Quebec, other 
Trudeaus in the making, who raised the issue of partition of the 
territory.
<P>
	I repeat, did they try to find a way to convince us, to understand 
Quebecers? They did not. Sadly, I saw this as a denial, a rejection.
<P>
	The third step was the speech from the throne, and we are now 
back in the House. So what about the throne speech? Briefly, it says 
that as far as the economy is concerned, the government is no 
longer involved. It says: ``I have done my share. It is now up to the 
private sector to create jobs''. I do not know where the government 
found this particular economic principle, but it is all very easy for 
the government to say what it just said. Just because the 
government offloads its deficit on the provinces, which in turn have 
to make cuts that affect the average person, just because the 
government is lying low and dipping into unemployment insurance 
contributions, all that does not mean it is putting the economy on a 
sound footing and it can tell business: ``Mission accomplished. 
Now it is up to you to create jobs''.
<P>
	This is so shortsighted it makes me weep, and the same goes for 
the Team Canada concept and the idea of partnership. In fact, 
partnership is a wonderful word, and the way we used it during the 
referendum campaign, and will continue to do so, it means 
something. In Quebec, for years governments, business and unions 
representing the grass roots-not just business and 
government-have been working together to develop the regions. 
Together, they realized they do not have enough power, in one area 
in particular, where there is a consensus on the problems that must 
be solved, and unfortunately, that does not seem to be in the cards, 
and I am referring to manpower training.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	First, the government is washing its hands of the matter. Second, 
what did it say it would do at the administrative level to eliminate 
overlap? The plan it announced is in fact a centralizing measure. It 
says that there is only one social, economic and cultural plan in 
Canada, that is to say a national plan, and that it will delegate, 
decentralize and privatize as it sees fit, shifting certain things to the 
private sector, to municipalities, to certain groups or, occasionally, 
to the provinces.
<P>
	Does the government take into account what got Canadians all 
upset on October 30? One third of the speech from the throne deals 
with national unity. But what does it say? What does the 
government have to propose to Quebec? Only outrageous things.
<P>
	What message is the government conveying in the few and 
insignificant economic measures it managed to come up with, like 
doubling youth job opportunities? It says it will enhance summer 
student job programs. Does this address the major problems facing 
Quebec?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="159"> 159 </A></B>
<P>
	What message is it conveying with regard to the Canada social 
transfer, which will play even more havoc with the Quebec social 
system? It talks about standards, standards to be established in 
co-operation with the majority of the provinces. What is in it for 
Quebec?
<P>
	Referring to the labour market, it describes it as a national 
phenomenon and talks about the need to promote mobility, when 
we all know that, in terms of employment, the problem for Quebec 
within Canada has always been the fact that, for obvious reasons, 
Quebec workers are not as mobile as others and that the labour 
market is different in Quebec.
<P>
	On the subject of training, there is a nice line about the 
government being prepared to withdraw from that area and to 
decide what would be best and who should take over. Does this 
mean that the government is getting ready to negotiate with the 
Quebec government? Perhaps.
<P>
	It says it is prepared to make a great, unprecedented offer 
regarding exclusive provincial jurisdictions by not creating any 
new programs in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction without 
the consent of a majority of the provinces, with compensation for 
those provinces that are not part of the consensus. It talks about 
infrastructures already transferred to municipal authorities and 
community-based groups. The federal government decides what is 
good; it decides what suits the Canadian vision of society.
<P>
	There is no room, actually less room than ever, for the people of 
Quebec in this Canadian vision.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	No wonder they did not try to convince people in Vancouver. 
But, if they are not trying to convince them, what are they trying to 
do? They are trying to stop them, to frighten them by carrying a big 
stick. Are they hoping that Quebecers will back down, that they 
will suddenly have fewer needs?
<P>
	It is while listening to the Prime Minister's speech yesterday that 
I finally understood. I may be off the mark, but when I heard this 
sentence, I said to myself: ``That is the source of the huge problem 
that Canada will face if the government does not get back on a path 
that will allow it to prepare for a future of peace and perhaps 
prosperity''. I heard the following sentence coming from the Prime 
Minister's mouth: ``A united Canada is a far nobler enterprise than 
the narrowing of vision proclaimed by those who would break up 
this country''. Now everything becomes clear.
<P>
	There is a great vision, that of Canada, and there is a narrow 
vision, the one shared by half the people of Quebec. So Quebecers 
are wrong; they understood nothing. Canada is a nobler enterprise 
than Quebec? Why? Because it is a bigger country? Then we would 
be better off as Americans. Because there is not enough ethnic 
diversity? What about France, Italy, Germany or  Israel? In fact, 
why is Canada still distinct from the U.S.? That is a good question. 
Because of the Queen? Because of social programs?
<P>
	I respect Canada, which is a great country. When I was in 
Quebec during my recent campaign for the leadership of my party, 
I stressed the need to repeat that Canada is a great country, that we 
respect Canadians, but that we as Quebecers cannot grow in this 
Canada. All members of the House, whatever their party, have a 
responsibility to preserve the future and that future must be based 
on respect. We might have won on October 30. Our vision and our 
country would then have been as great and noble as Canada.
<P>
	Quebecers are a people; they will form a sovereign nation in 
which all citizens have equal rights. Until then, and there is no 
doubt in my mind that this day will come, I do hope that the 
government and our colleagues in opposition will understand that, 
while they can expect respect from us, they should remember that 
they must also respect us, our project, and the people of Quebec, 
for whom we speak.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	Both federalists as well as sovereignists belong to the people of 
Quebec. They recognize themselves and will not tolerate contempt, 
whether directed at themselves or at their wish to control their 
destiny. After going through a long series of failed attempts and 
unfulfilled expectations, Quebecers see a deteriorating economy. 
Young people are losing hope. Quebecers say that the situation 
cannot go on any longer.
<P>
	As far as I am concerned, yesterday the Prime Minister once 
again gave a bad example. I am not pleased to say that, on the 
contrary. I am not pleased because the Prime Minister, who is a 
successor of Lester B. Pearson, should be building a future based 
on peace and harmony, regardless of the democratic choices of 
Quebecers, and he should strive to reach that goal. I know that 
moderate federalists hope to convince Quebecers to stay in Canada, 
but they also strive to ensure that economic, social and cultural 
development is not impeded the way it is right now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am a true federalist but I fully agree with the principle 
that Quebecers are a people, as the hon. member said.
<P>
	The member for Matapédia-Matane said that because there is a 
people of Quebec, Canada must be divided. He said that if there is a 
people, there must be a country. This is simple and logical.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Normally, yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Normally, you are right. Let us take the example of 
Newfoundland. In the forties, Newfoundland was a country and the 
people of that country decided to join Canada. 
Newfoundlanders-and I see the hon.  member from 
Newfoundland-are still a people. Therefore, if Newfoundlanders 
are a people within Canada, why 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="160"> 160 </A></B>
<P>
would the same not be possible for Quebecers? This is my question 
to the hon. member for Mercier.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Lalonde: </B>Mr. Speaker, let me first say that I have good 
friends from Newfoundland. I often ask them the question: If, in 
1949, the population of Newfoundland had been seven million, 
what would you have done? I will let you guess the answer. This is 
the first element of my answer.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	The people of Quebec did not always define themselves as such 
in Quebec. As you know, our history is a long one. It goes back 
farther than the history of those we now call English Canadians. 
That history includes events such as the Conquest and the quelled 
rebellions of 1837-38, which created conditions such that, for a 
long time, leaders sought to make arrangements within 
Confederation and they did so in all honesty. They felt that the way 
to protect the French-Canadian nation was to do so within 
Confederation.
<P>
	But as time went by, as Quebecers developed their culture and as 
they suffered setbacks-I have already mentioned this in this 
House-there came a point when a premier of Irish descent, Daniel 
Johnson Sr., first used the slogan of ``equality or independence'' 
and explained that, if the French Canadians who live mostly in 
Quebec were not treated fairly, it would be normal for them to go 
for political independence. Daniel Johnson Sr. wrote <I>Égalité ou 
indépendance</I> in 1965.
<P>
	Since 1965, our history is an endless string of failures, of 
searching. That, dear colleague, is the answer to your question. I 
am not saying this because I used to teach history, but because it is 
a fact. Quebecers have repeatedly tried to gain recognition and to 
get the tools they need to develop. And it is precisely because they 
have been unable to reach these goals that the last referendum was 
held. I do not want to go over Meech or Chalotettown again. It is 
true. We went through all that, we were deeply hurt, but there are 
limits to the patience of people who feel helpless and unable to 
control the means to ensure their development. Successive federal 
governments chose to treat Quebec only as a province. The people 
in our province cannot tolerate this situation any longer and want 
their own country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Laval West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
bring to your attention that I am sharing my time with the member 
for Halton-Peel.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There are two issues I would like to focus on in this debate on the 
throne speech.
<P>
	The first one deals with the openness shown towards Quebec, 
and the second one with the way cultural issues are addressed. The 
two are similar in that they are equally important for the future of 
our country.
<P>
	When one listens to Quebecers, it does not take long to 
understand their concerns, their confusion and even their anger, if I 
may say so, when faced with the problems the Quebec society has 
to deal with.
<P>
	Quebecers are concerned about job insecurity and job loss. They 
are worried about the way the major social services are 
deteriorating, whether it is the unemployment insurance program, 
the health system, education or the social safety net.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	They are concerned about the future of the regions and the price 
they will have to pay for the excessive debt incurred by the 
governments. They complain about the very few tangible effects 
brought about by the business restructuring and the new high tech 
industries whose merits they hear so much about. They express 
their frustration through their strong will to change things.
<P>
	Quebecers are all the more anxious to change things since they 
have the talent, the entrepreneurship and the adaptability to catch 
up with the front runners. They are asking for change so that they 
can resume their place and take advantage of the social and 
economic benefits stemming from dynamic growth. Quebecers 
have had it with double talk, gimmicks, scapegoats and so-called 
winning questions. They do not like politicians who avoid talking 
to them about what they cherish most, that is their quality of life 
and their opportunities.
<P>
	Faced with these challenges, the Parti Quebecois government, so 
far, has only come up with a policy resembling the squaring of the 
circle. On one hand, the supposedly inescapable road to separation 
from Canada and, on the other hand, the recovery of the Quebec's 
economy and finances in partnership with that same Canada.
<P>
	The inherent contradiction in that policy creates a climate of 
uncertainty that paralyses economic growth in Quebec. Moreover, 
that policy, which is based on an irreversible break with Canada, 
causes division among Quebecers. In turn, this division fosters 
uncertainty. One day, Lucien Bouchard sings the praise of 
separation and promises yet another referendum, and the next day, 
he is calls for economic recovery and fiscal consolidation in 
Quebec which, in turn, require stability and confidence.
<P>
	We know that it is this squaring of the circle that caused Jacques 
Parizeau's political demise. We must get out of this dialectic before 
Quebec itself is destroyed by it.
<P>
	The speech from the throne offers an alternative to Quebecers, a 
partnership that affects not only economic and social issues, but 
also the method of government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="161"> 161 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us not be mistaken, this speech speaks to Quebecers in a 
language fraught with consequences; that may be the reason why 
the opposition rejected it offhandedly, fearing that the message 
would get across.
<P>
	Basically, the speech proposes to modernize the Canadian 
federation, together with the provinces, to meet the needs of the 
21st century. It invites the government of Quebec to participate in 
this process so that Quebec's interests are better served. The 
message is clear: this adjustment will not be done by increasing the 
powers of the federal government to the detriment of the provinces. 
The federal government will limit the use of its spending power, 
obtain the consent of the provinces and create joint management 
systems if necessary.
<P>
	It will withdraw from areas under provincial jurisdiction such as 
tourism, mining, forestry and recreation and will continue to 
withdraw from transportation and manpower training. The speech 
from the throne does, however, propose increased partnerships with 
the provinces and a common effort to ensure our security by 
strengthening our economic and social union and preserving the 
quality of our environment.
<P>
	These new partnerships are possible without these endless 
constitutional debates that have taken up so much of our energy. 
This is possible without the trauma of Quebec's separating. 
Nothing would be better for eradicating the uncertainty than this 
new beginning in an atmosphere of confidence and co-operation. 
This is the opening now available to the people of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	If we wish to work together to create a Canadian society for the 
21st century that can serve as a model for the rest of the world, 
clearly that society cannot be anything but pluralistic, with each 
part recognizing and respecting the distinct identity of the others. 
In this we are no different than any other large country in which 
different languages, ethnic groups and religions live alongside each 
other.
<P>
	But we are far advanced over most of these because of the 
common values of open mindedness, understanding and generosity 
which have characterized our history and still prevail. Such values 
are diametrically opposed to the parochialism and intolerance 
which lead to division, fragmentation and weakness. For these 
reasons we can rejoice in the fact that the Throne Speech confirms 
the government of Canada's desire to recognize the distinct 
character of Quebec society and to have it acknowledged.
<P>
	I would like to conclude with a few comments on the 
commitments to the cultural sector expressed in the speech. It can 
never be repeated too often that cultural creation is essential to our 
identity. We abound in creative talent and enjoy a widely diverse 
cultural industry, but there is still need for further development in 
this area.
<P>
	Our biggest challenge in the years to come will be to ensure a 
strong Canadian presence on the information highway. We are 
already facing competition from foreign products, mainly 
American. In the future, regulations protecting the Canadian 
audio-visual market will gradually lose their effectiveness, and our 
political will will be undermined by American threats of punitive 
measures. We will have to create our own high-quality products to 
maintain control over our own space and even better, to export 
these throughout the world. This strategy has a better chance of 
success than a protectionist strategy. It will, however, require 
increased financing for Canadian content.
<P>
	In addition to fiscal measures encouraging the investment of 
private capital in our cultural industries, few options open to the 
Government of Canada will be as effective in their impact on the 
cultural sector as creating a consolidated fund of audio-visual 
productions. Thanks to this initiative, the consumer will be able to 
choose from foreign products, which are always available, and 
domestic products which, without this new financial support, 
would never see the light of day. Cable companies and 
satellite-television distributors already contribute considerable 
amounts of money as a condition of operating their services. This 
type of contribution could be used to provide better financing for 
the production of Canadian content.
<P>
	In the past, we have always opted for strategies that would 
support our artists, our creators and our cultural industries and 
provide a buffer against the tide of American culture. We are aware 
that this sector, which is critical to establishing our distinct identity 
in the world, would not come into its own if market forces alone 
were allowed to prevail. That is why we have put in place policies 
and institutions that serve to maintain a balance between our own 
identity and foreign perspectives.
<P>
	The throne speech is in line with a tradition that has confidence 
in the talent of our own citizens.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
the speech from the throne, I noted very little, a few lines only, on 
semi-urban and rural communities.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	Earlier, my colleague said that mining and forestry would be 
handed over to the provinces. But we know that mining and 
forestry are already under provincial jurisdiction. In this case, I do 
not know how this could be organized another way. It is a bit like 
the eastern plan, which worked very well for communities in 
eastern Quebec. It was put into effect, and timber owners were very 
happy.
<P>
	The Conservatives, before them, had set a deadline of a year, 
which was extended a year, but is now about to run out, in March. 
Will there be compensation? When something wonderful happens 
somewhere, particularly in  a rural setting, it would seem great 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="162"> 162 </A></B>
<P>
pleasure is taken in cutting it. I saw nothing in the budget to 
compensate for what was cut.
<P>
	There are other problems in our regions. Matane has a local 
airport, and Mont-Joli a regional one. Major renovations are 
required at the moment, and the plan is to give them to the 
municipalities or an independent agency to do. There is a lot of talk 
about Mirabel and Dorval, but little thought is given to regional or 
local airports. Their maintenance alone will cost the people in the 
regions a fortune. There is nothing on that.
<P>
	There is something else I would like to mention, in the area of 
agriculture. We, as in other regions, are having huge problems 
getting a meat packing plant. We apply, and this sort of thing 
always involves some pickiness. They do not want to help farm 
producers process the butcher's beef they produce.
<P>
	I wonder what the budget contains for the regions, the rural 
communities and the farmers?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dupuy:</B> Mr. Speaker, to start with, I would like to clarify 
something. Our colleague mentioned the budget; the budget will be 
presented next week. Today, we are dealing with the speech from 
the throne and he should not expect me to comment on the content 
of a budget which the finance minister said will be delivered in a 
few days.
<P>
	Also, I would like to mention that when I referred to areas such 
as tourism, mining, and forestry, I took care to specify that they 
were areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. There is no doubt 
about that, it is a well known fact. Therefore, from what is the 
Canadian government withdrawing? What is the meaning of this 
new step it is taking?
<P>
	It is responding to the request of provinces which have been 
asking for years that it withdraw from certain areas by not using its 
spending power in those areas. Provincial governments found it 
offending that the federal government exercises its spending power 
in areas under their jurisdiction. The federal government is 
complying with their request. But you have to be logical, you 
cannot, on the one hand, ask the federal government to withdraw its 
spending power from these areas which are acknowledged as areas 
of exclusive provincial jurisdiction and, on the other hand, ask that 
it spend money in those very same areas. This is one of many 
contradictions.
<P>
	Transport is certainly a major area and I have no hesitation in 
recognizing that we need to provide assistance to small airports, 
which I have myself used on many occasions.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	The federal government owned them. It was responsible for all 
the work. Pressure was put on it to privatize, because 
municipalities and private groups asked the federal government to 
let these properties go, put them up for sale and put them back in 
the hands of the local communities, which claimed to be better able 
to manage them.
<P>
	This is what the government is doing. However, it is extremely 
difficult here as well to tell the government to withdraw from the 
management of these investments, these assets, but to continue to 
help pay for them and the management of them. So, we have to 
accept the consequences of what we ask for when we get it. I think 
the policy of the Government of Canada is a good one. It responds 
to requests at the local level and by private industry, and we have to 
live with the consequences. I hope, however, that these new owners 
will invest enough to make these vital communications centres cost 
effective and useful.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague for sharing his time this afternoon.
<P>
	The throne speech has charted a course for the next two years, 
the remainder of the term in this House. It has dwelt in a number of 
areas. First, it has had something to say about the accomplishments 
of the government to date and significant accomplishments they 
have been. It has also had something to say about one of the most 
perplexing and what should be the most important issues of 
concern that we have to deal with at the present time, the issue of 
Canada and Canadian unity.
<P>
	I have listened for the last two years to the Bloc and the speeches 
that have been made in this House. I heard the remainder of a very 
impassioned speech this afternoon by the hon. member for Mercier. 
If I am wrong, I stand to be corrected but what I seem to detect so 
often from some members of the Bloc is an underlying belief that 
Quebec cannot exist within the framework of Canada because 
Quebecers somehow do not have the self-confidence nor the 
strength to preserve their society within that framework.
<P>
	From the very beginning, built into the framework we call 
Canada are the elements to protect that society, to protect the 
language, the culture and of course the Napoleonic civil law. Those 
things together are part of what naturally make Quebec a distinct 
society. That is why the government has endorsed such a move to 
recognize what actually exists, what already is.
<P>
	I am always perplexed when I feel, perhaps wrongly, that at least 
some members of the Bloc do not feel confident within that 
framework. I ask them and I ask Quebecers to consider what life 
would be like without those protections that are built into the 
framework we now call Canada.
<P>
	It seems from an emotional perspective that one could isolate 
oneself even more and build a wall around a very small country. 
However the world is not made like that any more. We 
communicate instantly to every part of the globe. We trade 
virtually
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="163"> 163 </A></B>
<P>
instantly to every part of the globe. Money changes hands from 
hour to hour. The sun never sets on the economies of our countries.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	I seriously ask those members who wish for separation if they 
really believe in the long run that they will enjoy the protection of 
their language, culture and law that they enjoy in the framework we 
call Canada.
<P>
	Canada is made up of distinct societies. I visited one a couple of 
weeks ago and had a wonderful time. It has a distinct language and 
culture and unless the people speak very slowly I cannot 
understand them. However they are a very confident and proud 
people. They exist within the framework of Canada. They are our 
friends in Newfoundland. If we take the trouble to travel to other 
parts of Canada we will find other very distinct societies all living 
within that same framework.
<P>
	Last summer I had the privilege of travelling into central 
Quebec. My wife and I went there partly on a bit of a holiday and 
partly on a pilgrimage. We drove along the north shore to the 
Saguenay and up the Saguenay and stopped at Baie Trinité to 
scatter my brother's ashes. He spent the happiest years of his life 
sailing on the cruise ships on the Saguenay. We went on up to 
Lac-Saint-Jean and Chicoutimi. We stayed in Chicoutimi and then 
went on to Roberval and down the long highway to Shawinigan and 
back home again.
<P>
	I realized one thing. The geographical isolation of that area 
separates it very much from other parts of the country. It is 
unfortunate that many of the young people there do not have the 
opportunity to move, to visit, to exchange with young people in 
other parts of the country. If they did there would be a new and 
revitalized realization that we are all in this country together. We 
built it together. Quebecers have as much ownership of British 
Columbia and Alberta as other Canadians have in Quebec.
<P>
	We have travelled a long distance together, not without our 
difficulties and not without our arguments in the family and so on. 
But now we have an opportunity to look to the future together and 
to move on. The destruction of one part of us produces something 
less in the rest.
<P>
	With Quebec, with Newfoundland, with the Arctic and all other 
parts of Canada, we make the greatest distinct society in the world. 
With all of our differences, but also with all of our common goals, 
we all want the same things. We want fulfilment in our lives. We 
want a roof over our heads. We want to be able to have three square 
meals a day and to be able to raise our children in safety and in 
confidence. We want to attend the church of our choice or indulge 
in the religion of our choice without interference, without anyone 
coming along and saying we cannot do that.
<P>
	Those are common aspirations of all people in the world. 
Sometimes they get clouded with history or with the visions of
<P>
history or the perceptions of history, sometimes true, sometimes 
untrue, sometimes twisted.
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	My first ancestor in this country came from Ireland. He was a 
Protestant living in the south of Ireland. Talk about being on the 
wrong side of the railway tracks. The troubles that existed in 1834 
continue to assail that land today, in 1996. He made a conscious 
decision to leave that strife behind him.
<P>
	He was being terrorized. His cattle were killed. His life was 
threatened and so on. He left with his wife and five children and 
came to the wilds of Canada. He lost his wife to cholera on Grosse 
Isle, a place I hope to visit in a very few weeks.
<P>
	I have his diary. He made a conscious decision to put the past 
behind him and to put the old emnities, which have held that 
country back for hundreds of years, away and come to Canada, a 
new land where he could find fulfilment and partnership with the 
people he met.
<P>
	I make a plea to my friends in the Bloc. The time has come to 
make a conscious decision to put the past behind, to join hands and 
to move together because together we are much stronger than 
pieces separated and scattered. We can do far more as a family, as a 
team, than we can as strangers.
<P>
	Quebec is very special to me in many ways. I spent some years in 
Montreal as a child. Montreal was a thriving city at that time. I was 
disappointed to see it again and how it has declined.
<P>
	We can talk about the politics of blame. We can blame the 
federal government. We can blame somebody else and all the rest 
of it. The time has come to make that conscious choice to move 
ahead. If we do, we can only be the richer for it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would first like to point out to my colleague, who 
talks about people with clouded minds, that we should look at 
Quebec from another angle. I heard my colleague talk about the 
small country that Quebec would be.
<P>
	We can compare pare Quebec to other countries in the world, 
Israel, in particular. Israel is a country with a population of about 
3.5 million Jews, without any natural resources, and surrounded by 
220 million Arabs. It is 74 times smaller than Quebec. Quebec is 
not small. People should stop saying that.
<P>
	I take another example, Singapore. Everyone is trading with 
Singapore, everyone wants to do business with Singapore. 
Singapore has a population of about 4 million people, and a total 
area of 651 square kilometres. It is 2,500 times smaller than 
Quebec. Let us stop talking about Quebec being small and start 
talking about 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="164"> 164 </A></B>
<P>
real things. Quebec is one of the largest countries in the world in 
terms of its territory.
<P>
	Second, some people talk about isolation. They would like to 
build a fence around Quebec. Every time we talk about making 
Quebec a sovereign country, they say we want to cut ourselves off. 
I would like to quote from an article published quite recently in the 
economic section of <I>La Presse</I>, on February 5, 1996. What I am 
going to quote was written by an American university professor, 
Kenneth Holland. This article appeared in <I>Quebec Studies</I> and was 
done at the University of Memphis, in Tennessee. He is not a 
member of the Parti Quebecois or the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	What does he say about Quebec? He says: ``The unwavering 
support given by Quebec to free trade with the United States at the 
end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s was the catalyst 
that made possible the remarkable chain of events that changed 
forever the global trade system''.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	It is all very well to talk about people wanting to isolate 
themselves. And by the way, the comparison he makes with 
Ontario certainly does not reflect well on that province. Quebec has 
always been open to all markets, and there would be no North 
American Trade Agreement today if Quebec had not been on side.
<P>
	I do not see a society that wants to cut itself off but a society that 
is as open as can be. The hon. member asked why we did not think 
it was worth being part of the Canadian federation? The reason is 
that we are a political minority. Even if all Quebecers voted to send 
members to this House, we would never be able to form a 
government. Every time the interests of Quebec clash with 
Canada's, as often happens, we will always be on the losing side. 
That is what Quebecers realized in the last election. That is why 
they sent the Bloc Quebecois here, to get real power, as much as 
they could get in this Parliament, because we cannot form the 
government in this Parliament. We are a minority. Which means 
what? It means that when Canadians decide, for a number of very 
good reasons that are in line with the interests of Canada, to make 
decisions for all Canadians that go against the interests of Quebec, 
they can never prevent that.
<P>
	Earlier, someone mentioned political uncertainty as one of the 
factors responsible for the current economic decline affecting us. 
First of all, this political uncertainty was created in 1982 by the 
patriation of the Constitution. This is not an attempt to dredge up 
past events, it is the truth: the contract that united this country was 
torn up, and Quebec was excluded from the Canadian 
Confederation. That is where the political uncertainty started.
<P>
	I think we should look at all that in the light of these new factors. 
Quebec is not a small territory. It is an immense territory. It is not a
<P>
closed society. It is a society that is opening up, a society that will 
go the full democratic route to do what all other peoples in the 
world have done: become a country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not know I had any time left.
<P>
	I appreciate the words of my hon. friend but I point out to him 
that Israel is probably not the best choice in the world, if we 
consider that Israel is now surrounded by the enemy. There are 
those outside of Israel who are determined that no peace shall ever 
exist there.
<P>
	This is precisely what I was trying to say when I talked about my 
grandfather five times removed leaving Ireland, to get away from 
the strife and come to a land of peace.
<P>
	I understand that the separatists in Quebec consider themselves a 
political minority and they believe that decisions taken in the 
interests of Canada go against them. However, I believe if together 
we are looking for the greater good of the whole, we will all realize 
that the decisions of the House in which Quebec has an very 
important role to play, are not only good for Canada but are good 
for Quebec as well.
<P>
	That is where I think we part company. I am rapidly becoming a 
minority in Canada. If we go to Toronto-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I deeply regret interrupting 
any of you but I must resume debate with the hon. member for 
Okanagan Centre.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the speech from the throne is a plan, a sense of the direction the 
government is taking. Hon. members opposite have said very 
clearly that is what the speech from the throne is to designate.
<P>
	I read the speech from the throne. I listened when the Governor 
General read it. I came away with a single sentence that I think 
describes accurately the leadership that we are seeing evidenced 
here in this House and it goes something like this. It is vague 
enough to be confusing but specific enough to dash any hopes of a 
better day at the end of this session.
<P>
	I wish to address my remarks to exactly those kinds of things 
now. What is it that we need to do to govern ourselves 
successfully? I want to approach it from four specific points of 
view: First, the specificity of the speech; second, the fiscal 
responsibility that is or is not demonstrated in it; the economic and 
industrial development that is being proposed and the unity that is 
addressed.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="165"> 165 </A></B>
<P>
	First, let me look at the specificity of jobs. The Prime Minister 
said that we should have jobs. In fact that was the hallmark of 
the election campaign. It was a threefold election platform; jobs, 
jobs, jobs.
<P>
	Two years later unemployment rates have not changed very 
much. Many of the jobs that do exist are part time and many of the 
other jobs that are not part time are temporary. People want stable 
full time jobs.
<P>
	What does the speech say to that particular issue? It begins by 
addressing the question for young people. It says the government 
will double the number of federal summer student jobs this 
summer. They are temporary jobs. They are really bubble jobs. In 
fact one of the young people I talked to said they are bubble gum 
jobs, here this summer and gone the next. The emphasis is on 
getting our young people into the job market. However, what 
happens to the parents of these young people who are unemployed?
<P>
	The challenge is for government and the private sector to work 
together. But there are no ideas of what the endeavour should be or 
the sectors that should be involved.
<P>
	The government challenges business and labour leaders to find 
new approaches to assist young people to find jobs. What a finger 
pointing exercise that is. Talk about shifting blame from 
government policy to business and industry. As long as the tax 
burden continues to increase, and it must, given the kind of deficit 
picture that we have, the tax burden alone will discourage the 
creation of jobs.
<P>
	There is the section stating that we want enduring jobs. There is 
a suggestion of how we might achieve these: investment and 
knowledge technology. Three specific areas are mentioned: 
aerospace, environment and enabling technologies like 
biotechnology.
<P>
	The second major area proposed is a predictable policy and a 
regulatory framework for the information highway. The last 
proposal is to expand the school net and community access 
programs to use technology to increase the knowledge base of 
workers.
<P>
	We need knowledgeable workers. We need them in this new 
economy. We need them to grow, we need them to develop, but 
there is no indication as to how this is to be accomplished except 
with one little statement ``to use the technology to increase the 
knowledge of workers''. Is the federal government going to 
institute training programs? Is some kind of special superfund 
going to be created in the form of subsidies and grants to industry 
in terms of developing biotechnology and these industries in 
aerospace, environment and so on? It is not clear.
<P>
	There is no suggestion of what sort of institutions or programs of 
study, or internship programs or other mechanisms by which 
workers might develop their skills. There is no indication of the 
kinds of measures, and I  would like to underline that, that will be 
employed to monitor the quality and success of any of these 
programs.
<P>
	Millions of dollars have been spent in the last number of years to 
develop programs, to retrain unemployed people. What has the 
success measure been? Where is the monitoring program that these 
programs are working, the people are actually getting to work and 
their skill level has increased? There are some notable exceptions, 
but generally speaking it has not worked.
<P>
	On the information highway there is no specific direction as to 
what we are talking about. Are we talking about 
telecommunications? Are we talking about broadcasting, radio, 
television, cable, satellite? What is it? Do we address the question 
in terms of convergence of these various media to get involved in 
how they will work together, or the adaptation and application of 
new technologies that are particularly conversant with digitization 
of information and can carry that very well, making obsolete the 
transmission systems that are dedicated to analog formats of 
information distribution?
<P>
	There is one little paragraph on financial institutions which 
states that the government will update legislation governing 
financial institutions to ensure that they continue, or that the 
legislation continues to be relevant to the emerging needs of 
business and consumers.
<P>
	Businesses need capital, especially small businesses. Those that 
are being established now, particularly in the new economy and in 
the knowledge based industries need fair access and timely access. 
They need it in large amounts; they need it in small amounts. The 
speech does not even seem to recognize that these are some of the 
needs of businesses.
<P>
	On the other hand, consumers need competitive prices for the 
services offered to them. They need privacy, they need 
confidentiality and they need confidentiality of personal 
communications. Current legislation allows significant intrusion 
into the personal information and confidentiality of an individual's 
financial affairs. Is the legislation that is being proposed going to 
change that? We do not know. It simply states that the government 
will do something.
<P>
	When there is so much ambiguity can we trust the government to 
do what we really need and what we want? Or is it really as Mr. 
Gibson pointed out in his article in the February 27 <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
where he says: ``Our system effectively provides for a four-year 
elected dictatorship with an astonishing concentration of power in 
the Prime Minister's office and cabinet. Not unnaturally those 
enjoying this power think it is a pretty good system''.
<P>
	Will this legislation governing not only the banks but financial 
institutions include the insurance companies, the credit unions, the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="166"> 166 </A></B>
<P>
trust companies? Will it allow them to expand into these areas? 
Will it have to do with the confidentiality, the cross selling and the 
tied selling which  is currently taking place? Will that be allowed to 
continue? Will conflicts of interest that currently exist be allowed 
to continue? Questions on all of these vague matters have been 
unanswered.
<P>
	If we are going to determine how we are going to govern 
ourselves, if there is going to be a direction here, then it has to be 
very clear there is a direction. However, there is not a direction and 
it is dangerous to get into that kind of situation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Since we are voting today on 
the subamendment this will close this portion of the debate.
<P>
	It being 6.15 p.m., it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings and 
put forthwith every question necessary to dispose of the 
subamendment now before the House.

	Call in the members.
