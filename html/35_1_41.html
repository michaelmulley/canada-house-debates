<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of introducing legislation that would ensure:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) that any person who was once entitled to receive a monetary benefit from 
the federal government and did not make an application to receive such benefit, 
is allowed to file an application to receive the benefit, notwithstanding any 
limitation period affecting the application;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) that, upon receipt of the application, the federal government shall grant 
such benefit to that person where it is satisfied that the person would have 
received the benefit had the person applied within the limitation period; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) that the monetary benefit bears interest as determined by regulation of the 
Governor in Council.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, what we are discussing today is the 
possibility of implementing a mechanism to address a 
fundamental matter of justice: How to treat Canadians fairly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to stress that what I am saying here is exploring the 
advisability of bringing forward legislation or some other 
mechanism to make certain that if Canadians lose a particular 
benefit it can be recouped.
<P>
	For those of us, and generally speaking I think that is 
everyone here, who want to be fair to Canadians and make sure 
that governments respond to real needs I believe this is a 
wonderful opportunity to do so.
<P>
	Let me be the first to say that no doubt all kinds of reasons 
could be brought forward to indicate that we should not be doing 
this. Let us look at those. If it is the right thing to do then let us 
explore together this notion. I do not want excuses from people 
saying that it is complex, potentially very costly or how would 
we do it. What I would like to hear is how can we do this if it is 
the right thing to do in terms of treating our fellow citizens.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	Remember as well that governments have very little 
limitation on their power to go back and recoup the money they 
feel is theirs. They can go back and get it with very few 
limitations. What I really want is to put the shoe on the other 
foot. Surely if it is right for governments to go out and get that 
which is theirs, and I believe it is, then it is right for citizens to 
get that which is theirs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This fundamental principle is very important to me. Indeed, if 
governments, and I believe it is the case, can, in almost any 
situation, go back and get what is theirs, why should this not be 
possible for Canadians across the country? I know that a number 
of reasons will be invoked against doing so. Some will say the 
issue is complex. Others will ask what we should do in such and 
such a situation? Others still will say that it could be a costly 
proposition. I understand all that, but what I would appreciate 
today is some help and suggestions as to how we could do it. If 
we agree with the basic principle that governments can go out 
and get what is theirs, why should ordinary citizens not be able 
to do the same?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I maintain that if governments have an opportunity, and they 
do, to go back and recoup, citizens should have more or less the 
same kinds of opportunities.
<P>
	Some may ask why I brought this forward. I brought it 
forward because there are a number of cases in which people 
have been treated, in my opinion, unfairly, insensitively and 
unjustly.
<P>
	I will share with members three such cases. I met a gentleman 
of 81 years of age. The reason I met him was that he was having 
some difficulty in making ends meet. When I looked at his 
pension I told him that there was a supplement. I asked him 
where it was and he told me that he was sorry, he did not know 
what I was talking about.
<P>
	I told him that his income was so low he was entitled to the 
supplement. I asked him whether he had ever received it. He told 
me no, he did not know it existed. Members will have to 
understand that this was not an 81-year old man who was not 
with it. He had worked late into his life at his business and it was 
only a few years before since he let it go. He was not making a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2514"> 2514 </A></B>
<P>
lot of money at the business, I assure members, but here was a 
gentleman who basically had been denied the supplement for a 
number of years.
<P>
	When I brought it to the attention of the government three or 
four years ago, it looked at it very responsibly but, lo and 
behold, gave him 14 months of retroactivity.
<P>
	Some people will say that it was too bad, he should have been 
with it, he should have applied on time. The truth of the matter is 
that he did not know it existed. The truth of the matter is that he 
did not have support systems in place that permitted him to 
know about it. The truth of the matter is that he got, in good old, 
plain Canadian English, shafted. I do not think that is right.
<P>
	Let me give members another example. A lady came to me 
one day and wanted to chat about a special program that existed 
whereby her son might profit from training, but she did not have 
a great deal of money. It was helicopter training for her son.
<P>
	She wanted me to make a special plea to the Government of 
Canada to find this funding. I asked on what basis she wanted me 
to make the special plea. To make a long story short, she had 
lived in a common law relationship with a soldier who had 
passed away. He had children from a previous marriage and they 
had some children from their own union. When he passed away 
she did not understand because of her situation that she was 
entitled to certain benefits.
<P>
	Lo and behold, she sold her home and moved far away in order 
to start a new life. It was very difficult. She was alone. She had 
virtually no funds and she had a family.
<P>
	Roughly 20 years later I found out that she was entitled to 
certain benefits. There were two types of benefits. In one case 
the retroactivity was two years and in another case it was three 
years. I maintain that is not fair.
<P>
	Again we could argue that she should have known, she should 
have explored it, but she did not know and she did not explore it. 
She had lost a loved one. She was probably not in the frame of 
mind to go to the government and ask for help and inquire about 
special programs. She carried on as best she could and raised her 
family in a very meaningful way, and at a significant 
disadvantage. That is my second case. Cases like that, situations 
like that are unfair.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	Let me talk about a third case. A single mother came to me 
who was near the end of her studies. She had worked for many 
years. She had children and it had been extremely difficult. She 
had received minimal assistance from government. When I 
explored her case I thought at first glance that she should have 
qualified for more. I asked someone to follow up and sure 
enough she could have qualified for more. There had been an 
error made along the way.
<P>
	This person had to sell certain goods she possessed in order to 
make her way. If that error had not been made some time before 
she would have had significant additional remuneration in order 
to continue and complete those studies. However, the attitude 
was: ``You have made it thus far. We will help you to go the rest 
of the way. There is no way we are going back''. I think that was 
unfair.
<P>
	Let me assure the House that there are literally hundreds of 
cases like that. Some will ask if there are, would it not cost 
millions of dollars. I suspect not but I really do not know and I 
am not going to pretend I do.
<P>
	Surely all of us here want to make sure that when an injustice 
has occurred, very often not because of anyone's particular 
fault, it is up to us to see how we can prevent it in the future. That 
is one of the responsibilities we have as a Parliament and as 
members of Parliament. If governments can go into a citizen's 
pocket several years after when they find out that a citizen owes 
them money, a citizen ought to be able to go into the pocket of 
government and recoup that for which they would have 
qualified.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As I said earlier, I understand that there could be a number of 
reasons for hesitating. Of course, there is a whole series of 
programs; some are still in effect, while others ceased to exist a 
long time ago. There is no doubt that it could cost a fair bit; I 
understand that. I also understand that we do not have the means 
to make frivolous expenses. But this is not the basic issue, and 
we must not fool ourselves into thinking it is. It is not. The 
fundamental issue is one of justice.
<P>
	If it is right, if it is fair for the government to go back and 
recoup what was owed to it, should we not allow ordinary 
citizens to do the same? I personally think so. And I hope that 
today, during this debate, we will explore, as I asked, the 
possibility of legislating or doing something else which would 
have the same result. I do not consider the process itself to be 
nearly as important as the final result, which is to ensure 
fundamental justice by enabling people to have what is theirs.
<P>
	This is all I have to say. I will conclude by simply asking the 
hon. members to help me with an open and creative mind, to 
recognize that a fundamental injustice exists, and to suggest 
ideas as to how we could correct this situation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is all I ask for. I do not ask for a whole bunch of excuses, 
and we are really good at those, as to why it cannot be done, the 
complexity and the costs or what have you. I ask for members' 
creativity applied to this basic problem to make sure that justice 
is done.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I 
begin, I would like to extend my congratulations to the hon. 
member for Saint-Boniface for the honour bestowed upon him 
this past weekend by the International Assembly of 
French-speaking Parliamentarians. He was awarded the rank of 
knight of the Ordre de la Francophonie, du Dialogue et de la 
Culture. Therefore, I want to congratulate him both personally 
and on behalf of my colleagues.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear!
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Now to the crux of his speech. After a number of 
days of budget debates, I am pleased to see the hon. member for 
Saint-Boniface get back to the concept of justice and staunchly 
defend the notion. This suits him far better than the role of 
ardent defender of the recent budget. Then, the notion of justice 
took a back seat to party interests. I much prefer to see him in the 
role he has taken on today.
<P>
	The hon. member has said that we must focus on the 
underlying principle here, which is to give back to people what 
is rightfully theirs. I think we cannot disagree with this 
principle. However, care must be taken to ensure that the 
mechanism does not open the door to all sorts of applications 
from all kinds of people.
<P>
	The first thing that needs to be done is to define exactly who 
these potential benefit recipients are and what type of benefit is 
involved. The hon. member mentioned income supplement 
recipients. He could have been talking about persons entitled to 
unemployment insurance. And what of all transfers to 
individuals?
<P>
	Is this mechanism going to be limited to transfers to 
individuals, whether family allowances or pensions? Or will tax 
credits also be included? Would the government go this far, in 
keeping with the spirit of the bill the hon. member would like to 
bring forward? Would it be possible for individuals to claim 
unused tax credits several years after the fact? This process 
could end up being quite complex, and rather difficult to 
administer. Conversely, however, the Minister of Revenue does 
have the authority to make a provision retroactive and as such, 
he could in fact allow individuals to claim benefits 
retroactively. Of course, this would be to his disadvantage. But 
citizens should not be allowed to make it a habit of using tax 
credits in the wrong year, as this is relatively complex and would 
involve a rather substantial amount of extra work.
<P>
	The basic question we must ask ourselves is why people do 
not understand the credits to which they are entitled? This is a 
very serious problem. How is it that individuals do not 
understand or that those around them cannot inform them 
properly of the benefits to which they are entitled? It took the 
intervention of the hon. member to help a senior citizen 
understand that she was entitled to receive an income 
supplement. That should  not be. We must understand that the 
system appears so complex to some that they are quite lost.
<P>
	Perhaps more emphasis should be put on making information 
accessible to the people. This may be a simpler way and also a 
less expensive one to ensure that individuals can receive the 
maximum.
<P>
	Of course, there will never be a perfect system where all 
individuals will be able to claim all that they are entitled to. 
Occasionally there is negligence on the part of individuals, not 
all but some. It may be unconscious, but it happens that 
individuals are negligent and at times heedless. But it is not 
always the case.
<P>
	So, the first major factor is information or the lack of it. 
Complexity is also a factor making it difficult for some to find 
their way around these matters. At this time of year, the income 
tax return is a timely example. In spite of the fact that the 
income tax form has been made easier and easier year after year, 
people are still finding it harder and harder to fill. More and 
more people are asking for outside help to fill in their returns 
even though the number of lines on the form and the number of 
pages in the Guide have been reduced. The complexity remains. 
The problem is not necessarily with the Guide and its 
complexity but with the complexity of the system per se. Again, 
in the spirit of the hon. member's proposal, I think that we 
should focus on making our tax system simpler to make it more 
understandable to individuals. I think that the scope of the 
motion should be broadened to include not only benefits, but 
also tax credits that individuals are entitled to. It could be 
interesting to look into that area as well.
<P>
	Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, I must admit that I have received 
very few requests. I have seldom had people come to me with 
this kind of problem, but there were a few cases. The fact that it 
is not a common occurrence does not mean that we should not 
look into it.
<P>
	Let us examine a few positive aspects and perhaps slightly 
more difficult principles related to the application of all this. 
First of course, is justice. The principle of getting what we are 
entitled to, as we said earlier.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	At the same time, how far would it go? How many years can 
we go back?
<P>
	We talked about the case where a measure no longer applies. 
Let us say, for instance, that in a year or two-which is not 
unlikely-the unemployment insurance program is completely 
changed. What would happen to people covered by the system in 
place five, seven or ten years ago? There will have to be a time 
limit so that individuals cannot go too far back in the past.
<P>
	On the positive side, this bill would be better for the 
disadvantaged. Some people are better able to understand the 
system or can get professional advice in order to claim what is 
due to them. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2516"> 2516 </A></B>
<P>
This principle favours redistribution in a way and that could be 
positive.
<P>
	Of course, we would also restore the opposite right. The 
Department of Revenue can go back to your past and make you 
pay penalties and interest. So the reverse mechanism could be 
interesting.
<P>
	What is negative is the complexity involved in managing all 
this, because it would not be simple. But, of course, we cannot 
say that we will not solve a problem because it is complicated. 
No problem is easy to solve and that is why we are here, to find 
solutions to complex problems. As for the management side, the 
hon. member seems to be earnest and it could be interesting to 
look more closely at a concrete, administrative solution 
allowing individuals to make sense of all this.
<P>
	This should apply only to individuals, to people in difficulty, 
to disadvantaged people like those I talked about earlier. This 
principle should not be put in the hands of organizations or 
corporations already allowed to spread gains and losses over a 
certain number of years. It must not be a mechanism so open that 
everyone can use it to postpone or move up payments or to do 
what they like with tax rules because that would create great 
disorder in our tax system.
<P>
	Really, there is something good in the fact that the rules 
cannot be extended indefinitely; that would be a bad idea. It 
could cause a problem, maybe even more so for seniors or the 
less educated people in our society.
<P>
	There again, we need a time limit, even for those people, 
because otherwise the Minister of Finance will have great 
difficulty in financial planning.
<P>
	If there were clear guidelines, it would be possible to plan, 
just as we plan for contingencies or set aside some financial 
reserves. We could do it with some programs, but as far as I am 
concerned, it must apply only to transfers to individuals.
<P>
	Before I conclude, we must not forget one thing: the reason we 
are thinking about doing something like this today is that the 
system is terribly complex and individuals get lost in it. We 
often hear how complex it is.
<P>
	People feel it is unfair because they think that those who know 
the system well take advantage of it and make better use of its 
benefits. They feel that because they do not understand it, they 
are being had. This feeds a deep sense of injustice and unfairness 
and we must all work to restore justice and some fairness, 
especially in the area of taxation, which is one of the most 
important reasons that people are unhappy with politicians.
<P>
	In that regard, I think that I share the concerns of the hon. 
member for St. Boniface. It would be interesting to work on the 
principle of his motion, but we must keep in mind that it would 
be complicated to administer, it is not a simple problem and we 
must work to restore fairness in our tax system. I congratulate 
him. I reach out to him and we will work together.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
oppose the motion put forward by the hon. member for St. 
Boniface. I know he put it forward with the best of intentions 
and he gave us some examples. There are some constituents in 
his riding who unfortunately have missed out on some of the 
government largesse through either lack of knowledge that 
programs were available or for whatever reason they were not 
able to claim the benefits available to them had they applied.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	There are two sides to every coin. If there is a responsibility 
on one side for the people to apply for it and there is also the 
obligation for the government to pay then it should not be an 
open-ended commitment by the government to pay forever 
should it be found at some future point that someone did not 
apply for a benefit.
<P>
	We must remember the concept that benefits are to help 
people in their daily living. It is not for them to build a nest egg 
or a small fortune because they did not apply for it last year, the 
year before, five years ago or twenty years ago. The idea of the 
programs we have today, be it the guaranteed income 
supplement, be it the family allowance program, be it the old age 
security program or be it the Canada pension plan, is to help 
people in their daily living. It is not a savings program for them 
to pass on to their heirs. That is the first philosophical objection 
I have to the point raised by the hon. member.
<P>
	He talked about being able to recoup a lost benefit. Yes, I 
know in the interest of fairness it would seem that if I had missed 
out on an opportunity to claim a benefit from the government 
some considerable number of years ago, it might be nice if I 
were able to go back and claim it. However I do not think we can 
leave it as an open-ended commitment.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about responding to real needs. I 
mentioned, as I said, we are here to help people in their daily 
lives, not to build savings. He said it was the right thing to do. 
Yes, perhaps there is some merit in the fact that it is the right 
thing to do. However I believe if the person does not take some 
onus and some responsibility upon themselves to find out what 
they are eligible to apply for, to find out the programs offered 
through the government, a certain onus should be applied on 
constituents to say: ``I have a need that perhaps the government 
will provide. Let me check it out''.
<P>
	He also mentioned that the government had few limitations on 
its side in order to collect the money from our citizens. I beg to 
differ on that. There is the statute of limitations. There are many 
rules, for example in the Income Tax Act, that put very specific 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2517"> 2517 </A></B>
<P>
deadlines on how long the government has before it loses its 
ability to go after the taxpayer to collect lost taxes.
<P>
	I remember a tax case about four or five years ago wherein the 
government had for some unknown reason a tax return in its files 
that it had failed to process. About six years later the file was 
discovered and processed. In the particular case the taxpayer 
had actually owed the government $250,000. It went to court. 
The government lost because there was an item in the Income 
Tax Act that says the government shall process tax returns 
within a reasonable period of time. The court decided that six 
years to process a tax return and send the person a notice of 
assessment showing how much he owed was not a reasonable 
period of time. In that particular case the government was out a 
quarter of a million dollars, plus whatever interest would have 
been applied.
<P>
	There are rules on both sides. As I said, there are two sides to 
the coin. We have specific limitation rules on the government 
being able to collect and I think it is only fair that we have them.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about examples of social programs to 
help people. He talked about the need and desire that we be fair. I 
think the hon. member is trying to be fair and generous with 
taxpayers' dollars. The point we are trying to make as the 
Reform Party is that there is a limitation to what the taxpayer is 
prepared to pay. Therefore that suggests we should not continue 
to have an open-ended situation.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	I was thinking in reading the member's motion that 100 years 
from now someone on reading their great-grandmother's 
correspondence may find that she said: ``I did without my 
guaranteed income supplement because back in 1994 I felt the 
government deserved a hand. I passed up on my claim''. The 
heirs come along and say: ``Wow, here we are. Great-granny is 
long since gone but the claim is there''. Let us not forget the 
interest. It is now tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars that 
the taxpayer would be on the hook for. Therefore, I cannot 
support the motion.
<P>
	The member talked about people getting shafted. I remember 
some years ago while driving along I was pulled over by the 
RCMP. He advised me that I had entered a lower speed limit and 
because I was driving too fast he was going to give me a ticket. 
He said to me: ``I've got good news and bad news for you. One, 
I'm going to reduce the amount of the ticket, but the bad news is 
that I'm going to give you a ticket anyway''. I thought I was 
being shafted. I did not see that I was going to get any redress so 
I ended up paying the ticket.
<P>
	I think the hon. member's point really is that we should 
simplify government so that we are here to help people in need. 
That has been the Reform Party policy. There is a myriad of 
programs out there. That is why people today cannot wade their 
way through the red tape and government bureaucracy to find 
the programs that are there for them.
<P>
	I suggest the hon. member go back and examine the nature and 
philosophy of his motion. We should simplify government and 
make it more responsive to the needs of people. In that way 
people in need will know that we have a program available for 
them. The complexity of government adds to the cost of 
government. It removes government from being able to help 
genuinely needy people while throwing all kinds of money 
through all kinds of programs to many thousands of Canadians 
who could get by fine without the money but it just happens to be 
a program that is there for them.
<P>
	I therefore speak against the motion. I feel that the 
government does much today and, in many cases, goes 
overboard in the way that it spends taxpayers' money. I 
recommend that we oppose the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
support this motion very strongly. I speak as a former provincial 
member who has had direct experience with some of the very 
issues the hon. member has brought forward with this motion.
<P>
	Fairness in government depends on being able to impart 
information to the population in order that what is going on is 
understood. Very often the potential recipients of some of these 
programs that they do not get are not understood by the people 
who deserve them or by the people for whom they were created 
in the first place.
<P>
	I recall one story of a gentleman who was very seriously 
impaired through asphyxiation. He was a mechanic in a garage 
and inhaled a lot of carbon monoxide. He had to be given 
resuscitation to be revived. He did not recover to the fullest 
extent so that he could go back and pursue his trade. When I met 
him it was during a period when I was not an elected member. I 
was in self-imposed retirement. I knew of his financial 
circumstances and they were very modest, to put it mildly. I 
asked him if he was receiving the supplements to which he was 
entitled. He said he had a disability pension. I asked if he got a 
guaranteed income supplement that the province of Ontario 
provides. He did not know about that.
<P>
	We were able to start some wheels turning and he got the 
supplement. However his entitlement went back to the time of 
his accident, the time he was so badly injured. He did not receive 
anything for that time period because application had not been 
made.
<P>
	I would say that is the motivation of the hon. member in 
putting forward this motion. It is in order to correct what really 
is an injustice when the programs of government or what 
government does are not fully known by everybody.
<P>
	I am supposed to be familiar with all of the government 
programs. I do not know them all. I can say what it is like for a 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2518"> 2518 </A></B>
<P>
private citizen who continues working day to day and really does 
not have direct familiarity with what is going on.
<P>
	To be generous, I find the idea or concept put forward by my 
hon. friend in the Reform Party that ``I'm all right, Jack, so 
everybody can look after themselves'' unacceptable in this day 
and age. I believe we have a responsibility to make sure that 
whatever an entitlement is for a citizen that the entitlement gets 
to that citizen sooner or later.
<P>
	I understand details are going to have be worked out and there 
will have to be some limitations and so on so as not to create the 
extreme kind of circumstances that my friend in the Reform 
Party has brought forward.
<P>
	Certainly the intent of this motion is clear and laudable and I 
am delighted to endorse it.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, there being no further 
members rising for debate and this not being a votable motion, 
the time provided for consideration of private members'

	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada)</B> moved that 
Bill C-18, an act to suspend the operation of the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to move 
second reading of Bill C-18, an act to suspend the operation of 
the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am pleased to support Bill C-18, An Act to suspend the 
operation of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The current process of adjusting constituency boundaries by 
independent commissions has been in existence since 1964 
when the government of Lester Pearson passed the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act. Before then the House of 
Commons itself through a committee would carry out the 
adjustment of the boundaries of the ridings.
<P>
	The current process has been in place since 1964. We believe 
that after 30 years the time has come for a full review of all 
aspects of this process by the House of Commons which passed 
the 1964 law in the first place.
<P>
	According to the Constitution the readjustment process must 
take place after each decennial census. After both the 1971 and 
1981 censuses the readjustment process was suspended to 
permit amendments to section 51 of the Constitution Act, 
setting out the formula for representation of provinces in the 
House and to make some changes to the readjustment process 
itself. In both cases the process was suspended at a late stage 
when the House was considering the commission's reports.
<P>
	What we are proposing today is not something being done for 
the first time; it is not new or novel. There are certainly 
precedents for the bill that we are asking the House to adopt.
<P>
	The government is of the view that the most opportune time to 
undertake a comprehensive review of the redistribution process 
is now before further effort and resources are expended on the 
process currently under way.
<P>
	We should take a step back and have all aspects of the matter 
reviewed by the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs in a thorough way. As I said, this is an appropriate time 
to do so while we are at an early stage in the process and the 
existing electoral boundaries commissions have not yet begun to 
hold public hearings on their proposals for new riding 
boundaries.
<P>
	While the redistribution or readjustment process is technical, 
I believe it is worthwhile to take a few minutes to outline how it 
works.
<P>
	There are two stages in the redistribution of seats in the House 
of Commons. The first stage is governed by section 51 of the 
Constitution Act. This section specifies the formula for 
determining the total number of seats in the House of Commons 
and the allocation of those seats among the provinces. The 
second stage of the process is provided for in the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act which establishes the process for 
the drawing of constituency boundaries for the ridings or 
constituencies within the individual provinces.
<P>
	Section 51 of the Constitution Act requires redistribution 
after each decennial census and sets out the formula for 
determining the number of seats per province. The Electoral 
Bound-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2519"> 2519 </A></B>
<P>
aries Readjustment Act  sets out the detailed process for the 
readjustment of the boundaries of each riding within a province.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	As the first step in the process the chief statistician of Canada 
sends the results of the decennial census to the minister 
responsible for the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act and 
to the chief electoral officer. The chief electoral officer then 
calculates the number of seats allocated to each province by 
using the formula set out in the Constitution Act and publishes 
the results in the <I>Canada Gazette</I>.
<P>
	The chief electoral officer, after having received the results of 
the 1991 census from the chief statistician, published in the 
<I>Canada Gazette</I> the allocation of seats to each province.
<P>
	According to this seat allocation and if this process is 
completed under the current formula the number of seats in this 
House would increase from 295 to 301.
<P>
	Eleven boundaries commissions, one for each province and 
one for the Northwest Territories, were created on September 1, 
1993 under the terms of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment 
Act. The chairs of these commissions were nominated by the 
respective chief justices of the provinces and the Northwest 
Territories. The two other members of each commission were 
nominated by the Speaker of the House of Commons.
<P>
	Each commission must set the boundaries for each of the 
specified number of electoral districts in the province for which 
it was established. Community of interests, community of 
identity, historical patterns and geography may be taken into 
account.
<P>
	Using population data from the 1991 decennial census, the 11 
commissions have published their proposals for new boundaries 
for the ridings in each province with a notice of the time and 
place of their hearings or sittings to hear representations on the 
proposed boundaries. These public hearings are scheduled to 
start in early April 1994 and will continue until June of this year.
<P>
	The commissions must complete their reports on the new 
electoral districts no later than one year after receiving the 
population data. The commissions' reports are sent to the 
Speaker of the House who must then ensure they are tabled and 
referred to a parliamentary committee designated to deal with 
electoral matters.
<P>
	Written objections, each signed by at least 10 members of 
Parliament, may be filed with the House committee after the 
tabling of a report. The committee has 30 days to discuss any 
objections to a report. The committee's minutes and 
proceedings are sent back to the commissions which decide 
whether or not to adjust the reports accordingly.
<P>
	The chief electoral officer then drafts a representation order 
describing and naming each electoral district established by the 
commissions and sends it to the minister responsible for the 
Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act.
<P>
	The Governor in Council must publicly announce the new 
boundaries in a proclamation within five days after the receipt 
by the minister of the draft representation order. These new 
boundaries for the ridings cannot be used at an election until at 
least one year has passed between the date the representation 
order was proclaimed and the date that Parliament is dissolved 
for a general election.
<P>
	As members can see, a number of steps remain to be 
undertaken in the examination of electoral boundaries for 
ridings by the existing commissions.
<P>
	Some dissatisfaction has been expressed with regard to the 
current process and the rules under which it operates. For 
example, the commissions publish their initial proposals 
without having had a chance to obtain input from interested 
parties so that when published these proposals generally come 
as a complete surprise.
<P>
	Although some commissions explain the reasons for their 
proposals, they are not required to do so. It is therefore very 
difficult for a person who intends to make representations to a 
commission to know the reasons behind the proposal and to 
make objections or present alternatives in an effective and 
informed manner.
<P>
	The criteria the commissions must use to set the boundaries 
may have to be rethought. These criteria are quite general. 
Depending on the approach taken by each commission, the 
rationale for drawing the boundaries for the ridings can differ 
considerably from one province to another.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	The continual increase in the number of members of the 
House of Commons after each census is another issue of concern 
to many. For example since Confederation the number of seats 
in the House of Commons has increased steadily from 181 seats 
in 1867 to the current level of 295. If the redistribution process 
had not been suspended and new rules adopted some years ago, I 
think back in 1985, the number of members by now would have 
shot up already to more than some 340. That is something we 
should be considering.
<P>
	What I have said are only examples of areas we believe should 
be thoroughly reviewed by the standing committee. The 
government has decided to ask the House of Commons to refer 
the electoral boundaries readjustment process to the House of 
Commons Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs 
for review and for developing improvements to the current 
procedure.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2520"> 2520 </A></B>
<P>
	The government will create this review by proposing a motion 
to the House setting out the terms of reference for the 
committee. I would like to outline for the House what these 
terms of reference will be.
<P>
	They will provide that the committee bring in a bill respecting 
the system of readjusting the boundaries of the electoral 
districts, the ridings.
<P>
	The committee shall consider the general operation over the 
past 30 years of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act 
including: whether there should be a continual increase in the 
number of members of the House of Commons after each census 
as now provided for in section 51 of the Constitution Act; a 
review of the method of selection of members of electoral 
boundaries commissions; a review of the proceedings of the 
commissions, including whether they ought to make alterations 
to the boundaries of existing electoral districts where possible; 
and a review of the involvement of the public and of members of 
Parliament in the work of the commissions.
<P>
	The terms of reference would provide that the committee is to 
report no later than December 16, 1994.
<P>
	Using one of the new procedures adopted by the House about 
one month ago when it approved the government's 
parliamentary reform package, the committee will in effect be 
authorized to frame legislation implementing its proposals. This 
will be the first opportunity for a parliamentary committee to 
initiate legislation in response to a request submitted by the 
government under the terms of the new rules which were 
adopted unanimously by the House.
<P>
	Again I want to express my thanks to the opposition parties 
and members for their support of this parliamentary reform 
package, of which the procedure we are going to follow is one 
important element. We are beginning to follow through on our 
commitment to strengthen the role of members of Parliament in 
developing legislation.
<P>
	The redistribution of the boundaries of the ridings is an 
important matter for the whole country. Therefore we are 
requesting the standing committee not only study the issue but 
also develop and recommend legislative measures it feels may 
be required.
<P>
	In order to allow for this thorough review of all aspects of the 
process, in our view the current process now under way has to be 
suspended. Therefore the government has presented Bill C-18 
for the consideration of the House. If passed it will suspend the 
operation of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act for a 
period of 24 months.
<P>
	I should stress the bill specifically provides that new 
commissions will have to be established within 60 days after the 
end of the 24 month period of suspension. They will follow the 
existing rules unless in the meantime there is legislation 
establishing changes which emerge from the work of the 
standing committee.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	This is proposed to ensure continuity of the requirement under 
the Constitution to readjust the boundaries of the ridings after 
every decennial census.
<P>
	Nothing prevents the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs from making recommendations regarding this 24 
month timeframe or the method by which commissions are 
established when it undertakes its review of this whole subject 
matter and makes recommendations for new legislation.
<P>
	In conclusion, the adjustment of the boundaries of the ridings, 
the adjustment of the electoral boundaries, touches important 
questions of democratic representation in the House of 
Commons. Now is an ideal time to have a thorough review of the 
process undertaken by the House of Commons while we are still 
at an early stage and to hear Canadians through the standing 
committee.
<P>
	As I have said, the committee hearings will be public and 
obviously it will be possible for witnesses to be heard. After 30 
years we believe that this is an appropriate time to review the 
process to see if improvements in the results of that process can 
be brought about.
<P>
	I commend this bill to the House. I urge its early adoption so 
that finally after 30 years the House, which passed the current 
electoral boundaries readjustment law, can review that law and 
see how it can be brought up to date in the light of our current 
and future requirements, requirements of the democratic 
process in this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
comments on Bill C-18, An Act to suspend the operation of the 
Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act, tabled by the 
Government House leader, will be brief.
<P>
	First, I want to say that the Official Opposition agrees with the 
principles underlying Bill C-18. We agree with the principles 
described by the Government House leader because these are 
general, non-partisan principles aimed at improving a system 
which has now been in effect for close to 30 years in Canada.
<P>
	There is no doubt that the criteria set in 1964 must be 
reviewed. Our response might have been less spontaneous and 
more reserved if this legislation had been tabled just before an 
election, but the government deserves to be congratulated for 
acting at an early stage, when there is no controversy or dispute. 
Indeed, the government cannot be accused of gerrymandering 
the electoral map by referring the issue now to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, for a review of the 
whole process.
<P>
	While our objective remains Quebec's sovereignty, it would 
be irresponsible on the Official Opposition's part not to get 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2521"> 2521 </A></B>
<P>
involved in this exercise, since we must represent the interests 
of Canadians from Newfoundland to Vancouver, that is from 
coast to coast and up to the Arctic.
<P>
	Once the bill is referred to the committee, we will look, 
without any mental reservations and with a totally open mind, at 
the impact of the review and we will participate, in the most 
positive manner possible, in the development of new criteria 
regarding the philosophy exposed earlier.
<P>
	The Supreme Court has already indicated some parameters 
which we have to follow, but parliamentarians definitely have 
some room to manoeuvre. There are aspects which we must 
review, including the continuous increase in the number of MPs. 
Should that trend be maintained? Should we do something about 
the situation? How should we go about this? To correct the 
situation we must first look at it, and the best way to do so is 
certainly by referring the issue to the Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	One aspect I find particularly interesting in connection with 
the readjustment process would be, of course, to review the 
well-known senate clause which allows Prince Edward Island 
its four seats, not that I am challenging that-that is not the 
point-and in any case, we have all lived with this provision. 
Everyone agrees it would be bizarre, to say the least, for a 
province to be represented by fewer members than the number 
of senators it may have, although that does happen in the United 
States.
<P>
	Perhaps section 51, if it still applies to Quebec in the next 
election, could be used to cover cases like the Magdalen Islands. 
This is an entirely separate community which no longer has its 
own member of Parliament, because since the 1968 reform, it 
has been part of the riding of 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine. This is not a political 
issue. In fact, we find the same situation in the province of 
Newfoundland, where Labrador exists as a distinct entity only 
because Newfoundlanders are willing to have their electoral 
districts contain more voters than would normally be the case, 
so that residents of Labrador, on the mainland, can have their 
own representative. These are only two examples.
<P>
	Perhaps more examples of truly distinct communities within 
this country will be submitted to the Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs-I am not sure-but it would certainly be the 
proper place to make these submissions, as well as adjust other 
criteria.
<P>
	I think the government made a wise decision to stop the train 
at the first opportunity, in other words, before it would be to 
expensive to do so. The Official Opposition is not in the habit of 
making frivolous compliments. However, I think the 
government acted sensibly by intervening in the readjustment 
process at the earliest opportunity, instead of waiting, as the 
previous government so often did on other occasions, until all 
public money was spent before stopping the train. It waited until 
we had paid our fare and the train had reached the station.
<P>
	If the train must be stopped, and we on this side of the House 
believe that it should be stopped, we can at least save on the fuel 
and the staff we need on board that train. In any case, I do not 
support the argument that since a certain amount of money was 
authorized during the 34th Parliament, we should go ahead.
<P>
	I believe that on October 25 of last year, we made a dramatic 
turn, at least in Quebec. We will see in the months to come 
whether or not this also applies to the other side. We should not 
feel overly bound by the decisions of the 34th Parliament, and in 
particular by the Lortie report already mentioned by the hon. 
leader of the government in this House. The Royal Commission 
on Electoral Reform is only a small part of what we will have to 
study before we come to some conclusion.
<P>
	The report of the Lortie Commission should not be the 
exclusive background or even the only basis on which to build. 
In fact, the mandate does not set any limits nor give strict 
criteria to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs. Therefore, the Committee will be free to act as it sees 
fit.
<P>
	To conclude, Mr. Speaker, the Official Opposition will use all 
its capabilities-God and you know we have a lot-to influence 
the work of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
rising today on Bill C-18, an act to suspend operation of the 
electoral boundaries readjustment process.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will know, having studied these questions, it 
is never a good time to adjust boundaries of sitting politicians. It 
is never a good time to do districting. It always causes problems 
and controversy. In the past these things were resolved in the 
House through political processes in which the powerful 
members of parties imposed solutions on the Chamber as they 
occasionally do in other aspects of debate.
<P>
	Since 1964, as the government House leader has indicated, we 
have attempted to move toward an independent process for that. 
We have had an independent process. The process has actually, 
in my view, worked reasonably well. The problem has been the 
periodic interference of politicians with the operation of the 
process.
<P>
	This motion asks the House to give its consent in principle to 
Bill C-18. That would be a contradiction. It is not possible to 
agree in principle with something entirely lacking in principles.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2522"> 2522 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill is an indication of what is wrong with Parliament 
today and what is wrong with the operations of this place and 
explains why many citizens have such a jaded and cynical view 
of what transpires here.
<P>
	We have a wide range of euphemisms in describing what we 
are about to embark on by adopting Bill C-18. The basic pitch 
for Bill C-18 is that we are prepared to bring the public into a 
consultation in order that we can have a better process for 
defining electoral boundaries.
<P>
	What we have is an attempt to railroad for a long time the 
process for redistribution that is mandated by the Constitution 
and specifically by this bill, which serves only to suspend the 
existing process which is about to enter the public hearing 
phase. We are asked in effect to suspend the public's right to 
debate the boundaries for which we have already as a Parliament 
and as a government authorized the expenditure of millions of 
dollars so that we can turn that study over to the operations of a 
parliamentary commission dominated by politicians.
<P>
	Doug Fisher, the former member of Parliament and widely 
respected columnist, noted in the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> on March 18:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It's ridiculous, even beyond irony, how quickly the newly-elected become 
owners of their ridings.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Just as an aside, I am as guilty of that as anyone, referring to 
my riding. Calgary West is not my riding. It is the riding I 
represent in the Parliament of Canada. There is a big difference 
between that and my riding. However, that is the talk and is the 
attitude most of us have here only a few months after being 
elected.
<P>
	Mr. Fisher goes on:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In large part our costly decennial census is to establish where the people are 
so electoral constituencies can be adjusted to reflect: (1) the equality of each 
citizen's vote; (2) the total number of MPs in the next Parliament; and (3) the 
number of constituencies for most provinces (not all-some have ``floors'' 
against losses).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Some weeks ago the official redistribution process produced the new riding 
maps required by shifts revealed in the 1991 census. At once many MPs, most of 
them new, particularly Ontario Liberals, began to protest the riding changes. Of 
course, this means an attack on the enacted formula for increasing the number of 
MPs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The chief justification for sticking with what we have is the presently popular 
one of saving money.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Yes, stalling redistribution would probably save $25 or $30 million in the 
short run-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is an exaggeration. It is about one-tenth of that.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-but it offends the ``rep by pop'' principle and stacks up some already 
inordinately populous ridings and leaves others small and decreasing in 
numbers. The electors who must be done first, of course, are those in large cities 
and their suburbs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	That is Mr. Fisher's commentary. I am going to elaborate on 
it. It is reflective of what is wrong with Parliament today. It is 
very interesting how in question period and in debate, day after 
day a government member or government minister defending a 
particular position or a particular bill, no matter how ludicrous 
the argument, can receive not only an ovation from the side 
opposite but usually a standing ovation for the silliest of 
comments. Yet when something is brought in that affects the 
personal self-interest of members of Parliament, it is amazing 
how quickly and independently they can mobilize to get action. I 
am always amazed that whenever we raise questions here about 
issues like pay, the pension scam or the ridiculous tax-free 
unaccountable expense allowance, we get hoots and hollers 
from the other side and the independent voice rises up with all 
this concern.
<P>
	The same is true with electoral boundaries. As soon as our 
own electoral fortunes are put in some jeopardy or our political 
plans for the future are threatened, government backbenchers 
can bring great pressure to bear on government members, but the 
rest of the time we run from committee to committee busy 
working, approving things, having the satisfaction of merely 
being present among the great men and women who form the 
cabinet, maybe even getting some photographs of ourselves for 
our householders where we can be seen with the leaders. As I 
say, when it concerns self-interest like electoral boundaries or 
pensions or some issue like this, boy does the voice of the 
independent member ever rise to the fore in a hurry.
<P>
	This is why this is such an important issue for me and many 
members of my party. This is really the first time in this 
Parliament where members of our party are being asked to make 
a difficult decision between what is the right thing to do based 
on the principles that govern this country versus protecting our 
own narrow self-interest through getting together and having all 
party agreement on something.
<P>
	Many of us in this party, and this will come out in debate and it 
is no different for me, are dramatically affected by the proposed 
changes. Many of us are unfavourably affected by the proposed 
changes. I am sure there are some who will even support 
stopping this process, and I respect that. But for the majority of 
us that is not a basis to interfere with a process that is 
independent and should be independent, is consultative and 
should be consultative, and by and large has been working and is 
necessary and mandated legally and constitutionally.
<P>
	I say that is a very important issue for us. That is the reason we 
are going to oppose this bill. That is not to say that the process 
cannot be improved, not to say that there are not legitimate 
issues that the public wants addressed. What this party is 
looking for is some real commitment on the part of the other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2523"> 2523 </A></B>
<P>
members of the House, particularly the government, to show 
that it has some real  plans to address the problems that it claims 
are behind its decision to suddenly try and suspend this process.
<P>
	Let me spend a few minutes talking about some of those 
things. The government House leader has today provided a 
number of arguments for this particular bill and this particular 
course of action, as did my friend from the Bloc Quebecois. I 
want to comment on some of those things because I think it is 
important to say what could be improved and also to say where 
in very many of these instances the rationale for proceeding is 
simply not consistent with the actions that are being requested 
here.
<P>
	First, there is the issue of public consultation. We, as 
members of Parliament, will be prepared to consult the public on 
a new process leading to new boundaries. As I already said, this 
bill blocks a public hearing process which is about to get under 
way and which is mandated by the bill. Some, not just myself as 
a member and other members, but private citizens have already 
contacted these commissions with the intention of making 
submissions. In the past it has been claimed that these 
boundaries are presented as a fait accompli. That is simply not 
true. It is true that the parameters of the act which are mandated 
under the Constitution are a fait accompli but the boundaries 
themselves are not a fait accompli.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	If I have time I will discuss what kind of changes 
commissions are generally interested in looking at. In the last 
process I am told by officials of Elections Canada that 20 per 
cent of the proposed ridings were altered in that particular 
public hearing process.
<P>
	The second point is that we are prepared to proceed on a 
non-partisan basis. I take the government at its word that there 
is certainly no question of the committee or politicians drawing 
the boundaries. Yes, they want to block the independent 
commission and set up their own study of the process but there is 
no thought that politicians themselves would redraw the 
boundaries. I accept that. I would be shocked to believe that any 
party in this House would propose such a thing.
<P>
	It is interesting when we are supposed to be proceeding on this 
question, which is one of the questions of the fundamental rules 
of the game and of how electoral law operates, that the 
government is prepared to proceed with this bill and presumably 
with its entire agenda on this without the consent of one of the 
three recognized parties of the House. From that fact alone we 
have every reason, and I suggest the Bloc Quebecois also should 
have every reason, to be suspicious that this is in fact a 
non-partisan venture.
<P>
	You will recall, Mr. Speaker, that one of the acts of the 
previous government that I supported was it changed a part of 
the formula in the Constitution for redistribution that had been 
put into the act in the 1970s which had special discriminatory 
measures against Alberta and to a lesser degree British 
Columbia. There was a formula that talked about different kinds 
of provinces and treated  them differently. When the 
Conservative Party revisited the formula and revised it and did it 
in a way that limited the growth of the Commons, it did away 
with those discriminatory provisions. That was a formula 
instituted by a previous Liberal government.
<P>
	The government says: ``It has been 30 years and we have a 
long time desire to study the electoral process. Furthermore, this 
process has not been revised in some time''. I cannot say that I 
am an expert on everything that has transpired with the bill since 
it was tabled in 1964 but just looking at a copy of it I can say that 
it is not the case that the bill has not been amended since 1964. 
There is a list in the back of the present publication of the bill by 
Elections Canada that describes or gives a list of amendments 
from 1964 to 1992.
<P>
	Just glancing at this I see a list of about 25 or so amendments 
that have occurred over that period. I suspect some of them are 
very small, but by and large this is a process that has been 
functional except for the periodic interference of politicians.
<P>
	If there was this desire to study this process, if this had been a 
pressing matter, why did this not come to the fore before the 
tabling of boundary proposals that were not particularly looked 
upon favourably by members of this House? Why did we not 
undertake that process before?
<P>
	In 1985 we had debate over the formula. We changed the 
formula in the Constitution which mandates this process. At that 
time we did not do a comprehensive revision of the process. 
There was no debate on this issue. While we set these new 
boundaries in place in 1987 and elected MPs in them in 1988, 
there was never any study throughout that time.
<P>
	I was here for a large part of that time. I do not remember any 
call on behalf of any number of members to have a 
parliamentary study into this before getting into the next 
process. I did a quick glance of my red book. I did not find any 
particular mention in the government's election plan of a desire 
to alter the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act. Last year 
we had the Lortie commission. We spent millions of dollars on 
that commission to look into all aspects of electoral law. It and 
the committee that studied that report deferred discussion on 
this set of issues.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	As my friend from the Bloc mentioned, there is no agreement 
on those things in the Lortie report. The government has 
expressed some interest but it is not bound by the Lortie report. 
The Bloc is not bound by the Lortie report. We have strong 
objections to the Lortie report. We have spent millions of dollars 
having a royal commission study some of these questions and 
none of us are prepared to move on them. Why are we now 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2524"> 2524 </A></B>
<P>
talking about instituting yet another study, this time by members 
of the House of Commons?
<P>
	It is important to mention one fact here. We had a briefing by 
officials from Elections Canada on Friday. I would bring to the 
attention of the House that senior officials of Elections Canada 
said that far from this being an issue of discussion there had 
been no consultations with Elections Canada on this bill and that 
senior officials were not provided with a copy, a draft or 
otherwise until it was tabled in the House of Commons. That was 
only last Friday.
<P>
	This is in sharp contrast with the repeated consultation 
detailed in the Chief Electoral Officer's report, the most recent 
report ``Toward the 35th General Election'', during previous 
electoral reform efforts, including for example Bill C-213 in 
1991, Bill C-78 the Referendum Act and most recently Bill 
C-114. Members can see the details and the consultations that 
occurred with Elections Canada in adopting those courses of 
action.
<P>
	Let us look at the issue of cost. This is the most interesting for 
me. The government with its $40 billion deficit is now 
concerned with the great costs that may be incurred in 
proceeding with a $2 million to $3 million completion of work 
already in progress.
<P>
	The claim is we are going to save money by doing this. We 
have budgeted $7.8 million for this process of which more than 
half is already spent.
<P>
	It is important to note that there is absolutely nothing in the 
course of action we are asked to take that could possibly save 
money. Even if we establish a parliamentary committee it will 
be travelling around the country studying these questions and 
racking up costs. Meanwhile people at Elections Canada will 
still be paid to prepare a revision to the process when it kicks in a 
second time. We are simply wiping out the $5 million that has 
been spent. We are incurring additional costs and time here in 
the House and we are ultimately going back to square one on 
some kind of electoral boundaries readjustment process.
<P>
	There is a very outside chance, if we can ever get a sense of 
what precisely it is any party is actually proposing we change 
about this process, that we may get a better act or better 
boundaries. What is absolutely clear is that it will cost a lot more 
to proceed with this course of action.
<P>
	When this bill was placed on the Order Paper on March 17, it 
contained the standard recommendation: ``His Excellency the 
Governor General recommends to the House of Commons the 
appropriation of public revenue under the circumstances and in 
the manner and for the purposes set out in the measure entitled 
Bill C-18''. In other words, we already recognized in tabling 
this bill that it will cost more money than we have budgeted, not 
less. It will cost more whether we come out at the other end with 
absolutely nothing or whether we approve the process or change 
it or anything. It will cost more money. The least costly action 
without doubt is to proceed in the manner we are already 
proceeding.
<P>
	If we can get some commitment to improvements before we 
decide to flush $5 million down the toilet, I guess we would be 
prepared to look at that. In the absence of that, we see no reason 
in proceeding in this manner.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	The government has talked about precedents, about previous 
suspensions of the process. I was here when that occurred in the 
1985-87 period when we suspended the process. Ultimately the 
reason we suspended the process was the same and only reason 
we have today to suspend the process, because the public does 
not like the growth in the number of seats in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	In 1985 the government suspended the process for that reason 
and brought in a new amending formula under the Constitution 
to limit the growth of seats in the House of Commons. In the 
previous redistribution the seats were supposed to grow from 
282 to 312. Under the act brought in by the former Conservative 
government we were limited to 295 and to much smaller growth 
in the future.
<P>
	That may still be too much growth. Our party has offered the 
suggestion to the government that all parties get together to 
make a commitment to an amending formula that would 
permanently cap the growth of seats in the House of Commons. 
That could be done if we respect certain elements of the 
Constitution that require interprovincial agreement.
<P>
	There are other requirements that would allow us to cap the 
growth of seats in the House of Commons and still respect the 
general principle of rep by pop, provided we could get 
agreement of the House and agreement of the Senate. If that 
were to be done to answer the one legitimate public demand out 
there at the moment, which is that we limit the growth of seats in 
the Commons, in all honesty it would be perfectly legitimate. 
The electoral boundaries adjustment commissions have no 
mandate to examine that question. They are simply to draw 
boundaries under the current formula and under the current 
calculations.
<P>
	We can have these public hearings and it is going to surprise 
many people that what they think they are to talk about is not the 
purpose of the commission. The purpose of the commission is to 
change boundaries. It is a catch 22. Either we give a legitimate 
reason for doing it and react to public demand, or we admit that 
all we are concerned about is the boundaries. In fact we are 
concerned about them before the public has actually had any 
chance to speak its own mind on the issue.
<P>
	I would point out that the government has an ancillary motion 
to the bill that looks to reviewing the issue. We will review the 
issue of number of seats. We will review the issue of operations. 
We will review the parameters of discussion and of commission 
deliberation on boundaries. We will review, review, review. All 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2525"> 2525 </A></B>
<P>
the bill really does is suspend the process and suspend public 
input in the interim.
<P>
	That would be very interesting since the government is a 
master of studies and reviews. We have 15 or 18 studies or 
reviews of government legislation. We are reviewing foreign 
policy. We are reviewing defence policy. We are reviewing 
social policy, unemployment insurance and welfare. We are 
reviewing tax policy. We are to review family trust. We are 
reviewing the GST. We are reviewing just about everything.
<P>
	Would it not be interesting if we were to take the attitude that 
until we finish the review of unemployment insurance we will 
stop paying it; or, until we finish our review of foreign policy we 
will shut down our embassies and suspend their operations; or, 
until we review our defence policy we will tell our guys in 
Bosnia to take a holiday and enjoy the sights?
<P>
	It is a very different aspect when it comes to being not just a 
review. We are very anxious to review these matters. I am sure 
members of the House affairs and procedures committee from 
this party would be all the more willing to review an important 
question like that one. Members who are concerned with 
parliamentary reform and electoral reform would be happy to 
study some of these questions. In the absence of any sense that 
this is going anywhere other than suspending the process, I do 
not think we will take a look at that.
<P>
	I would also note that there has been some hint at it. We know 
the real reason is that there has been political outcry from 
certain members about the proposed boundaries. I would call on 
members of Parliament, particularly Liberal members of 
Parliament, to play a different role on this question. I appreciate 
there are severe pressures.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	There are many members on the Liberal backbenches. Most of 
us in opposition are inexperienced members and are not aware of 
the process involved in these kinds of issues. Having been 
surprised, having tried to figure out how we were going to have 
some influence and suddenly having discovered that Parliament 
cannot vote down these proposals because the commission is 
independent, we demand that Parliament can the process.
<P>
	I call on members of the Liberal frontbenches to educate their 
backbenchers or their MPs on exactly what the issues are. I 
noticed the government House leader did some of that today. He 
informed them-and it is very important to inform members, 
particularly some members who have spoken in the 
House-about the fact that this was not an option. We do not 
have the option of saying that we are not going to redistribute 
seats in the House of Commons. This is required by the 
Constitution and we have had a readjustment every census since 
Confederation. That is an important democratic protection.
<P>
	It has its origins in the reform bill in Britain of 1832. For 
centuries we had virtually no redistribution in the House of 
Commons. We had ridings in Great Britain wherein there were 
two or three eligible voters. They were called rotten boroughs. 
Some members of the government are fond of quoting Edmund 
Burke who is sometimes called a conservative and proclaimed to 
be the father of modern conservatism. One speech Liberal 
members like to quote is the one in which he said he did not feel 
he had to represent his constituents; he was protecting 
something called the national interest. Of course he made most 
of these statements from the safety of a rotten borough because 
he could not get elected making statements like those.
<P>
	I hope that is drawn to the attention of the frontbench so that it 
can provide some leadership on it that says we have a legitimate 
process in place, that we have already delayed it and that we 
should now get down to business. Our friends in the Bloc 
mentioned many objections today as did our friends in the 
government and others in the past. Many of the objections to the 
particular boundaries have nothing in common. What is good for 
myself and my riding may be bad for the person in the next 
riding. I said there is never going to be a good time to redraw 
boundaries. Other than keeping the seats pretty much as they 
are, there would never be any particular alignment of boundaries 
that would be satisfactory to the vast majority of members of 
Parliament. That is the one option, for reasons of protection of 
the public and the voter, the Constitution rules out.
<P>
	I want to mention a serious concern about the intent of the act. 
It suspends the process for a period of 24 months, which would 
effectively mean it would be virtually impossible to foresee a 
situation where we had a redistribution prior to the next 
election. If there is not a redistribution prior to the next election 
which we expect in 1997-98, the first redistribution from the 
1991 census would probably not occur until early in the next 
century, at which time we would likely already have the results 
of another census requiring redistribution.
<P>
	If the bill for that reason is not in violation of the Constitution 
I suspect it is certainly in violation of the spirit of the 
Constitution and might be a very interesting reference to the 
Supreme Court. This has always been a question. I am not a 
constitutional lawyer. I would be more than happy to hear the 
interpretation and advice on this question from hon. members 
such as the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra. The 
Constitution requires Parliament to redistribute seats in the 
House of Commons and has always done so. What if it simply 
refused or undertook actions which amount to a refusal? What 
then would be the recourse of the population? Would it then be 
incumbent upon the Supreme 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2526"> 2526 </A></B>
<P>
Court to redraw the boundaries for us? In that context I think the 
bill raises some very substantial difficulties.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would also like to comment on the position taken by the Bloc 
Quebecois on this bill. It is most interesting, but I hope the Bloc 
will carefully reconsider its position and its support for this 
measure.
<P>
	It is interesting to see how a party that claims to be a party of 
principle, that exists for the sake of Quebec's independence, for 
the sake of its own ridings and the ridings of Quebec in this 
Parliament, it is very interesting to see how that party could be 
concerned about the redistribution process and the possibility 
that existing ridings might change in the next election.
<P>
	I think the Canadian public, especially in Quebec, will take a 
good look at the reasons for all this. The Bloc Quebecois claims 
to be concerned about the cost of government and the federal 
system, but they are prepared to support a plan that will most 
certainly increase those costs. The advantage of this plan is that 
ridings will not change in time for the next federal election.
<P>
	I think this demonstrates a lack of confidence on the part of 
the Bloc Quebecois in its ability to achieve its goal, the 
independence of Quebec, before the next election.
<P>
	Of course I realize that in the Bloc Quebecois, as in the 
Reform Party and the Liberal Party, there are members who for 
obvious reasons object to the proposals for electoral reform 
made by the present commissions.
<P>
	We realize that. But I would ask the Bloc Quebecois to think 
twice about giving the power to change this process to 
commissions appointed by the government and to committees of 
this House where government members have a majority. Quite 
frankly, I think the Bloc should take a long, hard look at this 
plan.
<P>
	I would also like to comment on what was said about electoral 
redistribution and representation by the Bloc Quebecois 
member who just spoke. For instance, in referring to the 
Magdalen Islands, he mentioned regional representation.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you and I are very concerned about regional 
representation in this country. That is why we support a 
thorough and complete reform of the Canadian Senate. The real 
representation for Canada's less populated areas should be in 
that house. The Bloc Quebecois has consistently opposed such 
reform, and now it mentions the possibility of regional 
representation here in the House of Commons, which works on 
the principle of ``rep by pop''. I see a contradiction here as well, 
a policy for parliamentary reform which needs work, and I say 
this with respect, not only for the sake of the Parliament of 
Canada but perhaps also for the sake of the Parliament of an 
independent Quebec, if the Bloc is able to achieve its goals. 
From the Bloc's comments it is clear there are a lot of problems 
with their current position.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I see I only have a short amount of time left. I know my party 
has a number of people who have asked to speak to Bill C-18. 
We are aware from Elections Canada that the process of looking 
at these boundaries is going to continue until it clears both 
Houses of Parliament. In the meantime we would like to use our 
speeches to educate the public as to the opportunities that exist 
here and what exactly is the state of this law and this process.
<P>
	Many members will be explaining how the changes that the 
commission has proposed affect them. We will be explaining it 
in open forum here to the public. Members of the Reform Party 
will certainly be free to say whether they like or do not like those 
changes and any proposals which they would take to the 
independent commissions and which they would urge the 
independent commissions and other citizens to look at. I think 
we will see very quickly the number of difficulties with 
politicians trying to direct such a process. I believe most of our 
members will be indicating that getting ourselves involved in 
this process without a clear plan is not the method to use.
<P>
	I have asked a number of members of my party to indicate to 
the public how both politicians and constituents can contact 
Elections Canada and participate in the public hearings in their 
ridings. There is a process being set up now. Elections Canada is 
already incurring the costs of setting it up and we might as well 
make sure the public is aware of the opportunities. We can use 
this particular debate to do that.
<P>
	This will indicate the kinds of things that the public really 
would want to see before we begin to intervene and change this 
process or incur further costs or further delays.
<P>
	The main reason is to mention that the only reason most 
people would really want to see this process stopped is to agree 
that we limit the number of seats in the House of Commons. 
Canadians are dramatically overgoverned. I call on the 
government and the Bloc Quebecois to sit down with us and 
reach a formula very quickly that could lead to a permanent 
capping of the number of seats in the House of Commons.
<P>
	We could introduce that through both Houses and that would 
suspend the process for reasons the public would support and 
then would allow us to get on with business in a way that would 
not only serve the public interest and would not have the 
extreme delays planned in this bill but would fulfil a legitimate 
public reason for doing so.

	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> No, Mr. Speaker. I was watching the government

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to rise today to speak to 
and to oppose the provisions of the legislation before us in Bill 
C-18.
<P>
	One has to ask what precipitated the government's decision to 
attempt to suspend the legitimate work of the federal electoral 
boundaries commission. Was the government responding to 
public concern and opinion or merely trying to circumvent for 
whatever reason the prescribed process? Or, heaven forbid, is 
the government responding to disgruntled politicians?
<P>
	To British Columbians, we once again have the example of 
central Canada controlling the outcome before the polls have 
even closed on the west coast. On election night the Leader of 
the Official Opposition made his acceptance speech at seven 
o'clock Alberta time, six o'clock B.C. time, before the polls had 
even closed. In the case of this electoral boundary review we in 
B.C. had not even received our report when Ontario MPs were 
crying foul and wanting to throw out the process.
<P>
	This process has been in effect in Canada, every decade since 
1867, tied to the census. In this case the redistribution is tied to 
the 1991 census. One can legitimately ask how the House of 
Commons can cancel this mandate. I am very disappointed that 
apparently the government can do exactly that.
<P>
	There is no precedent for this attempted action. It was not an 
issue in the campaign. It was not an issue after the campaign. It 
certainly was not in the Liberal red book.
<P>
	I am led to the inescapable conclusion that some government 
MPs are not pleased with lines on a map as a part of the 
redistribution process and therefore want to throw out the whole 
process.
<P>
	I am not 100 per cent satisfied with lines on a map either, but a 
part of the process is public hearings. I am already scheduled for 
May 26 in Nanaimo, B.C. and I am actively seeking support for 
my proposals. This is all part of the process. Where is the public 
outcry? I suggest it does not exist and that self-interest is the 
issue here. This is an attempt to politicize a process which 
should be depoliticized and tied to the census as much as 
possible.
<P>
	We have received no commitment from the government that 
three party agreement will be necessary to approve a new 
boundaries review process. As well, there is no contingency 
plan to save the work done by the current commission if the 
procedures and House affairs committee should fail to put 
forward a new proposal for consideration by the House.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	Ultimately this could mean $5 million worth of wasted work, 
the start of another commission and the appointment of new 
members. This could even kill any chance of redistribution 
before the next federal election-so much for redistribution 
every 10 years based on population shifts in the census.
<P>
	The government would have us believe that it wants the 
procedures committee to examine the growth in the number of 
seats from the current 295 to the proposed 301, capping the total 
number as a reason to suspend the committee's work.
<P>
	The government has failed to convince me that its intentions 
are credible. The government wants the committee to examine 
the merits of adding 10 new seats in Ontario, which means 
Toronto, three new seats for B.C. and two for Alberta. The way it 
is right now is for Toronto to get four new seats and B.C. two 
new seats.
<P>
	During the negotiations for the Charlottetown accord the 
three old parties brought the Premier of British Columbia into 
the fold by assuring British Columbians that we would obtain 
two additional seats in the next redistribution, contrary to early 
negotiations. British Columbians remember this commitment. 
As a matter of fact, British Columbians cannot believe that 
Parliament is even entertaining throwing out the process this 
week.
<P>
	Just who is upset here? I am unaware, as is the office of the 
Chief Electoral Officer, of any hue and cry from the public. It is 
another example of politically motivated interference. In this 
instance we have not even allowed public hearings to unfold and 
determine the degree of reception or opposition to the proposals. 
Instead, we have the government jumping to thwart the process.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="2528"> 2528 </A></B>
<P>
	I represent a riding that includes half the coastline of 
Vancouver Island and half the coastline of mainland B.C. As is 
the case in Toronto, my riding is a fast growing region and 
consequently would be affected in a major way by 
redistribution.
<P>
	Currently my riding includes the northern half of Vancouver 
Island, the Powell River district on the mainland of the 
province, territories south to the sunshine coast and the Gibsons 
area and north to Bella Coola and Ocean Falls. It is a vast area of 
territory with no logical connection at times between different 
parts of the riding.
<P>
	With redistribution I would lose all mainland portions of the 
riding on the one hand and make it a pure island riding to include 
the top half of Vancouver Island and some islands in the northern 
part of Johnstone Strait.
<P>
	On the other hand, it would be the coastal mainland from 
north of Powell River to Cape Caution, which is a land of 
mountains, glaciers, fiords, logging and fishing camps and 
Indian reserves. Their natural lines of communication are to 
points on Vancouver Island. Not many people are involved but 
this mainland coastal area should remain a part of this newly 
designated Vancouver Island North riding.
<P>
	That is what people think and that is the subject of my 
presentation to the electoral boundaries commission.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	Adding this area to a redistribution population of 96,302 
would mean a population of about 98,000 for Vancouver Island 
north. Half the population of the current North Island-Powell 
River riding on the mainland would predominantly amalgamate 
with west Vancouver to form the west Vancouver sunshine coast 
riding with a redistribution population of 100,265.
<P>
	The north mainland coast area around Bella Coola would join 
the Cariboo-Chilcotin riding with a population of over 85,000. 
Bella Coola on the coast has a road link to the Chilcotin. It is the 
only road link from the mainland to the central B.C. area and the 
only road link between Gibsons and Kitimat.
<P>
	I can assure members that my constituents have little 
opposition to the changes. As I said earlier the riding is a little 
bit of everything right now. The proposed changes represent 
some form of continuity. Most of all the process allows for 
public input at hearings to be conducted upon the receipt of 
representation by interested parties in this process. What could 
be more democratic than that?
<P>
	The only time we as politicians should get involved in this 
process would be to ensure that seats do not increase 
capriciously at the whim of government and cost to the taxpayer.
<P>
	The government's attempt to circumvent the legitimate 
redistribution process is transparent and unacceptable. What is 
needed is a long term look at the parliamentary requirements for 
sitting members.  Everyone knows Canada has too many 
politicians. Let us put this expensive and time consuming 
redistribution to bed first. Then we can deal with Canada's long 
term parliamentary needs without the red herring of someone's 
ox being gored in the current process and therefore attempting to 
subvert the process.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair assumes the Reform Party is 
dividing its time and that we are now on a five minute question 
and comment period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to the member's speech. I wonder if he could 
elaborate on one point.
<P>
	He raised the issue of opposition to the Charlottetown accord 
that had occurred in most parts of Canada, but particularly in his 
riding. He referred to the provision in that accord which would 
have guaranteed the province of Quebec a minimum of 25 per 
cent of the seats in the House of Commons in perpetuity and also 
that the accord would have resulted in a growth of seats in the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	He mentioned there is growth and that B.C. is getting two 
more seats. He also thinks most people in his riding could live 
with the boundaries. Therefore would he and members of his 
riding be concerned that the parliamentary committee composed 
and dominated by politicians who supported the Charlottetown 
accord might use the process of electoral review and reform to 
propose amendments to the formula and the act that would 
implement aspects of the Charlottetown accord through the back 
door? We have seen that on other issues.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> To the hon. member before he replies, 
the Chair, as members know, recognizes a member from another 
party. There was none until the member for Calgary West got up 
and that is the only reason he was recognized.
<P>
	There is a member from the Liberal Party who wishes to ask a 
question or make a comment. I would ask the member to be as 
brief as possible, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, the collective memory on the 
Charlottetown accord in British Columbia is still very much 
there. The province voted two-thirds against the provisions of 
the Charlottetown accord. The collective memory on the 
promise and guarantees concerning redistribution is very much 
in the forefront.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	If in the long term the process could be brought around where 
this distribution is put to bed-the promises were made, let us 
fulfil those promises-if we could then go to a circumstance 
where for the greater good we either cap or even reduce the 
number of sitting members of Parliament for the next 
redistribution, then most Canadians would accept that with glee, 
particularly those in British Columbia.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2529"> 2529 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is just for 
the hon. member's edification. He said he did not hear of any 
objection among voters to proposed redistribution. I would 
inform him that the riding of Halton-Peel has received 
objection loud and clear to the way the proposed lines are drawn.
<P>
	The chamber of commerce of one of the major municipalities 
in the riding has expressed objection. Even a returning officer 
has expressed an objection to the way these lines are presently 
proposed. I want the member to know it is not some concocted 
situation; my own constituents are telling me this.
<P>
	There are some other things to consider. The region of 
Durham is not in the riding I serve but it has now moved to 
reduce the number of school trustees. Here we are with a 
proposed redistribution that would add members to the House 
probably with a carrying charge of-what do we cost, a half a 
million dollars each per year. If we add six new members we are 
adding another $3 million.
<P>
	The hon. member may not consider that to be important in the 
scheme of things. However some of us do consider it important 
especially when our school boards are taking the initiative and 
making serious changes in the density of representation in their 
districts. It is something the House may well consider in the 
years to come.
<P>
	If one looks at Australia for example there are about twice as 
many voters per member in that country. We are at the point 
where we have to make some changes. Either that or we are 
going to have to knock out one of these walls.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for North 
Island-Powell River briefly, please. I believe the Reform Party 
is dividing its time and there will be another speaker getting up 
in about a minute.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, there will be objections whenever 
boundaries are redrawn. I appreciate that.
<P>
	British Columbians have had knowledge of these changes for 
nine days. Discussions were going on in this parliamentary 
atmosphere on the Hill wanting to kill this process before 
British Columbians were even made aware of what the 
provincial boundary redistribution was.
<P>
	What we are saying is that once again Ontario is controlling 
the agenda. In order to represent properly the area of the country 
where I come from and my views on the long term of what is 
good for the country, I am suggesting that we must continue with 
this process as has been done every decade since Confederation.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
record my opposition to Bill C-18 which suspends the operation 
of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act.
<P>
	There are major issues which should be examined here. Some 
fundamental Canadian human rights are being trampled. Let us 
look at some of the issues that should be considered before 
passing Bill C-18.
<P>
	The first one is that political interference is being proposed. 
The principle of political interference in electoral boundaries 
was debated long ago. The decision was it should not be allowed 
and the concept of an independent drafting of the electoral 
boundaries was the way it should be done.
<P>
	Politicians should be removed entirely from the process. 
Looking back to the 1960s and prior there was a great deal of 
political interference in the drawing of electoral boundaries. 
Unfortunately that led to blatant political manipulation of the 
whole situation.
<P>
	In his book <I>The Election Process in Canada</I> Professor Terence 
Qualter identified four roles parliamentarians used when they 
were allowed to manipulate the system and redefine the 
boundaries of the electoral districts. Let us look at what he 
identified.
<P>
	They were most concerned about maintaining the boundaries 
for the MPs sitting in the House. They wanted to protect the 
incumbents' districts so that another election could be fought 
based on the same old boundaries; if they won last time, perhaps 
they could win again. It was self-serving from that point of 
view.
<P>
	And what about retiring members? They would dispense with 
those ridings. They would not have to protect those ridings and 
could use them to their advantage.
<P>
	What about members of parties in the minority, the smaller 
parties and the independents? Some are sitting here today. Those 
were determined to be dispensable. They would draw the 
boundary to eliminate them rather than ensure fair and 
reasonable representation for the people across this land and 
rather than ensure that people who had a different point of view 
could be elected and their position heard in the House. When the 
job is left to the politicians, the minorities are left on the outside 
rather than just being given a seat on the backbench, which of 
course is the case today.
<P>
	Of course given the opportunity, MPs would again respond to 
political pressure to create more seats in the urban ridings rather 
than do a realignment to ensure real representation for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	In the 1960s the need for reform was recognized. They wanted 
to throw out political involvement. They wanted to get rid of it 
and bring in a non-partisan commission that would do the job 
for them.
<P>
	The act established a commission in every province. The chief 
justice of every province was to appoint a judge to be the 
chairman of the commission. That seems to be a great 
non-partisan way to start.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2530"> 2530 </A></B>
<P>
	The proposal at that time was the government would put 
forward a member and the opposition side would put forward a 
member on the commission. They said no, that allowed for 
political involvement and therefore the power would be given to 
the Speaker to appoint additional members to the commission.
<P>
	We want impartial non-partisanship to ensure that democracy 
works in this country. We are the servants of the people; we are 
not their masters. We are here because the people want 
representation. They want democracy in the House. It is not for 
us to take it upon ourselves to manipulate the public to ensure 
we protect our jobs at the expense of free debate, other positions 
and real representation of the people.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	The commissions were established and today we have Bill 
C-18 that wants to take that non-partisan, impartial situation 
and throw it out the window because we do not like what has 
been done. We established the commissions last fall with the 
intention that they would come forward, as they have done 
before, with proposals based on reasoned, rational opinions as to 
why boundaries should be the way they are proposing.
<P>
	Once they make their decisions or proposals the whole matter 
is opened up to input and debate by the people who can then be 
heard. We could ask them what they think. Is this reasonable? 
Have we followed the trading boundaries of a constituency? 
Have we kept the historical names? Have we followed the 
democratic movement of people across the country? Have we 
made a reasonable decision? Let us hear from the people, not 
from the politicians. Let us hear what the people have to say.
<P>
	That is what the government does not want to hear. It wants to 
cut the democratic process off at the pass because the proposals 
being made by the non-partisan, impartial commissions will 
now affect its ridings. Government members do not like it and 
hence we are back to political interference through Bill C-18.
<P>
	Why does the government now wish to scrap their work? The 
commissions based their work on the census performed in 1991. 
Have the numbers changed? I do not think so. The government 
now wants to take these same numbers, massage them and 
manipulate them for its own benefit.
<P>
	Have the people on the commissions been incompetent? I do 
not think so. These are educated, learned people on these 
commissions who have the country's best interest at heart. 
Would self-serving politicians do a better job with the same 
numbers? I do not think so. Do we believe that politicians are 
better suited than judges and ordinary Canadians to decide how 
they should be represented? I do no think so either.
<P>
	That is what Bill C-18 proposes to do. It proposes to take the 
same numbers or the same figures and rework them or massage 
them, all for the benefit of themselves. The public would end up 
with the short end of the stick where the hearing process is 
short-circuited and the  people who are independent and 
impartial have been told that their work is no good.
<P>
	Here we are today bringing the process under the scrutiny of 
the politicians. We wonder why politicians have a poor 
reputation in the country. I would suggest one of the real reasons 
our reputation is tarnished and people have no faith in us is that 
when we appoint an impartial inquiry to do the job and we do not 
like what it says, we throw it out the window and start again by 
doing our own.
<P>
	That brings me to the second issue, the public participation 
issue. It was stated in 1964 as being one of the main reasons for 
the act that was introduced at that point in time. We wanted to 
hear that. We are the servants of the people of the country; we 
are not the masters. They should dictate to us how they ought to 
be represented in the House. It is their House; it is not our our 
House. They are the ones who should decide how it should be 
done.
<P>
	That is why we have mass distribution of material by the 
commission to every household in the land. Let Canadians see 
what is being proposed. Let them have their input. Let the 
impartial commission hear what they have to say and decide on 
the merits of the input whether there should be any real 
adjustments.
<P>
	The government seems to have the idea that this input can be 
dispensed with, that it can be reviewed, and that the time and 
nature of public involvement should be scrutinized and set 
aside. That would be a bad day for democracy, a bad day for our 
reputations. That is why my colleagues in the Reform Party on 
this side of the House are vehemently opposed to the particular 
bill.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	We have some members on this side of the House who are 
supporting the bill. Of course I am talking about the Bloc. I 
wonder where they are coming from on this particular issue. We 
know what their agenda is: it is to break up the country. Nothing 
would give them greater satisfaction than to have a referendum 
tomorrow to say that Quebec wants to go its own way.
<P>
	I wonder if they are supporting the bill to give them the 
opportunity to work up or stir up the emotions in the country 
about real representation by members from Quebec and about 
their opportunity to sit in the House and have their voices heard. 
There are only 75 MPs from Quebec out of a total of 295. They 
can argue about having a minority status, as does every other 
province including Ontario. Therefore I wonder what is their 
particular involvement in the bill.
<P>
	If there is a point to be made, it should be that we capped the 
number of MPs in the House. We have enough MPs. To create an 
opportunity to continue raising that number at great expense to 
the taxpayer who thinks we will add to the number just to help 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2531"> 2531 </A></B>
<P>
ourselves to more taxpayers' dollars also tarnishes our 
reputation.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Reform Party and I are opposed. The 
taxpayer is opposed. Every constituent in the country is 
opposed. I say let the hearings proceed and let us hear what the 
people have to say.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very 
carefully to the three speakers from the Reform Party and their 
rationale for wanting to abort the process we are proposing in 
the House of Commons. I am somewhat shocked at some of the 
things I heard. Here is a party that purports to want to save 
taxpayers' money. They are talking about increasing by six the 
numbers of representation in the House of Commons. We know 
it costs at least a million dollars a year for every member of the 
House. I have great difficulty in how they rationalize that.
<P>
	I would like to get back to the previous speaker concerning the 
fact that there has not been any public input into this matter. I 
wonder how much public input there was into the electoral 
commission. If I could use the example of the province of 
Newfoundland, it has had a population increase in the last 10 
years of something like 600 people. Yet the boundaries of every 
riding in the province of Newfoundland have been redistributed 
at great cost to the Canadian taxpayer. I wonder how much 
consultation there was with the people of Newfoundland.
<P>
	There is no doubt in my mind that British Columbia needs a 
redistribution of its boundaries so that the ones with the heavily 
populated areas are shifting some over to the less populated 
areas. My colleagues in the city of Toronto will probably have 
by the next election 300,000 electors in their ridings. That is an 
incredible burden for those members of Parliament.
<P>
	If we look at the ridings in the national capital region how can 
we justify this shifting? They are not increasing anything. They 
are not doing anything. They are just shifting and creating 
additional costs.
<P>
	How can the previous speaker, as a member of the Reform 
Party who is constantly and consistently preaching restraint to 
this side of the House, talk about expending millions and 
millions and millions of taxpayers' dollars because of 
recommendations by a commission that never consulted in the 
first place?
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the hon. member's 
question, she is accusing us of aborting the process. Bill C-18 is 
designed to abort the process that has been in place and has 
worked for the last 30 years. I find it quite incredible that the 
hon. member would accuse us of trying to abort the process 
when the bill is designed to do exactly that.
<P>
	Then the member made the point about the extra costs of more 
MPs. We are saying let us cap it. We have more than enough 
today. Let us put in motion a serious commitment from the 
House saying that 300 members are surely enough to get an 
informed debate in the House. That would be quite sufficient.
<P>
	I address her last point about how the commissions are 
redrawing the boundaries even though there has been no 
increase in population. These people had the 1991 census 
figures to work from. Those are exactly the same figures the 
government would work from if it proposed to go ahead with 
Bill C-18. There may have been a population shift from one end 
of a city to another. I do not know, but that is what we paid these 
people to determine.
<P>
	In her final point she mentioned the public hearing process. 
The public hearing process was about to start. They cut it right 
off before the public had an opportunity to say that it seemed a 
bit strange to redefine boundaries strictly for the sake of 
redefining them. Let us give the public the opportunity to say 
that. Maybe it will say that the recommendation by the 
commission is wonderful. If that is the case then let the public 
say it. Let us hear what the public has to say. That is the whole 
purpose of public hearings.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to 
have an opportunity to say a few words regarding Bill C-18. I 
want to acknowledge the co-operation of our friends in the 
Reform Party for providing this opportunity.
<P>
	I must say I come at this matter with some mixed feelings. On 
the one hand I have to ask what motivated this particular Bill 
C-18. I remember an effort a few days ago when I suspect all of 
us were trying to get some understanding of what the 
parliamentary agenda would be for the next number of days. We 
asked what the legislative program was and Bill C-18 was not 
mentioned. Then some time last week the formal indication 
from the government was that Bill C-18 was considered to be a 
priority and ideally would have to be dealt with expeditiously 
and with all-party agreement to move it through all stages in one 
day.
<P>
	Perhaps two weeks ago, before the electoral boundary maps 
for British Columbia were made public, rumours about 
Parliament Hill had it that the government was contemplating 
this initiative. At that time I was curious about what motivated 
it, where it came from, what was behind the suggestion. It was 
new to me. I have been here for many years and I had not heard 
there was a serious concern regarding the legislation as it was 
presented.
<P>
	Like everyone else in my constituency I received the maps of 
changes to the electoral boundaries in British Columbia. I must 
say that on looking at the maps of the new boundaries I was 
totally mystified. As a professional geographer who has some 
background in cartography, map making, map reading and 
constructing maps, I was told that the mapped boundaries 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2532"> 2532 </A></B>
<P>
regarding new  constituencies were to recognize geography, 
were to recognize history, were to acknowledge the flows of 
commerce, and were to represent social realities that existed on 
the landscape of Canada.
<P>
	I studied all of them and I could find no correlation between 
an interest in geography and the boundaries on the maps. 
Historically the boundaries made no sense. As a matter of fact I 
can only assume it was some sort of creative artistry on behalf of 
the commissioners who decided on the boundaries in the central 
interior of British Columbia. I can only assume that whoever 
they were, and I say this with all due respect, they must have 
visualised the interior mountains of British Columbia as a flat 
plain with no topographical variation at all because the reaction 
was immediate.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	The next morning, after Canada Post had delivered all of these 
proposals, there was a hue and cry that went up in the 
communities around Kamloops. People who normally would 
never say anything positive about their member of Parliament 
because of their political affiliation rose up and said that they 
must rally around their member of Parliament and stop this 
process before this lunacy continues any further.
<P>
	It was interesting. The talk shows and the editorials were not 
only negative, but viciously negative about who would be 
perpetuating these changes on behalf of the constituents of 
central British Columbia, suggesting that the whole process was 
extremely undemocratic, that it had no relationship with the real 
world in which people lived.
<P>
	That was the first clue that something was up. Very quickly I 
understood why these changes were being contemplated. It was 
because members of Parliament were obviously going to be 
quite upset. As my friend in the Reform Party indicated earlier, 
we perhaps do take some ownership of these constituencies. We 
find that this particular change of boundaries would certainly 
not represent in any way, shape or form the democratic future of 
the electors of the Kamloops constituency, to say nothing about 
all of the surrounding constituencies as well. I am sure that my 
colleagues who represent those constituencies will be 
participating in this debate later.
<P>
	Therein lies a dilemma. On the one hand to proceed with these 
changes would be folly. I know there are changes made from 
time to time by the electoral commission. In my experience I 
have never seen any. I have been involved in this process over 
the years and have argued in favour of changes and there has 
been virtual unanimity by all of the interveners that a particular 
part of the boundary should change or shift and so on to 
represent the reality of that area, but I have yet to see any 
changes ever made. However, I will assume that some are. 
Again, I think there almost is this impression that these borders 
are written in stone. By the time the public process begins it is 
perhaps at best a time  for some tinkering or some minor 
alternations. Essentially the parameters of the boundaries 
remain.
<P>
	When looking at the process today, I think to most Canadians 
this comes as a shock. They receive the map, which is probably 
the first they have ever heard of this process, and they are 
surprised. They have had absolutely no input. Members of 
Parliament and others who are interested in electoral boundaries 
also have had absolutely no input up to that point. The rationale 
itself in terms of creating the boundaries can differ from one 
area of the country to another. While cultural relations, social 
patterns or commercial flows might influence the boundaries in 
one part of Canada, perhaps only geography would influence 
them in another part.
<P>
	The whole process seems a little odd. If we are serious about 
changing the boundaries of federal constituencies to reflect the 
electoral and demographic realities of the country, this seems to 
be a rather outmoded process to do it in a positive way. 
Therefore, I suggest that there is some need for change.
<P>
	On the other hand I question the motive at this point. What is 
behind this? I listened with interest to the government House 
leader who indicated that the government would study the 
operations in terms of how the act is utilized. The government 
will examine whether it will increase the members as we 
automatically do now after each census. It will examine how the 
members of the commission are selected and review how the 
public and perhaps members of Parliament and others ought to 
be involved in the process.
<P>
	This sounds laudable, but surely the most fundamental 
question that has been side-stepped or perhaps almost ignored is 
the number of members of Parliament. There is probably a fairly 
clear indication that the people of Canada do not want these 
Chambers just to continue to mushroom census after census 
until we get-I do not know what the limit would be-hundreds 
and hundreds of members of Parliament.
<P>
	The question would be what size of a constituency can a single 
member of Parliament serve well. Of course that would largely 
be determined on the resources made available to that 
individual.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	I recall a few years ago discussing with a member of 
Parliament from India at the Lok Sabha the size of constituency 
they had. She replied that she was not really certain but it was 
something in the neighbourhood of four million to five million 
in the constituency.
<P>
	I thought that if we have problems, they certainly have theirs 
as well in terms of communicating with their constituents. We 
do not have two million or three million but again, the numbers 
of 85,000 or 95,000 are not necessarily written in stone. I 
suspect that if one looks at other jurisdictions one would find 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2533"> 2533 </A></B>
<P>
areas with smaller constituencies in terms of numbers and others 
with larger.
<P>
	Perhaps we ought to consider seriously whether there should 
be any increases in the number of members of Parliament at this 
point. We have all heard from our constituents that this at best 
would be something that we would move on very cautiously and 
perhaps we ought not to move on it at all other than simply cap it 
with the present levels for now.
<P>
	We have to look carefully at why we are doing this. One of the 
ways that we have protected ourselves in the past is to have a 
process as a result of section 51 of the Constitution and 
associated with the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act first 
introduced in 1964.
<P>
	It is very appropriate for us to remember that this process was 
set up as an arm's length process away from members of 
Parliament. The assumption presumably was that MPs might 
have a vested interest in how the boundaries might be 
reallocated in their area of the country.
<P>
	Therefore an independent process, a commission, was set up 
that would proceed and make these recommendations quite 
apart from the House of Commons or from the Parliament of 
Canada but at least providing input at the last stage of the 
process, which we have just been notified of recently.
<P>
	We ought to move very cautiously now. The government has 
indicated that it has concerns about these maps as do I. Because 
it has concerns about these maps and because it has concerns 
about the boundaries, we should now curtail this arm's length 
process, this independent process, stop it in its tracks and send 
the whole matter to the appropriate parliamentary committee for 
discussion.
<P>
	We have to be very cautious of this. I have been here through a 
number of governments. I know that because the government 
has the large majority in the House that it is going to do what it 
decides to do anyway. Our purpose as members of the opposition 
is to point out some of the concerns that exist if the government 
is to proceed this way.
<P>
	The government is saying that it does not like the way this 
independent commission is working. Therefore it is going to 
change the rules. If necessary, it will even change the 
Constitution of Canada to get its way.
<P>
	We must be careful. When we start indicating a possible 
change to the Constitution, when we start involving ourselves in 
what is a very independent process from Parliament because the 
government in this case does not like the process, what problems 
does this open up? What problems could this present?
<P>
	I have very mixed feelings about this initiative. I question the 
motive behind this initiative. I certainly say that the present 
process could use some improving. As someone from a province 
like British Columbia I also have concerns about representation.
<P>
	I recognize that the proposal would indicate that British 
Columbia would be allocated two additional seats in the House 
of Commons. This is under the old formula and would recognize 
the tremendous population growth that is occurring throughout 
the province and particularly in some of the urban areas. 
Obviously there is a need for changes in order to have a better 
reflection of representation by population.
<P>
	I cannot go without making two observations. If we are going 
to be discussing these kinds of changes, is there not some way 
that we can do this and also examine senatorial reform? There is 
a need, I think we would all agree, to reform the upper House. 
Some would suggest that we eliminate the upper House and 
others would say we should reform it in a variety of ways. There 
is general agreement that the Senate ought to be reformed and 
become much more of a democratic institution.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	I also have to draw attention to my friend in the Bloc who 
represented the Bloc Quebecois in its review of this legislation 
and to indicate as others have that I find it somewhat curious that 
the Bloc is facilitating or is prepared to facilitate this legislation 
to redraft and redraw the federal boundaries in the province of 
Quebec.
<P>
	I have listened carefully to almost all the speeches the 
members have made. There is a theme throughout these 
speeches that within two or three years there will be no need for 
the Bloc, that the process of change in Canada will occur as per 
their plan and therefore there is little need to concern 
themselves as members of the Bloc Quebecois as to how this 
place will operate two or three years from now.
<P>
	There is some inconsistency I might say by the suggestion that 
we need now to examine the new electoral boundaries in the 
province of Quebec to see if they make sense in time for the next 
general election, particularly in terms of some of the comments 
made in the House over the last few weeks.
<P>
	I want to say with regard to the process proposed by the 
government, recognizing the need for change and ensuring a 
more democratic process in the next general election, certainly I 
have some concerns about the way the boundaries have been 
drafted particularly in central British Columbia.
<P>
	I think we have to discuss this very thoroughly and not rush 
the legislation to ensure that the process being proposed by the 
government is not by itself undemocratic, that the process being 
proposed by the government is not behaviour that we saw too 
often in the past nine years where the government, if it did not 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2534"> 2534 </A></B>
<P>
like a particular regulation or law, as important as it was, simply 
used its overwhelming number in the House of Commons, its 
muscle in Parliament, to push legislation through.
<P>
	We can take some comfort that this matter would go before the 
Senate before changes would be made and again, with the 
different political relationships in the Senate compared to the 
House of Commons, there might be some safeguard there.
<P>
	In closing I want to say that the process is of deep concern. 
The need for reform is certainly there. Whether this is the most 
appropriate way however is still a requirement of the debate.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being two o'clock p.m., pursuant to Standing 
Order 30(5) the House will now proceed to statements by 
members, pursuant to Standing Order 31.
<P>

	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Mr. Speaker, today, 
March 21, the United Nations Convention on Climate Change 
comes into effect.
<P>
	This agreement among nations represents the first 
international step in support of the reduction of greenhouse 
gases such as carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide as we all know is 
produced when we burn natural gas, oil and coal.
<P>
	Today we must remind the government and the Minister of 
Energy to act on the promise to reduce emissions of greenhouse 
gases by 20 per cent by the year 2005. Federal, provincial and 
municipal governments all have a role to play but the 
Government of Canada has to lead at the national and 
international levels.
<P>
	The problem of climate change can only be resolved if every 
nation pulls its weight.

	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, this week is 
the Semaine nationale de la Francophonie, which provides 
francophones all over the world an opportunity to stop and think 
of the role played by the French language in the development of 
our communities. This week-long event aimed at making this 
international forum know will allow us this year to emphasize 
the key role of Quebec within la Francophonie in North 
America.
<P>
	I wish this week will also be a time to develop a certain level 
of open-mindedness with regard to Quebec's linguistic 
specificity, reinforce ties between francophones in America and 
elsewhere, and bridge gaps between linguistic communities in 
Canada.
<P>
	I certainly hope that la Francophonie will be celebrated in the 
workplace, schools and businesses, and by all Quebeckers.
<P>
	I call upon my colleagues from across Canada to practice this 
year's theme, which is: ``En français, bien sûr'', or ``In French, 
of course''.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, a couple 
living in my riding of Calgary Southeast were victims of a 
senseless crime. They had their car stolen, taken for a joy ride 
and then vandalized. These citizens had done their part to 
protect themselves from crime. They had locked their car. They 
parked in a lot under a street light.
<P>
	The police believe that young offenders were responsible for 
this crime. This is a growing problem not only in Calgary but 
everywhere. Stealing cars is becoming fun for young offenders. 
They know they can get away with it. If they are caught they 
know that the Young Offenders Act will protect them. Young 
vandals in one instance even spray painted a car with the words: 
``Thanks, Young Offenders Act''.
<P>
	We have to make young people more accountable for their 
crimes and protect the rights of victims. Restitution can be a 
pretty major deterrent if given due consideration.
<P>
	We need to change the Young Offenders Act to make Canada a 
safer place; safer for you, Mr. Speaker, safer for people in my 
riding of Calgary Southeast and safer for all of us who care.

<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to New 
Brunswick youth as valuable members of our present 
communities and an important consideration in all that we 
decide and do.
<P>
	Young New Brunswickers and our young people across 
Canada are faced with peculiar challenges and need our support. 
Government services targeted for youth are improving. We need 
only look to the national youth services corps as an example of 
the kind of creative, youth specific programming necessary to 
assist young New Brunswickers and Canadians through tough 
and changing times. As we attempt to make change we must all 
realize that young people need to be involved in designing the 
programs and policies that affect them.

today is the United Nations International Day for Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination, which persists whenever the principle of 
merit is undermined by prejudice.
<P>
	We must safeguard against reverse discrimination, the 
antithesis of the principle being defended, as we work to meet 
our hiring targets for qualified minorities and tearing down the 
barriers to their full participation.
<P>
	Tolerance and respect are put to a greater test during harsh 
economic times. Witness the views of those who see immigrants 
as stealing jobs from other Canadians, who see only their 
difficulties, forgetting that there are others who are worse off.
<P>
	Today we are challenged to work together to foster economic 
growth and rededicate ourselves to our nation's reality.

whom heighten the intellectual, social, cultural and economic

	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Mr. Speaker, I and many 
other MPs had the opportunity to have a dinner with a group of 
youths visiting Parliament last week. The group was here under 
the Forum for Young Canadians program.
<P>
	In my opinion the Forum for Young Canadians is a valuable 
educational program that brings young people from all parts of 
this great nation together to learn about our political process. 
The forum allows young people to learn about our political 
system through participation and workshops, presentations and 
a mock Parliament. It gives students real, hands-on experience. 
It is also valuable because it allows friendships to form between 
the participants from all provinces of Canada, friendships that 
last a lifetime.
<P>
	It is programs like the Forum for Young Canadians that we as 
members of Parliament must continue to support and expand 
because their benefits are enormous. These youths are the 
leaders of tomorrow and their individual and collective 
experience will lead to the development of a greater nation.

this morning that fewer racial discrimination complaints were 
received by the Quebec human rights commission last year. We 
all know that racist behaviour has not been eliminated and that 
making other cultures known is one of the best ways to stop this 
behaviour.
<P>
	On this International Day for the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, the members of the Official Opposition 
associate themselves with the thousands of Quebeckers and 
Canadians for whom racial discrimination is a social evil which 
must be fought at all cost.
<P>
	We must strive daily to eliminate any form of intolerance 
toward people with a difference. We must promote a society 
where nobody feels out of place because of the colour of their 
skin, their religion or their country of birth. That is the challenge 
facing us all at the turn of this century.

of my Calgary North constituents have raised concerns about a 
member of the other place and his work on behalf of a developer 
in Calgary.
<P>
	Since his appointment this individual has acted for the 
developer in public hearings and has also very actively lobbied 
city officials to advance the developer's interests.
<P>
	Calgary North constituents are particularly outraged that 
someone they are paying to represent Albertans should use his 
influence in this manner and by the fact that he is doing so at the 
expense of his attendance in the other place which is now sitting.
<P>
	I call on the Prime Minister to ask the government leader in 
the other place to investigate the ethics involved when a member 
of that place lobbies-

difficulty about one member attacking another member in the

extend this to the other House.

	Although the hon. member has not mentioned a specific 
person or a specific riding, I think the hon. member is probably 
leaving very little leeway for misinterpretation.

tomorrow we could have another try at it if it is not quite that 
specific, if the hon. member would not mind.

<P>
	As some members of the House will know, the Canadian 
Wheat Board is western Canada's single desk selling agency for 
the export sale of wheat and barley.
<P>
	There are some presently advocating that the powers of the 
Canadian Wheat Board should be fragmented and weakened. 
This is not the time to weaken the Canadian Wheat Board, our 
single desk selling agency. Rather it is exactly the right time to 
strengthen it and expand its role in the international grain 
market.

Canadian farmers superbly over the years and continues to do 
so.

region in the country. The Association emphasizes the 
following: On top of the benefits flowing from an increased use 
of French in all lines of activity, it also wants to generate 
initiatives promoting an interest in reading and writing, improve 
the quality of the spoken  and written language, and also create 
and maintain opportunities for positive dialogue between 
francophones, francophiles and other Canadians of good will.

company in Mexico, while it does name several companies from

government will soon decriminalize the growing of cannabis or 
hemp for commercial purposes. She has indicated that 
Parliament will be asked to pass a law to enable her department 
to issue licences to grow marijuana depending on the level of 
THC, the hallucinogenic agent in cannabis.
<P>
	Perhaps the minister sees us as a country in which people will 
live in houses made of hemp particle board, read hemp 
newspapers, wear hemp clothing, drive cars powered by hemp 
based methanol, dine on hemp seed tofu or enjoy THC free 
marijuana candy bars.
<P>
	While many Canadians support this initiative, I wonder if the 
whole issue of hemp cultivation and decriminalization ought not 
to be referred to the appropriate committee of the House to 
prepare legislative recommendations for Parliament rather than 
dealing with this critical issue in such an ad hoc fashion.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EMPLOYMENT">EMPLOYMENT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. Last week, 
the Minister of Finance took part in the G-7 jobs summit, where 
he proposed a tax credit for companies that create jobs or that 
maintain jobs in spite of technological change. Furthermore, the 
G-7 countries agreed to make employment their priority in 
1994.
<P>
	Now that he is back from the summit, does the minister intend 
to implement a real job recovery strategy based on concrete 
measures in order to give back some hope to the million and a 
half people who are now unemployed in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, when we were in 
Detroit, the issue of a tax credit for hiring workers was raised. A 
suggestion was made by Mr. Reich, the U.S. Secretary of 
Labour. It was also a suggestion made in Canada at hearings held 
by the human resources minister. We are prepared to consider 
this suggestion along with many others.
<P>
	But one thing is very clear, and I was delighted to see that the 
measures we took in our budget-that is, our approach to job 
creation, lower payroll taxes, unemployment insurance 
reform-are exactly the same as those recommended by the 
OECD. That is also the conclusion that was reached at the 
meeting. We must say that even the G-7 supported us.
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if these words are not followed by concrete action, we 
can only conclude that it was hot air. When the minister boasts 
that his own proposals were supported, if no action follows, I do 
not see how he can talk about support.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I think that we must ask him today to tell us 
clearly if he intends to establish this kind of tax credit for 
companies that create or maintain jobs. Can we expect a 
ministerial statement on this and not just hot air?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the budget, we took 
what is perhaps the most important step, namely the lowering of 
payroll taxes. Not only was the unemployment insurance 
premium rate reduced to $3 but we also showed that we intend to 
continue in the same direction when the minister's reform is 
completed.
<P>
	At the same time, we said that we will really look at our whole 
taxation system to see if there are obstacles to job creation or, 
better yet, to see what could be done to encourage employment. 
We clearly intend to do that. It is not hot air but very specific 
action.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask the Prime Minister whether he 
admits that his budget is going the wrong way on employment by 
attacking the unemployed rather than unemployment and its 
structural causes. I would ask him to admit that he will not 
stimulate employment by reducing 85 per cent of the benefits 
for unemployed people.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we clearly stated that this government's priority was job 
creation. We adapted our budget policies accordingly. In the 
past few months, we have already seen the situation improve. It 
will take some time, but I am convinced that the finance 
minister's budget has put the country on the right track for job 
creation.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. In the Ginn Publishing 
affair, today's <I>Toronto Star</I>, quoting sources in the Prime 
Minister's Office, made surprising revelations on the heritage 
minister's behaviour.
<P>
	In particular, we learned that the minister did not see fit, 
before authorizing the deal, to read the legal advice on which he 
bases his own authorization.
<P>
	How does the minister explain the thoughtless and 
irresponsible way he acted in authorizing this bad deal without 
first reading the legal advice in question?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I see that the favourite soap opera of the hon. member 
for Rimouski-Témiscouata is also watched by her colleagues. 
But soap operas are works of fiction and not fact.
<P>
	I gave the facts to this House. I said that I had read and studied 
the recommendations made by the Department of Justice and I 
think that the decision that was made was explained and 
understood; the hon. member only has to read <I>Hansard</I> to know 
where we stand.
<P>
	I hasten to say that the alternative would have been to use 
taxpayers' money to finance questionable legal proceedings. I 
prefer to see this money support the publishing industry I deeply 
care about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
minister also admit that, after reading the legal advice prepared 
for the previous Conservative government in 1990, he realized 
this advice was far from definite regarding the government's 
obligation to honour the so-called verbal promise it is now 
invoking? And would he agree to table the legal advice on which 
he is now trying to base his position?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I am very happy to see that the hon. member has started 
to read English-language newspapers. They do not necessarily 
cover all that goes on in the minister's office. After reading and 
studying the advice, I came to the conclusions I stated on several 
occasions in this House. I think I cannot tell him much more than 
the truth.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister who again today 
reiterated his government's first priority is job creation. It is 
becoming increasingly clear to Canadians that the government 
does not have any coherent strategy for the creation of 
sustainable jobs.
<P>
	Past experience proves that government financed projects 
usually fail on two accounts. First, they do not create sustainable 
jobs and, second, they rob millions of tax dollars that could be 
used to prepare workers wishing to enter the new economy or 
could be used to assist the most vulnerable members of our 
society.
<P>
	When will the Prime Minister abandon his contradictory 
approach to job creation to increase spending on one hand and 
decrease spending on the other? When will he commit his 
government to reduce overall public spending so that taxes can 
be cut and the private sector can create real jobs for 1.6 million 
Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, as was indicated in the 
earlier question, I have just returned from a meeting of the G-7 
on jobs in Detroit and over the weekend a meeting of APEC, the 
fastest growing segment of the world's economy at the present 
time, dealing with many of the same issues.
<P>
	It was fascinating. The measures those fast growing countries 
are taking are exactly the ones that we outlined in our budget.
<P>
	What are they? They are a reduction of the cancer killing taxes 
on jobs such as unemployment insurance premiums. They are an 
encouragement to small and medium sized business, the major 
creator of jobs not only in this country but in all other countries. 
They are an encouragement of the newer technologies, networks 
for small businesses, access to new technologies, matching 
grants between universities and the private sector.
<P>
	We have set out a very clear jobs plan and that jobs plan is 
going to make this a much stronger country for Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad that the minister recognizes some of these 
cancers but one cancer he did not mention was funding for 
regional development.
<P>
	Last week Hyundai announced that its assembly plant in 
Bromont, Quebec, would remain closed indefinitely. This is a 
perfect example of a regional development project gone bad.
<P>
	Does the minister agree that the most effective and efficient 
way his government can create jobs is to stop influencing 
business decisions with short term public subsidies and instead 
encourage the private sector to get Canada back to work by 
getting public sector spending under control?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that 
getting public sector spending under control is a very important 
objec-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2539"> 2539 </A></B>
<P>
tive of any government. It certainly is of this government and 
our budget demonstrates that.
<P>
	In terms of subsidies to business, we undertook in the budget a 
very large reduction in subsidies to business that we deem to be 
counter-productive. It is in the budget. We have also said that 
we are continuing to look at the wide range of other ways in 
which government and business interact to make sure that there 
are no obstacles placed in the way of business.
<P>
	On the one issue that the member raised, all members in the 
House and certainly the members opposite feel very badly and 
are very disappointed by the decision of Hyundai to delay the 
reopening of its plant.
<P>
	The minister of human resources has already begun 
discussions with the laid-off workers at that plant to see what 
can be done. We as a government have begun discussions with 
Hyundai to see if there are other alternatives for the plant.
<P>
	When I was in a meeting with the APEC members, I had the 
opportunity to discuss that subject with the Minister of Finance 
of Korea. We are going to continue to watch it very closely.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the point we are trying to get across is that a little 
cutting of regional development grants is not the answer. We 
need to scrap the whole concept because it is not working.
<P>
	Let me illustrate with another example. This is out west and 
not in Quebec. A perfect example is the almost $4 million 
loaned to Myrias Research Corporation by Western 
Diversification to an Edmonton group in 1990. The final loan of 
more than $500,000 was made just two weeks before the 
company went into receivership, creating no jobs. Has the 
minister learned from the past administration that regional 
development is a huge waste of tax dollars and will he take steps 
to eliminate all federal regional development spending from our

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

and talk to the Minister of National Defence when certain base 
closures are occurring and then ask what is going to be done for 
that particular area, whether there is going to be regional 
development. Then they turn around and say we cannot do it 
generally.
<P>
	The fact is that this political party in opposition and now in 
government has said that we think a lot of regional development 
in this country has been applied to pork barrel grants to industry, 
grants to companies that do not need it, which simply makes no 
sense.
<P>
	That is why, and any one of the ministers can tell you that, the 
minister responsible for ACOA, the minister responsible for the 
western diversification fund, and the minister responsible for 
FORD-Q have completed a thorough re-evaluation of the way 
regional development was taking place, and we are not going to 
repeat the mistakes of the past.

is directed to the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	In this same article on Ginn Publishing in the Toronto <I>Star</I> we 
read: ``This was a deal cooked behind the scenes by lobbyists 
and officials''. We are told that it was lobbyists who threw the 
deal together on behalf of Paramount at a meeting with 
government representatives.
<P>
	Can the minister confirm that this infamous deal, partly 
written, partly verbal, which the government refuses to make 
public was made by a lobbyist acting on behalf of Paramount?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on this account I have to go by hearsay.
<P>
	This government was not in office and therefore we cannot 
give information which we ourselves do not have. I have of 
course retraced the statements which are to me, as I said, 
hearsay.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker I thank the 
minister for his answer. My additional question is directed to the 
Prime Minister.
<P>
	Since the <I>Toronto Star</I> is quoting sources from the Prime 
Minister's office to the effect that the Ginn Publishing mess is 
the result of secret dealings of lobbyists acting on behalf of 
private interests, does the Prime Minister recognize the urgent 
need to ensure through legislative action full openness with 
regard to the activities of such lobbyists?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker I 
do not know if there is a source like that. Senior staff in my 
office talk to me but nobody has talked to me about this problem.
<P>
	If that so-called very close source is one of mine, I would like 
to know the name. If the member has the name I ask him to give 
it to me. What is a source? I need a name.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberal campaign promises and the recent budget indicated that 
the government will increase the number of child care spaces 
once the real economic growth exceeds 3 per cent. The 
estimated cost to the Canadian taxpayer that I have seen for this 
is about $1.5 billion. I might add that expenditure amounts do 
not even reflect an increase in the estimates for 1995-1996.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Since the budget 
projects a 3 per cent growth rate, will the minister confirm the 
government's commitment to this $1.5 billion program?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
</B><B>Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the budget contains a 
projection for the expenditure on the day care spaces on the 
basis that we do expect growth will be 3 per cent or in excess 
thereof.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	Although we have provided for it, the spending on day care 
spaces is of course dependent upon agreement with the 
provinces. The spending on day care fulfils a multitude of 
purposes. Not only is it in itself an important creator of jobs, but 
it also permits a substantial segment of our society desirous of 
working the opportunity to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, just 
about anything can be spent in the name of jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	The investors, small businessmen and Canadian taxpayers 
would be more interested in understanding if our economy 
should grow at 3 per cent why the government would not prefer 
to pay down the deficit and pay some of the bills rather than 
create more child care spaces and spending $1.5 billion of 
taxpayers' money.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are substantial 
expenditure cuts within our budget.
<P>
	It does not take a close observation of the numbers to 
understand that we are not going to eliminate the deficit unless 
at the same time that we are cutting we are getting the economy 
going, creating jobs and getting some growth.
<P>
	Let me say one thing. We as a government have said that the 
major element of job creation is the private sector. The element 
of the private sector which is going to do that is small and 
medium sized business. The member opposite ought to realize 
that women entrepreneurs do the majority of successful 
start-ups in small and medium sized businesses. They are the 
ones who want the child care.

off more than 800 highly skilled workers whose average age is 
between 25 and 30.
<P>
	Given the scope of the federal grants awarded to the Hyundai 
automobile plant, what conditions did the government impose 
on the company to guarantee that it would reopen the Bromont 
facilities, thus preserving jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, this is a very valid 
question. As I stated in an earlier answer, we are extremely 
disappointed that Hyundai has delayed the reopening of its 
plant. The federal office has already begun discussions with 
Hyundai and the Minister of Industry also plans to take up this 
matter with the company. With respect to grants-and the 
question is perfectly relevant-we are now in the process of 
determining, along with the Government of Quebec, what our 
exact position on this matter will be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
says he is disappointed. Well, the people in my region are 
disappointed as well. Should Hyundai refuse to reopen its plant 
in Bromont, has the government considered another alternative 
which would at least preserve the 825 high-tech jobs now in 
Bromont?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

commission sales jobs in Ottawa and Toronto. From this effort 
Mr. Burge discovered that many respondents were unwilling to 
give up guaranteed unemployment insurance benefits and risk 
the uncertainty of a commission sales job. Many jobs in the new 
economy will be commission or performance based.
<P>
	In view of what the government said at the G-7 meeting, will 
the minister respond to the evidence that the UI system 
discourages recipients from taking commission jobs? Could he 
tell the House what he intends to do to fix UI in this regard?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to

question is for the Prime Minister and it pertains to the Collège

<P>
	It is now obvious that the decision to close this college was 
misguided. However, we recognize that the closure is part of a

extremely difficult financial situation. That is why many of us, 
including the Government of Quebec, have called for a

<P>

the military college in Saint-Jean will not be closed until the end

	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, on the initiative of the Association of 
French-speaking Parliamentarians, a reception was held here on 
Parliament Hill to mark the beginning of the Semaine de la 
Francophonie. Representatives of various Canadian 
organizations dealing with the Francophonie came from across 
Canada.
<P>
	A number of Canadian personalities who have distinguished 
themselves in this country by working in different ways and in 
different communities to promote the French fact were 
honoured. We were especially happy to have among us at this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2546"> 2546 </A></B>
<P>
ceremony the Prime Minister of Canada, who received the 
honourary award of the Francophonie and who is a proud 
representative of Canada's French-speaking community.
<P>
	Allow me today in this House, at the first opportunity I have 
had since the beginning of this Semaine de la Francophonie, to 
remind members of some interesting historic facts.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	As hon. members know, the heads of state and government 
summit held at Chaillot Palace in Paris in 1991 ratified the 
proposal for an international Francophonie day and expressed 
the wish that each of the 47 states and governments forming the 
so-called Francophone community celebrate this day 
individually and at their convenience. It was officially set for 
March 20, the date on which was founded the Cultural and 
Technical Co-operation Agency, the first francophone 
intergovernmental organization, whose secretary general in the 
last few years has been a distinguished Canadian, Jean-Louis 
Roy.
<P>
	We are very proud to take part in this day and thus show that 
we belong to the Francophonie. As active members of this 
multilateral group, we will continue to promote the basic values 
dear to all Canadians such as democracy, human rights, 
women's equality, child welfare, education and training. The 
francophone community includes over 400 million men and 
women scattered all over the globe.
<P>
	The Francophonie is an integral part of Canada's foreign 
policy. We intend to continue playing an active role and 
contributing in various ways, so that all francophone and 
francophile Canadians continue to benefit from this window on 
the world and the fruitful contacts we maintain in many 
French-speaking countries throughout the world.
<P>
	By being a member of the Francophonie, Canada also shows 
the rest of the world the unique features of Canadian reality. The 
Canadian Francophonie speaks with many accents. It starts out 
in the sandy dunes of New Brunswick, goes up the St. Lawrence 
River, and ends up in the western plains. During their travels, 
our francophones took on the accents of Antonine Maillet, Anne 
Hébert, and Gabrielle Roy. Far from resting on their laurels, our 
francophones now speak with new accents such as the Creole 
intonations of those who found refuge on these North American 
shores.
<P>
	Canadians show solidarity with all the people of the world 
who use French to communicate, exchange ideas and better 
understand one another.
<P>
	It is in this spirit that I invite all Canadians and their elected 
representatives in this House and in legislatures with a large 
number of francophones, be it in Quebec, New Brunswick, 
Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, or even British Columbia, 
for there are many francophones on Canada's West Coast.
<P>
	So, on this day and week celebrating the Francophonie, I 
would urge all my colleagues in the House of Commons, 
particularly the members of the Bloc Quebecois, to realize that 
the French language is alive and well in Canada. It is not 
endangered as some members opposite would like us to believe. 
On the contrary! The French fact is strongly and brilliantly 
defended throughout Canada and reaches out around the world.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, today it is 
a great honour and a great source of pride for the Bloc Quebecois 
to draw the attention of the House to la Journée mondiale de la 
Francophonie.
<P>
	For Quebec and for all francophones in the rest of Canada, 
whose common destiny is necessarily linked to that of the 
Francophonie, this is a particularly memorable day.
<P>
	Incidentally, this anniversary coincides with that of the 
founding of the Agence de coopération culturelle et technique, 
the first francophone intergovernmental organization.
<P>
	Quebec's participation in this international body illustrates 
that in matters concerning the Francophonie, as in all other 
matters, especially when they concern our identity and cultural 
ambience, as the Leader of the Official Opposition mentioned 
earlier, it is important to run our own affairs.
<P>
	Promoting the French fact also means promoting our viability 
as a community, and in this respect, we have no outside allies 
other than the solidarity of francophone countries.
<P>
	We must remember that the destiny of francophones outside 
Quebec should not be dissociated from the affirmation of 
Quebec's identity, because our community owes its survival to 
its will to endure as a people. This solidarity among 
francophones in Canada must be strengthened.
<P>
	Canada's francophone communities must not only survive, 
they must also be able to develop their cultural, economic and 
social potential in their own language.
<P>
	The situation is not reassuring. Everywhere in Canada and 
even in Quebec, the position of French is precarious. 
Twenty-five years of official and individual bilingualism have 
not been able to stop the assimilation of francophones. 
Bilingualism is still too often a Francophone that speaks 
English.
<P>
	It is also a fact that Canada's provinces have ignored the 
rights of their francophone minorities. Even worse, in a number 
of provinces, francophone communities are considered just 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2547"> 2547 </A></B>
<P>
another ethnic community, a situation that was aggravated by 
the federal government's support for multiculturalism.
<P>
	The closing of Collège militaire in Saint-Jean also brought to 
the fore the case of the French high school in Kingston, which is 
located in a building without washrooms or running water. 
Reality can be pretty grim!
<P>
	When the Minister of Foreign Affairs says that to Canada, 
belonging to the Francophonie also means revealing to the rest 
of the world what is unique about Canada's situation, one 
wonders what situation he is talking about!
<P>
	The Forum international de la Francophonie, which includes 
47 countries from all continents, must continue to develop and 
make itself heard. This applies to all areas, including education, 
for instance, where the association of partially or fully French 
language universities, whose headquarters is in Montreal, does 
remarkable work, and also to the information technology sector 
and all other economic and cultural sectors.
<P>
	I think that although it is appropriate to celebrate this 
international day of the Francophonie, we must not forget that 
we still have a long way to go, especially here in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Reform Party of Canada recognizes the Journée internationale 
de la Francophonie, that was officially celebrated yesterday, 
March 20.
<P>
	Our party, being a party of the people, recognizes on this day 
that 23 per cent of Canadians are francophones.
<P>
	At the same time, we realize that Canadians are part of la 
Francophonie, a worldwide group of 400 million people.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	Canada is a fortunate country. Despite our financial problems, 
we continue to provide assistance to other countries, but our 
help does not necessarily involve money.
<P>
	We agree with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who just said 
that Canada will continue to promote the fundamental values 
dear to all Canadians such as democracy, human rights, 
women's equality, child welfare, education and training. By 
supporting these values in other countries, we hope to reinforce 
them at home.
<P>
	We congratulate francophones from Canada and other 
countries around the world on this international day of la 
Francophonie.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I believe the hon. member 
for Kamloops had the floor prior to question period. We will go 
directly to questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have two questions for my hon. colleague.
<P>
	I was disappointed, assuming that I heard or interpreted the 
comments attributed to the Bloc Quebecois correctly, that it sort 
of washed its hands of this. It really did not matter because the 
Bloc did not expect to around the next time.
<P>
	I have told the Bloc on several occasions that it has a 
responsibility to represent all Canadians. This bill is coming 
forward now and I would argue, and I would like my colleague's 
comments on this, that it has a responsibility to treat this 
seriously and not take its own myopic view and simply say it 
may not be around. It could go poof by the next election. That is 
my first comment.
<P>
	My second is a question which is very simple and precise. In 
the 34th Parliament I had suggested that perhaps this 
Parliament, that is, l'ensemble des députés, should look at the 
possibility of significantly reducing the number of MPs. Would 
this not be a wonderful opportunity to see whether we could do 
with one-quarter or perhaps one-third fewer MPs?
<P>
	I would like to get my colleague's reaction. I think that 
Canadians would applaud such a move. It would mean a 
significant saving. For the record, I did make that request in the 
34th Parliament. Perhaps it will be more easily supported in this, 
the 35th Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will answer my colleague's second 
question first.
<P>
	I believe there is some merit in the proposal he raised in the 
last Parliament. It brings to mind a private member's bill that 
was put forward by my colleague then, the member for 
Yorkton-Melville. My colleague for Regina-Lumsden spoke 
to me about that earlier. It would have reduced the number of 
seats by about 60, I believe, about 20 per cent.
<P>
	Again, this idea of a political party open to at least the 
suggestion of not only capping the seats in the House of 
Commons but actually reducing the number is something that 
we pursued in the past. It is the kind of thing that we would 
certainly be open to now in the discussions, assuming that this 
bill goes on to committee.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	In terms of the hon. member's comment regarding my friends 
in the Bloc, it was a good point. Over the past few weeks as this 
Parliament has unfolded one of the points I have noticed is there 
seemed to be a rather restricted geographic base of interest from 
my friends in the Bloc, tending to focus on issues that were more 
related to Quebec than perhaps to other parts of Canada. That 
seems to be a theme that has developed over a period of time.
<P>
	The speaker from the Bloc made his points earlier and there 
seems to be almost a preoccupation with Quebec issues. It is not 
surprising for me, recognizing the mandate that the members 
have interpreted for themselves. I assumed that there was some 
inconsistency.
<P>
	I take the suggestion by my hon. friend from St. Boniface 
seriously. Perhaps it is a reflection that the Bloc is widening its 
terms of reference as it interprets being the Official Opposition 
to represent issues far beyond the borders of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
following the comments made by the hon. member for 
Kamloops, I want to say that we made no secret of our 
sovereignist option and of the fact that we constantly promote 
that option for Quebec. Also, we will never resort to the 
scorched-earth policy. The seats we occupy do not belong to us: 
we are trustees. I fully agree with that observation made by the 
hon. member for Calgary West. Until last October 25, we had a 
government which thought that the whole country belonged to 
it. Look at what is left of that government now.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2549"> 2549 </A></B>
<P>
	It is in this responsible fashion that the Official Opposition 
intends to continue to work on Bill C-18, which deals with 
electoral boundaries readjustment. This legislation might be in 
effect for the next general election, whether Quebec is still 
present or not.
<P>
	I think it is a matter of responsibility for parliamentarians, 
regardless of their political affiliation, to participate in the 
business of the House. In my opinion, given this notion of 
responsibility, a party which would sit back and refuse to take 
part in the work of the House because of a political option or 
some bias, would certainly deserve to be blamed.
<P>
	As I said earlier, as long as we are here, we intend to defend 
the interests of Canadians from coast to coast, all the way up to 
the Arctic. This must be very clear, and if we have to repeat it, 
we will constantly repeat it, being understood of course that our 
primary objective is Quebec's sovereignty.
<P>
	However, we are not the ones who will decide; the decision 
rests with Quebeckers. It is Quebec voters who, on referendum 
day, will decide their future, in the polling booth.
<P>
	Whatever their decision, we must respect it. We believe and 
we hope that they will say yes, and in fact we will work for a yes 
vote for sovereignty, for empowerment, for the opening of 
Quebec to the world, to the francophonie and to the 
English-speaking world and all other cultures of course. If, 
unfortunately, we cannot reach our goal from the seat we occupy 
here and if others take over, we will have to work to ensure that it 
happens later, in the best possible manner.
<P>
	We are here to promote Quebec's evolution in the context of a 
mature political context, and it makes me very sad every time I 
hear expressions such as ``break up'' or ``collapse'' in reference 
to Canada. We do not want to break anything other than political 
structures. Does the redefinition of Canada's political structures 
mean the breaking up of anything? Was there any mention of a 
``collapse'' when the Canadian Constitution was rewritten in 
1840, then in 1867, in 1931, and finally in 1982? No, rather we 
talked about affirmation. When Canada became sovereign, we 
celebrated. When Quebec becomes sovereign, we should also 
celebrate.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to my friend with some 
interest. First of all he says he is a separatist and that he is 
promoting separatism or sovereignty association or whatever. 
That is fine. I think it is a moot point.
<P>
	He says that he wants his party to act as the Official 
Opposition. I do not think there is any question that if we did a 
content analysis of the questions asked by my friends in the Bloc 
we would find overwhelmingly that those questions are focused 
geographically.
<P>
	I do not recall many questions being raised about the west 
coast fishery, about the problems in the Arctic region, about 
agriculture on the prairies, about the Atlantic fishery, the fixed 
link with P.E.I, energy and mines. I hope this is a new trend that 
we will see. I would encourage my colleagues to take up the role 
of Official Opposition in a more appropriate way than they have 
in the past.
<P>
	However, to listen to my friend talk about dismembering 
Canada as we know it and to say that this is not breaking up the 
country is mixing up our words somewhat. In a family when a 
piece of the family leaves, we talk about breaking up the family. 
When one loses a limb, one is obviously breaking up one's body 
somewhat.
<P>
	To take a major part of Canada and separate it into a sovereign 
nation and say that is not breaking up Canada is a misuse of the 
term.
<P>
	We should recognize that the fundamental purpose, as my 
colleague has indicated, of the Bloc in the House is to separate 
the province of Quebec from Canada, which in my terminology 
would be breaking up the country that we have known for the 
past 126 years in a formal sense.
<P>
	It is a mixture of terminology. Perhaps some of it gets mixed 
up in the translation, but in my mind it is very clear what is going 
on. I do not support the Bloc in its fundamental mandate, but I do 
find encouragement in the fact that it says it is going to take on 
the role of Official Opposition in a more generous way in the 
future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the thoughtful remarks of the hon. member for 
Kamloops on this subject.
<P>
	I want to raise a couple of points with him. I appreciate the 
dissatisfaction that exists in interior British Columbia. I have 
had the opportunity, not in a great deal of detail, to review some 
of the proposed maps from the commission and certainly 
interior British Columbia has some of the stranger proposals. 
Some of them are unusual. Most are fairly standard types of 
proposals.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member for Kamloops would agree it would 
be appropriate in the interim to point his constituents toward the 
fact that the commission will be holding hearings in Kamloops 
on May 24. I am sure he will do that.
<P>
	One thing he raised in his speech that I want to bring forward 
concerns the legislative program of the government. Does he 
find it unusual that we are discussing electoral boundaries when 
the budget is yet to be discussed, the omnibus budget bill, 
unemployment insurance concerns? Does he find that this is a 
strange example of parliamentary priorities in his long 
experience here?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Mr. Speaker, to my colleague from Calgary West I 
want to say that one of the very first things I did when I saw the 
map was call a press conference and urge my constituents to 
write, serve notice that they would want to be interveners during 
the hearings on the new boundaries because they were so odd 
and so peculiar.
<P>
	In terms of priority, my hon. colleague from Calgary West 
pointed out that part of the theme of this new government is to 
consult, to discuss, to study, to examine and to review. As a 
matter of fact, all we have really done so far is initiate reviews, 
studies and examinations of just about every conceivable area of 
responsibility for the federal government.
<P>
	I suspect this is part of that thesis, although when we consider 
the priorities of the country we would have to look long and hard 
to find Canadians that would say the process we use for 
determining the boundaries of federal electoral districts is 
something that ought to be reviewed and given some priority.
<P>
	I find myself in agreement with my friend that this is an odd 
priority. What is perhaps more odd is that it has come so quickly 
and out of nowhere.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to add some fresh thoughts on our debate about the 
proposed suspension of the operation of the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act.
<P>
	I wonder if we should consider starting from the premise that 
this Parliament ought to interfere in due process set up by 
Parliament only for some clearly stated public policy purpose.
<P>
	What concerns some of us in the House very much is that the 
purpose of this interference has not at all been stated. There is 
absolutely nothing in the bill that says what we are hoping to 
achieve by suspension of the process that has been in effect now 
for many months.
<P>
	The proposed bill is entirely silent on important elements that 
would provide some direction and also that would allow the 
citizens we serve to evaluate the merits of the process. Other 
speakers have stated clearly, and I would agree, that the effects 
of the present process are somewhat undesirable.
<P>
	I represent the riding of Calgary North. It is the largest riding 
in terms of voter population in the province of Alberta, with 
over 94,000 electors. It is growing very quickly. New 
communities are being built up rapidly and the boundaries of the 
riding are expanding.
<P>
	This commission in its initial proposal which was mailed to 
the electors in my riding did not just take away a portion of the 
riding, which is the largest riding in Alberta and growing. 
Obviously part of it will have to go somewhere else. The 
commission ripped the thing in half and gave me a chunk of 
someone else's riding. Not only did this disrupt the sense of 
community that the riding has enjoyed for a while but it also 
took away a part of  another sense of community that has been 
built up in another riding.
<P>
	There would not be any problem with taking away from the 
largest riding in Alberta, but to do that on one hand and then give 
me part of another one does not make a whole lot of sense in my 
view and in the view of many of my constituents. The concern 
that has been stated on all sides of the House is the tendency of 
the commission to violate the sense of community that has been 
built up. I would suggest that this is a valid concern.
<P>
	If we are going to have our citizens participating in the 
political process in a meaningful way then the provisions of the 
act that instruct the commission to respect the community of 
interest, to look at geographic criteria should have been more 
closely followed by the commission. I think that is a valid 
criticism.
<P>
	The problem is that we have identified the problem but not the 
solution. What we are doing in this case is taking away an 
important element that would help us to identify solutions. That 
would be to proceed with the public hearings which have been 
scheduled to begin in a couple of weeks across the country for 
which many of our citizens are preparing.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kamloops has just stated that in his 
riding citizens have already been preparing for those hearings. 
Here we are at the very last second pulling the rug out from 
under this process and not allowing the citizens of the country to 
help us move in better directions if we are agreed that we do 
need different directions.
<P>
	I believe there is some real virtue in moving on to permit these 
public views to be heard, to assist parliamentarians who 
represent the citizens of the country, to look at the process, to 
adjust it so that the results are more desirable for all of us and to 
open the process up to that kind of input.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	It could be very beneficial for us as parliamentarians to have 
the views of other citizens in the country who are directly 
affected by the work of the commission. It would also ensure 
that any future rules that were proposed were not open to the 
charge that has been made by other speakers in today's debate 
that the process has been interfered with in a partisan, unfair or 
inappropriate manner.
<P>
	I believe that if we let the public speak on this situation the 
public would bring up the very same concerns that we in 
Parliament have, perhaps with an added perspective, definitely 
with a different credibility. I would urge the government to 
consider seriously whether this process should go ahead. I 
recommend that it does.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2551"> 2551 </A></B>
<P>
	The process that is set up under the Electoral Boundaries 
Readjustment Act is represented as being independent of 
political influence, and so it should be. Some speakers today 
have registered a concern that in stopping this present process 
and not putting in a clear process today that could be evaluated, 
political influence is a definite possibility in the future.
<P>
	I would suggest that the House, if it wishes to maintain the 
confidence of the Canadian public, should protect that principle 
of independence by commissions that are engaged in these types 
of exercises and that we ought to affirm that principle of 
independence. Whatever we do in the House or whatever the 
government does to affect the process must clearly protect the 
integrity of the process rather than leave it open to even a 
suspicion that there can be partisan tinkering with it.
<P>
	Unfortunately no safeguards are proposed in the legislation to 
address this very legitimate concern. That is one of the reasons, 
in spite of the disagreement that members of the House have 
with the commission's initial proposals, we feel that the present 
action of the government in simply putting a stop to the whole 
process without safeguards, without any clear direction, is 
inappropriate and why we do not support the bill that is before us 
today.
<P>
	In Calgary hearings by the commission have been scheduled 
for April 20. We have urged citizens there to make their 
proposals known. We hope that this kind of participation can 
still take place. If the government, after today's debate, after 
hearing some of the concerns and suggestions from other 
members of the House, will allow those hearings to proceed it 
will encourage participation of the public in what is happening 
with redistribution.
<P>
	There have been many suggestions made today that the people 
of Canada do not want to pay more members of Parliament. 
Some people have been so unkind as to suggest that some 
members of the public feel that the 295 we have today are not 
entirely worth their pay. I am sure that is not true but it has been 
suggested by some.
<P>
	If it is true that the people of Canada do not want to see an 
increase in the number of members of the House, the number of 
members representing and governing them, we ought to give 
them an opportunity to air this concern. That would be another 
purpose of the public hearings that we feel should not be stopped 
but should go ahead.
<P>
	The suggestion has been made in the House but there really 
has been no opportunity for the members of the public to make 
this suggestion. Perhaps if they were allowed to speak they 
would be happy to have more of us doing the fine job that we are 
doing. However, if they do not feel that way they should be 
allowed to say so clearly and to the proper body.
<P>
	I want to emphasize that this exercise of electoral 
redistribution and the public hearings that accompany it really 
go to the root of the democratic principle of representation. In a 
democracy we abide by the principle  of one person, one vote. 
That is a very important principle of democracy. That means that 
our proportional representation has to be unified across the 
country.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	The redistribution that is necessary because of fluctuations in 
population is important and the exercise that surrounds this 
redistribution is important because it touches this very 
fundamental proposition of one person, one vote, a proportional 
representation.
<P>
	I would emphasize that we ought not to interfere with this 
exercise lightly because of the very fundamental principles that 
it speaks to. I think the people of Canada would have a right to be 
concerned if a government used its majority against the wishes 
of all members of the House, of all representatives of the people, 
to interfere in a very fundamental democratic exercise without 
having the opportunity for people to speak themselves.
<P>
	I would suggest that rather than exercising our power as 
legislators to pass judgment on the proposals of the commission, 
although we are certainly entitled to state our concerns and 
opinions and would be free to do so in the commission hearings, 
that instead we use our responsibilities as leaders to ensure full 
and fair public debate and review of the commission's 
proposals.
<P>
	I think that would be the service that we should render to the 
public rather than simply using our own unilateral judgment to 
put a stop to the exercise of the commission's jurisdiction.
<P>
	I think that we as legislators also have a responsibility to 
ensure that the commission respects the provisions of section 15 
of the present Electoral Boundaries Redistribution Act which 
mandates that they look at community and geographic 
considerations and some of the things that we could argue have 
been violated in the initial proposals of the commission.
<P>
	However, I would emphasize that these are initial proposals 
only, that they are not written in stone. They are, presumably 
and certainly ostensibly, open to public input and public 
influence. I would suggest that we allow that process to go 
ahead.
<P>
	In summary I believe there are public policy reasons to 
re-examine the present process. It is clear that there is a lot of 
unhappiness both in terms of the growing numbers of MPs that 
have been suggested and in terms of the violation of community 
and the sense of cohesion that has been built up in many areas 
through political involvement.
<P>
	However, I believe that this process should be carefully and 
thoughtfully considered and rather than just throwing out $5 
million worth of work today that we give some clear direction 
when we do change the process and that the changes be proposed 
only when they have been properly framed and not just on ``we 
don't like this, we don't know what we like, but we are not going 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2552"> 2552 </A></B>
<P>
to  go ahead with this'', especially without the public being able 
to speak on this.
<P>
	With that recommendation I urge members of the House to 
support our proposed amendment to this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member for Calgary North has made an 
interesting speech based on the principle of public 
representation, arguing that the people should be able to make 
representations on how the new federal ridings would be 
redistributed.
<P>
	I think this is an excellent point and it would be great if all the 
various communities within a riding were homogenous instead 
of having totally divergent interests as is often the case at 
present.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member for Calgary North the 
following question. You can see the size of this chamber. A few 
years ago, ten, fifty, a hundred years ago, there certainly were 
not 295 members sitting here. Not so long ago, there were about 
250. There used to be 200 and, before that, perhaps 150. Today, 
we are 295 and we are about to add another six, at a cost of 
approximately $9 million, $10 million or $12 million.
<P>
	So, I can see two problems. One is that, at this rate, there will 
come a point, in 2050 or 2090, where this chamber will no longer 
be large enough to hold all the new members. Walls will have to 
be moved back to make room for the extra seats that will have to 
be made. If you look to the south, in the United States, they have 
only 100 senators for a total population of about 250 million.
<P>
	My riding is huge. It is currently the fourth largest of all urban 
and rural ridings in Canada, and I am not complaining. I am 
rather proud of it. I think that there is a way, when you how, to 
represent your riding well and not lose touch with the 
community.
<P>
	I am sure that the hon. member has noticed that in Prince 
Edward Island, they have ridings-and I do not mean any 
disrespect; I am merely stating a fact-which are no larger than 
certain neighbourhoods in cities like Calgary or here, in the 
Ottawa area. They have four members of Parliament 
representing 135,000 people, and I do mean people as opposed 
to voters. There are probably no more than 20,000 to 25,000 
voters in some of these ridings, and even that is generous. Now, 
there is a problem there, but the province and its right to be 
represented have to be respected. This is a case where we would 
have to refer to the Constitution.
<P>
	For those of us from other parts of the country where there are 
no such guarantees, is this room not getting a little crowded? 
And have our national debt and public debt not grown so much 
that we should act to curb the growth of the number of elected 
members?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before I give the floor to 
the hon. member for Calgary North, I know it is the beginning of 
the week and possibly I have been a little more generous with the 
time than I should be, but I do want to give the opportunity to 
each and every member who wishes to speak to this issue that 
opportunity in the next few hours or however long the debate 
might go on. I understood that members are sharing time in tens 
and fives and I think if we were to check the times we would find 
that we have rather extended those quite generously.
<P>
	In all fairness to the very good question following an 
interesting intervention by the member for Calgary North, I 
would ask the member for Calgary North if she would not mind 
just giving the House at this moment the short version and 
possibly she may want to discuss the matter more fully with her 
colleague at a later time so that we can get the debate back on 
track within the confines of the time limitations we put on one 
another.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> On a point of order, Mr. 
Speaker. I should have indicated to you a few minutes ago that 
Reform members are not presently sharing their time. I had 
indicated that in a discussion with your predecessor and I guess 
that information was not passed on. There was some lack of 
clarity on that.
<P>
	I do not know how you want to proceed with this particular 
speaker, but after this speaker I do not think for the time being 
we will be sharing our time. We will not be sharing our time.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I apologize to all 
members in the House, and particularly to the member for 
Calgary North and the member for Carleton-Gloucester.
<P>
	I understand now very clearly from the member for Calgary 
West that Reform members participating in the debate will not 
be sharing their time but in fact will take the full 20 minute 
complement followed by 10 minutes of questions and 
comments. Is that correct?
<P>
	The member for Calgary North has more time than I had first 
indicated.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, we probably owe you an 
apology for not communicating directly to you on that point. I 
am sure that members of the House will be absolutely delighted 
to know that I can now give them the long answer to the hon. 
member's question rather than the short answer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2553"> 2553 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe his points were well taken. With respect to Prince 
Edward Island, now that the causeway is going ahead perhaps 
the population of that area of the country will increase to justify 
more representation.
<P>
	I believe his comment with respect to other countries, 
particularly our neighbour to the south, is very interesting and 
very appropriate where a much larger population appears to be 
well served. In fact, some people think it is still over-served by 
a much lesser number of representatives than we have here in 
Canada. I believe that their Congress is not a whole lot bigger 
than our House of Commons even though they have 10 times the 
population. That is one argument I have certainly heard 
advanced by many Canadians against expanding the 
membership of this Chamber.
<P>
	I would like to touch on another aspect of this in response to 
the hon. member's question as to whether we really need more 
representatives. I think this goes to the root and scope of our 
representation here in the Canadian Parliament. On this side of 
the House we have argued rather strenuously and will continue 
to argue that the scope of our representation in this Chamber is 
very circumscribed. In other words, we really do not have the 
freedom we think is necessary to represent the wishes and 
directives of our constituents as should be available in a 
representative democracy through things like free votes. Quite 
often we find in the House members are voting and acting in 
accordance with strict directives from their party.
<P>
	If that is going to continue to be the case, I would suggest that 
indeed there could be fewer of us simply responding to 
directives from the executive portion of our party. If we are 
going to truly solicit and actively represent the concerns and 
wishes and directives of our constituents then we would have 
much more legitimacy, especially with respect to numbers than 
we do today.
<P>
	Last, I would like to point out to the hon. member that 
although I agree with his contention that we ought not to 
increase the numbers in this Chamber, and as he rightly points 
out there are even physical limitations on that today, this bill 
makes absolutely no commitment to do that. There is nothing in 
this bill that says we are going to turn this back to committee 
with a view to ensuring that the number of members in this 
Chamber does not increase.
<P>
	That is a real concern. I would say to the hon. member that for 
that reason I would urge him to support the amendment we have 
made to give a period of time so that those very specific 
directions can be built into the bill and then the bill can be 
brought back. We know where we are going and we know what 
we want to achieve. It is clearly stated and we can go forward on 
a much more solid basis that is open to evaluation and debate 
rather than just throwing the thing wide open again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the hon. member for Calgary North for her comments. The hon. 
member for Calgary North and I and other members of the 
Reform caucus from Calgary have been co-operating on a 
submission to be made to the public hearings in Calgary on April 
20. We certainly appreciate her efforts in that regard and also the 
fact that she has really been in the forefront of making sure that 
her constituents are aware of this and are able to participate in 
the process.
<P>
	The question I would like to ask the hon. member for Calgary 
North flows from the previous comment from the hon. member 
for Carleton-Gloucester. So far today every speaker has 
indicated a desire to see the number of MPs capped or even 
reduced. Certainly nobody seems to be saying they want the 
number of MPs increased.
<P>
	Blocking the public hearing process will not accomplish that. 
In fact, having the public hearing process will not accomplish it 
either because it is not a matter of the boundaries commission. It 
is a matter of the formula to which the House in conjunction with 
the Senate could make some alterations.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	This whole process could be facilitated if we could agree on 
the issue of capping the number of MPs. I am curious as to 
whether the hon. member has observed the same thing in debate. 
Why does she believe the government is so reluctant to make 
this commitment if there seems to be support for this kind of 
measure from all sides of the House. I am sure she is hearing the 
same thing from some of her constituents.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the points we have been 
making is that we want a commitment in this bill to cap the 
number of members of Parliament.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Calgary West rightly points out this 
would be within the purview of the House of Commons through 
an amendment to section 51 of the Constitution. This House has 
the jurisdiction to make that amendment because it pertains to a 
federal matter.
<P>
	In speaking with other members and particularly government 
members, we have urged a commitment like that to be built into 
this process or a review of the process. I want to emphasize that 
this has not been done. This is very disturbing to me as a 
representative of electors. I have no idea why this could not have 
been done and was not done.
<P>
	It does raise the question as to how serious the government is 
about capping or committing not to increase the number of 
members. Rather than just taking a chance on a proper proposal 
or a commitment coming out of a new process, it would be far 
better to make that commitment right up front as a condition of 
going in a different direction with the process rather than hoping 
that somehow it comes out of talks within the House or in 
committees in the next few months.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2554"> 2554 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
1993 election Canadians from small rural towns to large urban 
centres told whoever would listen they wanted a reduction in the 
size and cost of government. They continue to expect their 
elected representatives to provide leadership on this issue. By 
not listening the government is failing yet again to provide that 
leadership Canadians are seeking.
<P>
	The government as a minimum must review the process by 
which representation takes place if it is to demonstrate it takes 
the wishes of the electorate seriously. Most certainly the number 
of seats in this House must be capped.
<P>
	I recognize that electoral riding boundaries are not frozen for 
all time, nor should they be. Changes in population distribution 
often render electoral boundaries obsolete requiring them to be 
changed. However, changes should be made with one important 
element in mind: This country cannot afford any more members 
of Parliament. What it needs are parliamentary reforms that will 
make the system and the MPs we do have more effective in 
carrying out their roles in the House.
<P>
	One of the most important of those reforms is Senate reform. 
An elected Senate would ensure that regional interests are 
effectively balanced against the electoral distribution we now 
have, one that is heavily weighted in favour of central Canada. 
An equal, elected and effective Senate is what Canada needs, not 
more MPs. The long range interest of Canadian federalism, a 
reformed Senate, must be put ahead of short term expediency, 
more MPs. Reforming the Senate is the kind of long range 
planning Canadians expect from government.
<P>
	The 35th Parliament must take a leadership role in 
demonstrating we are seriously heeding the wishes of Canadians 
and that we are acting on their advice. The bill before us today 
should therefore be rejected by all members who respond 
directly to the wishes of their electorate.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	Like a number of other government programs the exact cost of 
yet another proposal to possibly add more members of 
Parliament cannot be calculated.
<P>
	For example the government has yet to deal with the cost of 
MPs pensions. While we support the government's intention to 
review MPs pensions, we cannot endorse the mixed message 
this bill sends to Canadians. Where is the government's 
commitment to control and limit spending? Let us be clear and 
provide consistent messages to Canadians because they are not 
only listening but they are also watching.
<P>
	We support a federal democratically elected government that 
provides equity to all regions through a reasonable alignment of 
boundaries. Equity is better served through downsizing than 
through upsizing.
<P>
	Given that the government cannot fund all of our current 
expenditures out of revenues, it falls to our lenders to fund with 
interest these additional costs. It is becoming a very scary part 
of Canadian government that our lenders are funding with 
interest those activities and actions we wish to pursue in this 
House.
<P>
	In recent years the trend in corporate communities has been to 
become more efficient. Companies in the nineties have become 
slim and trim to give better services with decreased overhead. 
When will the government learn to look to the private sector to 
see where it is going and what it is doing? There are many 
lessons to be learned there.
<P>
	I do not understand how the government is going to create 
jobs for Canadians when it has no concept of what is going on in 
the private sector. I certainly met no one during the 1993 
election campaign who felt that job creation meant more jobs for 
MPs.
<P>
	We are clearly over governed. We have three levels of 
government. Among the three levels of government there are 
thousands of elected representatives. The House of Commons 
has 295 MPs representing some 28 million people. This works 
out to approximately 94,915 Canadians for every member of 
Parliament.
<P>
	The Prime Minister likes to make comparisons between 
Canada and the United States. I agree with the Prime Minister 
that we look outside of Canada for comparisons to measure our 
own performance.
<P>
	In the United States there are 435 congressmen in the House 
of Representatives and 100 senators. This totals only 535 
representatives for some 250 million Americans. This works out 
to one elected representative for every 467,300 Americans. I 
have not heard of any support from Americans to increase their 
levels of representation by 497 per cent to bring them in line 
with the level of representation provided for in Canada. This per 
capita comparison clearly shows that we do not need more MPs; 
we probably could do with less.
<P>
	Until there is a comprehensive review of Canada's electoral 
needs as we approach the 21st century and an accompanying 
strategic plan, there should be a moratorium on changes to 
electoral boundaries. The government should guarantee there 
will not be an increase in the number of seats in Parliament. The 
notion of simply adding MPs as the population grows lacks any 
vision regarding representation.
<P>
	A move toward a downsized and elected Senate will stabilize 
representation at a lower cost. Making senators accountable to 
their constituents will allow a further reduction in the number of 
MPs required to provide greater voter representation than that 
found in most other democracies.

<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	The government has suggested that a parliamentary panel 
should study the redistribution and size of Parliament. This 
suggestion causes the people of Canada, and I am one of them, 
great concern. They have been left out of the decision making 
process long enough.
<P>
	It is time government recognized that Canadians are not 
satisfied to sit idly by and let politicians make decisions without 
consulting them. The government says it is committed to an 
open and honest style of governance. Yet at every turn it is 
calling for councils, panels and committees that do not include 
nor are open to the public.
<P>
	It is not up to current members of Parliament to put forward 
proposals to alter constituency boundaries for future elections. 
When a redistribution takes place on a large scale the House of 
Commons frequently rings out with what one MP, Mr. C. G. 
Power, frankly described as an unseemly, undignified and 
utterly confusing scramble for personal or political advantage.
<P>
	Since 1892 Tory governments have proposed committees to 
redistribute electoral ridings and the Liberals have opposed 
them. Conversely, Liberal governments have proposed 
committees to redistribute electoral ridings and the Tories have 
opposed them. The opposition premise was that the committees 
were only serving the interests of the government.
<P>
	Remember the 34th Parliament and how the Liberals objected 
to an expanded Senate. The Senate has not brought any 
improvement to Canadian representation. The Liberal 
opposition of the day argued that electoral boundary changes 
would only benefit those on the committee deciding the 
changes. Why have the Liberals now so dramatically changed 
their position? They are now proposing yet another committee 
with a mandate to study electoral boundary changes which 
would likely recommend increases, not decreases, to the number 
of MPs.
<P>
	I am not opposing out of my own self-interest. I oppose 
electoral boundary redistribution because I want to ensure there 
will be no new seats and preferably fewer than we have today. 
This is what the constituents I represent are telling me. Further, 
this exercise by parliamentarians does not include the public 
beyond broader based review nor does it have the popular 
support of the public.
<P>
	We are calling for the government to adopt a procedure that 
cannot be accused of being partisan. Electoral boundary changes 
must only be implemented if they will benefit Canadians.
<P>
	There were calls for non-partisan redistribution prior to the 
BNA Act, 1867. Those wishes still have not been satisfied. We 
in the Reform Party are bringing to the House those popular 
wishes, wishes that government in this country have failed to 
listen to for 127 years.
<P>
	I ask the House to support our amendment.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to address the part of the hon. member's speech 
where she was comparing our system with the American system.
<P>
	I have spoken to a lot of American congressmen and women in 
the last five years. I have often talked to them about the size of 
their constituencies.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned the American constituencies 
were about five times larger than ours. They are about 500,000 
on average compared to our 100,000. What the hon. member 
failed to mention is that the size of their staff ranges from 18 to 
25 workers. One will find that is an increase of 5 per cent.
<P>
	In making a comparison therefore we should be comparing the 
whole picture. Sure their constituencies are larger in that they 
have 500,000 to our 100,000, but the size of their staff is five 
times larger as well. It is fair to mention that also. Maybe we 
could add that to the bill when we are considering it a bit later. 
Perhaps the member has something to say on that.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for her comments and her observations.
<P>
	For me and as I represent my constituents, those individuals 
who elected me to the 35th Parliament, I have to say that they are 
the ones who are giving me my direction. I would like to read 
from one of those constituents who sent me a letter with regard 
to the whole matter of electoral redistribution. She wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Jan:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Do we really need more government? At this time we are so far in debt, we 
should be looking at all ways to reduce costs and restricting the increase in the 
size of all our governing bodies, not increasing our debts.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore, I would like to see all boundaries remain the same or better still 
reduce the size of the House of Commons and get our huge debt under control.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The issue at stake is not only representation. It is also keeping 
our expenditures under control, managing our money more 
effectively, and keeping our debt under control. Quite frankly it 
is scary to me to consider that staffing issues will be increasing 
and burgeoning in light of the enormous debt costs we carry and 
that the request of my constituents would be ignored in that 
instance.
<P>
	Once again I thank the hon. member for her observations. I 
trust she will understand why I stand here and speak on behalf 
of, for and with the constituents of Calgary Southeast.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask the hon. member for Calgary Southeast a 
question. I found her address extremely interesting and very 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2556"> 2556 </A></B>
<P>
refreshing, particularly her reference that Parliament ought to 
become more effective and more efficient and her reference to 
how the other place might be changed.
<P>
	Would it be possible for her to outline for us, in perhaps 
greater detail, how one could actually bring about a change of 
that sort and how it could relate to the House of Commons and 
make Parliament a more effective place?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the question from the hon. member. I would like to reference my 
answer with a little story.
<P>
	At the last meeting in Calgary Southeast that I attended with 
some of my constituents a motion was put forward that will 
come forward at our assembly in October. I got a very clear 
message about how effective and efficient they would like us to 
become here. In this policy they are requesting that we reduce 
the number of MPs in the House from 295 to 140.
<P>
	That gave an idea about trimming down, paring down and 
increasing efficiency here. That gave me a very clear and 
powerful message from them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it has been an interesting half hour sitting here, listening to and 
seeing how hon. members who sit with me referred to half the 
thoughts I was to mention on this afternoon. I will try to enlarge 
a few of them and address a few comments to hon. members 
across the House.
<P>
	We are addressing Bill C-18. I have not been in politics very 
long but I have seen some of the bills presented to the House. I 
have noticed how additions have been made to bills to get them 
through, to make them a little sweeter, to sweeten the bait so that 
people can support them.
<P>
	If hon. members on the other side of the House had really 
wanted to pass the bill, they would have probably included such 
things as suspending strikes in the western grain handling 
system. That has just cost my constituents about $200 million in 
sales. That would have helped me to support the bill instead of 
being against it.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Why did they not also include in the bill to sweeten it up a bit a 
suspension of the gold-plated pension plans for MPs? Then I 
could have supported the bill. My constituents would have sent 
me congratulatory messages as soon as I left the floor of the 
House.
<P>
	Why did they not include the suspension of phrases that we 
cannot use in the House when we want to give our appreciation 
to or criticize the other place or whatever they call it? I could 
have supported that. I could have gone home and said: ``I am for 
Bill C-18'', and people would have loved me for it.
<P>
	Many members have raised concerns about the redrafting of 
constituencies, especially our hon. friends on the other side. I 
see a few little problems with it. I do not think they are that 
severe. I think we can overcome those little problems. One 
problem I have with my constituency is that it is gone. I do not 
object too much to that, but the name Lisgar, a very prominent 
name in Canadian history, will be gone. I will dwell on that point  
a little later. I do not I find it so objectionable that I do not have 
that riding to run in next time because the piece of property 
where I live is still there. It is going to be included in the 
boundaries of Portage. It is a real incentive for me to run in the 
constituency of Portage; it means that I have to defeat another 
federal minister. I did that in the last election. It really gives me 
incentive to be a politician.
<P>
	The bill suspends the operation of the Electoral Boundaries 
Readjustment Act. What does that really mean? It means we are 
suspending a regulation or a rule entrenched in the Constitution. 
Why is it such a serious issue? I would like to dwell on it for a 
few minutes.
<P>
	In 1992 when we were discussing the referendum to change 
the Constitution I will never forget Mr. Peter Warren, a very 
well-known investigative reporter for CJOB in Manitoba, said: 
``I am going to read to you the best constitution that has ever 
been written and then just show and point out to you how 
valuable a constitution is''.
<P>
	I wondered what he would read the following day because I 
was not that informed about constitutions. He read the manifesto 
of 1917 written for the Communist Party. If that constitution 
were taken to legal authorities or political analysts, it would be 
found to be the best constitution that has ever been written, 
guaranteeing all freedoms, all rights, everything needed in a 
perfect constitution.
<P>
	However the reason it did not work in the Soviet Union was 
that politicians did not honour it. All of a sudden they felt they 
could suspend the right to have property. All of a sudden they 
thought they had the right to suspend freedom of religion. All of 
a sudden in 1937, when things got really hostile in the world, 
they thought they had the right to suspend the judicial system. 
When my uncle was accused of being a traitor to the Soviet 
government he did not have the right to appeal to the 
government. A military tribunal accused him of being a traitor 
and he was shot the following day without having any 
representation.
<P>
	That is what happens when we as politicians change the 
guidelines and the rules of a constitution. If after the hearings of 
April 29 Canadians say that the boundaries commission is no 
good, that they do not want it, I will very gladly support them in 
having the boundaries commission stopped. We as politicians do 
not have the right, according to our Constitution, to do that 
before we have had the hearings. That is why this worries me a 
bit.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	If the procedures and House affairs committee fails to put 
forward a new proposal for consideration by the House, there is 
no contingency plan offered to save the work done by the current 
commission. If no new process is introduced the original 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2557"> 2557 </A></B>
<P>
process that was started is finished, which means that we will 
have wasted $5 million worth of work.
<P>
	Is this the way to run government? That is why I said 
previously that if the right to strike had been suspended we 
could have saved $200 million, which would have made a lot 
more sense to me.
<P>
	I am aware of no proof that Canadians are dissatisfied with 
current distribution. Politicians are another story. I have heard 
that the problem with redistribution comes from politicians. 
This would be the second political interference in the process 
since the 1991 census. Politicians should remove themselves 
from the process, except for the purpose of ensuring that the 
number of MPs does not increase.
<P>
	As one of my colleagues mentioned earlier in the House, it is 
amazing how quickly politicians can get action in the House 
when their own interests are threatened. When they hear about 
criminals being let loose and about children who are starving 
they are very slow to react, but here is a situation which does not 
suit us and we react.
<P>
	Once it was determined that the commission's proposals 
could change the chances of re-election, the government was 
very easily prodded to take action. It put its feet against the wall 
and said: ``This is no good. This process does not work. Let us 
change it''.
<P>
	Very often constituents can pester their MPs and the 
government for action on an issue that is important to them and 
their community and they get very little response. But once the 
politicians' interests are threatened we see immediate action 
like we see here today.
<P>
	This problem clearly highlights the need for more regional 
representation. This is the whole issue. Hon. members object to 
this process. They are not so much worried about the process as 
they are about losing political clout in some areas where they 
have had it and want to keep it. This is why I think it is very 
important, as my hon. colleague said, that we go to a more 
regional and equal redistribution of the Senate. I would fully 
support her comments about that.
<P>
	It worries me when I see that in Manitoba we would lose more 
rural MPs. That is the one thing I do not like, and we would get 
more urban MPs. The people who have little power already 
would get less power down the road. By increasing the members 
of Parliament from huge urban areas we would be getting less 
regional representation than more.
<P>
	That is why I think we should go to an elected, equal Senate 
like the United States has. That is why I can support my hon. 
colleague. The problem with the current system is not only that 
it adds more MPs but it increases costs. It is useful to compare 
the Canadian system with the American system as my hon. 
colleague did. Her figures are much like mine. Each 
representative in their house represents about half a million 
people. Each state has two senators, no matter what the size of 
the population, and each senator represents about 2.5 million 
people. When I look at the issue today in the United  States and 
the clout that those farmers have because of these two Senate 
representatives in the farm states, it amazes me why we have not 
done this a lot sooner so that we could have equal representation 
from regions and have equal distribution of wealth or a chance to 
improve our economics in those areas.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps I should not raise it here. The Prime Minister was a 
little upset about not getting the wages that hockey players 
receive. I remind the House that hockey players' salaries are 
based on United States guidelines of what they think they are 
worth. If our Prime Minister served 10 times the population and 
increased his wages by 10 times, he would probably get more 
money than a hockey player. That is my answer to the value as 
far as our work is concerned. As an MP, if I did 10 times as much 
as I am doing today maybe my wages would be a little higher 
too. We have to put those things in perspective.
<P>
	I said I was opposed to this redistribution because of one or 
two concerns. One is about the name change. Adding six letters 
to the name of Portage could be very easily remedied for me. It 
would either read Lisgar-Portage or Portage-Lisgar. That 
would satisfy my complaints about the redistribution problem.
<P>
	Hon. members may wonder why I am so set on having the 
name Lisgar in that constituency. This is what I found out 
looking into the records of the House. The name Lisgar is of 
significant importance because Sir John Lisgar is a great figure 
in Canadian history. He was born in Bombay, India, and 
educated at Oxford University. He was the member of 
Parliament for County Cavan and served as a Lord of the 
Treasury from 1844 to 1846 and the chief secretary for Ireland 
from 1852 to 1855.
<P>
	During his term in Canada Lisgar took an active role in 
diffusing Canadian-American tensions created by the Red River 
rebellion and the Fenian raids. We know how important the 
rebellion was in Manitoba, the Louis Riel rebellion as they 
called it. We lose a tremendous part of history if we lose the 
name Lisgar.
<P>
	He was a strong supporter of Confederation. He helped 
negotiate the transfer of Rupertsland and the entry of Manitoba 
into Confederation. He also encouraged British Columbia to 
join. He was designated by John A. Macdonald, Prime Minister 
at that time, as the best Governor General that Canada ever had.
<P>
	This is what we lose if we take the name Lisgar out of 
Canadian history. I would encourage the commission and I am 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2558"> 2558 </A></B>
<P>
going to write a letter to it asking it to change the name Portage 
to Portage-Lisgar or Lisgar-Portage, whichever way.
<P>
	We can see that this name is of great importance to all 
Canadians and in particular Manitobans. I am at a loss therefore 
as to why it was dropped. I hope that when the commission 
finishes its work, completed its hearings, it will come to the 
conclusion that is beneficial to Canadians as a whole, not as 
Canadian politicians but Canadian citizens.
<P>
	The reason we are here as members of Parliament is to follow 
the wishes, suggestions and guidance of our constituents. We are 
desperately failing to do that with Bill C-18. There has been no 
discussion of this bill in any constituencies. It has been done 
very expediently and quickly for some members of the House.
<P>
	I hope that we honestly start recognizing that we represent our 
constituents, that we are here for one purpose, to serve them, not 
just to tell them how to be served.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member made some reference to what the Prime Minister said in 
the context of the poorest NHL hockey players in reference to 
what MPs should be making. I am not talking about the pension. 
That is something that most MPs here think should be addressed, 
particularly when there is no age factor to qualify. I leave that 
out of it.
<P>
	Would the member just throw out a figure? What would he 
think? He has been here now for four or five months. He knows 
some of the costs associated with the job. I do not think he would 
want it to be said that in order to be a member of Parliament one 
had to have an outside source of money. That would put it on a 
totally different plane. It would eliminate a lot of people from 
ever aspiring to become a member of Parliament if they had to 
be wealthy to start with. I do not think that is what the member 
was suggesting.
<P>
	What would be a fair reimbursement for the kind of demand 
that is put on a member of Parliament, on his time and his 
resources and energy and the costs that he has? Perhaps some 
Canadians are not fully aware that there are costs associated 
with being a member of Parliament, particularly like the 
member who has just spoken whose riding is a considerable 
distance from here. Would he give me a figure? What would be 
an appropriate salary?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that question. I 
would like to answer it in this fashion.
<P>
	I ran as a member of Parliament and said that I did not care if I 
did not get a dollar out of this job. I have come here to make sure 
that in the future there is a country left for my children and 
grandchildren.
<P>
	If one wants to know how serious I am about that, I was called 
into a meeting in my constituency not too long ago about some 
of the infrastructure programs that hon. members have provided 
for us. One of my town councils was very interested in it.
<P>
	I said to the mayor that I had read about two months ago that 
they had increased their salaries by 2 per cent. I asked him 
whether that was a fact. He said that yes, it was a fact. I asked 
him how he could justify that. They wanted a handout from the 
federal government. They could not run their town council 
efficiently enough to do without these subsidies and he was 
asking me to represent him. I said that he was not dedicated 
enough to freeze his own wages. I knew he was a professional, 
that he was drawing a fairly good wage to date, that he did not 
need the bucks.
<P>
	I would say to the hon. member that I do not think there is a 
member of Parliament here today who really is going to starve if 
his wages are frozen until this debt or deficit mess is cleaned up. 
That is why I am here. I am here to try to make level headed, 
honest decisions that will benefit future generations and not for 
my wage cheque today or my pension plan. I am dead serious 
about that.
<P>
	When I found that this council had given itself a 2 per cent 
wage increase, I said that if it wanted any support from me it 
should kill that wage increase. Whether it will listen to me or 
not, I do not know, but that is how I would like to respond to the 
hon. member. I am prepared to sit here without a wage increase 
until we have a balanced budget and then I will tell the member 
what I think his work is worth.
<P>
	Right now we have bigger things to do than worry about salary 
increases.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
always I enjoyed the speeches from the hon. member for 
Lisgar-Marquette. He raised a number of issues which I would 
like to comment on and which maybe he would like to respond 
to. First, I would note his concern about regional representation 
and rural representation and the fact that both he and the 
previous speaker from Calgary Southeast have indicated the 
importance of Senate reform. I think that is very important to 
recognize.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	I have heard a lot of complaints in the last few weeks from 
members who are being affected negatively by redistribution in 
various parts of the country. They wish there were some 
protections for large rural and remote ridings and that they did 
not simply just grow and grow in order to represent a certain 
level of population. I understand that concern. This is why our 
party has been so outspoken and persistent in pursuing the issue 
of Senate reform. That is of course what the Senate was designed 
to do. I find it strange that some members who are now in the 
context of their own riding, not the hon. member for 
Lisgar-Marquette but others, complaining about lack of 
regional representation 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2559"> 2559 </A></B>
<P>
and are opposed to  the kind of meaningful Senate reform that 
our party supports.
<P>
	I point out to the member, and I am sure the hon. member for 
Lisgar-Marquette is aware of this or he would not have made 
reference to these matters, that section 42(1)(a) of the 
Constitution Act of 1982 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An amendment to the Constitution of Canada in relation to the following 
matters may be made only in accordance with subsection 38(1):</BLOCKQUOTE>
That of course is the two-thirds amending formula. That:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) the principle of proportionate representation of the provinces in the House 
of Commons prescribed by the Constitution of Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, some members not of this party but of other 
parties who are indicating that they are willing to look at the 
issue of regional representation in the context of reform of the 
House of Commons are really inadvertently misleading the 
public. There is no such opportunity to do so unless we enter into 
constitutional negotiations and get approval by two-thirds of 
the provinces. That is definitely off the table. I am glad the hon. 
member brought those matters to our attention.
<P>
	The hon. member also discussed his concerns about boundary 
and name changes in Manitoba. My understanding of past 
practices has been that it is very common for commissions to 
accept recommendations, particularly on name changes. I am 
sure he will want to approach the commission on that basis. I am 
just wondering if that is simply his own viewpoint or whether he 
has heard this complaint from other constituents, whether there 
have been other kinds of complaints and what mechanisms are 
available.
<P>
	I understand there will be hearings at some point in Portage la 
Prairie. Perhaps he could tell us a little bit more about what he 
has heard from his constituents and what they intend to do.
<P>
	Finally, his comment about the constitution of the Soviet 
Union I thought was very interesting and something I would like 
to hear more about. Of course it is true that some of these 
autocratic or totalitarian states have had highly democratic 
constitutions but there are no structures of government behind 
them to protect people's actual rights. They are just pieces of 
paper. Maybe he could tell us whether he and his constituents 
feel that their rights in terms of representation would be better 
protected by the independent commissions that exist today and 
are operating as we speak that this bill would close or whether 
they would be better protected by a committee of this House 
controlled by partisan politicians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate those questions 
from my colleague from Calgary. I think I will address the last 
question first. The last question was about the commissions.
<P>
	This name change has stirred up quite a bit of comment in my 
constituency. As the member knows from recent history, Lisgar 
had the multiculturalism  minister for the Canadian government 
at one time. It also had the minister of oilseeds and the minister 
of the wheat board. It later became the agriculture minister. If 
one goes back in history there was a time when the constituency 
of Lisgar was represented by the Liberals, a very honourable and 
very effective member known as Howard Winkler. If we look 
back in the history books we will see his name. He was very well 
respected in the Lisgar constituency. The majority of people in 
my riding of Lisgar-Marquette are former Lisgar people and 
they are very interested in keeping that name and there will be a 
number of recommendations to this commission on that basis, 
the preservation of the name Lisgar.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	They are not that upset over the boundary change because 
Lisgar-Portage will actually be a smaller riding than 
Lisgar-Marquette. It will be better represented whether it is a 
federal minister or not.
<P>
	The other one that I want to address, and I see the motion 
going, is about the United States, farming close to the border. 
Having had that experience the last couple of weeks on 
agriculture problems, they do not go to their congressmen, they 
go to their senator.
<P>
	Two weeks ago we were hooked up with Senator Dorgan and 
myself among a number of American and Canadian farmers 
discussing the durum wheat issue and the tombstone issue and 
other diseases affecting wheat.
<P>
	It is amazing how these farmers depend on their senators 
because of the regional area they represent. Look at Senator 
Dole representing Kansas, look at all the agriculture states 
having senators to represent them. They do most of the 
trouble-shooting for the American farmer. That is why it is so 
important that they have regional representation.
<P>
	When it comes to the Soviet constitution, get a copy of it and 
read it. It is very direct in protecting human rights which were so 
badly abused later. I would never want to see that happen in this 
country.
<P>
	That is why I would rather give up redistribution than go 
against the Constitution and force on people what they do not 
want.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Davenport-the Environment; the hon. member for 
Regina-Qu'Appelle-Information Highway; the hon. member 
for Capilano-Howe Sound-Immigration.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2560"> 2560 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to oppose Bill C-18.
<P>
	I can understand the first blush reaction of my colleagues. The 
results of $5 million of work do not appear to be very satisfying.
<P>
	In many instances the suggested changes of the commission 
just do not make common sense. However, Bill C-18 seems to 
be a step backward in time and could represent the slippery slope 
of partisan interference in riding boundary making.
<P>
	The commission has been doing its work in good faith. 
However, the boundaries in the lower mainland of British 
Columbia do not seem to follow natural geographic divisions or 
reflect the psychological sense of community or sense of place 
that needs to be imparted to a political representative.
<P>
	I am often asked what riding I represent. My riding of New 
Westminster-Burnaby and the riding of Burnaby-Kingsway 
are sometimes confused. Fortunately there is never any 
confusion between me and the member for 
Burnaby-Kingsway.
<P>
	New Westminster has a distinctiveness, a history of the riding 
name that goes back to the byelection of 1871, the year British 
Columbia joined Confederation. In those days I suspect one had 
to be a British subject, a male, and probably a land owner to be 
eligible to vote.
<P>
	At that first election the riding was very large and included all 
the hinterland of the Fraser Valley, past Abbotsford and 
Chilliwack, up the Fraser canyon to Yale.
<P>
	Successively the riding boundary has been cut back as the 
population grew. Six of my colleagues now represent former 
parts of my riding.
<P>
	The riding of New Westminster-Burnaby was most recently 
rationalized for the 1988 election and like all others was the 
same for the October 1993 election.
<P>
	There is some improvement in the proposed distinctions in the 
name change as Burnaby-Kingsway riding will now become 
Burnaby North.
<P>
	The city of Burnaby is currently split between the riding 
known as Burnaby-Kingsway taking its name from the city and 
from the main historical street that was the horse trail between 
New Westminster and access from Fraser Rivers to the 
Vancouver ice free port.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	The proposed boundary shift moves the split of the city of 
Burnaby somewhat eastward. Although the current division is 
clear yet artificial in a cohesive community settlement sense the 
proposed boundary shift looks minor on a map but is very 
significant.
<P>
	The new proposal cuts down streets that did not represent 
main thoroughfares or easily identifiable divisions. It cuts 
through the middle of a park, across the middle of Deer Lake 
instead of taking the preferred street around the edge, then 
proceeds up a hill through residential properties and through 
bushlands where no streets exist at all. Therefore, examination 
of street map  can be deceiving. I doubt any commissioner ever 
actually physically examined on site the strange anomaly that 
the proposal makes.
<P>
	It leaves small enclaves of residential areas stranded in the 
new riding of Burnaby North without access, except by 
travelling a considerable distance through my riding of New 
Westminister-Burnaby. Clearly the purpose among others is to 
rationalize but this proposal has left these orphaned areas.
<P>
	I know my riding reasonably well since as a lad I have 
travelled the streets on bicycle and have walked untold miles 
campaigning door to door. There is always a different 
perspective for a pedestrian compared with a car slipping 
through the neighbourhood, sliding by.
<P>
	I have an alternative proposal that represents a minor change 
keeping in mind the principles I have mentioned and makes 
geographical and social sense to the feeling of place in reference 
to the voter. The boundary between Burnaby-Kingsway which 
is to become known as Burnaby North and my riding of New 
Westminster-Burnaby is problematic in one significant area 
only. The other boundaries are most sensible, easily understood 
by residents and fit postal code walks as they take into account 
the municipal political boundaries and the physical barriers. The 
number one freeway, the Fraser River and Boundary Road 
between Burnaby and Vancouver are clear on every map and are 
historically known and accepted by every resident.
<P>
	These are natural boundaries that thankfully remain in the 
new proposal. Nevertheless, I am suggesting that the boundary 
dividing Burnaby be moved just a few blocks to represent a more 
identifiable division. The population difference is minor but the 
rational sense is rather significant.
<P>
	The commission is permitting only one hearing in the lower 
mainland for the boundary changes and that may seem rather 
limited. At least the community can participate. I do not 
particularly approve of the results of the commission either, but 
I would rather give evidence at the hearings of an independent 
tribunal and work to convince arbitrators of the merits of my 
case with geographical and social evidence than let the riding 
realignments fall into the hands of the Liberals.
<P>
	Bill C-18 of the government flies in the face of everything we 
have come to trust about our electoral boundaries for 
non-partisanship and independence. Up until now we as 
Canadians could be quite smug as compared with the Americans 
for what we have achieved beyond gerrymandering, the 
American derogatory term.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2561"> 2561 </A></B>
<P>
	This government does not like the results of the commission's 
proposals and has introduced a bill to cancel everything. Let us 
not at the stroke of quick vote undo history that makes us 
distinctly proud to be Canadian. If we are not happy with the 
proposed results of the commission we should work to change it 
within the system before wiping out what we have on the books.
<P>
	Millions have already been spent and therefore the bill that we 
see before the House implicitly says that the money has been 
wasted. If the government is so aghast at the results, I say get in 
the game and make the process work. Give it a chance. If after 
all is said and done, and usually from this government more is 
said than done, the boundaries are still troublesome send the 
commission back to do its homework, refine the evidence and 
get it to justify its recommendations.
<P>
	What we have here in this bill is the old adage that if we do not 
like the message on the front line of the battle, shoot the 
messenger instead of the enemy.
<P>
	In my case in New Westminster-Burnaby I believe that I can 
change the situation by getting folk to walk the ground. I 
certainly do not trust electoral boundary reform to be put into 
the hands of the government. It is the cat among the pigeons, the 
fox in charge of the hen house. How long did it take us to learn in 
Canada and achieve the statute of the Electoral Boundaries 
Readjustment Act?
<P>
	British Columbia is already short about six seats that should 
come from other provinces and this bill certainly perpetuates 
that inequity.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	This bill is audacious and the government is not even 
embarrassed. We need regular, independent non-partisan 
redistribution in a manner that inspires confidence. The analogy 
is like a court. When the judgment is a little out of character we 
outlaw and remove the judges instead of dealing with the case.
<P>
	We need redistribution. Even more we need a cap on the 
number of members of Parliament. That is what new Canada 
thinking says. Modesty and common sense must begin in 
Parliament.
<P>
	We have become a country of city dwellers with vast 
hinterlands. There needs to be equity with an upper limit within 
which redistribution can take place. That is the vision of new 
Canada thinking of equality and reason.
<P>
	Such measures as I am suggesting are tied to the regional 
representation that a true triple-E upper House can bring. The 
Prime Minister could just announce what he will honour in 
appointment, the elected nominee, which follows the precedent 
of the late Stan Waters. This is a most important subject as 
representation by population and regional representation of our 
vast land require a balance that will not be ameliorated by 
disbanding the commission.
<P>
	Let not the excuse of dissatisfaction with the commission be 
the opening door to a hidden agenda. Let the standing committee 
do its work, but also engage the existing commission and let it 
do its work.
<P>
	In summary, let the system do its work, as the alternative 
proposed by this government is the least desirable of all the 
options.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> I listened with some 
interest to the speech by the hon. member for New 
Westminster-Burnaby, although I did miss a small portion of 
it.
<P>
	I wanted to draw the attention of the House to how this kind of 
redistribution would affect a riding like this in a population 
sense. New Westminster-Burnaby is an urban British 
Columbia riding. Under the current boundaries this riding has a 
population of 112,510; 16.5 per cent above the electoral quotient 
established for British Columbia. Under the new boundaries, 
which I appreciate are not entirely satisfactory to the hon. 
member, there is a population of 101,881, or only 5 per cent 
above the electoral quotient. There is a considerable 
improvement in representation there.
<P>
	It is interesting because that is allowed for under the current 
sets of acts that are leading us to this process in giving British 
Columbia two more seats. Maybe we do not want an increase in 
seats overall but we certainly recognize that British Columbia is 
entitled to more seats by virtue of the representation by 
population provisions of our Constitution.
<P>
	We will all remember that the previous formulas were not so 
generous to British Columbia. We will also remember that, as I 
indicated earlier today, in the Charlottetown accord of only a 
year and a half ago the party opposite and what remains of the 
other two parties in the former House got together to limit on a 
permanent basis the number of seats and the representation in 
the House of the province of British Columbia.
<P>
	I am sure that is colouring the reaction of members from that 
province when they see a committee being given an open ended 
mandate, a committee of this House, to re-examine the formula 
and to re-examine all kinds of other aspects of electoral reform.
<P>
	I am wondering whether the member for New 
Westminster-Burnaby had any comment on that, whether he 
shared those concerns, whether his constituents shared those 
concerns. Since the boundary decisions or proposals have been 
published by the commission, has he had a widespread reaction 
from ordinary constituents or is this a reaction he is getting 
primarily from members of Parliament or politically active 
individuals?
<P>
	I would appreciate his assessment of that situation.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief.
<P>
	At first blush, looking at the riding boundary map for the 
lower mainland, one questions the rational sense of how the 
reconfiguration of some of the boundaries will cross waterways 
and there is no natural geographical sense. There is an effort to 
bring better representation on line based on population. There is 
a creation of two new seats. There is a process there.
<P>
	I guess my reactions are somewhat the same as we get from 
constituents, do not throw the baby out with the bath water. We 
have a process in place and just because we do not like the first 
blush of the response we do not abandon the whole process and 
disband the commission.
<P>
	We certainly are looking for increased representation in 
British Columbia. I am afraid that Bill C-18 in the long run is 
not going to bring us that. One of our major fears is that British 
Columbia will be in the catch up position of trying to get 
representation that it should have had a long time ago.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, since this 
morning I have been listening to speeches made by members of 
the Reform Party, and I wonder why these people want a process 
that differs from the existing one, while the government is 
simply asking for a legislative review. The legislation goes back 
to 1964, which means it is 30 years old. This legislation should 
be revised, and we already seem to have some idea of what the 
new legislation will be like. I am sure that the committee formed 
to review this legislation will make recommendations to the 
House, which will examine these proposals before it decides to 
accept them.
<P>
	Recently, I went around my riding to get the opinion of my 
constituents on this subject. I must admit that as far as the 
boundaries of the riding of Chicoutimi are concerned, some 
municipalities were to be removed from the riding and most 
came out against the process. Today, residents realize that 
money has already been committed-as much as $5 million was 
mentioned-but they are still telling us to ``Stop the process. 
Look at what is wrong with the legislation, because every time 
they want to make readjustments, they have no regard for 
boundaries or for the people''.
<P>
	The following is a case in point. The municipalities that were 
to be removed from my riding are all connected with Saguenay 
Park and would be added to the riding of Jonquière, although 
there is no link between the two. I think that after 30 years, it is 
time to pause and consider what we can do with this legislation 
and amend it to bring it in line with the twenty-first century.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> Mr. Speaker, what I was addressing is the 
principle of arm's length independent process. Members in this 
corner of the House are very concerned  about suspending that 
and putting redistribution into the hands of politicians.
<P>
	The parallel is the tradition of this House essentially writing 
its own pay cheque. There is a cry in the land that we change 
that.
<P>
	We must have redistribution but my opening comment was 
that we could by this bill represent the slippery slope of partisan 
interference in riding boundary making. We are warning the 
House about that and we hope that it will not go that way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
here once again debating the merits of political interference in 
the rights and privileges of the Canadian citizen.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	It has always been that bad politicians make the assumption 
that the electorate cannot make decisions for itself and so they 
get involved in its everyday life and in its rights and privileges 
and make changes on its behalf. I thought that we were through 
with this and that this new Liberal government would make 
some changes in that regard.
<P>
	There is a saying that if we forget the past we are condemned 
to repeat it. That saying goes particularly well in this House of 
Commons. If this government forgets what happened with the 
last government it is condemned to go the same road in the next 
election. Let us look at how we got to this point in the history of 
electoral reform.
<P>
	In 1964 the present system came into effect so that the 
Canadian citizen would always have the right of representation 
based on a specific formula. Is that logical?-yes. In 1974 the 
federal government amended that formula and with it the rules 
for the Canada Elections Act.
<P>
	Unfortunately that formula would have resulted in an increase 
in the number of MPs to about 369 by the year 2001. We all know 
that more MPs are less desired than fewer MPs. Then we move 
on to 1986 when politicians of the day decided to simplify the 
formula. So important was this concept that the government of 
the time enshrined this right in our Constitution.
<P>
	Let us briefly cover the basics of that right. The first basic 
right is the Representation Act in 1986 which retained the idea 
that certain provinces would be guaranteed certain levels of 
representation. This affects provinces with slow or declining 
population growth, like P.E.I. and Quebec, more than others.
<P>
	The second basic right is after every election, to preserve one 
of the founding principles of our nation, representation by 
population, the system is re-examined and constituencies are 
readjusted according to the rules set out in the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2563"> 2563 </A></B>
<P>
	Like all rules, they must be interpreted before they can be 
applied and this is where the government comes in. As we have 
seen in the past, when the government gets involved things tend 
to get a little muddied. It is amazing to me the similarities 
between this Liberal government and the Conservative 
government in this regard. Actually, it is becoming quite clear.
<P>
	There are many similarities in many regards. For instance, 
their spending habits thus far indicate that both governments are 
more intent on leading us into bankruptcy than out of 
bankruptcy. However, let us look at a similarity between the 
dying Conservative Party and the Liberal Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fontana:</B> We are not dying.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> The hon. member says the 
Liberal party is not dying. I would go back to the original 
comment I made that if it forgets the past, it is condemned to 
repeat it. We will see how well the Liberal Party does.
<P>
	What is striking about this new government is its willingness 
to allow the direct interference of politicians in a long standing 
practice. In 1990 the majority Conservative government 
interfered in a long standing practice and wanted to legislate the 
GST despite the opposition of the majority of Canadians in this 
country and opposition parties, including the majority of Liberal 
senators.
<P>
	In order to get its way, however, the government at the time 
with the help of the Queen appointed eight political hacks as 
senators just to get its legislation passed. If the public does not 
like it, ram it down its throat is what the government said, which 
is kind of indicative of things here today. It is the cod liver oil 
approach, I say, as someone from the maritimes originally.
<P>
	Canadians are not going to swallow cod liver oil politics any 
longer. Not only will the Canadian taxpayer have to pay the bill 
for supporting these political hacks until the age of 75, but the 
government established a terrible political precedent. If we do 
not get our way in the House of Commons or we disagree with 
the accepted rules of our country then we change them to make 
them fit our political agenda. It is quite similar to Bill C-18.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	The fact is that very few people in Canada today really get 
excited about the political boundaries because they have always 
changed as the population changes. The only people who have 
concerns at the moment appear to be the Liberal Party members. 
Like the Conservatives and the GST, they will interfere in an 
issue, that of redistribution.
<P>
	This is neither their right nor any of their business. If this 
government were really in touch with the people of Canada 
today it would be attempting to reduce the number of ridings to 
200 or 250 and save some much needed money as well as making 
the job of members of Parliament a little easier.
<P>
	Having 295 members of Parliament in the past has not really 
served us that well, has it? For instance, MPs would be able to 
handle the workload much better if we did not waste so much 
time passing unnecessary laws like this one.
<P>
	How could we be spending this time? Look at the state of our 
economy. Look at the state of our criminal justice system. Look 
at the number of unemployed people in Canada and look at the 
stagnating parliamentary system we have today, one which 
refuses to recall MPs, one which refuses to give Canadians the 
right to referendums, and one that will not even elect senators.
<P>
	All these things merit our attention much more than deciding 
if we are going to postpone a decision we have no business 
interfering with in the first place.
<P>
	Is the government that desperate for new legislation? As in 
the case of the GST, let us look at what a desperate government 
might do after it sets the precedent of monkeying around with 
the electoral boundary process.
<P>
	I am not saying that this is a desperate government, yet. I 
predict that this Liberal government will be fighting for its very 
existence in 1997, and then who knows?
<P>
	If this government interferes with the realignment of electoral 
seats what is to stop it from realigning seats by interfering with 
the process in 1997? Perhaps the government may wish to add 
seats in a particular part of a province that is typically held by a 
majority of that party's voters. That is why the process has been 
set apart from politics in the first place.
<P>
	The action put before this House may mean instead of 
freezing the number of MPs to be added the public will see more 
seats eventually. At an average cost of $1 million per MP, do we 
really need more MPs?
<P>
	We have already spent $5 million on the process. Now, 
because politicians do not like the realignment, there is another 
$5 million out the window-what is $5 million today, they ask.
<P>
	This government seems willing to throw away tax dollars like 
this with no regard for common sense. This government wishes 
to pass the bill before the Easter break, suspending the current 
process for 24 months. If a new bill is not passed by Parliament 
within 24 months the process will be restarted under the existing 
legislation.
<P>
	The member across in the Liberal Party says he is saving 
money. Talk about a waste of money, how does one save money 
by spending it that way?
<P>
	It is absolutely amazing to me that this government again 
wants to change the constitutional item relating to electoral 
boundary redistribution. The government is already embarking 
on complicated changes to the Constitution related to aboriginal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2564"> 2564 </A></B>
<P>
self-government. The government has recently elected to 
change the constitutional item relative to Prince Edward Island 
ferry service.
<P>
	When it comes to the Reform Party's constitutional issue of 
insisting on a Senate that is elected, what do we get? The 
government says the issue was defeated in 1992 in the 
referendum so Canadians do not want it. Liberal Party members 
across the way say that they defeated the referendum in 1992. 
That is the narrow focus we get today.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	This government wishes to pass a bill before the Easter break. 
Why? What is the benefit? Is it to save money? No, I believe it is 
to fulfil a political ambition.
<P>
	Why is it when there are majority governments in this country 
they do what they want and not what the people want? There is 
nobody crying and screeching about this today other than a 
party.
<P>
	It makes one wonder about the Reform Party's platform on 
referendums, citizens' initiatives and free votes, does it not? 
Those are things where the people finally get to say what is right 
or wrong rather than the politicians assuming they know best 
what is in it for the people.
<P>
	There is a process in place on redistribution, one that allows 
all Canadians, including MPs, to state their case at public 
hearings. They have been established. The new proposal would 
see Ontario getting four new seats and British Columbia the 
other two.
<P>
	I can speak against this issue even though my riding is one of 
the ridings that will be drastically changed and not for the better. 
Unlike some members opposite they would prefer to get 
involved in a political process to change the process rather than 
address the issue through the appeal process.
<P>
	The government should do a number of things. It should come 
clean with the Canadian people and admit it is letting a political 
concern override a process that has been set up to ensure 
politicians will not be involved. It should introduce legislation 
that freezes the number of MPs at current levels. It should get on 
with the business of really running the country instead of 
tampering with an already overly complicated system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
intently to my hon. colleague.
<P>
	I am glad to see that members of the Reform Party who 
campaigned for change are now defending the status quo. They 
are now saying they are happy with an act that was put in place 
30 years ago and they want to continue with it. Things change 
and sometimes we have re-evaluate things.
<P>
	I am very surprised that members of the Reform Party who 
campaigned on the basis they were going to reform things are 
now in favour of the status quo. They want to support and 
maintain an act that was put in place in 1964.
<P>
	The hon. member states that the Liberal senators voted in 
favour of the GST. He should look at history and see how hard 
the Liberal senators fought against GST. The hon. member 
should get his facts straight on that issue instead of making 
erroneous statements. Everyone knows that simply was not the 
case and is not true.
<P>
	My riding of Vancouver South has a tremendous history. John 
Fraser, the first elected Speaker, was from that riding. Under 
redistribution it is basically wiped off the map. There is no 
riding of Vancouver South.
<P>
	We need to review the act which was brought in in 1964. 
Should it continue? Can we improve it? Are there better ways of 
doing it? Canadians also want us to look at things that were done 
30, 40 or 50 years ago, acts that have not been reviewed. That is 
what we are doing.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Reform members say they do not want to change anything but 
they would like to make some changes themselves. They are 
saying they do not want to change anything but they would 
support freezing the number of seats. When it is something the 
Reform Party wants it is quite acceptable to make the change. 
Those members only want to review it if it supports their party's 
view and political ideology.
<P>
	Is the Reform Party against reviewing, updating and seeing 
whether other acts that have been in existence for a long time 
make sense in today's age? Times change and the way we do 
things change. For a party which is committed to reform and 
wants to make changes we are going to work with its members 
and co-operate with them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member has made some interesting comments. I should clarify 
one thing. He talked about a listening technique. I will read part 
of my speech again.
<P>
	In 1990 the majority Conservative government wanted to 
legislate the GST against the opposition of the majority of 
Canadians and opposition parties, including the majority of 
Liberal senators. I think that is what I said. The member can read 
it in the record. Listening skills are important in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	It is important to understand that in a democracy the people 
are never wrong. Given that, one has to give some credibility to 
the electorate that if they are concerned about issues they will let 
us know. Right now we do not hear very much, if anything about 
this. In fact beyond these walls it is not a big problem.
<P>
	I want to talk about defending the status quo. It is ironic that 
when an issue comes up they expect us as Reformers to take an 
opposite position on it, but we do not.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2565"> 2565 </A></B>
<P>
	We are for change. We are for changes in referendums. We are 
for changes in free votes. We are for changes in elected senators. 
We are for changes in recall. We are for balanced budgets and for 
changes to the criminal justice system. Those are the kinds of 
changes we are for. We are not for changes in a process for 
political gain rather than other gains.
<P>
	When it comes to the status quo the member is talking to 
people who are against the status quo on many issues. It does not 
mean that on every issue it must be changed. A government 
member who suggests that just because it is there it should be 
changed is probably looking at the wrong methodology for 
undertaking that change.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also 
would like to comment on the hon. member's speech and the 
whole issue of change.
<P>
	Members on this side who have been speaking against this 
particular bill are not opposed to reviewing or changing the 
process. What is interesting about this bill is it makes no such 
proposal. There is no proposal to review or to change the process 
in any meaningful way. It is simply to kill it and substitute 
nothing other than parliamentary committee hearings controlled 
by politicians on a matter which is supposed to be the purview of 
an independent commission.
<P>
	Let us look at the recommendations of the Lortie commission 
on redistribution. The previous Parliament set up a commission 
to look at all aspects of electoral reform and election law. I am 
not saying that we necessarily approve of those things, but they 
were studied at considerable expense to the taxpayer of Canada. 
Now they are just off the table, we are talking about another 
study.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	The Lortie commission recommended to amend the 
representation formula found in section 51 of the Constitution 
Act, 1867 so that Quebec would be assigned 75 seats and other 
provinces would be assigned seats on the basis of the ratio of 
their population to Quebec. The senatorial clause would be kept. 
No province would lose more than one seat from a previous 
distribution. No province would have fewer seats than a 
province with a smaller population.
<P>
	Of course, that formula would lead to a more rapid growth in 
the number of seats in the House of Commons than the formula 
we are dealing with today. That was the last time we spent 
money to discover what was wrong with the process and how we 
could improve it.
<P>
	Actually, the Lortie commission said: ``Maintain the current 
composition and manner of appointment of the electoral 
boundaries commission''. The last study was not proposing that 
we change the method or that we kill this particular process.
<P>
	One other recommendation from that commission was that 
electoral boundaries commissions would justify their proposals 
with reference to communities of interest, et cetera and 
discontinuance of the procedure of parliamentary committee 
hearings on electoral boundaries. Instead, the commissions 
would hold a second set of public hearings if their second 
proposals departed significantly from their first proposals. In 
other words far from suggesting that Parliament should get itself 
involved again in the process or in examining the process, it 
suggested quite the opposite.
<P>
	We spent millions of dollars to find out from that particular 
commission that the opposite should be done. Parliament has no 
power to change but it does in fact review the recommendations 
of the boundary commission. We would actually cancel that to 
go to a second set of public hearings instead of one set of public 
hearings.
<P>
	With those observations I would appreciate the comments of 
the hon. member for Fraser Valley West on whether those 
recommendations are consistent with what he is hearing from 
people. Do they at all affect his view of whether we need to 
amend this act and whether we should be doing it in this way?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. 
colleague's observations are thought provoking. It is important 
to note that the government has introduced a bill on a process 
which is already taking place. Our constituents by and large 
really do not know this is happening.
<P>
	Far be it for us as politicians to get involved and take it upon 
ourselves to change it on their behalf when already there is a 
process in place. As much as I may dislike the change in the 
electoral boundary of Fraser Valley West, the fact is that I and 
everyone else in that constituency has a process and an avenue to 
address it through the hearings that are going on.
<P>
	My hon. friend is absolutely correct. Why do we want to get 
into another process? We have already spent $5 million, which is 
too much in my opinion. Why are we not just taking it upon 
ourselves to let the process run its course? That is what it should 
do.
<P>
	We do not know everything that is better for everybody. This 
process has been operating for a long time. Let it run its course.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in the House today to voice my strong opposition to Bill 
C-18, an act to suspend the operation of the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act. I feel quite strongly that this 
government's taking it upon itself to halt these proceedings, 
resulting in the disbanding of the existing electoral boundary 
commissions is not only unethical but also is highly irregular.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2566"> 2566 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	Of the approximate $8 million allocated for the readjustment 
process an estimated $5 million has already been spent. If the 
bill is passed into law, how much additional funding will be 
required to revisit the ground already covered? In other words, 
how much of the $5 million will have been wasted?
<P>
	Although I am completely opposed to the bill, my opposition 
should not be misconstrued to mean that I am happy with the 
proposals the commissions have drafted for redefining existing 
electoral boundaries. Certainly there seems to be widespread 
concern among my colleagues in this place. However I have yet 
to see evidence that their concern is echoed by the Canadian 
electorate.
<P>
	My constituency of Prince George-Peace River is huge. It 
encompasses 212,000 square kilometres in the northeast corner 
of British Columbia, stretching from the city of Prince George in 
central B.C. all the way to the Yukon border. No other federal 
riding straddles the Rocky Mountains, and this poses a serious 
barrier for winter travel in the constituency. The Pine Pass 
connecting the Peace River area with the rest of the province has 
one of the highest annual snowfalls found anywhere in Canada. 
Having lived all my life in the north, I can personally vouch for 
the difficulty it presents for east-west travel within the riding. 
To travel by road from the Lower Post community on the Yukon 
border to Prince George in the south requires driving some 1,300 
kilometres. This does not take into account any side trips to 
communities lying off the main arterial routes of the Alaska or 
Hart highways.
<P>
	In addition to the three main centres of population of Prince 
George, Fort St. John and Dawson Creek, the riding 
encompasses some seven additional smaller municipalities 
beginning in the north with Fort Nelson. These include Taylor, 
Hudson Hope, Pouce Coupe, Chetwynd, Tumbler Ridge and 
Mackenzie. There are also 15 native communities located in the 
constituency. Some are inaccessible by road during summer 
months; others can only be reached by air, river boat or 
snowmobile.
<P>
	Not only is the riding a blend of urban and rural; it is also a 
home to a mixture of diverse industries. With over 80 per cent of 
the arable land of British Columbia located in the Peace River 
district, the riding has a strong agricultural base. The economic 
viability of the area is further assured by the existence of many 
other industries such as oil and gas, lumber, pulp and paper, 
mining, hydroelectric, trapping, guiding, tourism and 
manufacturing. Representing such a multitude of interests and 
concerns is already an incredible challenge to the member of 
Parliament.
<P>
	Under the proposed electoral boundary changes the physical 
size of the riding will be lengthened by adding roughly 300 
kilometres of the Yellowhead highway and a further 70 or so of 
the Cariboo highway south of Prince George. This increase in 
geographical size will be offset  by losing the one-third of 
Prince George currently contained within the riding. The 
elimination of confusion that currently results from having 
Prince George split into two ridings must be weighed against the 
fact that the MP will have to travel through Prince George to 
service the 10 or so smaller communities in the extreme 
southern end of the new riding.
<P>
	The only other noteworthy change is the loss of the native 
community of Lower Post near the Yukon border. Under the 
proposed changes this community would find itself in the riding 
of Skeena, even though the MP would have to travel through part 
of Yukon to get to it.
<P>
	Although the suggested boundaries would ensure that the new 
riding of Peace-Yellowhead has a more consistent rural 
flavour, I am not in favour of the proposal because of the 
substantial increase in the physical size. It is proving more than 
difficult enough now to get around the riding on anything 
resembling a regular basis, without the addition of hundreds 
more kilometres. Even allowing for the increasing use of 
toll-free phone lines and faxes, constituents in far-flung small 
communities continue to expect a periodic personal visit from 
their MP.
<P>
	It is my intention, therefore, to take advantage of the same 
option open to any other Canadian living in northern British 
Columbia. I will make my concerns known to the commission 
when it holds its public hearing in Prince George on June 2.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	My concern about the impending passage of the bill is not that 
the changes are the best ones possible or even that they are really 
necessary. My concern is that the bill will be viewed by the 
public as just the latest example of politicians thinking they are 
free to alter any process they believe is not in their personal best 
interest.
<P>
	These commissions have been set up to be free of political 
interference. I can readily imagine the never ending arguments 
and endless disputes which will arise if the issue of electoral 
boundaries were left in the hands of politicians.
<P>
	If I may be so bold I would issue on behalf of all Canadians a 
word of caution to the government. If members opposite 
proceed with this plan it will be viewed as extremely 
self-serving by the general public. Just as in the case of 
gold-plated MP pension plans, expense allowances or other 
benefits of our elected offices, Canadians want to see decision 
making powers regarding these types of things removed from 
the politicians and placed under the jurisdiction of totally 
independent bodies.
<P>
	Canadians are sick and tired of this double standard. There 
appears to be one set of rules for politicians and another quite 
different set for the rest of Canadians. If members have 
legitimate concerns about the changes as proposed by the 
commissions as I do, they should make representations at the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2567"> 2567 </A></B>
<P>
appropriate hearing, not attempt an end run by circumventing 
the process.
<P>
	I do not believe that Liberals have a problem with the process. 
The real reason is that they do not like the results. Even a quick 
comparison between the old electoral boundaries and the 
proposed new ones indicates substantive alterations. Nowhere is 
this more evident than in the present Liberal power base of 
southern Ontario.
<P>
	It is common knowledge that an incumbent enjoys a 
considerable advantage at election time. Over the life of a 
Parliament an MP establishes many contacts within the confines 
of his or her constituency. However when those boundaries are 
subjected to major changes or as in some cases an entire existing 
riding is completely eliminated, the incumbent suffers the loss 
of this comparative advantage. In effect this means he or she is 
virtually starting over. It places challengers on a much more 
even footing during the following election. It is this loss of 
advantage that is behind the government's sudden need for 
further reviews.
<P>
	What will be accomplished by a 24-month delay? I believe it 
is simply the intention of the government to ensure the changes 
do not come into force in time to alter the boundaries prior to the 
next general election. The bill would immediately disband the 
existing commissions and enable the government to form new 
ones with new people two years from now. There is only one 
legitimate reason for delaying the process.
<P>
	There are currently 295 MPs in this place. Surely that is more 
than enough to govern our country. Rather than a further 
increase of six seats as is required under the Constitution 
following the last census, we need fewer MPs, not more. At the 
very least the government should fully and completely commit 
itself to establishing a cap on the total number of members. To 
say it would review the present system of continual increases I 
would contend is simply not good enough. If Canadians are to 
believe the government really intends to limit the number they 
must be able to see that commitment.
<P>
	In summary, the present system allows for input from all 
interested parties. I am prepared to take my turn along with all 
other northern B.C. stakeholders at the hearing in Prince George 
on June 2. I urge members opposite to consider carefully how 
the public will view their intended meddling in this process.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member has stated clearly that his riding would be adversely 
affected by an electoral boundary distribution. He is not happy 
with the proposed redistribution.
<P>
	If this is so, why is there opposition today to the bill? If it will 
adversely affect the member's riding, it is respectfully 
submitted that the member has a duty and a responsibility to 
represent the best interests of his constituents. To oppose the bill 
today is in direct conflict with the best interest of the member's 
constituents and his riding.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	It is unfortunate that the Reform Party insists on 
concentrating its focus on process. It is also unfortunate that the 
member has placed more confidence in the process than 
confidence in his own judgment to make a decision today that 
will protect and safeguard the best interest of his constituents.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are talking about process here. Other than the suspension for 24 
months there is nothing in Bill C-18 that would indicate the 
government intends to follow through with an in-depth review. 
The government has stated that it is not in the bill.
<P>
	We are saying that this is simply a way for the government to 
circumvent the system. Rather than having an open, consultative 
process wherein members of the public, including MPs, are 
quite free to make submissions both written and oral in front of 
the commissions when they are in their areas or our ridings, we 
will refer it to a committee of politicians. It is my contention 
that the public has had enough of that type of attitude.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State 
(Parliamentary Affairs)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would just like to 
make a few remarks about the bill before us today. Of course, 
this bill raises fundamental issues that go to the heart of our 
democratic system and, as members of Parliament, we must 
admit the importance of these issues.
<P>
	It must also be said that the process for redrawing the 
boundaries of electoral districts has been in place since 1964. 
On examining how the present system operates, we clearly see 
that it has several shortcomings. First, the commissions are not 
required to hold consultations before publishing their proposals. 
Second, the commissions are not required to give reasons for 
their proposals. Third, the criteria that the commissions must 
follow in setting the boundaries of electoral districts are very 
general.
<P>
	Depending on the approach taken by the commissions, the 
results can vary considerably from one province to another. If 
we look at the proposals put forward by the commission for the 
province of New Brunswick, we see that the commissions can 
make recommendations which certainly do not represent the 
interests of the people of New Brunswick in this case. We 
received a map making really major changes, where we lose a 
riding in the north of the province and other ridings bring 
together communities that do not have affinities or common 
interests.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2568"> 2568 </A></B>
<P>
	The criteria are so broad that one of the commissioners from 
New Brunswick told me what he thought of the proposed map 
for New Brunswick. He did not agree with the commission's 
proposal even though he was one of the commissioners, but the 
commission could only put forward a single proposal. He told us 
that he had been unable to influence the people on the 
commission to be a little more reasonable.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	What we would like to do in readjusting electoral boundaries 
is just that, propose reasonable changes instead of turning the 
whole system upside down.
<P>
	Finally, based on the existing formula, described in section 51 
of the Constitution Act, 1867, the number of seats in the House 
of Commons will increase from 295 to 301 as result of the 1991 
census, and that concerns me in light of current fiscal restraints.
<P>
	I have heard several members today express concern about the 
extra expenses the government and the people of Canada will 
incur if the number of seats does increase. Members from the 
Reform Party have indicated that this issue should be examined.
<P>
	I will point out to the Reform Party members that the only 
thing to do about this steady increase in the number of seats is to 
suspend the procedure and review it, as we are suggesting.
<P>
	I also heard members say that we are trying to prevent public 
participation in the process. On the contrary! We want to open it 
up, so that the people from all over Canada can speak on this 30 
year-old procedure. I think it is justified.
<P>
	In short, there is certainly no general agreement about the 
current procedure for readjusting the number of seats and 
electoral boundaries. The time has come to subject all elements 
of the present system to a thorough review, which has not been 
done, as I said earlier, since 1964. That is why the government 
has introduced the Act to suspend the operation of the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act. As mentioned earlier, this bill 
would suspend the procedure for twenty-four months.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, to give all members the opportunity to speak on 
this bill and go ahead and suspend the current procedure-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I therefore move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, pursuant to Standing Order 26, the House continue to sit beyond the 
ordinary time of adjournment for the purpose of considering the second reading 
stage of Bill C-18, an act to suspend the operations of the Electoral Boundaries 
Readjustment Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Will those members who 
object to the motion please rise in their place.
<P>
	<I>And more than 15 members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 26(2), the motion is deemed to have been withdrawn.
<P>
	(Motion deemed withdrawn.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I took 
great interest in the comments of the secretary of state.
<P>
	I would like to make a couple of comments. I was interested in 
the fact that there was the motion to extend the sitting, once 
again another attempt to rush this bill through.
<P>
	This bill was tabled in the House on Friday and is being 
debated for the first time today. There has been virtually no 
public discussion. The public discussions the process allows for 
are the independent commission hearings that the bill seeks to 
terminate.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	I find this all very interesting in that we have had a number of 
speakers today and this is really the first debater from another 
political party other than the hon. member for Kamloops who 
gave a very reasoned and considered intervention. We had the 
first two speakers from the government and from the Official 
Opposition. It is not questions and comments, not true debate. 
They just state their position. Since then we have been talking 
here to ourselves.
<P>
	I find it peculiar this great effort we are going through to make 
sure that the public does not have a right to go to the hearing 
process.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member could explain to us precisely why 
that is such an important public policy objective, why it is so 
important that we not get some reaction from the public before 
we continue to debate this particular issue?
<P>
	The member raised some of problems, some of which I am 
more sympathetic to than others. He raised two complaints, 
particularly in relation to the province of New Brunswick. This 
bears some examination. On the one hand he noted the radical 
changes that the commission has proposed in some parts of New 
Brunswick because of population shifts. On the other hand he 
raised concerns about increasing the number of seats in the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	I suppose if we were ultimately to revise the formula, which 
would require a revision to the senatorial clause, so that we were 
able to resist the increase in seats then we would have fewer 
seats in provinces like New Brunswick and we would have even 
more radical changes to the boundaries. This is what I find 
particularly disconcerting. The various reasons that are being 
used, not in this House but sort of in the hallways, for stopping 
this process are a complete contradiction to each other in terms 
of the results that they would bring about.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2569"> 2569 </A></B>
<P>
	Besides his commenting on the necessity of killing this, as a 
government minister would the hon. member favour having a 
public policy objective to this whole thing that the public would 
support limiting the number of seats so that we can proceed to at 
least give the public some reason why we would be interested in 
killing Bill C-18 after we have spent $5 million on the process?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is certainly not our intention 
to rush the bill, in the words of the hon. member who just spoke. 
We simply want to avoid a process like the one now under way, 
that is holding hearings where members or representatives of 
organizations, associations and municipalities wishing to make 
submissions to commissions must give notice, prepare their 
submissions and then appear before the commissions, the 
operations of which we are proposing to abolish. If we suspend 
the entire process, all of this work will have been for nothing. 
We simply want to save money by putting a stop to the process as 
soon as possible.
<P>
	As for the public's participation, we want their input. We want 
the public to have an opportunity to express their views because 
when the matter comes before the House committee, the public 
will certainly be asked to propose ways of changing the process. 
The committee will also likely consider the possibility of 
capping the number of seats in the House at the current level of 
295. Clearly, this is what the Reform Party members want, but 
the government is not prepared at this time to say that it will cap 
the number of seats at 295.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	First, we want to get the public's opinion on this process, if it 
comes to that. I assure you that we want to encourage public 
input in the readjustment of electoral boundaries any way we 
can.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a comment and question for the minister. This is 
a bit of déjà vu. When looking at the history books a very similar 
incident happened in 1974, 20 years back in Canadian history. 
At that time a number of MPs, the majority being Liberal MPs 
on the government side, were not happy with redistribution.
<P>
	I have not had time to read all the <I>Hansards</I> from back then to 
find out what all the reasons were, but the bottom line was that 
members were not happy with redistribution and so they 
interfered with the process. As a result 18 new seats were 
created in Canada.
<P>
	We have no indication from this government that by 
suspending the current process and the commissions in place 
there is goodwill from that side. The purpose of the suspension 
is to cap the number of seats in the House of Commons.
<P>
	I do not think the government has even considered all the 
ramifications of capping seats in the House of Commons. 
Perhaps that is a subject that really needs to be debated at greater 
length in the House.
<P>
	Bill C-18 calls for the commissions currently in place to 
cease to exist upon the passing of Bill C-18. Once the 
suspension is completed, some 24 months later, 60 days later 
new commissions are to be appointed. Certainly the government 
is opening itself up to allegations of patronage. We hope that 
would not be its purpose in suspending this and causing these 
commissions to cease to exist. However, the allegations could 
come.
<P>
	Therefore, if the government wanted to suspend the work of 
these commissions would it reinstate those commissions and 
have them resume their work at the point they were at when the 
suspension took place, thus saving the $5 million?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> Mr. Speaker, if we want to suspend the 
current process, it is because we intend to make a number of 
changes. It would be hard to say: ``We are going to suspend the 
process for 24 months, but after 24 months, we are going to start 
right back at the beginning, without taking into account the 
committee's findings or recommendations''. I do not see how 
we can predict the outcome of the committee's study. It would 
be like saying to people: ``We do not need your input. You have 
nothing to say, everything has already been decided''.
<P>
	As for the hon. member's concern that we could be tempted to 
resort to patronage, I can assure him that this is not what we have 
in mind. The process for selecting commissions is not open to 
this type of action and we have no intention of making changes 
in that regard. However, the committee, which is made up of 
representatives of all parties in this House, could make all kinds 
of recommendations and observations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will begin by expressing my opposition to Bill C-18. I 
also acknowledge the fact that the Liberal government must 
truly be committed to deficit reduction. I can make this 
statement because any government willing to scrap an electoral 
boundary commission report that has cost Canadians nearly $5 
million must be committed to fiscal responsibility.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	To make matters even more convincing, the government will 
be asking Canadian taxpayers to go through this process all over 
again even though the present commissions' report has not been 
tainted by any political influence. Nor is there any outcry from 
Canadians regarding the current redistribution process other 
than the fact that they do not want the number of seats in 
Parliament to increase.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2570"> 2570 </A></B>
<P>
	Perhaps the most troubling aspect of the government's plan is 
that there is no strong defence for interfering with the present 
process before determining if the public hearings are not 
successful. We can also see that throughout Canada's history the 
issue of electoral boundary redistribution has been a contentious 
issue. This hostility is derived from the very premise that those 
who have power are never willing to relinquish their hold on it.
<P>
	I think the idea of politicians redrawing their own boundaries 
lies at the very core of a serious problem in Canada. That 
problem is a lack of trust by the public regarding politicians. It is 
evident therefore that this government does not see that 
Canadians are unhappy with the entire process in which 
politicians have been doing their business. Canadians want 
change. They want a new style of openness. They want a new 
style of fairness. This type of legislation can only be viewed as 
regressive.
<P>
	This House was given the absolute right to redraw the 
electoral boundaries at Confederation. However because of the 
contentious nature of electoral redistribution which I have 
already mentioned Parliament has agreed to share this 
responsibility of redistribution with the electoral boundaries 
commissions created in 1964.
<P>
	Since the creation of these electoral boundaries commissions 
public perception that there are not considerable amounts of 
political interference to the readjustment process has 
diminished. This political interference which took place before 
the creation of the electoral boundaries commissions was an 
attempt to assure as far as possible the re-election of the 
members of the governing party.
<P>
	This is absolutely wrong. I hope that this government is not 
travelling down the same path of early governments.
<P>
	It is important to note that since 1964 while many politicians 
have been unhappy with the outcome of redistributions, there 
has rarely been the concern of political interference. This is for 
the simple fact that these commissions are non-partisan.
<P>
	There are 11 electoral boundaries commissions in Canada, 
one in each of the provinces and one in the Northwest 
Territories. These commissions consist of three members: a 
chairman who is appointed by the chief justice of the province 
from among judges in that province and the other two members 
of the commission are appointed by the Speaker of the House. 
These two individuals are usually university professors or 
non-elected officials of the legislative assemblies.
<P>
	The commission looks primarily at the number of people in 
the province, not political partisanship. They do not consider 
how the changes will affect one party over another. In fact the 
largest criticism of the commissions is they do not consider 
enough non-political information. Many times they overlook 
the common community interests or community identities.
<P>
	It is important to ensure that redistributed boundaries 
correspond as closely as possible to the national quotient while 
also taking into account community interests and the historical 
pattern of an electoral district.
<P>
	These factors then will enable the commissions to properly 
manage the geographic size of districts with sparsely populated 
areas. The commissions are allowed to deviate from the 
provincial average by plus or minus 25 per cent. This allowance 
then allows them to accommodate the human and geographic 
factors.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	Another issue that is troublesome for me is that in 1985 
Parliament passed the Representation Act which set out a 
formula for redistribution. It was a constitutional amendment 
which ensured that no province could have fewer seats than the 
1985 level of representation regardless of the population of that 
province.
<P>
	The exception is P.E.I. which can have no fewer MPs than 
senators. We therefore have done away with the premise of 
absolute representation by population. The government would 
like to suspend the Representation Act and attempt to develop a 
new proposal for the consideration of the House.
<P>
	Let us start with the basic premise of rep by pop. Within the 
concept of representation by population emerges the concept of 
equality of vote. Any notion of equality of rep by pop may 
permit if countered by the fact that the current and historical 
development of representation in Canada has only partially been 
based on the notion of representation by population.
<P>
	Since Confederation, Canada has developed a system with 
respect to electoral representation whereby the heavily 
populated provinces retain a majority of the seats within the 
House of Commons while the less populated provinces receive 
an adequate number of seats to ensure representation.
<P>
	By no means does the federal government reflect the notion of 
representation by population in its purest form. Rep by pop has 
been altered in order to guarantee a minimum number of seats 
within the House to less populated provinces so that they do not 
become under represented if their population base decreases.
<P>
	Thus while the principle of representation by population may 
be said to lie at the heart of the electoral apportionment in 
Canada, it has from the beginning been altered by other factors.
<P>
	Due to Canada's vast geographic size and regional 
differences, a modified version of representation by population 
has emerged. It is therefore determined that the equality of votes 
guaranteed to Canadians is one of relative equality and not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2571"> 2571 </A></B>
<P>
absolute equality. Therefore we do not have equality of voting 
power but rather relative equality of voting power.
<P>
	This relative equality is not just within the provinces but 
between the provinces as well. For example, Nova Scotia and 
New Brunswick constituting 6.1 per cent of the population are 
guaranteed 7 per cent of the seats. Alberta and British Columbia 
comprise just under 22 per cent of the population while we are 
entitled to only 20 per cent of the seats.
<P>
	The west is not only under represented in Parliament, we are 
also under represented in the Senate. How can a region of 
Canada that has less than 11 per cent of the population have over 
28 per cent of the Senate seats while western Canada has over 29 
per cent of the Canadian population with only 23 per cent of 
senate seats. These injustices must be rectified. The west wants 
in.
<P>
	Canada is a country of many regions and there are probably as 
many definitions of regionalism as there are people defining it. 
Regionalism is not some sort of disease to be stamped out. 
Rather it is a healthy manifestation but lacking a healthy 
institutional outlet.
<P>
	The only true significant political failure of the Canadian 
experience is its chronic inability to solve those regional 
tensions. The Senate was established to protect the interests of 
the provinces. Yet, for too long western Canada has felt that its 
interests have not been adequately represented in the federal 
Parliament. The National Energy Program is just one example 
and the possibility of a carbon tax implemented at source is 
another.
<P>
	The Canadian Senate lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many 
Canadians because it is an appointed body that runs counter to 
the fundamental Canadian belief that democratic governments 
should be conducted by an elected rather than an appointed 
body. What Canadians need is a triple-E Senate, an effective, 
elected and equal Senate. A reformed Senate will not just benefit 
one province or one region. It will help build a better and 
stronger Canada.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	We should have an elected Parliament based solely on 
representation by population with a constant number of 
members of Parliament. This concept will only work if we have 
an elected Senate to which all regions of Canada have an equal 
number of senators.
<P>
	This would ensure that Parliament reflects the notion of one 
man, one vote, and allows the Senate to reflect the regional 
interests of our nation.
<P>
	Moving on to specific recommendations of the recent 
electoral boundaries commission which has recommended that 
Calgary be given one additional seat for a total of seven, while 
Edmonton in Alberta would remain at six and 26 respectively, it 
was encouraging that the commission did recognize that Calgary 
and Edmonton have traditionally the same number of 
representatives in Ottawa.
<P>
	Because the number of electoral districts for Edmonton 
remains at six the proposed changes to the boundaries are 
relatively minor. The changes that will be made to my riding are 
not extensive and I feel that they have been done in a just 
manner.
<P>
	Edmonton-Strathcona's population will be almost 16 per 
cent above the provincial average yet it is well within the 
established plus or minus 25 per cent deviation.
<P>
	Although I do not wholeheartedly agree with this plus or 
minus 25 per cent as an absolute figure, I do agree that there 
needs to be some allowance in riding size because of urban and 
rural differences. However I am not convinced that the deviation 
presently allowed has not been picked arbitrarily.
<P>
	Why should it not be plus or minus 20 per cent, 15 per cent, 10 
per cent? However, this is an issue that I will leave to debate 
another day and I will continue with the specific changes to 
Edmonton-Strathcona recommended by the commission.
<P>
	The southern tip of Edmonton-Strathcona will be lost to 
Edmonton Southwest while we gain the northeastern part of 
Edmonton Southeast riding. Although I realize the need for 
redistribution, I do have some trouble with the map that has been 
made for Edmonton. However, with a few minor changes in the 
electoral boundaries which would ensure that the riding 
populations of the rest of Edmonton are closer than they are 
presently, I can see nothing else that is substantially wrong with 
the commission's report. These small changes could be made 
through the public consultation process.
<P>
	In fact these consultations or hearings are to begin in Quebec 
on April 12. They will move across Canada over the next three 
months and are due to hold hearings in Edmonton on April 28 at 
two o'clock and at 7.30 p.m. at the Macdonald Hotel.
<P>
	The present process of designing constituencies by 
independent boundaries commissions for each province has 
worked well. We do not need a change for the sake of change. If 
the electoral boundaries commissions were inherently flawed 
then changes would be made. However, this has not been shown 
to be the case.
<P>
	The use of such non-partisan commissions has made it 
possible to give consideration to community interest criteria 
without including a partisan tone to the nature of the equation 
and/or the process.
<P>
	These independent commissions have allowed us to redraw 
constituencies based primarily on equality of the vote which 
includes specific criteria based on a national quotient and have 
also included a need for justification of variations that deviate 
dramatically from the quotient.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2572"> 2572 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, this process has worked and it has been fair. 
Any alteration to the process will raise suspicions and a sense of 
unfairness among the Canadian public. Bill C-18 does not give 
the appearance of fairness to the Canadian public.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate my hon. colleague's concerns about Bill 
C-18 that is being introduced. Every elector in my riding of 
Kindersley-Lloydminster received a map of the new 
boundaries two or three weeks ago. I have not heard a public 
outcry even though my riding boundaries have been quite 
drastically changed.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	The current riding of Kindersley-Lloydminster will not 
exist after the readjustment takes place as proposed in the 
current report by the boundaries commission. In spite of that I 
have not had a hue and outcry from the public. I know as an MP I 
have some concerns. I know my constituency association has 
some concerns. However the general public seems more 
concerned about other decisions made in the House such as 
dollars spent.
<P>
	Has the hon. member had an outcry of concern from his riding 
regarding the new boundary proposals, or would he sense it 
being more a concern of politicians and political organizations?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanrahan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have had concerns expressed 
to me with regard to the boundary changes. I have also had 
constituents recognize that the process by which they can 
express their concerns to the commission is a valid one. They are 
much more confident with that process than with a committee of 
politicians deciding on where boundaries should or should not 
be.
<P>
	They are concerned but they see the opportunity they have to 
express those concerns in a traditional and fair manner.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
acknowledge my hon. colleague's comments and his 
presentation in the House tonight. There are several points I 
would make. I ask my colleague if he would care to respond to 
the points I am going to bring forward, one of which is clarity of 
purpose.
<P>
	It seems to me that anything we would do in the House of 
Commons would always have a clarity of purpose and that we 
would always know, by having defined that clarity of purpose, 
where we were going.
<P>
	We heard earlier from the side of the House from which I am 
speaking that perhaps it was personal self-interest that 
motivated some of the comments in today's discussions by the 
government side. Indeed those members mobilized themselves 
extremely well in terms of putting the bill forward, hastily I 
might add.
<P>
	When we have a clarity of purpose it is only the beginning of a 
process. I would like my hon. colleague to comment. Having 
extended the clarity of purpose perhaps we then have the review. 
However the review is only one small part of what comes next, a 
broad analysis  of what the review has told us, followed at that 
point by drawing conclusions and then making 
recommendations.
<P>
	All this would be in very open debate; all this would be very 
much in the public view. If the bill had died tonight constituents 
across the country who watched the debate would have seen only 
a few of us make presentations in the House today. We have an 
obligation to our constituents to ensure that in the fullness of 
debate the richness of our ideas is shared with them.
<P>
	Does my hon. colleague wish to make some comments on 
that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanrahan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with my colleague in 
terms of quality of purpose. I suggest to her that the vast 
majority of Canadians would also agree with her.
<P>
	I would agree with her and Canadians would agree with her on 
the very point that the process as it now exists is separate from 
politicians rather than involving politicians. They have seen it 
work over a period of time. What it seems to be in this instance is 
change for the sake of change. I do not believe that change is for 
the benefit of the Canadian people. I doubt very much if my 
constituents or anyone else in the country would see it in that 
manner.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, are 
the same kinds of things that happened in the boundary changes 
of the member for Edmonton-Strathcona happening in 
Okanagan Centre? If I heard correctly the southwest portion of 
the constituency will be lost or will be added. There may be 
some confusion as to the economic and social benefits if this 
were to happen.
<P>
	The southern part of Okanagan Centre is being taken out of 
the constituency and put into the Penticton riding or the 
Similkameen riding. That will not benefit that particular 
community because people naturally go to Cologne to do their 
shopping and so on.
<P>
	Could the hon. member for Edmonton-Strathcona detail 
exactly what is happening in his constituency with regard to the 
new boundaries?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanrahan:</B> Mr. Speaker, in terms of 
Edmonton-Strathcona it is geographically located in south 
central Edmonton. We are losing part of the southern tip and 
gaining part of the eastern section of it. In terms of 
socioeconomic changes, they are minimal. I do not see that it is 
going to be of major significance to my riding. We are studying 
that now.
<P>
	As I suggested there is a process in place at Hotel Macdonald 
on April 28. If we have problems with it we will submit them to 
the commission.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the applause from both sides of the House. I think it is 
someone dying to speak over there who has been thwarted 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2573"> 2573 </A></B>
<P>
perhaps in the debate today. They want to say something more. 
Who knows?
<P>
	Let us look for a few moments at how the bill came to be and 
what some of the reasons are for the incredible crisis that is 
under way and why it has to be dealt with so quickly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Because they are getting rid of Beaver River.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> My friend says: ``Because they are getting rid of 
Beaver River''. Let us cut to the basics here. That is very true. It 
would be easy for me to stand today in the House of Commons 
and say I think that shelving the whole thing is a marvellous 
idea. We would then see a cocooning of Beaver River and, if it 
were politically motivated, I would say: ``Whew, that makes me 
safe''.
<P>
	There is something far deeper, far more democratically 
essential in terms of this debate. Whether I would lose my 
constituency or whether my neighbour from 
Kindersley-Lloydminister would, as is the case as well, that is 
not the issue. People watching the debate need to be aware of 
exactly what is going here and the things they have heard from 
just one party in the House. Granted, the government House 
leader spoke and someone from the Bloc spoke, but basically 
they have heard from the Reform Party.
<P>
	Why has the Reform Party been talking about this bill all day 
long? Why are we concerned about the whole idea? If it were 
just political we would say: ``Let us put the thing off, shelve it 
for two years, and get back to looking at the details later''. That 
is not the case here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> Yes, it is.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Certain people have talked about it on the 
government side but basically only in questions and comments. 
I think that would be the general consensus in the House. They 
have probably been asked not to speak because they wanted the 
debate to die out, as we saw when they requested extra time. Let 
us not be foolish. There are people who have all kinds of 
concerns. We will continue to talk about this matter until 
something is done about democracy in the country. We would 
not see politicians getting in the way of electoral boundaries 
commissions that have been set up. We can talk about reasons: 
why they are set up and whether they are politically motivated. I 
will talk about that for a couple of minutes also.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	As soon as politicians get their hands into the tub we know 
there is something going wrong in the Chamber that is filtering 
out across the country. We are saying it must stop. We are not 
trying to be sanctimonious. I am not standing here trying to be 
self-righteous because I stand to lose. My constituency of 
Beaver River was brand new in 1988. It lived through the 1988 
election and the 1993 election, and under this proposal it stands 
to die.
<P>
	It is easy for someone to sit on the other side, chuckle about it 
and say: ``Look at her''. However, I have no seat in which to run 
in the next election. I want that very clear and I want that on the 
record. I stand here and that Beaver River lives, but let us make 
sure Beaver River has a chance to live in terms of the process of 
going to the hearings and making representations on April 27 
and April 28. That is what we are talking about here.
<P>
	It is easy to ask whether this was politically motivated. That is 
not for me to say. This is supposed to be a commission that has 
worked at arm's length from the government. I cannot quarrel or 
quibble with that.
<P>
	Recently I was at a hockey game in Elk Point and player came 
off the benches to me and asked: ``Deborah, could they not have 
made it any more subtle that they were trying to get rid of you''? 
Of course the circumstances were such that in the last 
Parliament I sat here as the only Reform member in all of 
Canada. My friend from Edmonton-Strathcona just mentioned 
that the head justice of each province was set up by the chief 
justice of the province. We have that situation in Alberta and the 
two members of the commission, one from Calgary and one 
from Edmonton, were appointed by the Speaker of the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	If in Elk Point, Alberta, somebody comes off a hockey bench 
and says ``boy, it sure looks political to me'', we need to pay 
attention. It is not self-righteous to stand here and say that is all 
they are trying to do. That is not the point.
<P>
	We are trying to say that something has been set up here 
whether or not we like it. Whether my friend's riding in 
Vancouver has been blitzed is not the issue. My friend from 
Vancouver should be there, absolutely firmly at those public 
hearings. That is his chance to talk about it. He should not hurl 
insults and comments across the House of Commons because it 
gains nothing. It is his party that has brought it in.
<P>
	It is sad to me that the public is feeling skeptical about the 
matter. Members of my party from various ridings have said 
today that they did not think there was much a hue and cry. 
Maybe in their ridings there has not been, but certainly in 
Beaver River there has been.
<P>
	The constituency of Beaver River, although it was a brand 
new riding in name in 1988, has a marvellous history in north 
eastern Alberta. The Beaver River itself is an amazing waterway 
which was a trading route for the fur traders or the voyageurs 
into the Athabasca region. They came to Lac-la-Biche, up the 
Beaver River, portaged very few miles across to the Athabasca 
and were gone all the way north.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2574"> 2574 </A></B>
<P>
	It was a really exciting moment in our history when people on 
the previous commission decided that Beaver River riding 
would be named. As I have said, why would the constituency 
have such a short history?
<P>
	In terms of setting records, if this bill goes through as 
proposed, yes, they will shelve it for 24 months. That is fine but 
what will happen after? If it goes through I will have sat as the 
only member of Parliament for the entire life of the constituency 
of Beaver River. We feel old and start looking old quickly in this 
place, but it seems to me that is a pretty short shelf life for a 
constituency.
<P>
	I am not arguing all in favour of the proposal because I have 
some serious reservations about it. I have been in touch with the 
person with whom we are to get in touch to say that I will be 
appearing in Lac-la-Biche, Alberta, at McArthur Place on 
Wednesday, April 17, 1994, at 7.30 p.m. That is where I am to go 
as a citizen and as a member of Parliament. That is what was set 
up in terms of stages that we are to go through.
<P>
	I sent in my notice saying that I would be appearing before 
this public hearing commission. Why should that be kiboshed? 
If I have any reservations about it, it would be just to ask one 
question: why did the commissioners draw up their lines first 
and consult second?
<P>
<B>(1830 ) </B>
<P>
	I have problems with the process. I have problems with the 
map that has been redrawn because I have serious reservations 
about totally eliminating a particular constituency that is brand 
new. I have a method in place to go and voice my concerns and 
my complaints about that. That is to go and talk to the people at 
the public hearings.
<P>
	Five million dollars has been spent on this already and are we 
going to throw it off on the shelf?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That was the Tories, not by us.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Nonetheless, how much will it cost to redo this 
completely? How much does it cost for lost time when the 
government is trying so desperately to get some other bills 
through vis-à-vis money and the borrowing authority?
<P>
	We look at things that it wants to put through Parliament and 
then all of a sudden now we have a crisis that we need royal 
assent just as quickly as possible.
<P>
	Why is it that people are so frustrated with this? There are 
problems but could it be that they would be losing out 
politically? That is the one thing that this commission was set up 
originally to do, to try to keep politicians' hands out of the 
works of this. If ever we have seen politicians' hands and dirty 
finger marks all over everything we see it today in this Chamber 
on March 21, 1994. That is a sad day in Canada as far as I am 
concerned.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I know that the 
member for Beaver River has seized her colleagues' attention 
opposite but I certainly do not want to miss anything either.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are talking about details in the 
way that this is set up versus process. That is what I am trying to 
draw to the attention of members opposite. I do not particularly 
like the way this is drawn up. I made that very clear. I have 
obviously riled some people on the other side of the House.
<P>
	I disagree with the way it is. I have constituents who are very 
upset about it. Nonetheless, when we look at a process that is 
flawed and only becomes more seriously flawed when we all get 
into it, that is what I am expressing concern about. I think that is 
probably what we have heard more and more.
<P>
	Let me address a couple of other issues before I close. Does 
this further divide rural and urban Canada? I spent my first 25 
years living in Vancouver which is about to lose a riding, as I 
understand from the other side. I grew up practically in 
downtown Vancouver. I know what it is like to be a city person. I 
know the concerns of urban Canada.
<P>
	I live in northeastern rural Alberta by choice. Many people are 
born in areas and there they are, citizens of that area just 
because. I chose to leave Vancouver and teach school in 
northeastern Alberta and so I am a rural Albertan by choice.
<P>
	To me that says a lot. I realize both sides of the coin. I know 
what it is like to live in the city and to be able to go to the 
symphony which is about six or eight minutes from home. I also 
know what it is like to watch the Edmonton Oilers play hockey 
or watch the Edmonton Eskimos play football when it is a three 
hour, one way drive for me. I know what it is like to be a rural 
Canadian.
<P>
	I would like to invite the commissioners who sit as the Alberta 
commissioners, two from Calgary, one from Edmonton, to come 
and spend a week with me in Beaver River, in my four by four. 
They would understand what rural Canada is all about. They 
would understand what it is like to travel 28,000 square 
kilometres regularly from end to end of our constituency. In 
terms of square kilometres mine is far smaller than many others. 
If we look at the map, if we look at the riding which is north of 
mine, Peace River, Athabasca, those take up physically literally 
half of Alberta's square kilometres.
<P>
	Beaver River is small in comparison to that but I would love 
the commissioners to come with me in my four by four. I 
appreciate my friend from Broadview-Greenwood. We have 
known each other well over the years. I always remember his 
saying he could ride around Broadview-Greenwood on his 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2575"> 2575 </A></B>
<P>
bicycle in about an hour and a half. I have given him a standing 
invitation to come on out to the ``Beav'' and we would see how 
far he would get on his bicycle-not very.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	I looked up the mileage of the three vehicles that I have gone 
through since my election in March 1989. There is my basic four 
by four that I spend most of my time in the riding with. I have 
also put lots of miles on my truck and camper, a small car and 
another truck when I have needed to.
<P>
	On my four by four that I do most of my business travelling 
with I have put 324,000 kilometres. I am no mathematician but I 
divided that out. It is basically 8,000 kilometres across Canada. 
That is 40.5 trips from sea to sea across and around Beaver 
River. That is an incredible number of miles.
<P>
	Rural Canada is an exciting place to live but let me tell 
members that in terms of hours and time and driving and getting 
around, driving two hours or three hours one way to a one and a 
half hour meeting and then turning around driving three hours 
home again is an incredible amount of time chewed up. 
However, it is peaceful time.
<P>
	Telephone time, if I need that, is marvellous. Why would we 
take that away from people? What is wrong with urban Canada's 
getting to know its country cousins better? Why could we not 
redraw these boundaries by taking a corner of the population out 
of a city and moving it into the rural areas? Why do we need to 
be so firm and obsessed with city boundaries all the time?
<P>
	Why not take a corner out of some of the population of four or 
five thousand people in Edmonton and tell them they have 
something in common with these people? The guidelines that 
the commissioners were given say that boundary readjustment 
must take into account human interests and geographic 
characteristics.
<P>
	Every one of those people who lives in Edmonton, Toronto or 
whatever is eating the bread that was grown for them on these 
farms. They do have something in common with urban and rural 
Canada. Why do we not celebrate that instead of always moving 
it off against each other? There are such divisions between the 
country and the city. We need to celebrate what we share in 
common rather than saying that person is from the country, that 
one is from the city and we have nothing more to gain from each 
other, we have precious little in common.
<P>
	That is wrong. That is incorrect. We need to look at these 
things and say that there are problems in the way this 
commission has gone about doing it. However, that is not the 
end of the world. One does not make a matter worse by having 
the government and the Official Opposition jump up and say that 
we should shelve it, that we should try to come up with 
something better.
<P>
	I would be in favour of that if I had a list of possibilities of 
what might be better. I really would. Let us make sure that we 
have some options on the table rather than saying that we will 
put a committee together. I get nervous when I see things like 
that and when I hear things like that.
<P>
	As rural Canada and rural MPs are called upon to represent 
larger and larger areas, we need to be very careful that we do not 
get into the situation in which MPs feel absolutely worthless 
because they simply cannot cover the physical distance.
<P>
	I think of my friend to the north of me from Athabasca, an 
incredibly large area. There is my friend from the western Arctic 
and my friend from Churchill. How do they get around? Why 
would we in Beaver River say that we are totally happy with 
being able to say take the north end of the riding and move it up 
to Athabasca, it can use a few thousand square kilometres extra, 
what the world? When one has 200,000 what is another 10,000 
or 15,000?
<P>
	Those are people who live there. Those are real people who 
live in Lac-la-Biche and they want to see their MP. They want to 
talk to their MP and know what their MP looks like and thinks. 
What about the people who live in St. Paul and Bonnyville and 
Cold Lake? They are going to become part of the 
Vegreville-St. Paul riding then, no problem. We will just throw 
a few thousand square kilometres on to that riding.
<P>
	There have been rapports built up with members of 
Parliament. I suspect that is why there is nervousness built up on 
the government benches to a great extent. They have built up 
rapports with their constituents, absolutely. I have built up a 
rapport with mine. I have a fine group of people I represent and I 
am proud to say that I am the representative of Beaver River.
<P>
	What about the people in bedroom communities of Edmonton, 
Namao, Gibbons, Bon Accord, Redwater? Those people are 
going to become part of Elk Island. Sorry, folks, we will just add 
a few thousand square kilometres on to Elk Island. My friend 
from Elk Island will represent any number of other towns. As I 
have heard so often today, the split or the general movement or 
flow of those people probably would not be to that area but to the 
west of them, over to St. Albert.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	This is flawed. I have serious problems with it but the reason 
we are so concerned about this, let me reiterate very firmly, is 
that the process for this is dreadfully flawed. The process in my 
neighbour's province of Saskatchewan is the same thing.
<P>
	Under this particular format it may lose a seat. We look at 
constitutional limitations on it. That is one thing. Do we toss it 
aside and say we are going to try and come up with something 
better? I hardly think so.
<P>
	What about my neighbours in my home province of British 
Columbia where the population is growing at an incredibly rapid 
rate? They have some serious considerations about the flaws in 
this as well, where things were drawn up, where there are so 
many people.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2576"> 2576 </A></B>
<P>
	Look at discrepancies in constituency numbers. These people 
need a chance to be able to say they will go to those hearings and 
we as Canadians or as members of Parliament will go to those 
public hearings because that is the system, that is the way it was 
set up and that is exactly what we need to do, not sit here in 
Parliament and cook up some deal in which we will shelve the 
thing for 24 months.
<P>
	In closing, I hope that the Canadian public has learned 
something here today in terms of process about this whole 
review. Let us make sure that Parliament does not have its 
fingerprints all over this process. Let us open it up. Let us 
consult the people first and then make decisions.

	<B>Mr. Comuzzi:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I wish to 
pose some questions to the previous speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I regret the time has 
lapsed. I am sure the hon. member for Thunder Bay-Nipigon 
will seek the next opportunity to ask questions of his colleague 
opposite, the member for Beaver River.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEENVIRONMENT">THE ENVIRONMENT</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Mr. Speaker, back in 
February the Minister of the Environment stated in the House 
her intention to review the present situation and to propose 
within four to six months timetables and schedules for the 
phasing out of toxic chemicals in the Great Lakes, particularly 
of organochlorines.
<P>
	Chlorine is at the centre of a controversy because of its 
impacts on the environment and on human health. On one hand 
chlorine has been very useful but it is also has negative effects.
<P>
	Today there are about 15,000 chlorinated compounds in use 
by industry. In addition, many byproducts are produced when 
chlorine is used in processes such as pulp and paper and vinyl 
manufacturing. These byproducts include such toxic persistent 
substances as dioxins, furans and PCBs.
<P>
	Organochlorines are known to be persistent in the 
environment and to build up in the food chain.
<P>
	A number of health problems are associated with 
organochlorines and mounting evidence indicates that some 
organochlorines can cause not only cancer, but also reproductive 
dysfunctions, endochrine disruptions, developmental 
impairments, and immunological effects.
<P>
	The International Joint Commission on the Great Lakes has 
recently recommended first, the virtual elimination of persistent 
toxic substances from the Great Lakes, including the use of 
chlorine and chlorine-containing compounds as chemical 
feedstocks in industry. Second, the elimination of other chlorine 
uses or at least their reduction and, third, a shift from 
government or the public having to prove the danger of a product 
to the chemical industry so that it would be the chemical 
industry that would have to prove the product or a substance is 
not harmful.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	In addition, the International Joint Commission is urging 
industry to rethink its practices in order to eliminate the 
production of persistent toxic substances, a much better 
preventive approach than the reacting and curing approach we 
have at the present time.
<P>
	Many scientists are saying that organo-chlorines are a 
problem from a public health point of view. While some 
organo-chlorines might be generally safe, they should earn their 
designation as safe through good, solid science and through a 
shift in the onus of proof.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I urge the Minister of the Environment 
to announce a plan for the gradual elimination of industrial 
chlorine use as recommended by the International Joint 
Commission. Also, I urge the minister to set up a strategy and a 
timetable for examining the possibility of reducing or 
eliminating other uses of chlorine and other persistent toxic 
substances.
<P>
	In conclusion, it seems to me that in 1994 the Minister of the 
Environment has the opportunity to act and to plan a transition 
as called for by the International Joint Commission which 
recommends the adoption of a virtual elimination strategy 
within two years. This action requires political will and 
commitment, of course. The Minister of the Environment and 
Deputy Prime Minister has the power to prove that this Liberal 
government is committed to the Great Lakes Water Quality 
Agreement which as we all know commits the Government of 
Canada and that of the United States of America to a toxic free 
water body for the benefit of Canadians and Americans.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government has been following the chlorine issue 
extremely closely. So far the government's policy has focused 
its regulations and control efforts on chlorinated compounds 
demonstrated to be toxic and on the processes that generate 
them.
<P>
	Environment Canada and Health Canada have undertaken a 
science-based examination of 22 chlorine compounds and have 
shown 14 of them to be toxic either to the environment or human 
health.
<P>
	We are determined to address this issue through the CEPA, the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act, a review that will start 
very shortly through the Standing Committee on Environment 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2577"> 2577 </A></B>
<P>
and Sustainable  Development of which my hon. colleague is the 
chairman.
<P>
	Through the Great Lakes action plans and programs in place 
already and through close interaction with other countries, 
especially the United States, we need to establish strategies 
along with our neighbours to the south to reduce, prohibit and 
substitute for the use of chlorine and chlorinated compounds. 
The U.S. is now proposing a task force with timetables to 
establish a definite action plan that will define the ways to 
reduce, prohibit and substitute the use of chlorine.
<P>
	Currently the Minister of the Environment is convening a 
consultation process of multi-stakeholders to do exactly this, to 
try and define an action plan to reduce, prohibit and substitute 
the use of chlorine. This action plan should be ready by the late 
spring of this year.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INFORMATIONHIGHWAY">INFORMATION HIGHWAY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle):</B> Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker and members of the House, for the opportunity of being 
able to speak in this House. It is a rare opportunity for some of 
us.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	The question I am raising tonight is a question that I raised in 
the House on March 15. It concerns Rogers' takeover of 
Maclean Hunter and the virtual monopoly that Rogers 
Communication will have on the information highway.
<P>
	Rogers Communication with this takeover will have some 43 
per cent control over Canadians who are hooked into the cable 
system. In Ontario it is over 70 per cent.
<P>
	My question to the government was to request it to either set 
up a special committee of Parliament or to ask the standing 
committee for the Department of Heritage to have special 
hearings, not just on Rogers' takeover but on the whole question 
of what is the public interest in the information highway.
<P>
	I acknowledged in my question that both the CRTC and the 
Competition Tribunal will have to hold hearings and approve 
this takeover. My position is we must first define what is in the 
public interest in terms of the evolution of the information 
highway.
<P>
	Mr. Rogers might be quite correct in claiming that we need 
large monopoly type organizations or companies in order to 
compete with the Americans and to take full advantage of the 
technologies available. If he is right then basically what he is 
saying is that he is a natural monopoly like telephone, like 
power and other utilities. If that is the case then we must look to 
make certain that the proper regulations are in place. This type 
of work, I suggest, should be done by a parliamentary 
committee.
<P>
	I noticed later last week that the government had set up a 
commission under the chairmanship of Mr. David Johnston from 
McGill University. The discouraging part, when I read about 
this in the Thursday, March 17 edition of the <I>Citizen</I>, is that most 
of these hearings will be held in private and not open to the 
public.
<P>
	I wish to underline the importance of an open public process 
in which all the players, including the public, can participate. I 
would also suggest that this is a creative way of using members 
of Parliament and the existing committee system. I could 
envisage working very closely with the departments involved, 
including the Department of Canadian Heritage, the bureaucrats 
in that department working with the committee, to work 
together on a co-operative basis to develop a position of what is 
in the public interest.
<P>
	I was also somewhat encouraged by the response of the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry. I believe 
that the parliamentary secretary left open the possibility of 
using members of Parliament either in a specially struck 
committee or in the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage 
to deal with this issue. I believe this is an issue that should be 
dealt with by committee and utilizing the work of the House.
<P>
	Let me again underline the importance of what is happening 
here. Never before has a development of this magnitude, that is 
Rogers' takeover of MacLean Hunter, been seen in the Canadian 
history of cultural industries. It creates a virtual monopoly. It is 
a turning point in Canada's technological and cultural future. 
Therefore, it is essential that the public interest be defined and 
that this be done through a committee of the House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I begin by thanking the member for 
his concern on both of these issues.
<P>
	First, the information highway will be a cornerstone for future 
industrial development and economic growth. The development 
of innovative products and technology will provide Canada and 
Canadian businesses with the infrastructure and technology 
necessary to compete successfully in international markets.
<P>
	On Wednesday, March 16, the Minister of Industry announced 
that Mr. David Johnston, the vice-chancellor of McGill 
University, will be the the chairperson for the advisory council 
for the information highway. The advisory council will assist 
the Minister of Industry to develop a Canadian strategy for the 
information highway.
<P>
	The council will analyse and provide advice on general 
matters of policy and strategy to ensure that Canada has access 
to the benefit of advanced communications information 
services. The council will also be accepting submissions from 
Canadians in any area of interest to them.

<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	I want to say to the member that in my own community with 
the assistance of constituents and Mark Cameron and Roman 
Kowalczuk, members of my support staff, we are beginning to 
set up a community centre for information access on this very 
important subject.
<P>
	I welcome members of the House and all Canadians to write 
for information on how to set up one of these systems in their 
community. We will supply them with the information. We are 
very much concerned that we bring this issue into the public 
forum. It is moving fast. It is complex and we want to make sure 
that public participation is involved all the way along.
<P>
	Getting back to the advisory council, it is not being 
established to review the proposed merger of Rogers 
Communications and Maclean Hunter. Issues concerning the 
merger will be addressed by regulatory bodies under existing 
legislation.
<P>
	Pursuant to the Broadcasting Act which Parliament passed in 
1991 a change in ownership of cable companies greater than 30 
per cent requires the approval of the Canadian Radio-television 
and Telecommunications Commission. The CRTC has broad 
powers and a fact finding mandate that will explore and examine 
the issues in this takeover to ensure it is in the public interest.
<P>
	Once the CRTC has received the application from Rogers 
Communications, it will make plans to schedule public hearings 
for the takeover of Maclean Hunter. Any group or organization 
that has an interest can request to be heard by the CRTC at those 
hearings.
<P>
	Furthermore the takeover will also be reviewed by the 
director of investigation and research pursuant to the powers 
vested in him by the Competition Act. It is also important to 
allow these officials to proceed as currently planned.

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is a question for the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration.
<P>
	Since the minister announced that next year's level of 
immigration will be 250,000 I have received only critical 
comments from my constituents concerning this decision. Other 
Reform members of Parliament have had the same experience. 
We are getting clear signals from the people of Canada that they 
want less immigration.
<P>
	Last week I asked the minister about the contacts his office 
has had concerning the same matter. I received no answer and 
instead received a lecture about the merit of the government's 
determination to stick to policies regardless of public opinion 
polls and comments received from the general public.
<P>
	I find this attitude of the government policymakers arrogant, 
elitist and undemocratic. When this government was in 
opposition its MPs were constantly arguing against government 
policies on the grounds that the people did not want such things 
as free trade and the GST. Power corrupts. Now the people's 
wishes no longer matter.
<P>
	I ask the minister again a simple and straightforward question 
which should be answerable in simple terms. How many 
contacts from the public has he received critical and supportive 
of the immigration levels since he has announced them?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for Capilano-Howe Sound for his intervention.
<P>
	I must say that counting the number of representations on any 
issue is really no way to determine the wishes of the majority of 
Canadians. It is also no way to determine whether public policy 
reflects the opinion of the people of Canada.
<P>
	Write in campaigns initiated by certain groups distort reality. 
All of us who have sat in this House for any length of time are 
aware of that. They only reflect the opinion of the particular 
group. With the greatest of respect, I might remind the hon. 
member that we on this side of the House who did win the 
majority of seats campaigned on exactly the immigration level 
the hon. minister brought forward this year.
<P>
	The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration is aware that 
many Canadians are concerned however about the future 
directions of the immigration program. That is why on February 
2 of this year he launched a major public consultation process 
that will help shape this country's immigration policy for the 
next decade.
<P>
	His intentions are clear. He wants to hear from Canadians 
through an open and informed discussion. The process will set 
the stage for establishing a new 10-year framework for 
immigration and a new immigration plan.
<P>
	The minister has stated on numerous occasions he has no 
intention of formulating immigration policy on public opinion 
polls, but by an open and frank discussion of the facts, not the 
myths.
<P>
	In the red book this party described our policies. Canadians 
accepted them through the national and democratic election. 
The 1994 levels fulfil the red book commitments, including a 
total immigration of approximately 1 per cent of the Canadian 
population and a priority to family and independent immigrants.
<P>
	The Reform Party is calling for cuts to levels which would 
reduce immigration levels by 100,000 people. The only way to
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2579"> 2579 </A></B>
<P>
do that is to modify the eligibility criteria which means 
changing the rules of who gets in and who does not.
<P>
	This is a very important issue which deserves input and 
discussion by as many Canadians as possible, not just a few 
letter writers in a few constituencies.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 7.03 p.m., this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
