In the documents I provided you this morning was a copy of the draft bill which was circulated by the Sierra Club and other environmental groups on Friday, October 13 at a press conference in the Charles Lynch Theatre where they were giving their commentary on the various provisions of the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204428"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, the government held a lock-up for the media from 9:00 a.m. to 10:15 a.m., as evidence of the necessity for maintaining confidentiality and secrecy of a government bill until it is duly tabled in the House, which was just done. Under the rules of Parliament, government bills are secret until they are tabled in the House for the first reading so the public does not know before Parliament knows. In the case where there is a contravention of that, it is, I believe, a prima facie matter of a breach of my and all hon. members' parliamentary privilege that there was a leak of a bill prior to it being tabled in the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204429"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any cabinet minister, official or other person who had access to the bill releases such bill, it still remains the responsibility of the government House leader or his authorized designate to ensure the secrecy provisions are protected until the bill is tabled. This is obviously done so that no other party has a substantial advantage or in fact disadvantage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204430"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, in the document that was presented at the October 13 press conference, which I provided to you, you will note that on the top of the page where we would normally see the word “secret”, the word has been whited out or blacked out so that it is unreadable. However, you will also note that on page 10 of the document the word “secret“ was inadvertently missed and not blacked out. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204431"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, on the basis of the information that I have provided to you, I believe there is substantive evidence that a secret document has been circulated in the public domain prior to it being tabled in Parliament, which would appear to constitute a breach of parliamentary privilege.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204432"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Speaker should find a prima facie case of a breach of privilege, I am prepared to move the appropriate motion.</div>

    </p><a name="Para204453"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allegation I am bringing forward is that the chair of the Subcommittee on the Review of the Anti-terrorism Act, a subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security, released to the media, specifically to the <i>National Post</i> and reporter Andrew Mayeda, the substantial contents of the interim report of that subcommittee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204454"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That interim report has been dealt with and reported out of the subcommittee. Mr. Speaker, I am trying to be very careful because I do not want to breach the confidentiality that the chair of this committee did. I believe it is simply appropriate for me to say that it has been reported out of the subcommittee and has been dealt with at the full committee. It is awaiting delivery to the House, which is expected shortly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204455"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the interim, the chair took it upon himself to release to the media basically the contents of it, the principal recommendations in particular, as already mentioned.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204456"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, if you wish, you can look at yesterday's <i>Quorum</i> at page 10, where that article is reproduced. It was also on the front page of the <i>National Post</i> yesterday morning.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204457"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear from the history of Parliament, this House of Commons, for quite some time that the breach of confidentiality is a breach of my privilege and that of every member of the House. It is a breach because it allows certain members of the House to have information in advance of the balance. That is the reason for the rule.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204458"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to draw to your attention, Mr. Speaker, the comments in Marleau and Montpetit at page 884. At the very bottom of the full text in the last full paragraph, it is stated:</div>
    </p><a name="Para204459"></a><p>
      <div>

            <td width="15" align="right"></td>

</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para204460"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what occurred on this occasion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204461"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marleau and Montpetit go on to say:</div>
    </p><a name="Para204462"></a><p>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para204465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marleau and Montpetit go on to  emphasize the seriousness of this conduct on page 885 and state:</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para204467"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot even talk about the interim reports at that stage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204468"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on that information, it is quite clear that there has been a breach of confidentiality and the privilege of the House. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204469"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Mr. Speaker, I would refer you to a ruling by Speaker Parent in the 2000-04 Parliament. The facts of the situation were similar to what you heard earlier today in another matter of privilege. It was raised, successfully, by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78576,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78576&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Provencher</A>, who is now our justice minister. That was a situation where, again, the government of the day had given information to the media. The media released that information prior to the bill--this was a bill rather than a report--coming into the House. Speaker Parent found at that time that this was a clear breach of members' privilege and it was dealt with by referring it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make one additional point with regard to the conduct. Again, I am trying to be very careful not to breach the confidentiality as the chair of the subcommittee did. The report, which I have in my hand right now, is 25 pages long. At the top of every one of those pages is the word “confidential”. Every single page has it.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015">(1015)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para204471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no ability on the part of that member, the chair, to claim any lack of knowledge of the importance and the significance of maintaining the confidentiality and following the rules of the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cover one last point. Then I will conclude. One can ask if we are just being technical here, if this is a technicality. It is not. If we are going to function properly in the House, if we are going to be able to do our jobs as MPs, we have to be treated equitably. Every member has the right to have access to the information that is in that report.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204473"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, that I was approached repeatedly by media about this interim report. I spoke to the member of the Bloc who sits on the committee. He also was approached. We knew we were not to release it in spite of the pressure put on us, because we respect, and rightfully so, the right of every member in the House to have that information at the same time. That time is when it is tabled in the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204474"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, if you rule in my favour that our privilege has been breached, I am in a position to present the motion as to how it should be referred and dealt with.</div>

I went to the clerk of the committee, who reports to the chair, and asked the clerk, “When does this report become public and when am I able to speak to this report?” I was told that because the report of the subcommittee went to the main committee, until the main committee tabled the report in the House the report was confidential.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say I had people from the national media trying to tell me what might or might not be in the report and I know it was very tempting to get into the fray. I had to say to them that I would not act against the rules of the House.

I think it is important, however, to recognize whether or not the mistakes made were serious enough by the intent behind them to cause some consequences and discipline from you. I would suggest that in this case there was absolutely no intention of malice. There was no intention to deliberately leak information. This was an inadvertent mistake. My colleague has apologized and I would ask that you take that into consideration when considering this question of privilege.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that it appears to me that the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78397,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78397&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Windsor—Tecumseh</A> is correct in saying there has been a breach of the privileges of the House in terms of a leaking of information that was in a confidential report which has not been tabled.

    </p><a name="Para204487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am going to do is review the comments of the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78536,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78536&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Leeds—Grenville</A> in the circumstances, and of course the comments of the hon. the parliamentary secretary, but I will note that the parliamentary secretary seems to think I have disciplinary powers in this regard. I like to think of myself as a strict disciplinarian, but unfortunately in this case the best I can do is allow a motion to refer the matter to committee for further study. If the committee recommends discipline, I may be the one who has to administer it, but only after the House adopts the committee report, so the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78536,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78536&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Leeds—Grenville</A> need not quail at the prospect of what I may say in my ruling on this matter in the next few days.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take a look at the statements that were made and see if they are sufficient to require a referral to a committee for what I believe has been a breach of privilege. It is simply a matter of whether the statements that were made are sufficient to make it unnecessary for committee to do a study. I am quite prepared to look at that from the point of view of the Chair and get back to the House in due course. If I agree that a motion can be moved to refer it to committee, the House will then make its own decision whether to refer the matter, but as I say, I will review the statements first. I will come back to the House in due course on this one.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The record will show, and I have checked with the Acting Speaker, the Table and with the <i>Hansard</i> index documents, that in fact, in the current Parliament I have only risen in the House twice, not 14 times. </div>

    </p><a name="Para204508"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue was on October 4, which was in fact the incident where the member threatened me. The Chair ruled that the Chair thought it was a point of debate.

    </p><a name="Para204509"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the member's own statement in <i>Hansard</i>, those are the facts. In fact, they are not the facts.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the member specifically says there were precisely 14, not a lot, but 14, and precisely 10, not a bunch of them, this member knows exactly what he was saying on the record.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I accepted the member's statement of October 16 because I had the presumption of honesty of all hon. members and I was not going to question it. However, when the story appeared in the <i>Ottawa Sun</i> yesterday where there were further statements which were insulting to me, I felt it was worth my while to inspect the record.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204514"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could also suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that if the Chair were to look at the 38th Parliament, the Chair would find that I rose on 18 occasions on points of order and only three of the 18 were found to be points of debate. There is no evidence of my being abusive of the House in terms of points of order as contended by the member who specifically cited 10 incidents in this Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204515"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that I have been insulted. I believe that I have been demeaned by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78377,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78377&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Nepean—Carleton</A>.

    </p><a name="Para204516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the rules of Parliament, the Standing Orders, and our practices and procedures, as I mentioned with regard to Marleau and Montpetit, I believe that there has been a serious breach of my privileges as a member of Parliament. If the Speaker should find a prima facie case of breach of my privileges, I would be prepared to move the appropriate motion.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, I am saddened to have to ask the government how it can be so meanspirited and so blindly ideological that it chooses to cut funding for programs that help the most vulnerable in society. Why does it feel that helping young people to find jobs is not a priority, that volunteering is not worthy of government support, that adult literacy is not important?</div>
    </p><a name="Para204528"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I attended a press conference recently where the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> and <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78780,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78780&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">President of the Treasury Board</A> announced that their government was putting an end to programs like these. As the Minister of Finance announced a $13.2 billion surplus and gloated about the strength of the Canadian economy, he turned to the President of the Treasury Board, who moments later explained that our country would no longer support literacy programs or our museums across the country. The sight would have been comical had it not been so distressing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204529"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The image of those two former Mike Harris cabinet ministers, standing side by side, grinning like two bullies watching each other's back, is a perfect snapshot of the government. The cuts it has made and the way it has announced them let all Canadians see that this is a petty government, a government driven by ideology rather than a good sense of the country, a government that lacks the sense of fairness that so many of our citizens hold dear and a government, as well, that is blind to economics.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204530"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, these meanspirited cuts have shown us all exactly what the government is all about, and it accepts no counter views. Anything that does not fit into its ideological point of view is quite simply discarded with vitriolic politic rhetoric. I am sure that after yesterday the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',79028,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=79028&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Halton</A> will agree.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204531"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government did not need to punish a member of its own caucus for simply confirming to Canadians what these cuts plainly show. They show that the government is out of touch with the majority of Canadians and, as polls show, it is alienating more and more Canadians week by week. The government needs to be reminded that it had the support of a minority of Canadians in the last federal election. That support is sinking even lower because of the callous way it approaches nearly every issue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204532"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will back up this general argument now by talking about a few of the cuts in more detail.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204533"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As one who spent most of my career in education, the worst move of the lot was the decision to slash $17.7 million from national literacy programs. For a government that is starting to talk a lot about productivity, after having tabled one of the least productivity oriented budgets in recent memory, this is truly a horrible decision, not only socially meanspirited but economically stupid as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204534"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a relatively small country in a world of emerging giants like India and China, it is obvious that Canada cannot compete on the basis of low wages, nor would we want to. We can only compete on the strength of educated, smart, innovative people. That does not mean just high-end smarts with world-class Ph.D.s, it begins with basic literacy skills for all Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204535"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, statistics show that there are roughly nine million Canadians who share some degree of difficulty with literacy. Of course, a $17.7 million, 30% cut to our literacy programs is meanspirited. Given the central role of education and training in today's economy, it is also economically foolish.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the museums assistance program?

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had the ink even dried before the Prime Minister decided to renege on his promise? That is but one example of dozens of drastic, meanspirited and spiteful cuts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204543"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now turn to the decision to eliminate the court challenges program. The Canadian Bar Association asked that funding for this program be restored as it is vital to the protection of the constitutional rights of Canadians, not all of whom may necessarily have deep pockets. The current government seems to be interested only in those with deep pockets. Why would a progressive government try to make it more difficult for its own citizens to challenge laws that curtail their individual freedoms? That is quite simply meanspirited.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204544"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about funding for Status of Women Canada? Yesterday was Persons Day, on which we pay tribute to the five courageous women who won the right for women to be recognized as persons by Canadian law in 1929. It is almost inconceivable that some of the women with us today were not considered persons in their youth by their own government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204545"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our society has made tremendous progress towards the socio-economic equality of men and women. However, there remains work to be done. Just look around you and you will see that, despite the efforts of all parties to increase the number of women in Parliament, we are far short of the target.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204546"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the adjective “meanspirited” applies to a situation where drastic cuts are made to the funding of an organization that continues to fight for the equality of men and women.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these cuts, Canadians from coast to coast are getting a strong picture of just how ideological the government can be. Newfoundland and Labrador's Premier, Danny Williams, has been trying to distance himself from the federal Conservative government by reminding his voters that he is a progressive Conservative premier and that he would never even dream of cutting literacy programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204548"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There does not seem to have been any consultation process by the government. It simply took aim at programs that did not sit with its ideological beliefs and cut them, without even consulting the people who deliver the programs or the Canadians who use them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204549"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep hearing from those in the tourism industry. They were not even consulted about the elimination of the GST visitor rebate program. The government did not bother to ask those people if they found the program useful in attracting tourists to Canada. Now, after the fact, we are hearing from groups, like the Hotel Associations of Canada, that are saying the resulting loss in tourism will cost the government more than three times the tax revenue that it will save by eliminating the program. It is hardly smart economics or good economics to attack the tourism industry when it is suffering extremely difficult times for other reasons, such as the high value of the Canadian dollar and possible difficulties at the border.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204550"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet the government has the audacity to call moves like this smart. I think it is high time that the government stopped treating Canadians as though we were stupid. These cuts are not smart. They are blunt, economically unsound and ideologically driven.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204551"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only gauge by which one could conceivably call them smart is that maybe they are good for the Conservative Party. For instance, the government has eliminated the court challenges program at exactly the same time as it has tabled several bills that some experts believe to be unconstitutional. Maybe it was just trying to head off legal challenges. This is just another example of the government doing what is right for the Conservative Party, not what is right for Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204552"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only the tip of the iceberg. The Conservatives have admitted that they had a $23 billion hole in their election platform that would need to be paid for by future spending cuts. In fact, budget 2006 has called for far more cuts than the ones recently announced. The 2007-08 column of the budget's ledgers calls for an additional $2.4 billion in cuts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204553"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government was not opposed at all to the principle of reallocation. In fact, we reallocated $11 billion over five years, substantially more than has been so far achieved by the government. However, we went to great lengths to ensure that our cuts did not hurt the vulnerable. We examined all possible actions through a regional lens to ensure that the cuts did not disproportionately hit the regions of the country rather than the national capital region. We also examined them through a gender lens and gender based analysis to ensure that our cuts did not disproportionately hurt women. Also, perhaps most fundamentally, we examined them through a fairness lens to ensure that those savings that we made did not unduly impact the most vulnerable in society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the Conservatives also used these lenses, but they inverted them. They used a gender lens, but they focused their cuts in areas that were particularly damaging to women. They used a fairness lens, but rather than exempting the most vulnerable, they focused their cuts on the most vulnerable in Canadian society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204555"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Conservatives come to identify the additional cuts that they will need, according to their budget and certainly according to their election platform, I certainly hope they will remember the lessons from this fall, that they will apply a gender lens, not to hurt women but to help women and that they will apply a fairness lens, not to punish the most vulnerable but to spare the most vulnerable. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have great expectations in that regard, but I hope the Conservative minority government has learned a lesson from this round of cuts. I believe Canadians expect their government to govern on behalf of all Canadians and not just on behalf of the narrow interests and the narrow base of the Conservative Party.</div>

The fact is that we have found $1 billion in savings. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204564"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last campaign, Canadians clearly indicated to our party that they were sick and tired of seeing the waste and mismanagement in recent years. We committed to Canadians in the last election that we would do things differently in Ottawa so we have found $1 billion in savings. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204565"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to put this into perspective. We found $1 billion in savings out of the $200 billion a year that is spent by the Government of Canada, which is the equivalent of a household that expends $20,000 a year finding $100 a year in savings. It is entirely reasonable and entirely appropriate. It is what Canadians do day to day in the management of their budgets and they expect the Government of Canada to do the same.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204566"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we have increased spending in this budget by $5 billion. Some of the $1 billion in savings we have found will go, in part, to this new spending on, for example, our new child care benefit that is providing $1,200 a year for each child under the age of six.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204567"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to some of the programs that the member mentioned, let us put this all into perspective. We found $2.3 million in savings out of the museums program out of the approximately $250 million spent by this government on museums a year, or about 1% of the budget. We are focusing the remaining money on supporting the country's museums and cultural heritage.</div>

As I said very clearly in my speech, we are in favour of saving money and we are in favour of reallocating from low to high priorities. He is talking about $1 billion. Our expenditure committee found $11 billion to reallocate, 11 times more than what he is talking about. That is not the point. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204571"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is not whether it is a good thing for government to save money and to reallocate to higher priorities. The point is the things the government cuts and the ideological, mean-spirited nature of those cuts. I do not object to government savings. We did more than it did but we did not apply a reverse fairness lens to specifically target the cuts on the least privilege or target cuts on women. We did the reverse. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204572"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the principle of reallocation that we object to. It is the mean-spirited nature of those cuts which are ideologically focused on the most vulnerable in society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204573"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that when the museum people came to the finance committee they told us that they were devastated by the cuts. The literacy people had a $17.7 million, or 30%, cut and they have $40 million left. That is criminal. There are 8 million or 9 million people in Canada who have literacy problems. We are competing in a knowledge economy globally and the government cuts 30% of the funding to literacy. That is just unconscionable.</div>

They took the entire $30 billion surplus without negotiating whatsoever. How is that for being cruel? How is that for a gender lens? Most of those pensioners, who earn on average $9,000 a year, are women living in poverty on their public service pension plan. The other $30 billion came from program cuts.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that when the Liberal government assumed power in 1993 it inherited a $42 billion deficit.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the government of the day, to correct the huge deficit left by the Tory government and which was leading us, according to the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, into third world status, had to take serious measures, and that was the hallmark of a responsible government. However, once we balanced the books we invested in people and, in the more recent times, in the expenditure review committee. I can tell the House, because I was directly involved, that we did apply a gender lens, a fairness lens and a regional lens. The NDP would not understand this but this was responsible government reallocating taxpayer money from the lower priorities to the higher priorities in a manner that did not hurt the most vulnerable in Canadian society.</div>

    </p><a name="Para204588"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We promised that we would bring in roughly 29 different tax reductions: reducing income tax; a new Canadian employment tax credit that is worth $155 for every person who works; tax credits to help parents with the cost of putting their kids in sports so we can encourage families to keep their children active, healthy and out of trouble; a tax credit worth $80 per student to help students buy textbooks; tax credits to help entrepreneurs buy tools for their daily work; and of course, a reduction in the GST to help every single taxpayer in Canada, regardless of their income.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204589"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were the promises we made. In order to finance these promises, we committed that we would find $1 billion worth of savings within the fiscal framework of Canada, and that is exactly what we have done. Again we have kept our word. We found $1 billion in savings that will put money back into higher priority initiatives, allowing us to go forward and finance our agenda of tax relief for Canadian families. Let me talk for a few moments about the savings that we have discovered. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are spending $40 million less on politicians. By merely reducing the size of cabinet, we have reduced the costs that are associated with having ministers. Under the previous government, the former prime minister wanted to be all things to all people. He owed a lot of favours to Liberal insiders and Liberal caucus members who had helped him engage in a civil war against his own party and overthrow the previous prime minister. He spent enormous sums just filling his cabinet with friends. When we took office under the leadership of the current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, this <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> was determined not to reward friends, but instead to get the costs down and ensure that our cabinet would be focused and frugal. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the expenses for our cabinet ministers came out. We had loud criticism for those expenses from the Liberal Party, particularly from the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78924,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78924&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Wascana</A>. What was his criticism? He could not believe we were spending so little on hospitality, on late night cocktail parties, on steak dinners, and on schmoozy lobbyist events. He said it was impossible that we could be that frugal and that responsible. He offered no proof whatsoever that that was the case. He was dumbfounded at how frugal and responsible this Conservative government had become. We are spending $40 million less on politicians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have eliminated a program that the Liberals employed where they would pay Liberal lawyers to sue the government and advance Liberal causes. I heard the Liberal finance critic across the way complaining. He said that the Conservative government has introduced laws that might present some constitutional problems. What laws is he speaking about? Let us get beyond the mumbo-jumbo over there and let us talk about the facts. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That member is talking about our tough on crime initiatives. such as our initiative to put three time violent offenders and sexual offenders in jail forever unless they can prove they are no longer a danger to society. That member believes these kinds of laws need to be challenged in the courts using taxpayers' money. Our mandatory jail time initiative ensures that criminals who commit serious crimes will serve their time in jail, not in their homes. That member believes we should pay lawyers to challenge these laws and eliminate these tough on crime measures. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That member does not have the presence of mind to state clearly that that is what he is talking about because he does not want his constituents to know how soft on crime he is. His entire party has spent the last 13 years coddling criminals and now when we are getting tough on crime, the Liberals are angry because we will no longer pay lawyers to sue the government for cracking down on crime. Instead, we will redirect those dollars toward higher priority initiatives. So, yes, we have eliminated the court challenges program and we have ended funding for the Law Commission, because we believe that the focus on our justice system should be on getting on tough on criminals instead of financing lawyers to sue the government.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will be learning more about these exciting proposals, Mr. Speaker, when the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78906,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78906&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Tobique—Mactaquac</A> rises, as we are splitting the time on this, something else to look forward to.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204596"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about the $13 billion that we paid off against the debt. The member across the way complained that we have put money against the debt. According to Don Drummond with TD Bank Financial Group, paying down $13 billion of the national debt of the Government of Canada will save the Government of Canada $660 million every year. Those are dollars we would otherwise have to pay in interest on that debt to bankers, many of them from other countries. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204597"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can use that $660 million to reduce taxes, to invest in health care, in a tougher justice system, in a whole series of other priorities. That is $660 million which the Liberal government would not have been able to capture and save because the Liberals would have engaged in March madness, which is to say, when entering the final stages of the fiscal year, governments past have had a tradition of blowing everything in the account, emptying the cupboards to buy electoral support or reward friends.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204598"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of that approach, we decided to take the full surplus and put it entirely against Canada's national debt. As a young person who cares deeply about the next generation, I am thankful that we have made that down payment on the enormous $480 billion mortgage that the next generation is going to inherit. I am very proud of that responsible decision to invest in the future of Canada's fiscal health.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to talk for a few moments about some of the other dynamic manoeuvres that we undertook to save taxpayers' money. For example, when we are talking about the Status of Women program, we did not cut any of the programs associated with that department, but by merely merging offices, we were able to save over $4 million. Not one job was lost but we saved that money through intelligent reallocation and intelligent management.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204600"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about foreign offices that are used for diplomatic reasons. We were able to find $4 million there just by managing them better. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cut $4 million from a marijuana program that the Liberal Party was promoting and boy, they were angry about that. Ever since we cut that program I have noticed they have not been as mellow over there. That was an intelligent move to save taxpayers' money. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204602"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total, again we saved $1 billion because of our intelligent economizing of people's tax dollars.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals are angry over there. They said before they supported saving money, but now they are furious because they have learned that it is their friends who have been cut off from the trough. At the end of the day they are making lots of big spending promises but let us be honest with the Canadian people, if the Liberals get in again and they resume their big spending, they will have to pay for it by raising the GST, taking away the $100 a month to support young families, raising taxes, eliminating the 29 different tax cuts that we brought in for Canadians. That is the real agenda of the Liberal Party. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if one of the Liberal Party's members, all of whom are here today, will be willing to stand and defend their agenda to raise taxes and take away the choice in child care allowance. Will any of them stand on their feet and defend that plan that they intend to foist on Canadians if they were ever, unfortunately, given the chance to do so? Will any of them stand and do that? </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the member if he is aware of the statistics. Fraser Mustard's presentation at the Brookings Institution this spring showed that almost 50% of Canadians are in literacy levels one and two of five, which level is totally dangerous in terms of the future economy of this country, and that 70% of young offenders actually have learning disabilities or some problems with literacy.</div>

I think there should be an open warning given to families that are receiving that money and spending it wisely, not on beer and popcorn as the member might suggest, that if the Liberal Party were ever to recapture power in this country, the first thing that would happen is that those young families would lose that $100 a month.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke with a young mother who has four children. Imagine what that program means to her.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of literacy, I am very proud that we as a government are spending $28 million for the enhanced language training initiative that helps Canada and Ontario immigrants.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choices they made during their mandate resulted in exaggerated increases in government spending that our economy cannot sustain over the long term unless, of course, the members opposite want to raise taxes.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para204629"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this year we have seen program spending actually decline for the first time in nine years. I want to emphasize that Conservatives said we would save $1 billion a year by cutting wasteful and ineffective programs, and we did just that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204630"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated by John Williamson of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation in the September 29 <i>Ottawa Citizen</i>, “The majority of Canadians will applaud the government's plan to pay down of the federal debt and a $1-billion spending cut to some awful programs--”. I underline awful programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204631"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don Drummond, in an editorial on September 27 when talking about accusations that the cuts were political, stated that “This is utter silliness...It's true that taxes could have been lowered instead of paying down the debt, but the real culprit keeping the tax burden high has been rapid program spending growth”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204632"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have eliminated ineffective programs, those that failed to deliver value for money and saved funds that were going unused. We have reduced the debt by $13.2 billion, thanks to solid economic growth, curbing the traditional last quarter spending spree, and through a review of ineffective programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204633"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is so beneficial to taxpayers and the economy from paying down that level of debt is the annual interest savings of $660 million. That saving is in perpetuity for Canadians, meaning that every year from this time forward Canadians will be freed from paying interest charges that actually provide no program value.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204634"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated by Mr. Drummond when referring to the debt repayment saving $660 million, “And that goes on forever. So you're freeing up $660 million for tax cuts or other priorities”.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para204635"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous government wanted to be all things to all people. The Liberals never could say no, not even to very bad ideas, such as the sponsorship scandal, the gun registry, and the annual megaconvention they hold every March.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para204636"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been able to reduce debt, cut taxes, and say yes to more resources for child care and safer streets, all because we have been able to say no to special interests and programs that do not work.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para204637"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians expect the government to invest their money in successful programs that meet their needs. They know that over the past few years, Ottawa spent too much money on too many unnecessary things—expenses that were completely unjustifiable. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para204638"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In budget 2006 we promised that we would review our programs to ensure every taxpayer dollar was well spent. To me this is another case of a promise made and a promise kept. By getting a more modern approach to managing our budgets versus the dated approach used by the last government, we are going to spend more money efficiently on safer streets, cleaner air and secure borders.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204639"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House knows, our review established a goal to secure $1 billion in savings. When we look at this, it is heartening to know that $379 million of the savings will come from programs of unused funds that already achieved their objectives or had a lower than expected take up. For example, we are saving $5.6 million because it did not cost as much to move the Canadian Tourism Commission to Vancouver as estimated. Also, an additional $265 million was found from efficiencies just by streamlining programs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204640"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, of the $1 billion in savings, two-thirds come from what we would call low hanging fruit or what I would call easy pickings. I would say that the previous government obviously did not do a very good job of executing their expenditure review over the last few years if we could find $650 million that quickly and easily.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204641"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we found programs that were not meeting the priorities of Canadians. For example, we will save $4 million, as the parliamentary secretary said, through the elimination of funding for research of medical marijuana. Our government has made commitments to health research and I share the view that the federal government does not need to tell professional researchers what to study.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204642"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a combination of these program savings and tighter management, we are trimming fat and refocusing spending on the priorities. Our government is keeping its promise to families and taxpayers by reigning in spending and reducing the national debt.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para204643"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking public servants to do more with less is not the right approach.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, in last spring's budget, we promised to invest in programs that better address Canadians' priorities. This program keeps that promise.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is lost in all the noise in the House over the last couple of weeks is that in this year's budget we committed to spending an additional $5 billion per year on programs to deliver priorities to Canadians and $1 billion of that new spending is coming from savings derived from existing programs.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, with the $650 million of low hanging fruit being left on the tree by the previous government, I can only conclude that it was good at spending and not so good at managing spending, sort of like the farmer who could not run the hen over the manure pile.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204652"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will close with a couple of points. Our cabinet undertook a review that we promised in the last budget and we have delivered on what we said. Managing spending and debt must become a key competency of any government. I would say that Kevin Dancey of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants had it right when he said:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, and a very comforting testimony for me, is an article in the <i>Times and Transcript</i> by Campbell Morrison where he observes that the, “Federal government won't play in provinces' pen. The decision of what to cut largely reflects a government that is retrenching into the strictly federal role as delineated by the original separation of powers that the Fathers of Confederation drew up in 1867”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204658"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made it halfway through a book by Patrick Boyer entitled <i>Just Trust Us: The Erosion of Accountability in Canada</i> where he states that successive governments have clouded the lines between federal and provincial responsibility. He adds that with respect to program spending, lack of responsibility and accountability has led to billions of dollars of money being spent without any measure as to whether it had been successful. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204659"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That stops now and it stops with the government. In short, there was a need for this action. We are creating value for Canadians and there is wisdom in what has been done.</div>

    </p><a name="Para204667"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, I refer to the member who raised this motion today who led the expenditure review.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the amounts of dollars that were invested, we looked at $5 billion in new spending. We have talked about a number of these programs over the last couple of days. We have talked about our initiative that the minister announced for older workers. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204669"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my speech I also talked about, and perhaps the member missed it, the funding for an additional $60 million and $70 million in targeted initiatives. Those are the kinds of things we are doing that will make a difference to ridings like his.</div>

I have a couple of questions and a comment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204671"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging from the details of his speech, how narrow an approach the Conservative government has taken to many difficult problems and specifically with respect to the economy and the finances of this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204672"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past 13 years, the Liberal government that was in charge of our economy recognized that it had to take a balanced approach. It had to cut taxes, it had to pay down debt, and it had to enhance productivity. We need to take a balanced approach and attack all three. We cannot just focus on one.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204673"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What that has produced over the last 13 years is a record $13.2 billion surplus that the Conservative government has now inherited. It has also inherited the lowest interest rates in Canada, the lowest unemployment rates in Canada, and a booming economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204674"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw the hon. member's attention to the fact that it was because of a balanced approach to deal with debt reduction, tax reduction and productivity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204675"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does his Conservative government refuse to listen to Canadians and take a balanced approach but instead takes a narrow approach? It increased spending to the military, cut government programs, and actually increased taxes to those at the lowest level of our economy.</div>

    </p><a name="Para204677"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is obvious, in the last 13 years of the Liberal government, that any rising tide will lift any boat, including the Liberal government. When he talked about a surplus over the number of years, $9 billion of that was because of additional GST revenue that it got because of a Conservative plan. His previous government benefited from a rising tide that lifts any boat.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased to speak to the motion introduced by the Liberal Party, a motion that we will in fact be supporting because it is in the interests of Quebec, and of Quebecers, to denounce the cuts announced a few days ago by the Conservative government. More than anything we have seen since the Conservatives took power, those cuts have demonstrated the ideological motivation behind some of the decisions made by this government. As the name says, that ideology is extremely conservative, not to say neo-conservative.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204680"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am therefore pleased to speak, not because I am pleased that there have been a billion dollars in cuts, but because it is my impression that when I speak today I will be speaking on behalf of the thousands and thousands of people in Quebec who were extremely shocked by the cuts that have been announced and by the places that were chosen for making those cuts. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204681"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that recent polls have shown the Conservative Party in third place in Quebec is not surprising. It reflects neither the values of Quebecers nor their vision of the role that a government should play, in particular when it comes to the most disadvantaged people and the causes of groups who are facing particular difficulties.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204682"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first obvious thing is that the public does not agree with the billion dollars in cuts announced by the Conservative government. This is true in Quebec and I imagine it is also true in a large part of Canada. We can see that the values that this party espouses do not reflect the values of Quebecers or, again, of a large proportion of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204683"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quebec is a nation that seeks to develop an approach based on community, so that it can deal with the issues of the future, particularly issues relating to globalization, the war on poverty and the need to reconcile economic prosperity and the welfare of the population as a whole. What do we see when we look at where the Conservative Party has decided to make its cuts? The first thing it does is attack the disadvantaged and the groups that stand up for their interests.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204684"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will give you a few examples.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a cut of $10.8 million in the smoking cessation program for aboriginal people. I would like you to tell me where the logic is in cutting $10 million from this program at a time when everyone agrees that smoking, in society as a whole but particularly among aboriginal people, is a serious health problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204686"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The budget for women’s groups has been cut. Unfortunately, women are still victims of certain forms of discrimination and they need the support of autonomous groups that are active in promoting equality between the sexes. This approach is probably something that the Conservatives do not like. Funding for those groups is being cut. I will be reading from letters that I have received from some of those groups in my riding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204687"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has also been a reduction in support for volunteer groups and literacy programs. We are all familiar with the challenge of globalization. The Standing Committee on Finance is currently doing a prebudget tour that focuses on Canadian competitiveness. If the competitiveness of an economy can be attributed to anything, the quality of training of the population is one factor and, at the core of training quality is literacy. It is therefore completely absurd, counter-productive, anti-social and detrimental to the economy to make cuts to these programs.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter is signed by Odette Neveu, project officer for the group.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204703"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could this be any clearer? In Quebec, at least, not only is there disapproval of the cuts, but there is the hope that the government will reverse its position. If this government would abandon its ideological approach, it could reverse its position.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204704"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that the first cuts are made in programs for the most disadvantaged. However, cuts were also made to programs for organizations that keep the government in check and that address certain unresolved issues that sometimes paralyze our society. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204705"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, what is the government doing when it cuts funding for the Law Commission of Canada, slashes Revenue Canada advisory groups and abolishes the court challenges program? These are attempts to stifle civil society organizations that seek to bring about social progress in our society. This is clearly undemocratic. A complex society such as ours need groups to speak on behalf of views that are sometimes in the minority but which, in the long run, end up being those of the majority.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204706"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, take the rights of same sex couples or the rights of gays and lesbians. Had there not been minority groups—supported by programs such as those I just mentioned— to defend these causes at the outset, our society would not have accepted, as it does now, these realities which are quite normal but were considered abnormal a few decades ago.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have just created the conditions for social decline in Canada and in Quebec. We do not accept that. Once again, it is to be hoped that the government will reverse gears.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204708"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The battle fought on behalf of the Montfort Hospital would never have taken place if there had not been a court challenges program. Minority language groups are being attacked, specifically Francophone minorities outside Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204709"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only are they attacking the most needy, the groups who defend them and the anti-establishment groups that work in our civil society to bring about social and democratic progress. In addition they cut the checks and balances and economic reinforcements; $39 million was cut from development of the social economy. I just cannot get over it. Simply, it is not Quebec that will pay the biggest price but rather it is Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quebec had an advantage in terms of the social economy. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the creation of the Chantier de l'économie sociale. Projects were underway and because the previous government announced the creation of this fund, the projects were completed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204711"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quebec will lose $5 million, which is completely unacceptable. In the rest of the country, $34 million will be lost. We need a program of this type in order to create business organizations that are a necessary complement to government programs and the initiatives of the private market, the capitalist market, the profit-seeking market. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204712"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, I believe the government needs to reverse gears. There is room to manoeuvre in terms of operating expenditures. We are not against making the federal bureaucracy leaner. On the contrary, the Bloc Québécois has been urging that for a long time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204713"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the first five years, from 2000 to 2004, expenditures increased by 39%—that is, operational expenditures for the bureaucracy including information technology, furniture and pencils, not program expenditures. That represents an increase in operational expenditures of about 8% per year, whereas an increase of 3.5% would have been appropriate considering population and inflation. There is room to make the Ottawa bureaucracy more efficient.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not need to strip resources from the most needy, from the groups that work on their behalf and the groups that work to advance democracy, as well as social and economic progress. That is what the Conservatives have done. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204715"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have been unmasked and, in my opinion, unless there is a reconsideration of their policy, their image has been tarnished forever in Quebec. </div>

That is what they took aim at.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204737"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding operating expenditures, I explained earlier that they had increased by 8% a year, while the increase in the population and inflation has been 3.5%. So we see there is room. In the announcement made by the Conservatives, scarcely a quarter billion dollars, or $250 million, is going in cuts to operating expenditures. That means that, out of $1 billion, $750 million is being drawn from cuts to useful programs, when some fat could have been trimmed from the Treasury Board, for example, a department that provides no service to the population and that has shown a 26% increase in its operating expenditures over five years. During the same period, in Quebec, we have lowered Treasury Board expenditures by 20%.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204738"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At CIDA, direct aid has increased by 20% while operating expenses have increased by 132%. There is definitely some fat to be trimmed there. But that is not where they cut, since three quarters of the cuts were aimed at groups that do work in the field: literacy groups and women’s groups that play an essential role.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204739"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We could also have looked at military expenditures. For example, the Department of National Defence budget is over $14 billion. Not one cent was cut. I am not sure that everything in there is useful. This budget should have been examined, not to call into question the fact that our equipment needs to be modernized, once we know what we will do with the Department of National Defence in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204740"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All departments should have been asked to make cuts in operating expenditures before any thought was given to cutting aid to the underprivileged, the groups that defend them and those that promote social development, economic development and democracy in Quebec.</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para204750"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we support this motion? For all the reasons given by my colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78635,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78635&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Joliette</A> and also because we feel that this government has a $13 billion surplus to work with. It could have cut operating costs, as mentioned by the member for Joliette, rather than programs that affect citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204751"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Conservatives have made what are generally called ideological cuts, and it is not impugning their motives to say so. They target the disadvantaged and minority groups. Mrs. Thatcher taught us a lot in this regard. The Conservatives target programs intended to counterbalance the government. They refuse to consider possible savings at National Defence. I wonder why. The question must be asked. Why is it that there were no cuts to the Department of National Defence when it is one of the departments with the largest budgets, about $14.7 billion in 2005-06? </div>
    </p><a name="Para204752"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the election campaign in January, we saw the Conservative government still slowly progressing like masked turtles. That is what I told the media at the time. The Conservatives had not yet revealed their true face, but now we know a little more about it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204753"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With all these cuts, the government is stirring up a lot of discontent in Quebec. If our friends across the aisle are incapable of seeing this, all I can say is they are out of touch with reality in Quebec. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204754"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The values of the Conservative Party are not the values of Quebeckers. The Quebec nation is about solidarity in all areas of life. We know that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204755"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Conservative government I was saying that it is going after the disadvantaged and minority groups. I will provide a few examples, beginning with the elimination of the court challenges program. This program gave minorities a voice: linguistic minorities, advocacy groups on behalf of the disadvantaged, homosexual rights groups, and so forth. The court challenges program funded groups that challenged the positions taken by current members of this government. Was the cutting of this program not a bad sign for all the groups opposed to the ideology embraced by this government? That is the question.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204756"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also the reduced budget for women’s groups, about which my colleague spoke earlier, and cuts to the support for volunteer groups and literacy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204757"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Conservatives decided to eliminate the Canada volunteerism initiative that was not supposed to end until next March.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204758"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question I want to ask is whether the government will invest in another volunteer action program in its next budget. Stakeholders are waiting for some sign, some hint. If not, another question arises: will the government decide then to transfer the entire file to the Department of Human Resources and Social Development?</div>
    </p><a name="Para204759"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives have cut funding to the public diplomacy fund, a program that promoted the support of cultural exportation, such as international tours for dance and theatre groups. Once again, they have not missed an opportunity to worry the cultural community.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the front page of this morning's <i>Le Devoir</i>, Stéphane Baillargeon has written an excellent article on the concerns of the cultural and artistic communities in Quebec. I urge all members to read the article, for it is full of information.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204761"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the announcement of $11.8 million in cuts to the public diplomacy fund, dance and theatre groups are wondering how this will affect the funding of international tours. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204762"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what I asked the heritage minister recently: Will these cuts put an end to funding for international tours for theatre and dance groups from Quebec and Canada, yes or no? She said no. I am sorry to say, however, that these groups are concerned that this was merely lip service.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204763"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the museum sector, which is very important to us. This sector has been awaiting a new museum policy for 25 years, as well as a budget increase, but unfortunately, the Conservative government just cut 25% from funding for museums.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to read the Conservative Party promises from the last election campaign. This was on December 16, 2005. The Canadian Museum Association received a number of responses to questions it had asked the Conservative Party.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives made a commitment to revitalize and support the arts, but it was a verbal commitment.

It has to be tangible and real and take the form of actions and funding. </div>

    </p><a name="Para204781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Bloc can promise the moon and talk and talk and talk since it will never be in power. It is not possible for the Bloc to form the government. It is quite easy for the Bloc to talk and criticize every plan since the Bloc does not have a chance to form the government.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take exception to the fact that the Bloc Québécois is being impugned in this way. It is a clear indication that they do not understand the reason for the Bloc Québécois' presence in this House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois was sent here by Quebeckers. Nearly half the population of Quebec sent us here to represent them because they have lost faith in Canadian federalism. When this party or the Liberal Party realizes and accepts that, perhaps then we can engage in a sincere and respectable conversation. </div>

When the Liberals were in government, they cut literally $25 billion out of spending in our country. It dramatically affected some of the most at risk and vulnerable of our citizens.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have a government that finds itself in a situation where it has a $13 billion surplus, mostly created on the backs of the poor and the most at risk by the previous government, which announced programs that were supposed to help, but it ended up not spending that money.</div>

It is so shallow, so hollow, so gratuitous and so without purpose. When I realized it was a reality and this was the genuine intentions of the Liberals, all I could conclude was the Liberals, with this opposition day, were making a mockery out of Parliament. They have embarrassed this place for all of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the resolution, it is nothing more than a statement of self-congratulation and gratuitous remarks. It has no purpose, no specific recommendation and no action for Parliament to consider. Therefore, I do not know on what we are supposed to vote. I, along with my colleagues, certainly will not vote on a motion that congratulates the Liberals for bringing our country to its knees over a decade of poor economic and fiscal mismanagement and a decade of cuts that have hurt the ability of Canadians to contribute.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204793"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the life of me I do not understand how the motion was allowed to be on the books and come forward. Surely, it is contrary to all the traditions of this place with respect to opposition day motions, and we are debating nothing. We are debating an empty statement of pure rhetoric, which is self-serving for the Liberals in this chamber.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204794"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It presents us with the unique combination of conceit and weakness, which has been so characteristic of the Liberals over this past decade and certainly over the last couple of years when their attitude, arrogance and sense that they were entitled to rule this place, no matter what voters thought, became so apparent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204795"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I have no choice but to recommend that my colleagues vote against the motion. It would be ludicrous for us to support such an empty, gratuitous statement. Second, I have no choice but to tear apart the two parts to this resolution</div>
    </p><a name="Para204796"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first part of the resolution suggests that the Liberals left the Conservatives the best economic and fiscal position of any incoming federal government, which is just nonsense, and I will proceed to prove that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204797"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part critiques the current government for not demonstrating the need, value or wisdom of its announced expenditure cuts, implying that if the current government had justified the spending cuts, had given us some background, some evaluation, the $1 billion in cuts would have been justified, would have been be okay.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204798"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot accept that position. We can accept nothing short of a resolution that calls for the reinstatement of these $1 billion cuts until such time as the government comes forward with an actual cost benefit analysis to show which programs were not producing results and were not contributing to the Canadian economy. So far we have not seen any evidence of that. The Conservative government has cut the lifeblood out of most communities, the very things that help communities help others, that help communities renew housing and community supports, that help give people the tools to access our economy, like literacy and numeracy and supports in socio-economic initiatives. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204799"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing to date, in any of the cuts announced by the Conservatives, that suggests there is any benefit to our Canadian economy, that there is any savings to be accrued, other than adding to our debt down the road and creating more and more difficulties for Canadians to participate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204800"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just go back to this nonsense about the goodness the Liberals have left this nation. I would remind members that over the course of the past 13 years, our country has ended up in a far worse position than we are today.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235">(1235)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para204801"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us go back to 1993 to 2006, to the fortunate year when the Liberals were, thankfully, defeated. During that period of time, workers' wages and salaries, as a percentage of GDP, declined steadily over those years, dropping from 54.3% to only 50%.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204802"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at some of the statistics. During this decade, the share of income for the top 1% of our population, those people who make over $150,000 a year, rose from 9% to 14%. Therefore, the Liberal government did a great job of boosting the already wealthy and catering to the corporate sector, but did nothing to help low and middle income Canadians. The bottom 40% of Canadians' share of national income actually dropped under the Liberals during this decade.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204803"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the job situation. Under the Liberals, we saw our country move away from a society, which had the possibility of permanent well-paying jobs, where both men and women were treated equally, where people were able to combine work, family and leisure activities on a reasonable basis and had some quality of life. That was taken away by the Liberals. Most new jobs, under the Liberals, happened in terms of temporary employment, part time employment or self-employment. Instead of us moving toward a progressive civil society, where people could put their talents to use in full time meaningful jobs, get some benefits and security and be able to still participate fully in their family and in their community activities, the Liberal government took that away. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204804"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One out of ten manufacturing jobs in Canada has been lost since 2001. More than 200,000 jobs have been lost in the manufacturing sector. That is a blow to many communities in our country and a blow to our whole society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204805"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One in seven Canadians works full time for less than $10 an hour. Women are two times as likely as men to work in low wage jobs. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204806"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employment insurance, which was supposed to help workers, now only helps about 40% of unemployed workers instead of the 80%. That happened when the Liberals took over as the government in 1993. Instead, they chalked up an EI surplus of $50 billion, which has not been used to help unemployed workers. It is not being used to train workers. It is not being used. That is the Liberal legacy. While workers were struggling, while families were suffering, while people needed training to be able to access the new economy, the Liberals destroyed the future for many Canadians. I could go on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204807"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the human aspect to fiscal and economic policy, which is a central part of any fiscal economic management and good government, we have to not simply look at the bottom line in terms of how much debt has been paid off and how much the tax breaks have been given corporate sector. We also have to look at the health and well-being of the workers who contribute so much to our economy and, in fact, grow the wealth in this country. Whether we are looking at the human aspect or the fundamentals in terms of good economic policy, the interest rate policy, the role of the Bank of Canada in trying to cut off growth every time the economy starts booming, all of this has to be traced back to Liberal inaction and incompetence over the last decade.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204808"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let us point to the ludicrously of the Liberals talking about cuts and criticizing the Conservative cuts. Members know we are opposed to the Conservative cuts. They hurt so many people in harmful ways. However, the Liberals were far worse. Do not forget that the Liberals were promising far bigger cuts in 2005 when they were still in office. In fact, for the two year period we are talking about, the Conservative cuts as a percentage of planned Liberal cuts is 25%.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204809"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, what the Conservatives are doing now is modest in comparison to what the Liberals were planning to do. In fact, they entrenched in the whole Treasury Board process the expenditure review, which would lead to significant cuts by the finance critic of the Liberal Party himself, none other than the person who brought forward the motion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204810"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us just remember that the Liberal government over the years cut $25 million from provincial transfers for health and education, cancelled the Canada assistance plan and eliminated its support for social housing. In the 1996 budget, it cut over 45,000 public service jobs. It cut over half a million dollars in appropriations to the CBC. It allowed Canada's foreign aid to slip from 0.4% to 0.3%. It cut the money for core programs for women and cut the heck out of the very fabric of our country. It left us in a position today--</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government of Canada did not conduct an annual expenditure review that would be cause for criticism by the people of Canada. Every organization should conduct an annual expenditure review. My wife and I do that in our household. We sit down and look at our household bills to see if there are places where we are spending money where it is not necessary. As a member of Parliament, at the end of the year my staff and I sit down and look at where we have spent our budget trying to serve the people in the riding as best we can and we reallocate resources by taking them out of one area and putting them into another.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204814"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I look at the size of the budget of Canada, approximately $200 billion a year, and the number of dollars that are involved in this expenditure review, which is about $1 billion, that is about half of a percent. I appreciate that there will be people who will disagree with some of the decisions that were made and where the trimming took place, but for the Liberal Party or any other party to suggest that this is some large scale reduction of expenditures or that there are massive cuts to programs is untrue and it exaggerates the point.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204815"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also make the distinction between dollars that are spent actually delivering services to people who need those services and dollars that are spent supporting organizations that often turn around and use those dollars to lobby the government to get more resources. </div>

    </p><a name="Para204818"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member says that it is less than 1% or 0.1% of the budget. My goodness, that $1 billion cut by the Conservative government will do more harm and create more debt down the road than anyone can imagine. When the Conservatives take away the tools that help people get a job and pay taxes, it is ludicrous and absolute stupidity and must be called to account.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204819"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not seen any kind of cost benefit analysis of government expenditures on a broad basis, especially in the area where corporations are able to benefit year in and year out with huge tax breaks, huge giveaways and huge loopholes and never have to account for the fact that the money is not being reinvested back in Canadian firms, in creating jobs and in growing the economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204820"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Don Drummond pointed out that it was an embarrassment to have this money go to corporations and not see it returned to this country. Instead, it is fleeing this country. It is not being put to use where it would make a difference, which would be a true cost benefit expenditure review. That would be showing that the government is sincere and willing to trim the fat.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the government eliminates the literacy partners program in Manitoba so people do not have any place to call for help, that is not trimming the fat. It is not trimming the fat when the court challenges program is cut thereby hurting the Unemployed Help Centre in Manitoba, the very centre that helps workers get their feet back on the ground.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was pleased to move a motion in the standing committee on which I serve, human resources and social development, that would actually take a look at these cuts, particularly in that ministry. At the first meeting we had this past Tuesday, the most important question we asked the group that came in to talk to us about the impact was whether they had been consulted about these cuts. Members of the group said that there was no consultation, no warning and no conversation whatsoever regarding the impact on the people they serve or whether they would be able to handle this. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204825"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We still have not been able to find or to get from the government any vehicle template that it might have used to actually make these decisions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204826"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not even the former Conservative minister in the Mulroney government, Perrin Beatty, co-chair of the Canadian Labour and Business Centre that must close its doors after 22 years of operation, was able to see the minister or the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> regarding the cuts to the program that they are so obviously committed to and think is a good thing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204827"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This centre is Canada's longest standing business and labour forum, the only national ongoing forum for partnership and dialogue on labour market and skills issues. The government is cutting that program at a time when the economy is rapidly changing and we are into a global reality. It cut the program and did not want to sit down and talk to the chair of that program about its impact. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204828"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time we ask a question here in the House or in committee, the Conservatives stand and say that they are spending millions of dollars on this, that and the other things, but the reality is that no matter what they say on how much money they claim they are spending, they are spending less. They are spending less on programs that affect very directly the most at risk and marginalized of our communities, our families. Most of these cuts are targeted at the most vulnerable people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204829"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has cut $200 million out of the voluntary sector; $55 million out of youth employment, the summer employment programs; $45 million out of Canada Mortgage and Housing; $17 million out of the adult learning and literacy program; $17 million from workplace skills; $13 from the social development partnership; and $13 million from the social economic initiative. That is just a short list of a long list of programs that have been hit dramatically and which will feel very directly every penny that they lose.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204830"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it should not surprise us at all that the government is making these cuts. When the budget was announced last year by Mr. Flaherty, supported by his good friend from the Ontario legislature, Mr. Baird, sitting up in the gallery was Mr. Harris who was very proud to be delivering on a program that he had very effectively rolled out in Ontario.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204831"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone is wondering what these cuts are about, or where they are going, or what is coming next, all they need do is look back at the record of that government in Ontario from 1995 to 2003.</div>

It should not surprise us that it is targeted at the most vulnerable of our citizens.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday, the committee heard a very compelling presentation by members of the Canadian Labour Congress who came before us and said that these cuts amounted to an attempt to silence the voices of Canadians, especially those not yet able to exercise their full citizenship because of the barriers in their way. They talked about the impact on women, on immigrant groups, on workers of colour, on the disabled, on those who lack literacy skills, on people who the previous Liberal government said it would help and even at the last minute, a deathbed confession, made promises of money for this, that and the other thing. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could not name one thing that was not in need of money in the month or two before the last election that the Liberals did not target money toward. Did that money get spent? No, it did not, which is the reason the government is now able to say that there is in fact some low hanging fruit.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an interesting comparison, because the situation we had in Ontario in 1995 and the difficult decisions that had to be made were there as the result of five years of an NDP government in Ontario that had created a financial crisis.

In fact, this is the kind of misinformation or lack of information that the Conservatives put out there. Yes, in fact, we did govern in some of the most difficult economic times that this country had experienced in probably 30 or 40 years and actually, it has been said, since the Great Depression. We had to make some difficult decisions.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member will remember the social contract and the price we paid for that in trying to manage the finances of the government of that day.

    </p><a name="Para204852"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened following 1995 was not that the deficit went down and the debt was paid. In fact, the deficit went up because the Conservative government of that time did exactly what the government is proposing to do here, which is to give massive tax breaks and make cuts in areas where it should not be making cuts. The Conservative government actually drove up the deficit and drove up the debt of Ontario, which is what the Conservatives will do with this country before they are finished.</div>

It was known for cutting, hacking and slashing every social program by which we define ourselves as Canadians, in the most ruthless and cruel way that can be imagined.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague made the point quite well, I think, that some cuts simply do not heal, that these cuts hurt people. Some cuts still have not healed. In my riding, the poorest riding in Canada, we feel the effects still of the Liberal economic policy that used the EI system as a cash cow.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204855"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask my colleague if the same is true in his riding. The cutbacks to EI by the Liberal government alone took $20.8 million a year out of just my riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78531,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78531&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Winnipeg Centre</A>. That is like the payrolls of two huge industries, two huge pulp and paper mills, moving out of one's riding. That is what it is equal to. Members can imagine what that would do to an already vulnerable low income neighbourhood like mine. Does the hon. member's riding still bear the vestiges of the Liberal legacy of ruthless cutbacks and slashing of budgets?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to talk for a second about the impact of the cuts made by the Liberals. I was in the NDP government in Ontario from 1990-95. We were dealing with the worst recession since the Great Depression and, not only that, we were dealing with a federal government that suddenly decided it was going to cut, over two or three years, some $25 billion out of the transfers to the provinces. We felt that very directly. We tried to manage those cuts so we would not dump on the next level of government, the municipalities, but as for the Conservative government of 1995, what I am saying here is to watch the pattern--</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone, too, are essential summer jobs for 25,000 Canadian students. We all have students in our ridings.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the United States, France, Great Britain and Italy, to name a few, each spend about a billion dollars a year on such programs. Why?

Even a yes or a no would do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204892"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would my hon. friend admit that in 1993-94 when the Liberals started their expenditure reduction program, one of the key components was a one-third reduction to health care, slashed, bang, gone overnight to all provinces? I was a member of a provincial government at the time so I watched, literally, the blood on the streets when that took place. There was the ongoing reduction for a number of years in national defence and the RCMP, and taxes were increased 67 times from 1994 to 2000, when in face of an election the Liberals were terrified and they did a low tax reduction. Will he first admit that that is how the Liberals did their tax reduction, mainly with the slashing of health care to all provinces? </div>
    </p><a name="Para204893"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For my other question I will just use one of the areas which my hon. friend has referred to and I will ask people to reflect on the validity of what he is saying in the other areas. He talked about literacy programming cuts. Will he admit that according to our budget, $81 million this year is going from this government to literacy programs? Will he also admit that not one single organization with any existing agreement in terms of literacy, not one is having its funding cut?</div>
    </p><a name="Para204894"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we are reducing in the literacy program is the millions of dollars the Liberals used to spend on consultations, millions of dollars to their friends to tell us that if people learn how to read they will do better.</div>

The contrast between a $43 billion deficit and a $10 billion surplus that they inherited from us is precisely the result of good economic management of this country, the return to prosperity and a common-sense approach.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were cuts made? Yes. Were they regrettable? Yes, but there was a reason for it. It is clear and the reason is sitting on the seats of the hon. members opposite.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204900"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the cuts to literacy, I humbly request that the hon. member do what I did and go out and talk to people. Go up to Nunavut and ask the people there what is happening. There are volunteers up there who want to help people in their community who really have very serious problems. They are seeing those cuts. They are seeing the possibility of losing their money with the local college because it will not be able to fund them because there will not be the program funding that is necessary to keep themselves alive.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a real problem across the country. Let us not pretend it is not happening. There is $17 million out of the budget and we know exactly what impact it is going to have on literacy.</div>

I did not want to interrupt him.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204912"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have the pleasure to speak to this motion with respect to the decision of the government to cut $2 billion, $1 billion this year, to federal programs and organizations.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204913"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are not blind to the actions of the government. They know these cuts were vindictive and were only to serve the Conservatives' narrow vision of the country. Being on the finance committee and touring western Canada last week, being in Ottawa for the last six weeks, and hearing submissions about how people in Canada actually view their country and what holds Canada together, I can say that most Canadians certainly do not share that view.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204914"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us review the current fiscal situation of the government. On the very day the Conservatives announced cutbacks to those who need government support the most, the government announced a $13 billion surplus.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204915"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a surplus, no thanks to the Conservatives. The last time they were in office, as was just indicated, they left us a $43 billion deficit and an ever increasing debt.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204916"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year they inherited a surplus, the best economy in decades, the best fiscal situation in the G-8, and the lowest unemployment rate in decades. One would think they would at least listen to whatever remnants of progressives are left over there and show some compassion to the people of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204917"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cuts are okay. Program review is reasonable and sensible. We have done it in the past ourselves, but we did it so that we could put resources toward the people who needed help, not take it away from them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204918"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These cuts are wrong. They are meanspirited. The majority of them target women's groups, the poor, minority groups, the arts community and the non-profit sector. They are motivated by a narrow ideology and are targeted at programs that are at odds with the political thinking of the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204919"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example is the cut to the budget for the status of women. It is no secret that certain elements of the Conservative Party have a different view of the role and status of women than most Canadians, and certainly most Canadian women. Is cutting back a women's organization, like the status of women a matter of cutting costs? I do not think so. It is really meant to send a message to women's groups that Conservatives do not support the progress and the victories that women have achieved over the past number of decades. It is a disgrace.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204920"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women have fought so hard for their rights and equality, and let us not pretend the fight is over. As we look around this chamber we see that the fight is far from over. Yet that funding has been cut.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204921"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Conservatives axed a legal aid program that has helped minority groups and the marginalized defend their rights. The court challenges program introduced under Pierre Elliott Trudeau has proven its value in ways that are immeasurable, resulting in court decisions expanding the rights of Canadian women, the disabled, gays and lesbians, aboriginals and minority language groups. La Fédération acadienne de la Nouvelle-Écosse for example wrote to me last week indicating how much it will feel that loss.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204922"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do the Conservatives take Canadians for fools in suggesting that cutting this program is a case of streamlining administrative expenses? No. It is another example of how the Conservatives distrust some of the fundamental values of Canada, values that include the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204923"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next cut is to the Canada volunteerism initiative. It is an example of an organization that encourages citizens to participate voluntarily in organizations throughout Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204924"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-profit volunteer organizations touch on every aspect of Canadian life: health, sport, recreation, environment and cultural sectors. Why would that be gutted? The answer is simple. The Conservatives do not believe in government. They do not believe that government should support organizations like the CVI. They believe that everyone should fend for themselves, a page copied from their Republican friends.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204925"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next cut is to the summer career placement program. All members of the House are familiar with this program which was introduced by a Liberal government. This has employed hundreds of thousands of young Canadians. This past summer more than 45,000 Canadians found meaningful work, often in their field of study thanks to this important initiative and volunteer and community organizations benefited as well. Students were able to gain valuable experience and save money for tuition fees.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204926"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to cut the program in half is indefensible. Given the health of the federal government's finances, the program should have been expanded, not gutted. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204927"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have talked with representatives of the Canadian Federation of Students. It has yet to be given a coherent explanation as to why the federal government wants to save a measly $45 million when it has $13 billion to the good. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204928"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, review is good. Cuts are sometimes necessary. This review is bad.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204929"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next cut is the $17 million from literacy. Cutting $17.7 million from a program that helps millions of Canadians while sitting on a $13 billion surplus just does not make sense.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Literacy Nova Scotia and the Dartmouth Literacy Network, organizations like these put together programs for Canadians who need help and they do it on almost no budget at all, and now literacy has been further cut. The story is the same throughout other provinces and territories. In Nova Scotia seven major projects will not be funded, including a project to support the development and coordination of family literacy through a multitude of agencies and programs. I could go on about the great work that they do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204931"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next cut is to support for the social economy. In our region a program that was to be delivered through ACOA in support of the social economy was shut down completely. This initiative, which was funded in the 2004 budget, would support businesses and community groups which reach out to marginalized Canadians by giving them jobs or providing other services that help people in our communities. It was abruptly cancelled. I would ask members opposite to talk to some of the cooperatives in their area and ask them what they think of those cuts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204932"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, the list goes on. As with other cuts, there was no consultation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204933"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada today is a vibrant, peaceful and just country. Canadians have worked hard to make it so. Throughout our political history successive Liberal and Progressive Conservative governments have developed policies that value individuals and our communities and recognize that government can and should play a role in our national life.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204934"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Progressive Conservative Premier Danny Williams of Newfoundland and Labrador called the cuts worrisome and distanced himself from what he referred to as the right-wing federal Conservatives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204935"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians today are seeing what the real agenda is of the government. I suspect many Canadians also wonder what life would be like if the old Progressive Conservatives were still around. The Progressive Conservative Party is dead and its replacement is neither fair nor progressive.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204936"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahatma Gandhi said that a nation's greatness is measured by how it treats its weakest members. Canadians, in my view, inherently believe that we are all better off when the strong help the weak, that we are all affected by the suffering and the success of each other. We do not believe that government should abdicate its responsibility to the least advantaged. These cuts will hurt Canadians who need help the most. The government should be ashamed.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a literacy group in Manitoba which received $353,000 of taxpayers' money, his money and my money, and it had $10,000 worth of deliverables. Is that a good deal? We cut $2.5 million from administration from status of women organizations. That money is going back into action programs that actually help women. Is that not a good idea? There is $150 million of the savings identified as money that was never given to anyone anyway. Is it not a good idea to put that money into programs that actually do something?</div>

When we hear that cuts have been made to administration, it sounds an awful lot like what we heard originally when the EnerGuide program for low income Canadians was cut, or the EnerGuide program overall. We heard that it was administration. In fact, it was not administration; it was actually going in and doing work in homes so that further work could be done. It is the same thing with the cuts that we have heard about here.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot speak to the example he mentioned in Manitoba, but let me refer to a letter from someone in the Annapolis Valley who wrote to me and copied the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>. He is a director of Literacy Nova Scotia and the Valley County Learning Association and he is a learner as well. He had been in the workforce for 30 years and lost his job because the company closed its doors. He could not find work because he could not write his GED. He was devastated. He lost his job. He thought he was losing his mind. He could not find a full time job, he could not fill out a job application. He found help through the Annapolis Valley Learning Association. Now he says that the literacy programs may end, or they will have to cut back on programs to help learners. This is a travesty. These are real Canadians who are looking for a hand up, not a push down.</div>

However, we have to comment on the hypocrisy of the Liberal opposition motion today. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204944"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Liberals were in power, they were guilty of far more ruthless cuts with absolutely no consultation. All the same criticisms that they now apply to the Conservative government, we can apply to them in terms of the disproportionate impact on women to many of their cuts and the gender imbalance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204945"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are critical of the Conservative government for choosing to trim the budget where we do not believe there was any fat left to be trimmed. However, we are incredibly critical of the member's previous government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204946"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask my colleague from Nova Scotia, when his party was in power, what was he saying around the caucus table? What were the Liberals saying around their cabinet table? Were they arguing with the former finance minister when they were contemplating the most conservative right wing agenda in the history of Canada? Were they arguing when they were cutting, hacking, and slashing every social program by which we even define themselves? What were they saying then around the caucus table, or did they save it all for now to be bleeding after the fact and trying to rewrite history?</div>

There is no question that there was a reduction in the transfer payments, for example, for health to the provinces. If there had not been, we would not have a public health system today. We would have been bankrupt as a nation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Liberal Party did saved the social infrastructure of Canada. I was not in the caucus at that point in time, but I suspect that they were saying “these are tough cuts, but we've got to do them”. I know that. I was not at that caucus table, but I was at a caucus table in Nova Scotia. My father inherited Conservative deficits as well in 1993 and he had to make changes, changes that he never thought he got into government to do, but he did what he thought was right.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we were able to invest in the social infrastructure of Canada, we introduced things such as the child tax credit. People attribute the child tax credit to keeping child poverty below where it is. Should it be lower? We would love it to be lower. We are now in a position to make it lower. We now have money in this country to invest in kids and the government is not doing it. That is a shame. </div>

    </p><a name="Para204951"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our government, unlike the previous government, respects its commitments. We do what we say and we say what we do. This is something new for people who follow politics because they are used to a party that says one thing and the following day says the opposite while it goes on a spending spree. A change has taken place with the arrival of our new government. We have a responsible government that keeps its promises.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204952"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is a great day. Not because I am speaking in this House but because we have truly announced an effective policy to combat climate change and to overcome smog. This is what is called sustainable development.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204953"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sustainable development is also economics and it is responsible economics. That is what we are talking about today. We are talking about a government that does not want to leave future generations with a tax burden, with a debt. That is the reality. That is also sustainable development. To achieve that, we must manage our money not as though it was someone else’s money but as though it were our own money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204954"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is almost a year since the people of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78459,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78459&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Lévis—Bellechasse</A>, Canadians and a great many Quebeckers elected a new government that promised more transparency and greater accountability. The way that government uses public funds is by far the most important aspect of that promise. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204955"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canadians have seen that since we took office. Ask Canadian families, pensioners and businesses. They have more money in their pockets because income taxes and the GST have been reduced. Parents in Saint-Anselme and Saint-Henri who register their children in soccer, hockey, skating and judo programs receive tax credits. We are introducing concrete measures that help Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204956"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we also have a responsibility to properly manage the machinery of government. It is normal that the budget should be revised at regular intervals and that unnecessary expenses are cut. That is exactly what we are doing. We can thank the opposition for giving us the opportunity to tell Canadians about our budgetary exercise to cut expenditures on the order of $1.1 billion out of a total budget of more than $200 billion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204957"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will agree with me that these are very reasonable cuts, in fact very modest, amounting to barely 0.5%. Still, this is a big difference from the previous government. We know that in the last five years, total program expenditures had risen by an average of 8.2% per year. For 2004-2005 alone, expenditures rose 14.4%.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204958"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does a 14.4% a year increase in the federal budget represent? Had the population increased by 14.4%? Did Canadian taxpayers receive 14.4% more services? The answer is obvious. And yet we had to pay that money out. Unfortunately, we know that the previous government had the annoying habit of also cutting transfers to the provinces. There were increased expenditures, but less money for the people who really needed it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204959"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we said it and we have done it. In the election campaign we made the commitment to make budget cuts, and we have done so responsibly. This shocks people somewhat. Some people who were used to being here for so long thought it was their money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204960"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us talk about the Federal Accountability Act. Our first piece of legislation will create new and significant checks and balances. Parliament and Canadians will be able to see better where taxpayers’ money, our money, is being spent, and what the connection is between how it is being used and what measurable results are achieved.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204961"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where do we stand today? There are some people here, on the other side of the House, and their colleagues in the Senate, who are delaying passage of that bill. What is the Senate waiting for to pass the Federal Accountability Act? Maybe, with that piece of legislation, it will be more difficult to set up projects that lead to sponsorship scandals?</div>
    </p><a name="Para204962"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even more recently we learned that public servants had been lent to parties for political purposes, to hold phantom positions. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need laws that will protect the public’s money. I hope that the Senate will abide by the wishes of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204964"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government is honouring the commitment it made in the budget. Treasury Board announced it on September 25, 2006, to save money in two very simple ways: through tighter and more disciplined management of spending—something we started to do as soon as we took office—and by applying the results of the program review we did over the summer. We are looking at which of our programs, and where, it is possible to cut, ensuring that we get results, that we optimize the use of resources and that we adhere to the priorities of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204965"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing that our friends from Quebec will be particularly happy about is that we are a responsible government that respects the jurisdictions of the federal and provincial governments. We have a Constitution; let us abide by it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204966"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President of the Treasury Board has worked with the officials in his department, who have worked hard, and has consulted with ministers to identify departmental programs and expenditures that do not meet the criteria in the recent budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204967"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did we do over the summer? We cut unused funds. We ensured that programs were optimized and that the administrative cuts were rationalized and consolidated. As I said earlier, we dealt with programs that were not in keeping with the priorities of Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204968"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will provide a few examples of the cuts that were made to the Treasury Board portfolio. The previous government had decided to spend another $20 million in support for regional ministers. There is already a $3.8 million fund, and we think that is enough. It is unnecessary, therefore, to allocate these additional funds in the current budget. Eliminating this funding enables us to save $18.5 million of the taxpayers’ money. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204969"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reducing the funding for the Public Service Human Resources Management Agency of Canada program should generate more than $83 million in savings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204970"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the year, taxpayers may not have felt the difference, but they will feel it in their wallets. Insofar as program delivery is concerned, these kinds of cuts do not have any effect on citizens. Some cuts eliminated funding that had been allocated by the previous government but was superfluous to what was really needed to carry out certain classification activities deemed necessary. There is nothing so far to make a fuss about here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204971"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will save more than $9 million by reducing low-priority training for federal employees at the Canada School of Public Service. I was a public servant myself and can say that I benefited from wonderful working conditions. The school now has an $89 million budget for its programs. It is important to have competent, well-trained public servants. It is possible to do so. When we speak about low priority, it can hardly be denied that cuts are very possible in light of the situation of Canadian families that need us to manage their money responsibly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204972"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Henceforth, the government will ensure that judicious expenditures become the norm by subjecting all new and existing programs to systematic, rigorous review. This is an exercise that will often have to be repeated because priorities change, needs change and society evolves. Our government will only approve funding that is really necessary in order to efficiently achieve measurable results, while optimizing resources. Canadians are entitled to expect accountable government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204973"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to these initiatives, the new government will provide significantly greater transparency and accountability and optimized use of resources in all areas of federal government expenditure. Canadians expect nothing less. That is why this initiative is at the heart of the government’s management program. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204974"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a word, I gave the House a statistic to remember: in 2004-05, spending grew by 14.4% in a single year. That is a lot. We can support some growth, but it is important to maintain cross-generational equity. To do this, we must bequeath good management to future generations and ensure that the debt burden is reduced. </div>
    </p><a name="Para204975"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I say to the families, businesses and pensioners in <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78459,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78459&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Lévis—Bellechasse</A> that our government is continuing to take care of the disadvantaged, minorities and immigrants and that, in contrast to the previous government, we manage money as if it were ours and yours.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in the last budget of the Liberals, which the NDP helped defeat, income taxes were lowered from 15.5% to 15%. The Conservative's first budget increased them to 15.5%. Is 15% lower or higher than 15.5%?</div>

I am proud to stand behind these measures.</div>
    </p><a name="Para204999"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases hon. members of the opposition need reminding that managing the public's money is about making wise choices and spending responsibly, ensuring the maximum return on taxpayer investments. Canadians put their trust in us, when they signed on to our election platform, to restore transparency and accountability in dealing with public money. We made it clear throughout the campaign that responsible spending was a cornerstone of accountable government. We do not make idle promises. We stick with our convictions and follow through on our commitments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205000"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In budget 2006 we pledged to review our programs to ensure every taxpayer dollar would spent achieve results, provide value for money and meets the needs of Canadians. Just as the economy and society are evolving, so too must the way government invests in economic and social programming. Through a careful spending review, we have identified a number of opportunities to improve efficiency, strengthen results and sharpen accountability in line with Canadians expectations. As columnist John Ibbitson recently wrote in the <i>Globe and Mail</i>, “The Tories are acting with commendable fiscal responsibility”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205001"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most grants and contributions are not affected either. In cases where they are, all signed contribution agreements will be honoured. Statutory programs are not in any way affected by these measures, vital programs like employment insurance, the Canada pension plan, and student loans. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205002"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have focused our attention on spending that was not meeting the needs of Canadians as effectively as it could. We have looked for opportunities to better manage investments and to reduce or eliminate expenditures where concrete results were simply not there. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205003"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems the opposition has not grasped that responsible management of the public purse does not mean simply spending for the sake of spending. It means putting money where it counts and working with partners across the country to maximize results for Canadians in need. For instance, the social development partnerships program will invest $139.6 million over the next five years to work with national and community-based non-profit organizations. Support and collaboration on key social issues for children, families, people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups in Canadian society. We are focusing on investments that matter to real people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205004"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition has spent a lot of time attacking the government for its commitment to better and more effective investments in learning and literacy. With a budget of $81 million over the next two years, Canada's new government will be working with partners across the country to put in place innovative and results-focused projects to help meet learning and literacy challenges. We want federal funds to complement the important investments in literacy by provinces, municipalities and organizations. We welcome the opportunity to work with all levels of government and literacy organizations across the country to strengthen our literacy programming and ensure it is effective and meaningful for all Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205005"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada will continue to foster partnerships and dialogue to support adult learning, literacy and essential skills, while respecting the roles of all levels of government. We need to keep in mind that this $81 million investment is just one component of an array of federal investments that support literacy, training and skills development. These include programs through employment insurance that help Canadians who lose their jobs to develop the skills they need to re-enter the labour force.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205006"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are working with industry sector councils on projects that identify and develop the literacy and essential skills we need to keep our economy competitive. We are helping students succeed in post-secondary education through our Canada student loan program and have recently introduced changes that will make this program available to more Canadians than ever before.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205007"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As these examples make clear, there can be no question that the government continues to be strongly committed to providing effective and meaningful support to Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205008"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the money that Human Resources and Social Development Canada has invested, which is close to $1 billion annually, in programs targeting the needs of youth at risk, Canadians with disabilities, and aboriginal Canadians. These are important investments and we are proud to be working with partners across the country to ensure our programs are meeting the needs of Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205009"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have ended the training centre infrastructure fund, I want to point out that our government is investing $1 billion in infrastructure for post-secondary education and training. This will help keep our universities and colleges among the best in the world, giving Canadian students tremendous opportunities to succeed and to invite students from around the world to come to Canada as a study destination committed to educational excellence.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help meet the need for skilled trades, we are also providing significant new support for apprenticeships, including a new $1,000 apprenticeship investment grant. We will no longer be providing support to Workplace Partners Panel. However, we are continuing and, in fact, expanding our collaboration with business and labour on issues of national importance, for example, through sector councils that are focusing on preparing Canada to meet the challenges of the global economy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205011"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We value the views and advice of business and labour organizations. For example, we are seeking the advice of business communities on how to implement our child care spaces initiative. The government recognizes that consultation is more than just institutions and reports. We want to listen, share ideas and, together, find new ways to build a more vibrant, inclusive and innovative Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205012"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I remind the House, as the TD Bank Financial Groups' Chief Economist Don Drummond has noted, the spending cuts are relatively minor. They represent only 6% of the overall cost of new initiatives announced in the May budget. They are only 0.5% of total program spending.</div>

    </p><a name="Para205081"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians, especially war brides, children of Canadians who served in the armed forces in World War II, the children of Canadians born overseas to those who served in the armed forces and the diplomatic corps in the period 1947 to 1977, and lost Canadians who, because of gaps and biases in legislation, have been told they are no longer Canadian: these Canadians all face bureaucratic and legal nightmares to fully claiming their citizenship.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205082"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some, like Joe Taylor, the son of a British war bride and a Canadian who served in World War II, are forced to press for their citizenship in court. Mr. Taylor won but, sadly, the Conservatives decided to appeal. Maher Arar and others see their citizenship written off and wait for an apology and just compensation. Dual citizens see their loyalty questioned, even in the midst of war.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205083"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to celebrate Citizenship Week would be for the government to make it possible for these Canadians to fully claim their citizenship without delay.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is unanimous support for the continuation of the SCPI program among the advocacy groups. This program is essential.

    </p><a name="Para205343"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before making a ruling, I believe it is important to note that the member was incorrect when he asserted that the denial of citizenship to an adopted child was a de facto denial of an immigration visa and permanent residence status. The member made this argument to persuade you, Mr. Speaker, that there was no difference between citizenship and immigration matters so that you would conclude that the immigration appeal division of the Immigration and Refugee Board may hear citizenship matters.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205344"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that citizenship and permanent residency each have a very different status in law. Indeed, so substantial are the differences that each is defined in separate statutes, as are the procedures and applications relevant to them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205345"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, the member would have you overlook the fact that there is nothing in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act that provides the Immigration and Refugee Board with powers or a mandate to deal with citizenship. The procedures and process for citizenship are limited to the Citizenship Act. None of those procedures or processes refer to or relate to the IRB.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205346"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More fundamental to the argument by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78519,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78519&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Burnaby—Douglas</A> is his incorrect assertion that one can look past the lack of a citizenship mandate of the IRB by finding that citizenship decisions have an impact on the applicant's visa or permanent residence status application. The member, simply put, was wrong.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205347"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that denial of citizenship has little impact on permanent residence status. It is certainly incorrect to say that a denial of citizenship is a de facto denial of permanent residence. Under the current law it is possible for a permanent resident to apply for citizenship and be denied with the denial having no effect on his or her permanent residence status.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second significant error to the member's submission that I wish to clarify is his suggestion that the incompleteness of the amendments may be addressed by regulations to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2195400,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2195400&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-14</A> by stating:</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para205350"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member made this argument hoping to persuade you, Mr. Speaker, to overlook the fact that the legislation that creates the Immigration and Refugee Board does not already recognize citizenship or a role for itself in dealing with citizenship matters.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205351"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member's submission that a new role for the IRB can be delineated in regulations to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2195400,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2195400&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-14</A> is incorrect. I gave my remarks on October 6 on the inadmissibility of an amendment that requires subsequent amendment of an act that was not before the committee. I do not propose to repeat those comments here but to simply respond to the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78519,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78519&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Burnaby—Douglas</A>' contention and clarify that there are no provisions in the Citizenship Act or the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act that would permit the making of regulations that would change the existing mandate of the immigration appeal division.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205352"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If his submission is to be taken as being that the regulations to Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2195400,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2195400&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-14</A> can speak to the mandate and powers of the immigration appeal division and broaden them to allow the immigration appeal division to deal with a citizenship matter, then I would refer to my previous comments on October 6 only to add that regulations to an amendment of the statute may not amend another statute that was not before the committee.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205353"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this instance, regulations to an amendment to the Citizenship Act may not amend the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act which creates the mandate and powers of the immigration appeal division.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205354"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the royal proclamation, the argument essentially was that since there would no longer be appeals under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, somehow these funds could be applied to appeals under the Citizenship Act, is somewhat circular in the sense that if there is no appeal provision in respect to the adoption provision in the Adoption Act, moneys would be saved and in order for the appeal to happen we would require additional funding which would require a royal proclamation. For that reason, also, it would not be acceptable.</div>

    </p><a name="Para205368"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, the collective privileges of the House are categorized as the power to discipline; the regulation of its own internal affairs; the authority to maintain the attendance and service of its members; the right to institute inquiries, call witnesses and demand papers; the right to administer oaths to witnesses; and the right to publish papers containing defamatory material. In this particular instance, it is evident that none of these collective rights have been breached.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the Chair is being asked to judge whether this action by the government has challenged the perceived authority and dignity of Parliament. Let me review briefly the parameters of that authority as they relate to this case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205372"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the estimates and ways and means processes, Parliament authorizes the amounts and destinations of all public expenditures. Once Parliament has allocated the moneys, it is the prerogative of the government to manage these funds. On page 697 of the <i>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</i> it states:</div>
    </p><a name="Para205373"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>As the Executive power, the Crown is responsible for managing all the revenue of the state, including all payments for the public service. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para205374"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although responsibility for financial management belongs to the government, the House retains an important oversight role. Members, through the standing committee system, have an opportunity to examine how the government has managed these funds through their review of the estimates, the annual departmental performance reports, the Public Accounts of Canada and the reports of the Auditor General. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205375"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time ministers may be invited to appear before standing committees to defend these expenditures and the committees may report back to the House. In addition, as part of its responsibility for oversight of government activities, a committee may invite a minister to appear at any time to discuss administrative decisions. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205376"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following such inquiries, committees are empowered to report to the House concerning any comments or recommendations they may wish to make. The House then has the authority to take up the matter and deal with it as it sees fit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205377"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the duty of oversight goes to the very reason for the existence of Parliament and this range of activities represents the normal operations of this place. In this way, members who disagree with the course taken by the government on any particular issue can pursue such questions in a variety of ways. Since the avenues remain open to the hon. member, the Chair cannot conclude that the government's action on the Law Commission is flouting the authority of the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205378"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While members may have deep concerns about the decision to no longer fund the Law Commission of Canada, this decision does not constitute a breach of privilege. While the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78397,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78397&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Windsor—Tecumseh</A> may feel he has a grievance, I cannot find a prima facie case of privilege in this case. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205379"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the hon. member, however, for bringing this important matter to the attention of the Chair.</div>

    </p><a name="Para205382"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion accurately describes the present situation in which we find ourselves. The motion reads:</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para205383"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That, in the opinion of the House, the government inherited the best economic and fiscal position of any incoming federal government and has not demonstrated the need, value or wisdom of its announced expenditure cuts which unfairly disadvantage the most vulnerable groups in Canadian society.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para205384"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, I completely agree with the motion. We have seen that almost every federal government department has felt the wrath of these meanspirited cuts. What is all the more confusing is that they have done this when we, as a nation, are enjoying one of the best fiscal periods ever.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205385"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the Conservatives need a reminder of the financial record of our Liberal government. We posted eight consecutive budget surpluses, the longest string in our country's history, experienced record job growth, debt reduction and low interest rates. First home buyers were able to buy affordable homes under our mandate. We started the process of paying down the federal debt, some $55 billion, which saves $3 billion each and every year going forward. We also, though given that, were able to cut taxes for Canadians, the largest cut of taxes in Canada's history of $100 billion. At the same time, we were able to invest in health care, with the health care accord, some $41 billion to improve the health of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205386"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bold economic agenda set out by the Liberal government allowed Canadians to invest in our families and businesses. It allowed our government to invest in the social programs we as Canadians all value, such as health care, child care and education.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205387"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is more. As I said, we had debt retirement, investments in research and training, job creation, low unemployment, low inflation and strong sustained economic growth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205388"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will talk about one thing we did not do. We did not take advantage of the poorest and most disadvantaged in our country. Programs such as literacy programs, the court challenges program and many others are very important to my constituents in <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78509,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78509&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Etobicoke North</A> and, indeed, to Canadians across this land.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205389"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard details earlier in this debate of many of these cuts. I would like to focus on the cuts in natural resources. I do this because I am our party's critic for natural resources. Here we have seen a number of cuts that do not seem to make any sense whatsoever, programs such as the wind power production incentive program, the EnerGuide for houses retrofit program, funding to fight the mountain pine beetle program, programs for the development of new base metals, the leading edge long telescope system, or VLBI, are all gone. All these valuable programs are gone.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205390"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time when the country is experiencing unprecedented fiscal prosperity, the government has decided to attack and slash these important programs. At a time when we need to improve our energy efficiency, when we need to conserve energy and we need to encourage alternative energy sources, the government has shown a callous disregard for programs that we know are working and working very well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205391"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reference to the EnerGuide program, in spite of very clear advice from the departmental experts to keep these programs alive, the minister and the government decided to scrap this effective and popular program. The only reason we can deduce it did that is for ideological reasons, not for reasons of program efficiency and effectiveness.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para205392"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this was a mistake that needs to be corrected. There is no shame in that. In this case, it is clear to everyone that a mistake was made.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205393"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clifford Maynes, executive director of Green Communities Canada, asserted that the elimination of the EnerGuide program could set back the residential energy efficiency file by at least 10 years.</div>

    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para205394"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On average, this program was achieving about 30% energy savings for homeowners. The $75 million that was spent in the program, from October 2003 to March 2006, will yield $975 million in energy savings over the life of the retrofit investments. The government must recognize this error and reinstate the program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205395"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard from the minister that 50¢ out of every dollar was for administration. We know this is not correct. The deputy minister clarified this at committee and indicated that 12¢ out of every dollar was for administration.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205396"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also very hard to believe that the wind power production incentive program has been frozen.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para205397"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rapid development of the wind energy sector in Canada, which is proving to be one of the main contributors to the diversification of energy sources for the next 20 years, now is not the time to freeze or cancel such important programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205398"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal Party recognizes this fact, as did the Liberal government, which is why we committed to expanding the wind power production incentive in the 2005 budget, by quadrupling the previous program and by promising $200 million over five years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205399"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector's response was very positive, and so were industry comments on the program.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para205400"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent report of the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development has said that the wind power production incentive program has stimulated investment. It goes on to say that there is broad-based support for the program from provincial governments, companies and utilities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205401"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we know that many provinces, like the province of Quebec, are planning a huge expansion in window power. Wind power has the potential to offer a very real alternative. It is not the complete solution nor is it the complete replacement for fossil fuels, but it has great promise. We need to encourage and provide the incentives necessary to keep that program moving forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205402"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78751,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78751&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"> Minister of Natural Resources</A> to freeze further funding for this program is imperiling this important industry and imperiling many jobs and investments. For example, every one megawatt of installed wind energy capacity in Canada generates $1.5 million in investment and creates 2.5 direct and 8 indirect person years of employment. If 5% of Canada's electricity were generated by wind energy in 2015, and I think we have the potential actually to move that benchmark up to 20% of our total energy needs in Canada, this development would produce $19.5 billion in investment and create 32,500 direct and 104,000 indirect person years of employment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205403"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, given that this program was being used, that it was effective and that we all recognize wind energy is an important component in Canada's future power supply, we must immediately reinstate this program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205404"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could go on. There are other areas that have been cut and slashed from this important portfolio of natural resources. The government has hacked and slashed for crass political reasons and has done so at the cost of our environment. Some very important programs were working well for all Canadians. They were moving us closer to our objectives of reducing greenhouse gasses and creating a better environment for ourselves, our children and our children's children. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205405"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axing these important programs is severely hurting Canada's ability to fight climate change and control pollution. The government must be held accountable, and we on this side will ensure that this happens.</div>

Some of the language we have heard from the Liberals, during the course of this debate and over the past couple of weeks, has been hyperbolic at best. We are talking about cutting less than one-half of 1% of the federal budget. That is it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205407"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague and some members of other parties in the House have mentioned programs. There is no question they are sincere in the concern about what these cuts will mean to some specific programs. However, to describe this as somehow meanspirited and draconian, as the Liberals describe, is insincere and wrong. This is a very small cut. We are cutting, for example, a number of programs where money was allocated but never spent. For example, $20 million was set aside for fish farms, polluting dirty fish farms, in Nova Scotia. That money was allocated but never spent. It is hardly draconian cutting spending that was never in fact done; it was just allocated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205408"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most important aspect of the Conservative fiscal plan is that we are paying down the debt by over $13 billion. When I was first elected to this place six years ago, I was 24 years of age. The big issue in that campaign, and it continues to be for young Canadians, is that the federal government has to pay down the federal debt so future generations of young Canadians are not hammered economically because of the broken and failed promises of politicians they have never met.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205409"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made the largest debt paydown in Canadian history, over $13 billion. It is to the benefit of young Canadians. We have done this with small cuts to programs, which are reasonable cuts. It is less than one-half of 1% of the federal budget. If we cannot do that, then the Liberals are saying there is no way we can possibly pay down the debt if we cannot even get that done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205410"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are doing is entirely fiscally responsible. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business says so. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce says so. My constituents are saying so. They applaud the fiscal measures. Just because the federal government has a surplus, it does not mean the money is being spent well. There is no better expenditure for young Canadians than to pay down the debt and give them a better future.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member cannot really give us a lesson in paying down debt. We started the process. We paid down $55 billion in debt, but we did not focus only on one aspect.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal legacy has been a $13 billion surplus, amassed on the backs of ordinary Canadians, on cities, on provinces in which services were downloaded, More than that, it has resulted in 13 years of inaction over greenhouse gas emissions, of increasing disparity between the rich and poor in Canada. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, we went through just the opposite of that with the Conservatives in power.

I suppose it would be easy to repeat many of the points again, but I thought I would change gears a little to see if we could maybe put this in terms my grandma would understand.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205425"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Canadians are aware of the history of the Liberal Party. They are aware of what it did during its term of office that ended last January. Canadians also will know that the financial year of the Government of Canada ends on March 31 and the Conservative government started to sit in April of this year. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205426"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Auditor General finally did her work and reported on the financial position of the Government of Canada for the 12 months ending March 31, 2006, which was just before the Conservative government called Parliament together, there was a $13.2 billion surplus. This is something that we as Canadians should celebrate. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205427"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A surplus is not a bad thing. In fact, it shows good fiscal responsibility. It means the debt can be paid down and the money spent on interest can be saved. Indeed, the interest savings are going to be approximately $600 million a year. That is a good thing because that is the real fiscal dividend.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205428"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can remember our discussions in 1997. When we came in, we inherited the Brian Mulroney financial situation of the country, with a $42 billion deficit. It took three years after we were first elected to whittle that down to the first balanced budget, which occurred in 1997. The members might be interested to hear the question we were then posing, which was about getting to the point where we were actually going to balance the books. That is a good thing. Canadians want that. As a matter of fact, I believe that Canadians say it is unacceptable for any party in government to incur a deficit unless there are extraordinary circumstances clearly beyond its control. We are not going back into deficit. I do not think there is a party in this place, maybe other than the NDP, that would want to go back into a deficit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205429"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I will say we must understand that the Auditor General determined in September that, as of March 31, $13.2 billion was the number. Under the rules of accounting of the Government of Canada, the entire amount goes to pay down debt. No decision was taken by anybody. March 31 was over six months ago. The moneys already were applied against the debt. There was no decision to be taken.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205430"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in 1997 when we were talking about having our very first balanced budget and maybe a small surplus, people were saying, “What should we do with the surplus?” We then got into defining what the real fiscal dividend would be to Canadians. What was the benefit to Canadians of having a surplus? It is not the surplus in itself, which goes to pay down the debt; it is the interest savings on the financing of the debt. It is the interest savings year after year. A surplus only occurs in one year, but if the bank loan is paid down, that means interest for all the years thereafter will be lower than otherwise projected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205431"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We passed on a healthy situation to the Conservative government. That is a good thing. We should celebrate that, but now, each and every year, each and every government, regardless of what party it is, has to be a responsible government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205432"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate I have heard indicates that people are getting a little partisan about this. They are talking about somebody maybe doing things because they really do not have their eye on the ball of making “good laws and wise decisions”, as we pray each day. They are not looking at an integrated vision for Canada, an economic plan and a social plan and things that would work together to make our country even better than it is. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205433"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we build up immunity to big hits during a recession? How do we deal with high unemployment, should that occur? In one year, if we were to go into a deficit, we could have a $6 billion additional charge to the EI fund just because of the unemployment caused by a recession.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550">(1550)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para205434"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talk here about billions of dollars, but ordinary Canadians are looking at their paycheques. Most Canadians who talk to us are saying that they have family responsibilities and bills to pay and they have to provide for their future. They say they work hard for every dollar they earn and they want, expect and deserve fiscal responsibility from the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205435"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So yes, there was a $13.2 billion surplus. It paid down debt. It is going to save us approximately $600 million a year. That is a good thing, but that $600 million a year is new dollars available to invest in the priorities of Canadians. It should be invested in things like health care, things for our youth and seniors, and for government efficiency, to continue to do things as we are able to, and for tax cuts as they are affordable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205436"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsible government is about having a vision. I think the debate going on back and forth around the House is questioning whether or not, on a partisan basis, someone is doing things for partisan reasons. Perhaps rather than having their eye on a vision of Canada and how we are going to have responsible government in Canada, they are in fact looking at when the next election is going to be. Is it really going to be next spring after the budget comes down? The Bloc Québécois has already said it is voting against the budget because it is not concerned. The role of the official opposition is to oppose and we will be opposed to the budget, because we already know that the government made commitments in its last election platform and many of them have not been introduced into this place yet.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205437"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next fiscal period, there are significant undertakings. One of them, I am afraid to say, is going to be tremendously expensive, and that is the wait times guarantee. I am not going to get into that, but there was no money in the last budget. There will have to be a lot of money in the next budget if the government is going to make a serious commitment to achieving a platform objective.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205438"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, what the economists have worked out is that in the next budget we have to trim something like $23 billion of what we spend today, in this fiscal year, so that we can pay for the $23 billion in additional promises that were made by the Conservatives in their last platform. That is not partisan. That just happens to be the fact. Those are the undertakings of the government of the day, so we know things are going to be happening.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205439"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the government comes to this place and announces that there will be a billion dollars in cuts and another billion two years from now, it is inconsequential. I do not think they really have to do that, but some of those cuts touched a chord with ordinary Canadians like my grandma.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205440"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seniors are affected by this and our youth are affected by this, as are the illiterate in our country. Members well know that illiteracy in Canada is way higher than most Canadians even realize. People are unable to read a simple instruction manual on how to operate machinery, equipment or any other technological item. That is the world we live in. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205441"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78780,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78780&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">President of the Treasury Board</A> struck a nerve with a lot of Canadians when he said about literacy that the government is cutting adult literacy programs because those people are already adults, they cannot read and so nothing can be done about it.

That is a billion dollars. Let us talk about a billion dollars. Saying that it is only a half of 1% is not the way to look at it. It is a billion dollars, and there are some cuts there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205443"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians want to understand why Parliament does things and why we do things. I felt really bad to hear a minister of the Crown say that we are not going to do this any more in adult literacy because they are old people now and we cannot teach an old dog new tricks. That is just not the way it works. I think we have the responsibility, collectively in the House, but certainly with the lead of the government, to make sure that we do not leave anyone behind. All Canadians need hope.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out to him, to his grandmother and to all of the other people who happen to be listening to this or will hear it in the future, that when it comes to economics, it is something like steering a ship. I read somewhere a long time ago that the captain of a large ocean liner has to begin his turn some 10 miles before he actually expects the direction of the ship to change, because of the inertia of it. The same thing is true economically. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205446"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hasten to point out that the debt, which the Liberals claim they inherited in 1993 from the Conservatives of the day, was in fact nothing more than the Liberal debt from 1972 onward, with accumulated interest. That is really what it was. During its time of being in power, the Conservative government actually had a balanced budget on programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205447"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a long term thing. I think if the Liberals were honest they would have to admit that it was some of the programs like NAFTA, and even the GST, which they said they would cut, these things, that set in motion the ability of this ship to turn nine years down the road. If it had not have been for that, they would not have been able to do even what they did.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205448"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond that, during their short time between 1999 and 2003, government spending went up 50% under those Liberals.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are just a little bit below that today even though we have had balanced budgets since 1997, the reason being the deficit that had to be eaten away. In 1994, I believe the $42 billion deficit went down to something like $27 billion. It actually went up to $550 billion. Then we paid down about $60 billion worth of debt, so we are just a little better with the total federal debt than we were when we started. In fact, it is almost the same.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the finance department agrees, asking how often provincial governments have balanced budgets since 1984. The NDP balanced the books 49% of the time, whereas the Liberal Party did so 23% of the time. I want to make that point.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I rise to speak in the House of Commons for the first time since I was named as the Bloc Québécois Treasury Board critic. I will do everything in my power to honour the example of my late colleague, Benoît Sauvageau, and Odina Desrochers, another Bloc member who filled the same role.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205463"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, we are discussing a motion by the Liberal Party concerning the cuts of more than a billion dollars made by the Conservative government. These cuts will affect vulnerable groups, organizations and citizens in our society. People whose lives have been shattered by their economic situation will be very much affected by these cuts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205464"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my remarks today, I will try to deal with three subjects.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, by cutting one billion dollars the government is not living up to a promise that it made to Quebec in the last election campaign to address the fiscal imbalance. There is no attempt to do that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we believe the government could have made cuts in its operating expenditures rather than in the programs that affect individual citizens. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205467"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we believe that the Conservatives have made ideological cuts. Indeed, they are attacking the most needy, along with minority groups and programs that provide checks and balances on the government. They have refused to consider possible economies in the Department of National Defence. That is why we call these ideological cuts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205468"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us agree on one fact. At the end of fiscal year 2005-2006, the federal debt was $481.5 billion, a drop of $81.4 billion from the peak of $562.9 billion in 1996-1997. Expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product, the federal debt is now at its lowest level in 24 years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205469"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The point that I want to bring out in my remarks is that the Liberals and the Conservatives must stop attacking the needy members of our society with their budget cuts. They must start thinking about the people of Quebec and Canada, who suffer under this desire to reduce the debt at all costs, with no compassion for the most vulnerable groups in our society, groups who need help. We must help them in those areas where we show concern for people, for individuals, those who should receive help from the government to which they contribute every year through various forms of taxation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a surplus of $13 billion, and indeed a little more. Whether the previous government or this government produced that surplus, the fact remains that it is all taxpayers’ money. This is not Liberal money or Conservative money. It is money from Quebeckers and Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we have to pay our debts. There is an old saying that a person who pays his debts increases his wealth. The fact remains that we could use part of that $13 billion to pay down the debt and also use part to help people.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1605"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605">(1605)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para205472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not take part of it to help the taxpayers who need some help and not just pay off interest on an accumulated debt when people are suffering in our society?</div>
    </p><a name="Para205473"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we are very rich, when we put our money in the bank and act like Ebenezer Scrooge, we are not showing compassion for people. We are only showing that we are closing our eyes to any realities that do not suit us. We are just trying to look good in an electoral platform, which is purely ideological and has nothing to do with human feelings, with the entreaties of society, whether from agencies or individuals who need help.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205474"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is an example. A few minutes ago I heard a representative of the cabinet, a parliamentary secretary, saying that they had just cut about 1% of the budget just to reduce expenditures. This $1 billion is 1% too much. Not only was $13 billion paid towards the debt, but a way was also found to cut into the money that had already been put in place. It had been spent, was about to be spent, or its spending had been delayed, but a cut was made nevertheless. It is as though $14 billion had been set aside.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205475"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot imagine how the Conservative government can seriously tell us that it is just 1%. Go and tell that to the people who today are suffering from cuts among the first nations or among French-speaking people, people in Canada who no longer are even entitled to challenge governments that do not respect the Canadian Constitution. Go and explain this situation to the people who want to inspect our food to make sure that we do not end up with deaths caused by mad cow disease or food poisoning.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205476"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to go farther than the bank or the institution that lent us some money. These are mechanisms that will not vanish tomorrow morning. Yes, the mistakes of the past must be corrected. There are deficits in the federal government that have been accumulating since the years of the Trudeau regime. Nevertheless we must not put all our eggs in one basket.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205477"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are human beings in Quebec and Canada and this must be understood at some point. I have heard such ugly things from people on the right as, “Anyway, poor people do not vote.” What a fine social conscience!</div>
    </p><a name="Para205478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to help the most vulnerable. We are leaders in this society. That is why we have to help people who have needs and who, all too often, no longer believe in the system. They might stop voting. The participation rate is low. When we see tangible evidence that the most vulnerable people do not come to the system that is supposed to help them, we must ask ourselves whether it might be our responsibility to reach out to them. That one magic word, “humanitarian”, indicates that it is our responsibility to help those who need it most.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205479"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a $13 billion surplus. Do not make more cuts. That makes no sense. The Liberals can crow about it being their surplus all they want, and the Conservatives can say it is thanks to them, but that is all garbage, because reality is flesh and bone: these are people with a soul, with spirituality, and we have to do whatever we can to help them. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205480"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fiscal imbalance means that the federal government has more money than it needs to tend to its constitutional responsibilities, while the provinces do not have enough for health care, education, income assistance, social services, assistance to municipalities and culture. The fiscal imbalance absolutely must be corrected. What does that mean? It means that the federal government must give Quebec and the other provinces what they have a right to for areas that fall under their constitutional responsibility.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government must correct the fiscal imbalance. That is what they promised to do during the last federal election. I hope they will fix it. If they do not, another election may happen sooner than expected. </div>

Ultimately, what this government is intending on doing, and I think it is reasonable to expect of any government, just like any business, is to periodically review the massive expenditures that it goes through.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205483"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous Liberal government had an opportunity to pay down $40 billion more on the deficit, which would have left us with $5 billion to $8 billion extra to provide for services.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205484"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the previous government that was attempting to be everything to all people, this government is taking a reasonable approach. We need to provide money to those programs that actually work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205485"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are asking that of our health care community. We ask that of our educational institutes. We look for areas where there is wasted money. Indeed, most of the programs that the gentleman is referring to were not cut at all. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205486"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how loud we want to get in the House of Commons does not make it accurate. The fact is that in 1999 government spending was $119 billion. In 2003 government spending had risen to $178 billion. That is so far above any standard in this country. It was out of control.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205487"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not cut programs dealing with literacy. We do not need to pay folks to fly around the country and do more studies to tell us that literacy rates in 1994 compared to 2004 have not changed. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian taxpayers expect value for their dollar. This government is committed to putting $80 million into literacy programs to help Canadians in programs that will work, not just spend money for the sake of spending money. The member should know that. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They could eliminate tax havens. This would help more than cutting funding to groups who need it.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They could stop looting the employment insurance fund like their predecessors did. Since they have been in power, the Conservatives have taken $2 billion from the employment insurance fund. This money comes from employee and employer contributions and the government used it to pay down part of the debt.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205494"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By adopting this new attitude they would get to the heart of the problem. They would be taking money and giving it to those who deserve it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205495"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By eliminating tax havens—it was even a campaign issue in the last two federal elections—they would not have to cut assistance to those who need it. Instead they would be taking money from those who do not deserve it.</div>

    </p><a name="Para205506"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para205507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These three parts of the Conservative plan must be kept in mind in order to understand the ideological approach of this minority Conservative government. I will therefore focus on these three parts, one at a time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205508"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us speak, first, about debt reduction. My hon. colleague just said it, but I want to say it again: the federal debt is at its lowest level in 24 years. The Conservative government has chosen to put the $13 billion surplus toward paying down the debt. To do this, it has deliberately chosen to penalize an important segment of the public, the most vulnerable people, and it has even announced in advance that it will continue doing so as long as it is in power.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205509"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This government is no more interested than the previous one in the legitimate and necessary redistribution of wealth around communities. Some of these surpluses could have been well used, among other things, to assist the regions, the unemployed and our older workers who are experiencing on all sides a major crisis in the forest industry. These surpluses could have been used to deal at least partially with the fiscal imbalance. But no, this is not one of the Conservative government’s priorities. The real needs of people are simply not a priority for it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205510"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the Conservative plan has to do with what I will call “internal” cuts. These are minimal cuts to the government's operating expenses. I say “minimal” because they represent only a quarter of the total cuts of $1 billion. Cuts to the machinery of government represent only a quarter of the total. Once again, the Conservative government has deliberately chosen not to significantly reduce government operating expenses. Instead, it has chosen to slash spending that affects the public. Seen another way, this spending represents investments in people. The government would even have us believe that these internal cuts are due in part to efficiency gains. These gains are so efficient that, for Health Canada, $28 million has been targeted—I do not know whether it is by the finance department or the Treasury Board—yet Health Canada does not even know the details. This is a great way of doing things. What is more, the government has the audacity to present the decision to cut unspent funds as inconsequential, without showing any concern about the negative effects of not using this money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205511"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at a few examples: at Natural Resources Canada, the government is cutting the mountain pine beetle initiative, which essentially helps companies in British Columbia that are hard hit by the softwood lumber crisis; at Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the government is cutting funds for the salmon ranching industry, which benefit New Brunswick; at the Economic Development Agency of Canada, the government is cutting uncommitted funds earmarked for the social economy, which will cost Quebec $5 million, because this money will not be invested in the social economy; for the rest of Canada, the government is cutting $34 million.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620">(1620)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para205512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can the government explain the fact that it could not spend $25 million for the textile and garment industry which needs it so badly, $50 million for the Northwest Territories, $20 million for the Fisheries and Oceans Canada programs I mentioned earlier, or $14 million for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, when we know that we are threatened by potato blight, bird flu and mad cow disease?</div>
    </p><a name="Para205513"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those are only a few examples, but I think they speak volumes. We are entitled to wonder about these cuts, in the form of cancellation of the funds that should be been used, that should have made a genuine contribution to focussed, useful assistance objectives. The government has chosen to end that funding in order to meet its objective of a mathematically calculated cut of $1 billion over two years. This is irresponsible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205514"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third point relates to the cancelled programs. The real reductions, the real cuts, are being made in programs and initiatives that affect the most vulnerable people, as I said earlier. Once again, because of the short time available to me, I will name only a few of the programs affected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205515"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the Canada Revenue Agency, the elimination of advisory committees amounts to $1.4 million. Heritage Canada has been handed a 50% cut because of a reduction in assistance to museums, amounting to $4.6 million. Cancellation of the court challenges program amounts to $5.6 million. For the justice system, with the cancellation of another legal program, the Law Commission of Canada, the government is saving $4 million. At Human Resources and Social Development Canada, there will be a $13 million reduction in grants and contributions to the social development partnerships program. Learning and literacy programs are being cut by $17.7 million. At Industry, we have a reduction in support program funding, including Technology Partnerships Canada, in the amount of $42 million. At Health Canada, $10 million earmarked for smoking cessation programs for the First Nations and Inuit people is being cut.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although this is not an exhaustive list—that was my point—it is enough to show how the Conservative government’s cuts are affecting services to vulnerable people and businesses. In addition, by attacking programs that allow minorities to make their voices heard, or that provide the most disadvantaged people with ways of defending their interests, the Conservative government is making ideological choices—what am I saying?—is imposing its ideology and is doing a serious disservice to a segment of the public that it should be helping and supporting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205517"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge everyone with access to the Internet to visit the Department of Finance site to see with their own eyes—because it really is almost unbelievable, to read for and by themselves just how sympathetic this government is when it describes the programs I have just listed as wasteful, when it explains that it has cut the fat, when it congratulates itself for saving $15 million in lawyers’ fees because it made an agreement—as we well know—that left $1 billion behind for the United States, and thus deprived our forestry companies of $1 billion. And for this it congratulates itself.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205518"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will conclude by pointing out that the federal government has more money than it needs to look after everything under its jurisdiction, with a $13 billion surplus and a $7 billion increase in its operating expenses over the last 10 years. It also has all the resources it needs to solve the fiscal imbalance. </div>

They ensure they have saved a few cents, so that they can afford to pay their property taxes, provincial taxes and federal taxes. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205521"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is up to the Government of Canada to show the same kind of responsibility with regard to its budget as the families that go to work every day, pay their taxes, and try to make ends meet. That is why the government is treating the finances of this country the same as average Canadians treat their finances, by finding savings here and there so that they can afford to do the things they have to do for their families. These families want to be responsible. They want to pay down their mortgages, so that near the end of their financial cycle they can afford to pay for their children's high school.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is precisely not what the Conservative government did. It did not look at how it could make cuts internally in order to trim government fat. It did not do that at all. It made only a 25% cut.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already said, in a proportion of 75%, the Conservative government did more harm by not helping its citizens and by making ideological budget cuts.</div>

We receive information that our funding is cut, of course we lobby and advocate for its reinstatement and then we are told that we will not receive that money because we are advocates and lobbyists. This is like the Salem Witch Trials—throw them in the water, if they sink, they are innocent—if they swim, then they are witches. Cut our funding, if we say nothing, we are slowly and silently eliminated, if we make noise, we are lobbyists and don't deserve funding. Our Coalition project had NO money allocated to advocating or lobbying. It had money to provide training for practitioners, promotion for the development of literacy skills, the establishment of a learner's network and more. Yet, our funding was eliminated. Of course we do some advocacy work, don't you think literacy is worth advocating for? We are speaking for hundreds of thousands of Canadians who are affected by the stigma of illiteracy. If [the minister] thinks the majority of Coalition funding is spent on advocacy and lobbying, she is sadly misinformed. But, if she thinks coalition workers won't stand up to defend and advocate for literacy, she is also wrong. Learners deserve to have a voice and shouldn't be punished for having one.</small></td>

I draw something to the attention of the House. The Conservative government's finance department issued a report saying that the NDP had the best fiscal track record across all parties and all levels of government in 1984 and 2006. We did this by investing in programs for people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205580"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to remind the hon. member that his party made some of the largest cuts in Canada's history to our cherished social programs, which took our social spending back to 1949 levels. At the same time it gave the largest corporate tax breaks in Canadian history. Three-quarters of the personal income tax cuts went to the wealthiest 8% of Canadians. In that period we saw the deterioration of our health care system, an increase in child poverty of 60%, tuition fees more than doubled and workers' wages went down. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205581"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the hon. member. The cuts announced by the Conservative government are truly devastating for many vulnerable Canadians. I specifically want to affirm his comments about literacy. These cuts are particularly meanspirited. This is not just about people having conferences. It is about reaching out to the community, trying to help people who need these literacy programs the most. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $1 billion the government wants to allegedly save could have been cut from the subsidies to the oil and gas sector, which were also in place under my colleague's government. Why does he think the Conservative government chose to continue subsidizing the oil and gas sector, but cut programs to some of the most vulnerable and needy people in our society?</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What made Canadians even more angry was the fact that the government announced the $1 billion cut in programs for the needy on the same day it announced a $13 billion surplus.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The $5 billion Kelowna accord was an historic agreement that could have brought a group of Canadians together, a group that is below average in all sorts of important segments in life such as health, learning, child birth and death.

The first question that springs to mind is that out of that $1 billion in cuts were $47 million we saved by reducing the size of cabinet. I am wondering if the member is considering members of the former Liberal cabinet to be among Canada's most vulnerable and we should have perhaps extended that. I think not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I want to make just a couple of comments about the literacy funding itself. For the member's benefit, in all seriousness, I have been involved in my home province of Saskatchewan in literacy programs and campaigns for many years. In fact, I was the head of the Peter Gzowski fundraiser for literacy, a major fundraising campaign that Peter Gzowski established with no government assistance for three years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Gzowski's commitment to the then Governor General of Canada was to raise over $2 million for literacy. He established this program across Canada. I ran it in Saskatchewan. We were very successful and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars without one nickel of government money. To suggest that all Conservative members are meanspirited and do not care about literacy is not only a falsehood but insults and offends me. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say this about the cuts about which my hon. colleague talked. A recent article in the <i>Winnipeg Sun</i> talked about the cuts to what I believe was called the Literacy Partners of Manitoba. This article indicated that the particular foundation in question did not deliver one nickel toward literacy programming. It was merely an advocacy program. The closest it came to delivering direct money for direct programs in literacy was a 1-800 number that was utilized on average less than once a day. When people phoned the 1-800 number, they were directed to a government department that directed money to programming for literacy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for Canadians to know that not one existing agreement in place, not one program has been cut. Most of the literacy programs are provincially directed. It is in the provincial jurisdiction. We are putting over $80 million into fundraising for the programs that will help Canadians directly learn how to read and write and that is a record of which to be proud.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada’s history did not begin yesterday. It was built brick by brick by women and men from every part of the country who fought for the right to equality.

    </p><a name="Para205599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The irony in all this is that the government opposite is using women to do this dirty work. The women sign and the men give the orders.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, Persons Day was celebrated on Parliament Hill. The reception took place here in the Parliament buildings. The event took the form of an exhibition highlighting women, some better known than others. All those women had their heads severed above the neck, the mouth or the forehead. The message was powerful: women still feel cut off from society. This is what comes of the cuts by this government because as of now, from what we have heard, they are going to do away with recognition of women by the UN, by Canada, and they are going to cut strengthening of equality under the Canadian Charter of rights and Freedoms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is one example among many others: the Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of Women is a national institute that focuses on research and promotion of equality for women, and that, no doubt, will lose all of its funding of nearly $300,000 because this institute falls into the category of organizations that will no longer be funded by the government, since its mandate includes research and promotion of equality for all women.</div>

These cuts were made despite the fact that our agreements had already been signed. These dollars would have expanded apprenticeship programs, literacy essential skills programs, workplace skills development programs and would have improved labour market integration of recent immigrants to Canada.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a government, we are providing a great deal of money for programs that are available to older people who want to learn to read. That is in our budget. Millions of dollars are provided for that purpose. But the hon. member did not mention those facts. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205618"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to say that the reason why the Liberals are not happy with the changes made is that they want to spend the taxpayers’ money on their friends. We have put an end to the practice of giving money directly to the Liberals’ friends. That is the real reason why they are not happy. The Liberals had a history of waste and corruption such as has never been seen in the entire history of Canada.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to know why the hon. member does not want Canadians to know that we have not cut services. This only involves the special interest groups that the Liberals had favoured.</div>

It is an excellent program for summer work for students and for community organizations running things like day camps and doing community economic development. In my riding almost 100% of the money went to non-profit organizations and small businesses to run that program. Now the Conservatives have cut the money by over 50% to student employment, which I think is outrageous.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205625"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem I have is that the scissors must have been warm because the Liberals tried to cut that program by 30% in many ridings in the last Parliament.

    </p><a name="Para205630"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin by thanking my colleague from across the floor, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78387,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78387&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Markham—Unionville</A>, for offering me the opportunity to discuss the importance of responsible budget planning. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205631"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he and I may duel a little bit at the finance committee, he likes the GST and I happen to dislike it, we still can have a fruitful discussion about the nation's finances.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205632"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This topic raises an important question, a question that tells us a lot about our values and how best to translate them into a better economy for Canadians and for our families; an economy that can keep pace in the increasingly fast paced and advanced global arena; an economy with better job opportunities; and a higher standard of living and greater opportunity for Canadians to learn, to earn and to invest in the future of their want for themselves and their families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205633"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listen to the families in St. Catharines and Canadian families all over. What they tell me is that they want some basic budgeting principles applied when they manage their finances. First, they do not want the government to spend beyond its means. Canadians understand this and Canada's new government understands it as well. Not only do we understand this, but we are acting on it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205634"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We announced significant spending control measures to ensure that the government does not spend beyond its means and that spending is effectively focused on the priorities of all Canadians. We have clearly indicated that a strategy is in place to secure $1 billion in savings this year and next, as we promised in the spring budget. We saw that federal program spending was down $1.1 billion from the previous year, the first year over year decline in nine years. This is a critical point. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205635"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to use some quotes to support our focus. First, “The government plans to make a regular exercise of chopping low priority programs to fund the Liberal agenda”. Second, “When it comes to funding and savings”, this individual said, “philosophically I believe it's absolutely the right thing to do”. This gentleman went on to say that his initial goal of bringing in excess of $12 billion out of government departments was just a start. Finally, he said, “There's no doubt you can't find $12 billion or even a chunk of it without affecting jobs”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205636"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the House is waiting in breathless anticipation to hear who said those things. It was not me. It was not the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78780,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78780&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">President of the Treasury Board</A>.

    </p><a name="Para205637"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, what the government is doing is what my hon. friend from across the floor agrees should be done. We have secured savings by identifying unused funds for programs that will not proceed. These are funds in excess of what is required to achieve results.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205638"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous spend-happy government liked to have its hand in the cookie jar so much that it could not be bothered to put the lid back on the jar. In fact, it became known across the country as the sponsorship jar because it was so easy to get into it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205639"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government has thrown out the jar and put the funds where they belong the most, with the highest priorities of Canadians. We also confirm that Canada's new government is reducing the national debt by $13.2 billion, one of the largest pay downs of debt reduction in Canadian history. This means that federal debt is actually down $561 for each and every Canadian and that the federal government will save approximately $650 million this year and every year into the future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205640"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This represents substantial progress. It is reflected in the favourable ratings we receive from investment houses and bond rating agencies, which will result in lower interest for all Canadians at all levels of government, including right here and starting right here at the federal level.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paying down the national debt means lower interest payments for all Canadians, freeing up resources for real priorities like tax reduction, supporting our seniors, and funding our health care system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205642"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canadians understand how this works. They know that it is better to pay down our debts as soon as possible so that we can spend money on better things than interest payments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205643"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is how Canadians want us to proceed and that is how we will proceed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205644"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach is already paying dividends, dividends we are reinvesting into some of the highest priorities of Canadians, such as our universal child care benefit, which provides parents with $1,200 per year to support their child care choice, or investments in core federal responsibilities like public safety, national defence and border security. These are vital for ridings like mine in the Niagara region.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205645"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also the priorities of financial assistance that will help meet the critical infrastructure needs of the communities we call home, the integrity of our universities and our colleges, and assistance for those who need affordable housing in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205646"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have done all this and we will continue to do more for Canadians and their families, because the Canadian family is at the heart of our agenda. As I hope I have illustrated here today, it is also the inspiration for our approach to managing taxpayers' dollars.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205647"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paying down the debt is an investment in a low tax, high potential future for our children. That is what my parents, who are sitting here in the House today, want for their children. That is what I want for my children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205648"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Catharines residents often tell me how important it is that our local economy is able to provide high quality jobs. It is important because we want our kids and the students at Brock University and Niagara College to be able to stay in the area and raise families. We do not want them to leave because they have to find jobs elsewhere. By reducing the debt today, we are helping ensure that a bright future will be there for them tomorrow.</div>

    </p><a name="Para205685"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation to all my colleagues in this House who have already expressed to me their support for this piece of legislation and who, like me, know constituents, friends or family members who have experienced financial hardship as they recovered from debilitating diseases such as cancer, respiratory disease, heart disease, arthritis, or one of the many other ailments that afflict people in our society.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205686"></a><p>

    </p><a name="Para205687"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stated, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169678,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169678&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-278</A> deals with the Employment Insurance Act and specifically paragraph 12(3)(c) pertaining to sickness benefits.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205688"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the EI Act was passed in the late 1990s, sickness benefits were provided in the spirit of compassion and support for someone who had to leave the job market temporarily to battle a disease. This financial support allowed an individual to focus on his or her treatment and to get well so he or she could return to the workforce as soon as possible.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205689"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To qualify under the sickness benefits provision, a claimant must have worked for a period of 600 or more hours of insurable employment during the qualifying period and must not be receiving similar benefits from another level of government or a private company. In order to determine the length of time a person would receive benefits, a claimant must provide a medical certificate from a medical professional attesting to the person's inability to work and stating the duration of the illness, injury or quarantine. Said another way, the number of weeks is set by the doctor who provides officials at the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development with a medical certificate which tells them how long a person should receive benefits.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205690"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the regulations, there is an appeal mechanism for HRSD officials in the event the time recommended seems inappropriate, but that is seldom used. A person's physician after all is almost always the best person to determine how long it will take his or her patient to recover and be able to return to the workforce. The act, however, does have a restriction on how long a doctor can recommend extending EI benefits which is a maximum of 15 weeks. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169678,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169678&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-278</A> addresses this length of time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205691"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My constituency office in Cape Breton, like many of the constituency offices of my colleagues, deals with many different types of federal government programs. In my riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78815,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78815&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Sydney—Victoria</A>, we deal with everything from immigration cases, to economic development funding, and of course employment insurance benefits, to name just a few. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205692"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One recurring issue that my staff have had to deal with is people who have applied for EI sickness benefits and have received the full 15 weeks available under the act but have found themselves incapable of returning to work. Quite simply, some claimants find that 15 weeks is just not long enough to either receive their full treatment or to have ample time to recover from a surgery or procedure. They are unable to go back to work and are in considerable financial difficulty. The resulting stress on them and their family is unwelcome, especially when they are already dealing with pain and the stress of battling a disease. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725">(1725)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para205693"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unfortunate that at the very time when 100% of a person's energy should be focused on getting better, his or her EI sickness benefits suddenly come to an end. The person is forced to deal not only with the stress of trying to get well but of finding money to pay rent, buy groceries, heat the home, you name it. All those bills start adding up. This is simply counterproductive.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205694"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen, over the years, medical study after medical study pointing to the fact that stress has a negative effect on our bodies. Certainly it would have a negative impact on a person's effort to recover from a prolonged or serious ailment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205695"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not profess to be the first to raise this issue. As many members know, the Standing Committee on Human Resources and Skills Development struck a subcommittee in the previous Parliament to look at the Employment Insurance Act and ways that the act could be improved or modified. In fact the subcommittee was chaired by my colleague, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78918,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78918&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Cape Breton—Canso</A>. One of the 28 recommendations coming out of the research conducted and the testimony taken at the subcommittee addressed the issue of sickness benefits and recommended that the number of weeks must be increased.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205696"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar refrain appears to come from the very department that manages the employment insurance program. Each year the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development issues what is called the employment insurance monitoring and assessment report. In the most recent report, the issue of the length of time a person is eligible for sickness benefits has been noted. I am going to quote the 2005 report:</div>
    </p><a name="Para205697"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>About 32% of sickness beneficiaries in 2004/05 used the entire 15 weeks of benefits to which they were entitled. This proportion has been relatively stable in recent years, suggesting that for some types of claimants or illnesses, 15 weeks of benefits may not be sufficient. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para205698"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This HRSD report points to the very issue that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169678,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169678&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-278</A> seeks to address.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205699"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have all witnessed legislation which has gone through the House and which appears to have dealt with an issue effectively, but after the actual program has been put into practice, we have realized that adjustments have been needed to refine it and make it fit into real life circumstances. This is one such case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205700"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be clear here. The bill would increase the total number of weeks someone could receive sickness benefits to up to 50 weeks. This does not mean that all claimants require that amount of time to seek treatment, to recover or to re-enter the workforce. In fact, the same 2005 employment insurance monitoring and assessment report that I referenced points out that the average length of time that people draw benefits is nine and a half weeks. The average length is not 15 weeks; it is nine and a half weeks. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205701"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, a doctor should determine the length of time that a person should receive benefits. In some cases, the doctor may determine that it is in the best interests of the person to return to the workforce sooner, but there are cases when people need more time to recover, when they should not have to return to work early and risk prolonging their illness and possibly having a relapse.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1730"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1730"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1730">(1730)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para205702"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most glaring instance of this is with respect to the treatment of cancer. All of us know someone with cancer, whether it is someone in our ridings or in our families. A 2004 survey of women fighting breast cancer revealed that a full 76% of respondents reported being off work for more than 15 weeks. They need more than 15 weeks to treat breast cancer. In fact, most oncologists will say that it takes up to a year for a person to go through chemotherapy, sometimes surgery, and to recover from these procedures. It is imperative in my mind that we find a way to help people through such a very difficult time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205703"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would put to the House that the spirit and intent back when the Employment Insurance Act sickness benefits provisions were first enacted was to help people through such hard times. Times have changed. There seem to be more people with cancer, but it is more easily cured, so we have to change the act accordingly.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205704"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very happy to report to the House that Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169678,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169678&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-278</A> has been well received by many stakeholders close to the issue, people who know and are involved with this issue. I am in receipt of letters of support from national organizations such as the Canadian Cancer Society and provincial organizations such as the Lung Association of Nova Scotia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205705"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also hearing from front line workers such as social workers at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto. As many of my colleagues are well aware, the Princess Margaret Hospital is one of the leading cancer treatment, research and education facilities in this country. They would know how important this is. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205706"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a letter, the social workers at the hospital endorsed the bill and noted that patients with breast cancer need up to 12 months for treatment, and for leukemia the length of time ranges from 9 to 12 months. They also noted that the intent of the cancer treatment is curative with patient participation providing the foundation for patients to return to work following the completion of their treatments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205707"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also received support from many leading labour organizations, including the Canadian Labour Congress, as well as the Canadian Auto Workers. In a letter, Mr. Buzz Hargrove, the national president of the Canadian Auto Workers, noted that the Supreme Court confirmed that the federal government has a responsibility for EI benefits when workers are temporarily separated from their work due to sickness, parental leave or compassionate care.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205708"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am bolstered by the support of all these organizations. So many people have called me from across the country to say that they see the benefit of this. Some did not have the benefits when they went through their treatments, but they see the benefit for people with illnesses and ailments down the road. They see how it makes us a more productive society. They see how it helps people through life's hard times so that they do not fall through the cracks, do not lose their vehicles and fall by the wayside under tremendous stress. It helps people to get back into society and be productive.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205709"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This points to a need for this legislation. It speaks to the fact that people are dealing with this issue daily. The job of health professionals, associations and organizations is to make people better. Our job is to help people financially while they are getting treatment. These organizations represent workers that are afflicted by prolonged and serious diseases. These people are all behind this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205710"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the House to recognize the importance of extending these EI benefits to 50 weeks. I ask the House to support the bill and to pass it at second reading.</div>

    </p><a name="Para205727"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I share the concern for those who must be absent from work owing to illness, I believe we should carefully review the adequacy of the EI sickness benefits available at present before endorsing the changes proposed in this bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205728"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the EI program provides for a 15 week sickness benefit designed to provide short term income replacement to individuals who are absent from their job due to illness, injury or quarantine. Claimants qualify with a medical certificate and 600 hours of insured work in the past year, as little as 12 hours a week.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205729"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sickness benefits thus provide a quick response to those in need and they are fully integrated with the other EI benefits for job loss, such as maternity or parental benefits and compassionate care benefits.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205730"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada Employment Insurance Commission monitors and assesses the impacts of the employment insurance system on the economy, communities and individuals, reporting its finding in an annual report.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205731"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The commission's latest report noted that the average duration of sickness benefits through 2004-05 remained stable at 9.5 weeks. This is consistent with a recent Statistics Canada study stating that the average work absence owing to illness or a disability has remained constant at 10 weeks for the past 13 years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205732"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When viewed in this context, the 15 week EI sickness benefit is meeting the program's objective of providing short term, temporary income support to workers when they are ill. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205733"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the interest of the House, I note that such a position is similar to that of the former Liberal government, which included the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78815,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78815&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Sydney—Victoria</A>. In its response to a report of the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Social Development and the Status of Persons of Disabilities tabled in May 2005, the former Liberal government clearly stated that EI sickness benefits, as presently constructed, were adequately meeting its intended objective. I will quote verbatim from the Liberal response:</div>
    </p><a name="Para205734"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>...the majority of workers who turn to EI when they are unable to work due to illness or injury, 15 weeks is meeting the objective of providing temporary income support. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para205735"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I previously stated, I would concur with such an assessment. Furthermore, I would question the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78815,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78815&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Sydney—Victoria</A> for a logical explanation as to why such a reasoning is no longer valid.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205736"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, when considering changes to the EI sickness benefits, we should be cognizant of the diverse range of other programs or supports available for those absent from the labour market due to illness. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205737"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, EI sickness benefits are designed as a short term income replacement measure that complement, and I underline the word complement, a range of other supports that are available for longer term illnesses and disability, including benefits offered through employer sponsored group insurance plans, private coverage held by individuals and long term disability benefits available under the Canada pension plan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205738"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before adding 35 weeks to the 15 weeks of EI sickness benefits now available, we need to fully understand the needs of clients and the impacts on other types of support benefits. An extensive examination of other possible implications would also be required.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205739"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an examination would have to take into account a number of issues. One is a thorough study of the effects such an extension would have on the labour market, particularly with respect to employer-employee relationships. For example, under the current EI provision, an employer can expect an employee's return to work after a limited absence for health reasons or, if the person is unable to return, the establishment of other arrangements suited to a long term disability.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205740"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EI sickness benefits are intended to replace lost income for short term absence. If they were greatly extended, how would this affect the employer's obligation? When, for instance, would this working relationship end? This relationship bears careful consideration and consultation before contemplating any steps to extend sickness benefits. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1745"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1745"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1745">(1745)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para205741"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, an option for employers under the EI program is a reduction in their premiums if they provide coverage to their employees for short term illness, injury or quarantine that is at least equivalent to EI benefits. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205742"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, reduced premiums are paid on about 60% of all insurable earnings in Canada, representing reduced premiums of about half a billion dollars for 34,000 employers across the country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205743"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, a change of the magnitude proposed under Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169678,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169678&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-278</A> would considerably affect employers and the premium reduction program would require thorough examination to determine the full impact on businesses.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205744"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another consideration is that the coverage employers provide to their employees is sometimes underwritten by private companies and an extended EI fund and sickness benefit could be in direct competition with the private sector in many instances.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205745"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An analysis of the effects on private insurers would be essential. The administration of EI itself would also be greatly affected by such a change. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205746"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present time, EI sickness benefits are simply and quickly processed based on a medical certificate from the claimant's doctor. If the duration of these benefits were increased substantially, it could require a reassessment of current EI sickness, design and delivery, including expanding medical assessment requirements, such as requiring a third party or a government doctor to issue the medical certificate. The relatively quick response now available might suffer or require the introduction of multi-step approvals on longer claims.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205747"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the consideration of mixed claims. Often, claimants need a variety of EI benefits to combine, for example, maternity and sickness. The bill does not reflect its possible impact on other parts of the EI Act that would also need to be changed, such as dealing with combined special benefit claims. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205748"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the cost factor is certainly another important consideration. Considerable research would be required to determine an accurate cost estimate of increasing the benefit entitlement as extensively as proposed in the bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205749"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we do share the hon. member's compassion for the people who find themselves unable to work due to illness. Indeed, our new government is committed to the monitoring and assessing of all aspects of the EI program to ensure it continues to serve Canadians in an effective and in a timely manner. This includes sickness benefits. We appreciate that some persons are absent from work for more than 15 weeks due to illness. However, at this point it is not clear as to whether EI is the appropriate mechanism for responding to these longer term absences from the labour market.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205750"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, further examination of the implications of extending EI sickness benefits, both within and outside of the parameters of Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169678,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169678&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-278</A>, may be warranted. </div>

Actually part of the title of this employment insurance bill is “benefits for illness, injury or quarantine.”</div>
    </p><a name="Para205752"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I indicated a while ago that we are delighted that a Liberal member of Parliament has tabled this bill. This shows some progress concerning the understanding of the issue and probably the degree of compassion we may feel for people who are victims of illness, a work accident or quarantine for contamination or some other reason.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205753"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc has worked constantly with a view to improving the employment insurance program, as our colleague indicated awhile ago. Since 2005, many measures have been proposed in the House, most of which have been rejected, particularly by the government then in place. We were hoping for progress of course with this new government in order to improve the situation of people who have the misfortune of being away from work because of illness, accident or quarantine.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205754"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the proposed measures appears in the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, namely recommendation 27. It reads as follows:</div>
    </p><a name="Para205755"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Committee recommends that the government study the possibility of extending sickness benefits by 35 weeks for those who suffer from a prolonged and serious illness.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para205756"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, with an extension of 35 weeks beyond the 15, we get the 50 weeks proposed by our colleague in his bill.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205757"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is interesting to note, however, that the Liberals are suddenly becoming concerned about unemployment. I do not particularly wish to attack the member, because he took this initiative, but my earlier question was to this effect: how is it that once a party in government is defeated it suddenly becomes sensitive to such situations? Actually the context, that is, the workers’ situation, was the same barely a year ago, when we submitted this recommendation to the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205758"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bloc Québécois has always been in favour of a substantial improvement to the entire employment insurance program, which of course includes amendments to the number of weeks of sick leave for absences caused by illness, accidents and quarantine.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205759"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following is a history of the last two years. I want to remind the House briefly to provide some context.</div>

Total sickness benefit payments increased by 4.5% to reach $813 million, while average weekly sickness benefits were $285. Hon. members talked about the costs earlier, although they have not changed very much.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205771"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People do not live very comfortably and do not go to restaurants very often on this amount of money. There was a 1.7% increase in comparison with 2003 and 2004. The average number of weeks over which sickness benefits are paid has remained relatively stable over the last few years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205772"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the years I mentioned, claims for sickness benefits have decreased among men. This is interesting to note because it allows us to see who ends up in certain situations and who has to stop working because of an illness or an accident. Those who are most vulnerable—either in terms of the insecurity of their employment or their working conditions—are women and older workers. During that time frame, this decreased by 1.2% in men and increased by 1.1% in women, even though the proportion of women who filed claims for sickness benefits remained relatively stable in 2004-05.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205773"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women continued to file the majority of the claims for this type of benefit, at 59%. Claims for sickness benefits decreased by 2.8% among young people 15 to 24 and by 2.9% among workers 25 to 44, whereas they increased by 3.5% among workers 45 to 54 and by 7.1% among workers over 55. This confirms what I just said: certain categories of workers are more vulnerable than others because they are put in more precarious situations to do their work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205774"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, since I have just two minutes remaining, I want to reiterate that the bill currently before us is important. I am calling on the Conservative Party, which is now in power and whose attitude toward workers has been consistently insensitive, to take the next step. </div>

    </p><a name="Para205781"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also mention the integrity of certain members who made some regrettable comments. There is no way around it, I am obliged to say it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205782"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, recommendations were made concerning employment insurance. Some Liberals were present—when they were in power—and recommended certain motions. I remember one motion. The chair of the committee was the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78918,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78918&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Cape Breton—Canso</A>. Then the time came to present the motion to the House of Commons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205783"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June of last year, I presented a motion regarding the 12 weeks. I recall that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78918,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78918&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Cape Breton—Canso</A>, who had recommended the changes to employment insurance, voted in favour of the change. However, two other Liberals, who had recommended changes to employment insurance, voted against their own recommendation when the motion was presented to the House of Commons. It is disgraceful.

    </p><a name="Para205784"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could have made changes to employment insurance but we did not get them. I have to say it. I will keep saying it as long as I am a member of the House of Commons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205785"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the Parliamentary Secretary for Human Resources and Social Development say that his government does not wish to make changes to employment insurance because he is concerned that it would affect private companies and insurance companies. That is unbelievable. The government is afraid that it could affect working people and the companies, because there would no be enough workers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205786"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all due respect, we are talking about people with cancer who have to undergo chemotherapy. It is not their choice. Their doctor tells them they cannot work for 12 months. As if that were not bad enough, their income is cut off after 15 weeks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205787"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find that position inhumane. These are human beings, workers who pay into a system. That system has a $50 billion surplus. We want the money deducted from our paycheques back. We want that money so we can buy an employment insurance system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205788"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal member from Prince Edward Island should not be laughing. His party voted against the motion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205789"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also think it is important to look closely at what the government said. It said there are other avenues, such as the Canada pension fund. I am sorry, but Canadian workers who fall ill cannot benefit from the Canada pension fund unless they have already been sick for a year. One has to have been sick for nearly two years before becoming eligible for the Canada pension fund.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205790"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are prepared to consider the possibility of using the Canada pension fund, why not use it when the doctor says the worker cannot return to work for 12 months? At that point, the worker should automatically be eligible for Canada pension fund benefits. That might be a solution.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205791"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is not what we are debating right now. We do not have the right to use the Canada pension fund. People do not have the right to employment insurance. The only thing they can get is welfare, and that is certainly not good for their health.</div>

    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para205792"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to what the government members said a few minutes ago. Why do they not look at this issue regarding employment insurance? We are talking about people who are sick and the doctors say they cannot go back to work for one year. We are not talking about individuals who just have a cold. We are not talking about people who break their legs and 16 weeks later they could be on the job. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205793"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not talking about someone who has broken his arm. We are talking about someone who has cancer and whose doctors say he cannot go back to work for 12 months because he must have cancer treatment. And with $50 billion in the employment insurance account, do we not have the humanity to say yes, we will give it to him? This is a program that belongs to the working people and the businesses. Why do we not let them make the decision, not the government?</div>
    </p><a name="Para205794"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Conservatives go with the royal recommendation, I think it is totally unfair. It is inhuman and the government should not be in power. I hope Canadians see that. I hope every worker listening to me tonight will never give a vote to the Conservative Party when the Conservatives cannot have even a little bit of compassion for a person who is sick.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205795"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for coming into the House and saying they do not want to hurt the private business of insurance companies, I will tell members something. The fish plant workers in my riding do not have a private plan. The fish plant workers in Newfoundland and Labrador do not have any private plans. The fish plant workers from P.E.I., even if the member from P.E.I. was laughing, do not have those plans. I say we have the responsibility as legislators here to give that plan back to the working people and to help the people who are sick.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205796"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals had the chance to do it when they were in power and they did not do it. Now they are in opposition--and I have said this before--and it seems that when members are in opposition they believe all things are good, but when they get into government they must get a needle somewhere that makes them change their minds.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205797"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I listened to what the government said tonight. To use computer language, it was a cut-and-paste. It is the same language we have heard before. I have been here for nine years. Tonight's is the same language I have heard for nine years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205798"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at the end of this, we have human beings. We have people who are left with no earnings. It is bad enough that the men or the women have cancer, but at the end of that, we have the children. We have families. We have kids who need to go to school.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205799"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the responsibility to help them, to give them an insurance plan, one that we can afford because we have a $50 billion surplus. Just this year, a $2 billion surplus went to the debt, and it came from the working people. It is a shame.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205800"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honestly, I hope that the Conservative government members have a conscience. I hope they will think about this, change their minds, and give the workers what they deserve. I hope they will give the person who is sick and needs cancer treatment a longer period of EI. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205801"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give it to them, I say. It will be good for society if we do it. It will be good for our working people. It will not affect the company involved because the person has been removed from the job already, by the doctor. That person needs to have those chemo treatments and cannot be on the job, but one thing this EI would do is help the family. It would help the kids. It would help that family to buy groceries, feed the kids and buy the clothes they need. This way, they would not have that worry. It would help people to heal.</div>

    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para205802"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why it is important. I am happy to see changes to the EI program being requested just one at a time. No one will be able to come and tell us that too many changes are being requested or that the bill is too voluminous.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205803"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we say no to this change, we will have to say no to any change. If we cannot have compassion for someone who is sick with cancer, this means that no changes can be made to the EI program and that the government will just go on taking the money of workers and companies to pay off its own debts and achieve zero deficit. That is being done not only on the backs of workers, but on the backs of the sick as well. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205804"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be a terrible and totally inhumane thing to do. The government still has a chance to act. This evening, the Conservatives asked that this bill require a royal recommendation. I think they should come back before the House to ask that their point of order be withdrawn. That would become the most humane thing this Parliament has done. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205805"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us imagine that this bill is adopted. Just think what it would do for our workers who are ill. When SARS hit Toronto, the government turned around and got rid of the two-week waiting period, because it was Toronto. It seems that the rest of Canada does not count. I remember that event and I would never have voted against eliminating the two-week waiting period in Toronto. I understood that it was a good thing and I agreed with it.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2005 report from the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills Development, Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, entitled “Restoring Financial Governance and Accessibility in the Employment Insurance Program”, outlined a series of recommendations as a result of the extensive study. I would add that the all party committee put forward these recommendations and saw only one party issue a dissenting report. Unfortunately for Canadians, it was the Conservative Party. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205809"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommendation 27 of the committee's report called for the government to study the possibility of a 35 week extension to the existing 15 weeks in the program for individuals who suffer a prolonged and serious illness. This, therefore, highlighted the pressing need for this issue to be re-addressed and met with appropriate changes, changes that meet the challenges and realities of individuals battling chronic diseases or injury in Canada.</div>

    </p><a name="Para205812"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The EI program was initially created to provide financial support for eligible Canadian workers who were temporarily unemployed and seeking employment. However, since 1971 the support program has grown to include short term sickness benefits. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205813"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today EI assists eligible Canadians through some of their most difficult times. For many, the 15 week time provided is sufficient, and I am sure they are grateful that Canada is a society that provides such support. Unfortunately, however, this allotment of time does not meet the demands of all Canadians in the recovery process. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205814"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recovery time for illnesses and injuries varies from case to case and individual to individual. According to the 2005 employment insurance report by the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development, approximately 32% of sickness beneficiaries in 2004-05 used the entire 15 weeks they were entitled to, a figure that has remained steady in recent years. This statistic suggests that, of the third of beneficiaries utilizing their maximum time, the 15 weeks of EI benefits is clearly insufficient.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205815"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey conducted in 2004 by the Canadian Breast Cancer Network asked whether 15 weeks of EI benefits was adequate to get women through treatment. The survey found that 75% of the 500 respondents claimed this was insufficient. In addition, the survey also found that 76% of respondents reported being off work for over 15 weeks. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205816"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women enduring breast cancer treatment is merely one example of where this policy, in its present form, is insufficient. If an individual is pushed back into the workforce while he or she should be off work recovering, I can assure everyone that the process of recovery will certainly be prolonged.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205817"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, chemotherapy patients often endure treatments of anywhere from several months up to 10 months in a one time span and subsequently often must face an additional five week period of radiation treatment. To expect someone to work in order to provide for his or her family if not fit to do so is absolutely appalling. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205818"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To add to the imperfections of this section within the EI program, rural and northern residents remain at a tremendous disadvantage. This is felt particularly by the constituents in my riding of <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78912,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78912&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Churchill</A> and indeed in most rural and northern areas in Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205819"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The extension of 35 weeks for eligible Canadians struggling with such injuries and sickness is critical for individuals and families throughout our great country.</div>

    </p><a name="Para205822"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169678,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169678&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-278</A> speaks to a common belief that all members of the House have and, indeed, all Canadians share, a belief that Canadian workers should be treated with fairness and compassion, especially when they are ill and unable to work,and that they receive all the benefits to which they are entitled.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205823"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill in that spirit proposes an extension of the sickness benefits paid under EI from the current 15 weeks to a maximum of a 50 week period, a potential increase of 35 weeks. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205824"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the duration of the EI sickness benefits is an important issue that warrants examination, the reality remains that we need to learn a lot more about the impact and labour market implications of implementing such a proposal. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205825"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a starting point, what do we know about the situation? EI sickness benefits are designed as a short term income replacement measure intended to complement the range of other supports that are available for longer term illnesses and disability, including benefits offered through employer sponsored group insurance plans, private coverage held by individuals and long term disability benefits available under the Canada pension plan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205826"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that about 300,000 individuals claimed sickness benefits under EI last year. Of those 300,000, about one-third or some 100,000 claimed the 15 week maximum benefit period. We also know that the average claim was for 9.5 weeks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205827"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, we have also learned that the 9.5 week average claim period under the existing EI compares closely with the findings of a new Statistics Canada study on workplace absenteeism due to sickness or disability. The results of that study can be found in the April 2006 issue of “Perspectives on Labour and Income”, a publication that is identified as a comprehensive journal on labour and income from Statistics Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205828"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new information shows that since 1993 the average duration of long term workplace absences for personal illness or disability has remained steady at around 10 weeks, very close to the EI experience of an average claim of 9.5 weeks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205829"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Statistics Canada report offers some other interesting insights as well. For example, the study indicates that factors like age, health, unionization, pay and job security can all have an influence on workplace absenteeism due to illness.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205830"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Age is a significant variable. Among employees age 45 or older, 4.6% had taken long term illness leave. This made older workers significantly more likely, 1.5 times more likely, to be on illness leave as compared with those under 35, even after controlling for health and disability factors.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205831"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demographic information like this can be very useful, especially in looking at the supports available for persons who may require more than 15 weeks away from work due to illness or injury.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205832"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What things do we need to know more about? Before endorsing the modifications proposed in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169678,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169678&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-278</A>, we need to have a more comprehensive understanding of the broader implications of extending benefits under EI for both government and the private sector. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205833"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, the idea of extending EI sickness benefits raises a number of considerations related to cost and the potential impact on employees and employers in the labour market. For example, how would this affect coverage from private financial services companies who offer insurance against income loss because of sickness or disability, particularly those providing insurance that complements EI?</div>
    </p><a name="Para205834"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we need to know more about the potential cost of extending the EI benefit period. Under the existing program, the maximum benefit is $413 per week. The average claim last year was $2,700, for a total cost of over $810 million for the program for one year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205835"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extending the benefit period could have a significant impact on that cost. Would it be double the $810 million or triple? We do not know because we do not have sufficient research to tell us what those exact costs might be. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205836"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, it would not be a prudent course of action to give a blanket endorsement to the proposals in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169678,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169678&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-278</A> without having the ability to adequately measure its potential cost.</div>
    </p><a name="Para205837"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, as I have suggested during the course of my remarks, we lack the information and analysis needed to properly evaluate the potential effects of extending EI sickness benefits. Therefore, I believe it would be premature to declare either opposition or support for the proposals contained in Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2169678,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2169678&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-278</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para205838"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that does not preclude support for further examination of such. Moreover, I would like to assure the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78815,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78815&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Sydney—Victoria</A> and all Canadians that Canada's new government is committed to ensuring that the EI program continues to serve Canadians in an effective and timely manner.</div>
