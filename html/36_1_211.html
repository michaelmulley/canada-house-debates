upon the Parliament of Canada to enact legislation to accord the 
merchant navy veterans the specific recognition and benefits that 
have been denied since world war two.

I would like to table a petition from the Inuit community of 
Aupaluk, in Nunavik. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners state that there have been no housing starts by 
either federal or provincial governments in Nunavik in the past 
three years. At the present time, there are 16 to 20 people 
living in three bedroom dwellings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Inuit find the housing conditions at Nunavik extremely 
distressing. They consider the situation totally intolerable, 
because it contributes to the high incidence of tuberculosis, 
infectious diseases and social problems.  At the end of October 
1998, there was a shortage of 425 houses in Nunavik.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of 
Canada, Lib.):</B> moved that Bill C-79, an act to amend the Criminal 
Code (victims of crime) and another Act in consequence, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said: Mr. Speaker, I rise with pleasure to speak to a 
subject that is one of my top priorities—improving the 
treatment of victims in the Canadian criminal justice system. 
On Thursday, I introduced Bill C-79, which will make changes to 
the Criminal Code. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am encouraged by the positive response I have received to 
these amendments.  This response is evidence of the impact the 
voices of victims of crime and concerned Canadians have had on 
policy makers and legislators.  The fact that so many people are 
prepared to support this bill and thereby advance the role of 
victims in the justice system indicates to me that the 
legislation has appropriately addressed those issues which have 
for too long caused victims to feel ignored or overlooked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no need for me to speak about these amendments in 
detail. 
All members have had an opportunity to review the bill.  I also 
anticipate that the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights will conduct an appropriate review of the legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to highlight the key features of the bill, but 
first let me comment briefly on how we arrived at these 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments I have tabled result from a thoughtful 
consideration of the federal government's role and jurisdiction 
in addressing the concerns of victims of crime as set out in the 
Criminal Code.  We have moved beyond the rhetoric of a victims 
bill of rights and have engaged in a dialogue with victims and 
their advocates, with victims service providers and with our 
provincial and territorial colleagues about concrete measures to 
support the concerns of victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have advanced this through the concerted effort of the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights whose review of 
victims issues led to a singular achievement, a unanimous report 
with recommendations entitled “Victims' Rights—A Voice, Not a 
Veto”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee heard from victims, victims advocates, 
service providers, crown attorneys, defence lawyers, restorative 
justice practitioners and countless other interested Canadians in 
its hearings, town hall meetings and ultimately at its national 
forum held last June chaired by our colleague and friend, the 
late Shaughnessy Cohen.  With her commitment to this issue and 
her ability to put participants at ease and encourage them to 
fully express their views, the report of the standing committee 
captured what crime victims really want, what they should be 
entitled to, and what we as a federal government can deliver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee recognized and emphasized two significant 
points.  First, the provinces and territories and the federal 
government share responsibility for the criminal justice system. 
While we enact the criminal law that applies throughout our 
country, the provinces are responsible for enforcing the law and 
prosecuting offenders, and more generally for the administration 
of justice which includes providing services and assistance for 
victims of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point recognized by the committee is that in Canada, 
both at the federal and provincial-territorial level, we have 
already made significant progress in responding to the concerns 
of victims through legislation, policies and programs.  We are 
not starting from the very beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee noted that despite the significant progress of the 
last decade and despite the current laws and programs, there 
continue to be gaps and much more can be done by both levels of 
government to fill those gaps.  I want to congratulate every 
member of the committee for his or her efforts and co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bill C-79 amendments I have tabled fully respond to the 
recommendations of the standing committee and will build upon the 
solid foundation of provisions already in the Criminal Code. 
While these amendments are significant in their own right, what 
is even more significant is the cumulative and comprehensive 
nature of the Criminal Code provisions which will result from the 
proclamation of these amendments.  Upon proclamation, Canada will 
stand out as a leader in addressing the role of the victim in the 
criminal justice system while at the same time fully respecting 
the rights of accused persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I promised, I do not intend to describe in detail every 
provision of Bill C-79, but I would like to highlight a few key 
features. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the preamble to this bill reflects why we as 
parliamentarians and members of the government are bringing these 
amendments forward.  The preamble expresses our concerns about 
the impact of crime on society and on victims.  It emphasizes 
that the criminal justice system depends on the participation of 
victims and witnesses of crime, that this participation should be 
facilitated and encouraged and that victims and witnesses should 
always be treated with courtesy, compassion and respect by the 
justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble also highlights our belief that the views and 
concerns of victims should be considered particularly with 
respect to decisions which have an impact on their safety, 
security and privacy. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble also reflects a key principle of these amendments. 
That is that this government is committed to ensuring that all 
persons have the full protection of the rights guaranteed by our 
charter and that those rights which do often come into conflict 
are to be reconciled and accommodated.  In other words, these 
improvements to the justice system in the name of victims of 
crime will in no way take away from the rights of persons accused 
of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The substantive amendments deal with several key concerns: 
enhancing the victim impact statement provisions; expanding 
protection for victims and witnesses to facilitate their 
participation; ensuring that the concerns of victims and 
witnesses regarding their safety and security are taken into 
account when determining whether an accused person should be 
released on bail; and revising the victim surcharge provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victim impact statement amendments build upon the current 
regime which requires that the judge consider any victim impact 
statement prepared at the time of sentencing of the offender. The 
amendments will make it clear that where the victims want to read 
that statement to the judge at the time of sentencing, they shall 
be permitted to do so. This opportunity to present their 
statement will assure victims that in addition to the requirement 
that the statement be considered, it will actually be heard by 
the judge and persons present in the courtroom at sentencing, 
including the accused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments will also address the frequent and significant 
concern of victims that they did not know about the opportunity 
to make an impact statement.  The code will require that the 
sentencing judge ask whether the victim has been informed of the 
opportunity to prepare and submit a victim impact statement. This 
legislative provision coupled with other initiatives to improve 
the flow of information to crime victims will greatly assist 
victims in their awareness of their role in the justice system, 
that they have a voice and that it can be heard through the 
victim impact statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other amendments will permit victims of mentally disordered 
offenders to describe the impact of the offence by providing for 
victim impact statements at a disposition hearing following a 
verdict of not criminally responsible on account of mental 
disorder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Significant changes have been made to the victim surcharge 
provisions.  The new regime will place the obligation to pay the 
surcharge squarely on the accused.  As hon. members know, the 
revenue raised by the victim surcharge stays in the province or 
territory and goes into a dedicated revenue fund to provide 
programs, services and assistance to victims of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new surcharge regime should result in a significant 
increase in the revenue available to provinces and territories to 
help victims.  Equally important, the victim surcharge holds 
offenders accountable, albeit in a small way, to victims of crime 
as a group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said when I tabled this bill last Thursday, victims need a 
voice that is listened to and respected.  These amendments 
reflect this philosophy in a concrete and practical way.  These 
amendments are an important and significant step in a strategy to 
improve the criminal justice system.  This strategy requires not 
only that we as a federal government do our part, but that we 
encourage others, including provincial and territorial 
governments, to continue their invaluable work in providing 
information and other necessary assistance to victims and that we 
encourage all the players in the criminal justice system to 
willingly recognize the role of victims and witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the federal government we intend to do our part.  Today we 
are focusing on essential Criminal Code amendments.  My colleague 
the solicitor general is eager to address the concerns of victims 
in the context of the review of the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act currently being carried out by a subcommittee of the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the legislative initiatives, I am committed to 
full implementation of all the recommendations of the standing 
committee.  These include the establishment of a policy centre 
within my department to provide the victims lens for all policy 
and legislative initiatives, to provide a centre of expertise on 
victims issues and to ensure that we continue to liaise with our 
provincial and territorial partners and with representatives of 
all components of the criminal justice system, including victim 
advocates and service providers to explore emerging issues and to 
ensure continued progress and improvements.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I count on having the support of all members for Bill C-79.  It 
reflects our collective opinion that victims should be able to 
speak out and our shared commitment to providing this right. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-79. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims of crime are finally going to see a start of some 
significant initiatives toward rights and privileges.  It has 
been a long struggle but the government appears to have finally 
recognized and accepted the necessity of rebalancing the scales 
of justice to more adequately reflect the interests of victims of 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I would like to acknowledge and compliment the hon. member 
for Langley—Abbotsford.  He definitely got the ball rolling in 
this place.  Throughout the 35th parliament he and his Reform 
colleagues pressured the government to introduce a victims bill 
of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was he who moved the Reform supply day motion of April 29, 
1996 which was successful.  This place voted to direct the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs as it was then 
called to draft a victims bill of rights.  The Minister of 
Justice was also to initiate consultations with the provinces to 
arrive at a national standard for a victims bill of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time of the debate, the Minister of Justice, now the 
Minister of Health, acknowledged the severe shortcomings of our 
legislation in regard to victims rights.  He stated: “Although 
steps have been made toward progress in recent years, they have 
been imperfect.  There remains a great deal to be done”.  He 
promised specific victim legislation by the fall of 1996.  He did 
not fulfill that promise.  In fact it was not for two more years 
that the government put victims rights on its agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1998 the justice committee finally got around to 
conducting a review into what changes to the legislation were 
necessary to acknowledge and respect victims of crime. In October 
1998 the justice committee submitted its report “Victims' 
Rights—A Voice, Not a Veto”.  It was a good report.  It 
essentially had all-party support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc submitted a short minority report but it essentially 
encouraged the government to respect the provincial jurisdiction 
within our Constitution in the area of victims issues.  Even the 
Bloc did not have much complaint over the recommended changes to 
the federal legislation.  Those changes merely enhance the role 
of victims in our criminal law process.  The actual financial, 
physical and psychological assistance programs for victims would 
still remain a provincial initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For one of the few times in this place, all participants seemed 
to be onside.  The co-operation among the various political 
parties at the committee table was refreshing and appreciated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-79 is merely the response to the committee report.  It is 
long overdue.  Victims have been waiting for far too long for 
many of these rather simple rights.  There has been little reason 
for the government to delay as long as it has.  Hopefully this 
legislation will be a start to rectifying the historical 
injustices to innocent members of our society who through no 
fault of their own happen to become victims of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years the government has fallen all over itself to safeguard 
the interests of criminals.  Victims in many respects have been 
completely forgotten.  Perhaps this legislation is an indication 
of change.  There must be a more proper balance between the 
rights of the criminal and the rights of the victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, the committee report was an example of how 
parliamentarians could work together to produce a valuable 
product for all Canadians.  The report contained 17 
recommendations.  Bill C-79 really only addresses about seven of 
the recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation No. 6 proposed changes to the Criminal Code to 
require consideration of the complainant's safety concerns prior 
to judicial interim release decisions, more commonly referred to 
as bail. 
There are a number of provisions to protect society as a whole or 
to protect specific portions of our community such as school 
children, et cetera, but there is a deficiency when it comes to 
considering the safety concerns of the specific victims of crime. 
It is the victim who is most likely to be the subject of 
intimidation regarding providing evidence and it is the victim 
who is most likely to be the subject of additional victimization. 
It only makes sense to consider that particular victim's 
concerns.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph 3 of the legislation requires a police officer to 
consider the safety and security of any victim or witness prior 
to releasing the accused from custody.  Paragraph 4 of the 
legislation requires the officer in charge to make similar 
considerations.  Paragraph 8 of the legislation places similar 
controls over the judge.  The safety and security of any person, 
but particularly a victim or witness, must be considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation No. 7 proposed changes to the Criminal Code to 
facilitate exclusion orders and to prohibit cross-examination by 
an accused personally during proceedings involving specific 
offences where the witness is under the age of 18, rather than 
the current age of 14.  The committee found that persons under 
the age of 18 were more easily intimidated by accused persons 
when permitted to cross-examine these young members of our 
society and, in effect, subjecting these victims to be victimized 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph 2 of the legislation appears to fulfill this 
recommendation.  Section 486 has been amended to change the age 
from 14 to 18 years.  The judge may appoint counsel for the 
purpose of conducting the cross-examination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation No. 8 proposed changes to the Criminal Code to 
permit a judge to ban the publication of identifying information 
concerning a victim, a complainant or a witness in certain 
circumstances.  Concern was expressed over respecting the dignity 
and privacy of victims.  Concern was expressed over hesitancy for 
complainants to come forward as witnesses should they not wish to 
have their identities revealed to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subparagraph 2(3) of the legislation appears to fulfill this 
recommendation.  The judge or justice is given power to ban 
publication of information that could identify a victim or a 
witness if necessary for the proper administration of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation No. 9 proposed changes to the Criminal Code to 
permit victims the right to read their impact statements into the 
record either personally or by other means provided the accused 
has received a copy of the statement in advance.  As I have said 
before, the opportunity to present a victim impact statement in 
court helps the victim to feel that they are an important part of 
the justice process, not merely a spectator.  It gives them a 
measure of closure in that they have had the opportunity to 
impress upon the court just how they have been harmed by the 
offence.  It gives them an opportunity to impress upon the 
offender just how they have been damaged by the actions of that 
individual.  It gives them the opportunity to hope that their 
words may cause the offender to reflect upon their misconduct and 
perhaps move them on the road to rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This recommendation was of special significance to me.  As some 
may know, my son was murdered six and a half years ago.  I was 
not permitted to present my impact statement orally.  I have been 
working for this change, among others, ever since. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph 17 of the legislation appears to fulfill this 
recommendation.  The court shall permit the victim to read victim 
impact statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation No. 10 proposed changes to require impact 
statements to be provided to the offender or counsel and to the 
prosecutor as soon as practicable after a determination of guilt. 
Concern had been raised over the fact that victim impact 
statements were to be provided to an accused as soon as it was 
filed.  They were often used as evidence during the trial through 
cross-examination to attack the credibility of the victim, even 
though they were not permitted as evidence until the sentencing 
portion of the hearing, if any.  To provide fairness, this 
recommendation proposed notice to the offender as soon as 
practicable after the finding of guilt.  They cannot and should 
not be used until sentencing so they should not be available to 
the defence until sentencing.  There will be ample opportunity at 
the sentencing for the defence to challenge the statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph 18 appears to fulfill this recommendation.  The clerk 
of the court shall provide a copy of the report to the offender 
or counsel and to the prosecutors.  We, as proponents of victims' 
rights issues, are fair.  We certainly recognize the necessity to 
provide the offender with notice of the contents of an impact 
statement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Evidence must not be presented in surprise although the rules of 
disclosure currently allow the defence to do just that, but that 
is a fight for another day.  In this case. the offender must be 
provided the opportunity to lead contradictory evidence, if any. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation No. 11 proposed changes to oblige the sentencing 
judge to determine whether the victim had been provided an 
opportunity to prepare and submit a victim impact statement and 
to grant an adjournment for that purpose where satisfied it would 
not interfere with the proper administration of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph 18 of the legislation appears to fulfill that 
recommendation.  The court inquires of the prosecutor whether the 
victim has been advised of the opportunity to prepare a 
statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the primary problems with victims' issues is that no one 
can forecast becoming a victim of crime.  As such, victims most 
often have little idea of what rights, privileges or provisions 
are available to them.  It is one thing to provide victims with 
rights.  It is quite another thing to ensure that the victim is 
made aware of those rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation No. 11 was made by the committee to ensure that 
the victim was made aware of the right to present a victim impact 
statement and the opportunity to prepare and submit the 
statement.  Bill C-79 meets this test.  The court has discretion 
whether to adjourn the proceedings to permit the victim to 
prepare a statement if satisfied that the adjournment would not 
interfere with the proper administration of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation No. 13 recommended that the Criminal Code and the 
Young Offenders Act be amended to allow for the automatic 
imposition of a mandatory minimum victim fine surcharge that 
could be waved by the court to avoid undue hardship to the 
offender.  Paragraph 20 appears to fulfill this recommendation in 
respect of Criminal Code cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has refused to initiate similar provisions with 
respect to young persons.  In the recent legislation introduced 
in the youth criminal justice act, the government has essentially 
left victim fine surcharges to the provinces.  If the provinces 
do not provide leadership in this area the court may impose a 
surcharge.  The government has left this type of provision in 
spite of the Minister of Justice's comments that the practice of 
leaving it to the courts has not worked.  Judges have had that 
power for years but they either refuse to use it or forget about 
it when imposing sentences.  It was because of this problem that 
the justice committee recommended a mandatory minimum surcharge 
or a sort of reverse onus clause.  It requires the court to 
automatically assess a fine surcharge but leaves it up to the 
defendant to argue economic hardship.  The justice committee was 
attempting to provide sufficient financial resources to assist 
the provinces to provide sufficient resources to victims of 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be attempting to have this amended in the current 
legislation or in the new youth justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, Bill C-79 addresses a number of 
recommendations of the justice committee report.  The 
recommendations that have been addressed have been relatively 
simple and not too painful.  None of them really require any 
additional funding from the government or in actual fact the 
taxpayer.  None of the accepted recommendations impact on the 
rights of the accused to any great extent.  Yes, the accused may 
be held in custody if there is a decision that the victim or 
witness is at risk of further harm.  Yes, the accused may no 
longer personally cross-examine young victims in cases such as 
sexual assault.  Yes, the victim is being provided with enhanced 
rights to present a victim's impact statement.  Yes, there is a 
better method of obtaining fine surcharges to provide assistance 
to victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these are long overdue and are not a particularly 
burdensome imposition on our accused or our criminals.  They all 
make common sense.  It is indeed a wonder why we have waited so 
long to bring them into being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now move to comment on recommendations that have not been 
addressed by the government.  Victims have waited for years to 
finally obtain substantive recognition and respect for their 
interests.  The justice committee heard from a number of victims 
and victims' groups both in testimony and in a one and a half day 
round table forum last summer.  There was a co-ordinated response 
from the committee of the necessity to act and act now. 
Unfortunately, this same sentiment is not as present with the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recommendation No. 5, the justice committee proposed the 
tabling of an omnibus bill to address needed amendments to the 
Criminal Code and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. 
Bill C-79 only addresses the Criminal Code aspect.  The minister 
has used the excuse that the justice committee is presently 
reviewing the Corrections and Conditional Release Act so the 
government will await that report before deciding whether to 
initiate reforms to that legislation in regard to victims' 
rights.  The minister has also claimed that the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act is the responsibility of the solicitor 
general.  My first thought is the old problem of the chicken and 
the egg.  Which came first? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1040"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a victims' rights report.  It addresses the needed 
changes to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.  This is 
after years and years of waiting.  It is difficult for me to 
accept having to wait some more months, perhaps many months, 
before the government might bring forth the needed victim 
legislation as it pertains to our prisons and our parole system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to understand why the government does not just 
do the job necessary.  Why does it always have to seem to need to 
be forced to introduce legislation that is best for its citizens? 
Why does it play political games to procrastinate and to prolong 
the suffering and disregard of innocent Canadians who just happen 
end up as victims of crime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the minister to claim that the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act comes under the responsibility of the solicitor 
general may be acceptable to the general public but we all know 
that it is the Minister of Justice's department that puts 
together legislation of a legal nature.  Yes, the solicitor 
general has overall responsibility but he and his predecessor 
have had the committee recommendations the same time as the 
Minister of Justice.  Surely the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act response to the committee report could have been 
completed in the same time as the Criminal Code portion.  In fact 
the more substantial portion of the report dealt with changes to 
the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were essentially four recommendations dealing with the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act.  These changes were 
relatively simple.  They were of the same nature as the changes 
to the Criminal Code.  There is no satisfactory explanation as to 
why the solicitor general's area of response is not now before 
the House.  That is a travesty to victims of crime.  It is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of recommendations had to do with developing a victims 
of crime strategy, co-ordinating federal-provincial 
responsibilities, establishing a national office for victims of 
crime and creating an advisory committee on victims of crime. All 
of these aspects do not really require legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice has announced that she will be creating 
the national office within her department.  We have seen little 
evidence of how it is to operate.  We hope it develops into more 
than just a public relations exercise or a haven for patronage 
appointments.  It cannot be allowed to develop into just another 
bureaucratic department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the justice committee, I know that this 
recommendation had more to do with creating a substantial 
initiative to properly assist victims toward obtaining justice 
and closure for their unwanted and unfortunate involvement with 
crime.  This national office and any advisory committee must 
provide concrete solutions and resolutions to victims' issues. 
Canadians are looking for action, not some more bureaucratic 
delay, not more red tape and certainly not more excuses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about the definition of victim.  It has been 
added to the definition section of the Criminal Code and merely 
states, “includes the victim of an alleged offence”.  For the 
purposes of section 722 there is a broader definition of victim. 
This includes a person to whom harm was done or who suffered 
physical or emotional loss as a result of the commission of an 
offence.  Section 722 is restricted to victim impact statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the anticipated justice committee review of this 
legislation, I will be interested in hearing why a broader 
definition, similar to what is included in the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act, has not been used.  Without getting 
carried away and making everyone a victim of any crime, there may 
well be sufficient argument to ensure true victims are not 
excluded merely because of the wording of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude my submission with a couple of stories which I 
hope will drive home to my hon. colleagues the shoddy treatment 
some victims of crime are subjected to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My son Jesse's best friend was at his side when he died.  Can 
anybody here even begin to imagine the trauma?  Jeremy's parents 
attempted to get him some help but were told the waiting list was 
months long.  Five months later, on the eve of my son's birthday, 
Jeremy acted out by committing a very minor offence himself.  As 
an offender he received help within days.  What does that tell 
us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks after our own tragedy, Laurie Woods and her roommate 
were brutally stabbed to death.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make a long story short, Laurie's mother Pat anticipated the 
possibility of requiring counselling.  When Laurie's dad Bob 
inquired about financial compensation for counselling, should it 
be required, some thoughtless bureaucrat promptly told him that 
his wife did not qualify because she did not personally witness 
the killings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Family members of homicide victims witness the event every night 
in their nightmares.  Bob and Pat are friends of mine.  A short 
time later we along with others were successful in getting the 
rules in British Columbia changed.  Granted these are provincial 
issues but I think the point is made.  The issue must be 
approached at all levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not intend on being entirely of gloom and doom.  The 
legislation is a start toward victims rights provisions.  It has 
been far too long in coming.  Even the government's response to 
the justice committee is only half done.  We will still have to 
wait for the changes to the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act.  Hopefully Canadians, and especially victims of crime, will 
not have to wait too much longer for the government to fulfil the 
needs of these individuals.  Today is a start.  There is still a 
long way to go. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased today to take part in the debate on Bill C-79, an act to 
amend the Criminal Code (victims of crime) and another act in 
consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill addresses several legitimate public expectations 
regarding how our criminal justice system should treat the 
victims of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criminal justice is defined in various ways.  Some will say that 
the purpose of the justice system is to punish those who have 
broken the law.  In fact, living in society involves respect for 
certain fundamental values that help maintain social 
equilibrium. 
If we do not respect these values, we expose ourselves to the 
disapproval of our fellow citizens and face a sentence judged 
appropriate by the community.  This sentence must meet various 
considerations, one of them being to protect society.  The 
sentence imposed must make it possible to decrease, if not 
eliminate, the probability of a repeat offence, thus lowering 
the medium and long term social costs of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal justice system therefore has a very significant 
social dimension.  This is shown primarily by the fact that it 
is the state that brings criminals before the courts.  Contrary 
to civil proceedings, it is the attorney general, representing 
the community, who must defend our interests by proving the 
accused's guilt before the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, we see that criminal justice is evaluated 
basically according to our shared needs.  When we pass 
legislation aimed at fighting crime, we do so in light of an 
overall analysis of the situation.  We avoid legislating based 
on specific, individual, cases.  We ensure that the justice 
system is properly integrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good body of legislation is described as being consistent, 
with punishments that match the crimes committed, and as 
effectively addressing the harmful consequences of these crimes 
on society in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crimes have always had names associated with them.  The 
suspect's first and last names appear on the court decision. 
The media pick them up, and associate a face and an identity 
with them.  The suspected perpetrator has not only rights, but 
also has obligations, freedoms but also constraints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have seen, crime has an adversary: the state.  Criminal 
justice does not just involve us and the crime, us and evil. 
There are also, above all, those who have been the victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often we lose sight of the fact that crime, to which we have 
attached a name, also involves another set of names, the first 
and last names of the person who has been killed, hurt or 
otherwise affected, a person with a face and a specific 
identity.  That person might be our friend, our relative, a 
child we know.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That name imposes the unlooked-for status of victim of crime, 
with all the suffering, torment, distress and of course anger 
that entails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal process the victims are required to take part in does 
nothing to lessen all this suffering.  On the contrary, the 
victim is forced to face the perpetrator and to relive in every 
last detail an unbearable event he or she wishes to forget as 
quickly as possible.  The criminal justice system is therefore 
often perceived as more of an irritant than a balm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the House of Commons must assume their 
responsibilities and work to reduce the negative effects of 
criminal proceedings on the victims of criminal acts.  They must 
not only ensure that the victims are not obliged to relive the 
drama, but they must also enable them to speak out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, in the spring of 1998, the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights began to study the role of victims of 
criminal acts in the criminal justice system.  After lengthy 
consultation, the committee, of which I am a member, tabled a 
report, some elements of which are reproduced in the bill before 
us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, we would point out that the amendments proposed 
by the committee and approved by the minister in her Bill C-79 
serve to protect victims and involve them in the criminal 
justice system and to increase the funding available for the 
services offered them.  We will see briefly how each of them is 
expressed in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The so-called protective measures include the fact that the bill 
recognizes the urgency of better protecting victims as they are 
cross-examined by a person accused of sexual assault.  The Bloc 
Quebecois has repeatedly asked in recent years that this 
protection be reinforced, since cross-examination is probably the 
hardest thing for a victim to face, especially when the accused 
is doing the questioning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, sexual offences are regularly committed by people 
known to the victims.  In fact, the statistics and files on 
these cases indicate that a friend, a parent or someone in a 
position of trust, an object of affection, not hatred, is often 
found to be responsible for the sexual aggression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the victim must be very brave to report this sort of 
offence, even more courage is, understandably, required to face 
one's aggressor in court.  The additional protection provided 
under Bill C-79, which prohibits cross-examination by the accused 
of victims under 18 years of age, is therefore a step in the 
right direction.  It will certainly allow the most vulnerable to 
prepare for the effects of this difficult stage of the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This limitation for victims under the age of 18 also ensures 
that the bill meets the test of the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the provisions for greater victim participation 
in the judicial process, there are the amendments regarding 
victim impact statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once Bill C-79 has been passed, victims will be allowed to read a 
statement describing the impact of the crime on their life and 
that of their family.  This amendment would have the merit of 
allowing victims to play a more active role in sentencing 
mechanisms.  In addition, the new wording of the Criminal Code 
would require judges to ensure that victims were duly informed 
of the possibility of preparing such a statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has responsibilities towards the victims of crime. 
However, its role, although extremely important, is linked to 
the criminal procedures defined in the Criminal Code and the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act.  In essence, the role 
of the Parliament of Canada is limited by the distribution of 
powers.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, under this distribution of powers, the provinces have 
primary jurisdiction for coming to the aid of victims of crime. 
Any legislative measure concerning victims, other than measures 
set out in criminal law and proceedings, falls exclusively under 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example, the Government of Quebec has implemented a system 
of co-operation between the CSST, the Department of Justice and 
the Department of Finance in order to provide financial support 
to victims through the application of its crime victims 
compensation act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec Department of Justice funds a number of programs 
including those offered by the Quebec crime victims assistance 
centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These provincial program may be numerous, but they are also 
costly.  Maintaining these essential services cannot be assured 
unless the funding is equal to the demand.  Since 1988, part of 
this funding comes from a victim fine surcharge that is imposed 
by the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This compensation is a penalty over and above any sentence that 
is intended to involve the criminal directly in making 
reparation to the victim.  In fact, it goes toward the funding 
of provincial victim assistance services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be made clear that the victim fine surcharge does not 
come from any of the resources generated by the federal 
government. 
By imposing this surcharge, the court taps into the financial 
capacity of the offender, not that of the federal government. 
Thus, in approving any change to the victim fine surcharge 
system, great care must be taken that the federal government 
does not play any part whatsoever in the funding of provincial 
services for victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the provincial prosecutors involved in the various 
victim assistance programs, the surcharge authorized and 
collected under the Criminal Code is not enough for improvements 
to the victim assistance programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By making this subject to a maximum of 15% of the fines imposed 
on sentencing, or setting it at $35 if there is no fine, the 
Criminal Code did not guarantee basic services of the financial 
health they required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-79, reflecting the recommendations from the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights, makes a substantial 
change to the victim fine surcharge system, first of all by 
making it mandatory for all offenders.  Unless the court is of 
the opinion that its imposition would cause undue hardship, the 
surcharge ought to be paid by all offenders, regardless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the amounts, these would in future be 15% of any fine 
imposed on the offender for the offence, or if no fine is 
imposed, $50 in the case of an offence punishable by summary 
conviction, and $100 in the case of an offence punishable by 
indictment.  As well, the court may order an offender to pay a 
higher amount if it is satisfied that the offender is able to do 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may prove necessary to review the provisions on victim 
surcharge.  The provinces, responsible for managing all direct 
services for victims of criminal offences, count on this 
significant contribution the offenders must provide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victims of criminal offences deserve attention commensurate 
to the tragedy they have undergone.  Policies on criminal 
justice can be fair only insofar as they take the victim's 
interests into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, Bill C-79 is welcome.  The measures it contains will 
gradually rebalance the interests at stake in the criminal 
justice system.  The victims and their families will now be able 
to count on protection and greater involvement in the criminal 
proceedings they are thrust into, much against their will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is from this perspective, that the Bloc Quebecois welcomes 
Bill C-79 from the Minister of Justice.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, I would like to conclude by recalling that the 
role of the federal government with respect to the victims of 
criminal acts must be limited to jurisdictions relating to 
criminal procedings and law.  The minister cannot, under any 
pretext, succumb to the temptation to cross into provincial 
jurisdiction in connection with providing help to victims of 
criminal acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In introducing Bill C-79, on April 15, the minister announced the 
establishment of a victim strategy centre.  In a press release, 
she stated that the new centre would manage, co-ordinate and 
increase federal initiatives to victims. 
Despite the minister's good intentions, we feel that crime 
victims would be better served if the federal government stopped 
duplicating existing provincial services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Bloc Quebecois is not only convinced that respect 
for the distribution of powers serves the interests of crime 
victims, but it fears that the minister's announcement will lead 
to additional administrative costs that could be avoided if the 
tools now available were better used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will therefore ensure that the mandate of the 
Victims' Policy Centre is defined in terms of federal 
jurisdiction, so that the provinces' constitutional authority 
with respect to victim assistance is respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the Minister of Justice that, in response to the 
dissenting report I tabled during consideration of this topic, 
she said that she would do everything she could, that she agreed 
with me that this centre should fully respect provincial 
jurisdictions, and that she would intervene in an area of 
provincial jurisdiction only with the agreement of the 
provinces.  I am confident that, in such a case, the minister 
will act in accordance with her response to my dissenting 
report.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to rise on behalf of the New Democratic Party to 
address Bill C-79, an act respecting victims of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the previous speakers who worked on the committee and the 
minister herself mentioned that this was a good day.  It is a 
recognition of what a committee can do when parties put aside 
partisan differences and work in a constructive way for the 
benefit of Canadians.  It is, and the minister referred to it, a 
tribute to the late Shaughnessy Cohen who chaired this committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am cognizant of the remarks of the member for Surrey North. 
Much of the preliminary work was done for the committee prior to 
my election in June 1997.  It was done in the last parliament. It 
is against that backdrop we should examine the work of the 
committee, the recommendations of the committee and the bill 
brought forward by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came to the House and became the spokesperson for the New 
Democratic Party on justice as a former defence lawyer.  I came 
to the committee dealing with the role of victims with much of 
the preconceived ideas that one would have, as did my colleague 
from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough who came here as a former 
crown prosecutor.  It is fair to say that all parties brought a 
perspective to the committee which helped to shape what became a 
unanimous report by the committee presented to the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a tribute to both the Conservative member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough and the member for Surrey North 
who brought the perspective of the victim to the committee. Also 
a Bloc Quebecois member brought to the committee the perspective 
of provincial rights and the importance of understanding the 
roles of the federal and provincial governments.  Members of the 
Liberal Party brought a sense of listening to the victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We put aside our differences.  We debated some very fundamental 
issues about which I will speak in a moment.  As a result we were 
able to come to a unanimous report which is a tribute to both the 
chair of the committee and to the work that went into it. 
I do not think we can underestimate the importance of the day and 
a half long meeting all members of that committee from all 
parties had with not just victims of crime but with 
representatives of every aspect of the criminal justice system. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1105"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was goodwill.  Whether they were from the National Police 
Association, groups representing victims of crime, the Canadian 
Bar Association or the Defence Lawyers Association, there was a 
real attempt by the participants in that meeting to work 
constructively and represent to members of parliament the kinds 
of changes that had to be made in the criminal justice system to 
accommodate what has for a long time been neglected, that is the 
role of victims in the criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much has been said about the rights of victims and much has been 
said about the rights of criminals.  Working at this level on the 
committees I think all of us struggled with some difficult 
questions. On the surface it seems fairly straightforward.  One 
is a victim of crime.  One ought to be afforded certain rights. 
One is a criminal.  Certainly criminal rights ought not to 
supersede those of the victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when we scratch the surface and begin to explore what 
that means, there are difficult questions.  When does one move 
from being an accused to being a criminal?  When does one move 
from being the accuser to being a recognized victim? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Surrey North has mentioned that there is a 
definition of victim in the act which requires careful scrutiny. 
There is a hazy area where we still have to ensure the balance 
between the presumption of innocence and a recognition that a 
wrong has been done, a balance between the rights of the accused 
before a finding of guilt or innocence and the rights of the 
person who is accusing them, and then competing balances when 
there is a finding by the court of guilt.  Where one becomes a 
criminal the accuser moves into a different area and certainly 
the victim has been affirmed as in fact a victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We struggled with those competing rights and how best the 
legislation could meet the balance of ensuring the protection of 
the rights of the accused on one hand and the role of the victim 
on the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be very careful when we talk about rights to 
understand that rights are not a little package which each 
independent individual person carries around in a briefcase. 
Rights are collective.  They are all our rights.  When the rights 
of an accused are infringed upon my rights are infringed upon, as 
are the rights of every citizen in the country.  When a victim's 
rights are not adhered to, my rights are not adhered to.  Nor are 
the rights of anyone in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as though we have a section on victims rights here 
that goes to war against the accused rights there.  They are the 
collective responsibility and fall into the safeguard of all of 
us as citizens.  That is why the committee struggled so hard. 
That is certainly the perspective that we from the New Democratic 
Party brought to find that important balance where we safeguard 
the rights of all Canadians and ensure that justice is done and 
seen to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation responds to a number of unanimous 
recommendations that came forward from the justice committee and 
which all parties signed on to.  The act does a number of things. 
I think it is worth examining exactly what is in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been commented upon, it provides that all offenders must 
pay a victim surcharge of a fixed minimum amount, except where 
the offender establishes undue hardship, and provides for 
increased amounts to be imposed in appropriate circumstances. Not 
only is that important in bringing responsibility to bear on the 
part of the offender, which it does.  It also provides a revenue 
by which many of the programs can be funded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a criticism, some may recall, that we had of the 
initial act to replace the Young Offenders Act because of the 
costs.  These things cost money.  It is important to know where 
the sources of revenue will be and who will bear those costs.  In 
many cases it will be the provinces in both this legislation and 
in the legislation to which I just referred.  It is important to 
know where the source of revenue will come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provides some moneys to go toward establishing what will be 
necessary to implement the law.  This law will create a greater 
burden on the courts.  There is no question about that. 
It will create a greater burden on the role of crown prosecutors 
or crown attorneys, as they are referred to in some provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to this legislation the crown answered almost exclusively 
to the state which it represented.  There will be increased 
pressure on the crown to respond and to ensure the victim plays 
an essential role in the criminal justice process.  Some of those 
costs to the provinces can be recouped through this victim 
surcharge tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also provisions to ensure victims are informed of 
their opportunity to prepare a victim impact statement at the 
time of sentencing.  One of the most important aspects of the 
legislation to the victim is that it is essential to the victim 
of a crime, especially after the finding of guilt at the time of 
sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that point we are no longer talking about the competing 
rights of the accused and of the person who accuses.  At that 
point there is a determination of guilt.  We know then there is 
an offender who has committed a criminal offence and a person who 
has been done wrong.  It is important they be given an 
opportunity at the time of sentencing to prepare a statement and 
to deliver it either in written form or orally before the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many cases before the courts today involve young victims.  That 
is why there is a section extending protection to victims of 
sexual or violent crime up to the age of 18.  It restricts 
personal cross examination by self-represented accused persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of that was to ensure where a young person of 16 or 
17 years is a victim of a sexual crime and an accused wants to be 
self-represented that the accused did not intimidate the young 
person.  An important caveat to that, which indicates the balance 
between the rights of the accused and the rights of the victim, 
is contained in the legislation.  It is one that we on behalf of 
the New Democratic Party brought to the table at the justice 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The section actually reads that protection is provided to the 
young person and the accused cannot personally cross-examine him 
or her.  It also makes a provision for the court to appoint a 
lawyer for the purposes of cross-examination.  We cannot refuse 
the accused the right to question the person who accuses them. At 
the same time we do not want the accused to be able to intimidate 
the victim, so we have provided for the court to appoint a lawyer 
to perform that function.  That is a very important aspect of the 
balancing act in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that the NDP supports the overall intent of 
the legislation to give victims and witnesses of crime a greater 
role in the criminal justice system and to increase safeguards 
for those victims.  The legislation attempts to strike that 
balance which we will be looking at very carefully in committee 
to ensure it does.  I have already spoken about the need to 
ensure it does not infringe upon the rights of the accused at the 
same time as it provides an opportunity for the victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of the policy centre for victims of crime 
announced earlier this year is important.  That is intended to 
ensure that all federal policies and legislation take into 
account the concerns of victims.  This is a major step forward. 
It is something we recognize and applaud.  It is the type of 
approach that could be applied in other areas of social policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have often thought we ought to have a policy centre for 
poverty where we might ensure that legislation is looked at 
through a lens in terms of what it will do to those who are 
currently poor in this wealthy country.  It is a step and it may 
provide a model we can use in other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our hope that the legislation will redress many of the 
concerns raised by victims and make it easier for victims and 
witnesses to play a meaningful role in the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From my own years in the courts it is clear that the judiciary 
in many cases looked in the past to the crown to represent the 
views of the victim to some extent, especially at sentencing 
hearings.  This will provide victims an opportunity to fulfil 
that role themselves.  It is important legislation in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes some way to meeting the needs expressed by many victims 
at the round table. 
Again I applaud them for coming forward.  I think that much of 
this would not have happened but for their work.  It is a 
testament to the way laws can be drafted in a democratic society 
when a group of people who feel they have a contribution to make, 
and this group certainly did, can come forward through their 
elected representatives and the government can respond to an 
all-party committee and accept the recommendations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been indicated, there are some areas that have not been 
accepted yet.  We will be watching very carefully to see what 
kind of changes take place under the solicitor general's 
department with regard to the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act.  We will be watching that to ensure they match up with the 
recommendations of the all-party committee.  However, it is an 
example of the government responding and I think it is to be 
congratulated for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe also that members of the committee in the other 
parties are to be congratulated for coming forward in the 
positive way they did.  Let us hope we can continue to reform the 
criminal justice system with that kind of spirit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be looking at the legislation carefully.  We in the NDP 
will continue to advocate for a sensible, compassionate response 
to the victims of crime, but one that takes into account the 
essential balancing that is so necessary for justice to be done 
in the criminal justice system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as previous members have mentioned, I am very 
pleased to take part in the debate on Bill C-79, which I feel is 
a very positive piece of legislation brought forward by the 
minister.  I congratulate her on her wisdom in recognizing the 
recommendations that were put forward by the justice committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to take a brief moment to recognize the 
contributions of the previous speakers and previous members of 
the justice committee for their positive contribution to this 
bill, which has now come to the stage where it is before the 
House for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time in our country's history and in the world's history 
the issue of victims rights is certainly something about which 
there is a raised awareness.  We have seen in Kosovo every 
evening news coverage which shows disturbing images of people 
dying, people being injured and families separated, crimes being 
committed under the guise of war.  We continually hear of 
accounts of terrible crimes being perpetrated on individuals at 
the hands of Milosevic's forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It saddens me to think that victims such as this will never have 
an opportunity to reach justice or to seek justice or retribution 
for these attacks.  It also makes me and I think others reflect 
on how lucky we are to have a criminal justice system in this 
country that at least attempts to address those issues of 
victimization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also be remiss if I did not pay some tribute to the late 
Shaughnessy Cohen, the chair of the justice committee at the time 
of the drafting of this report, and also recognize her very 
significant contribution to this cause, which I believe is 
embodied in the legislation that is before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are fortunate to live in a society that is progressive with 
regard to our criminal justice system.  I think this bill 
displays an attitude of non-partisanship concerning a justice 
issue as important as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a crown attorney I found myself considering daily the rights 
of victims and the issues they were wrestling with in seeking 
judicial retribution from criminal parties who preyed upon them. 
We need to recognize that there is also more that we in this 
parliament and we in the justice system can do to address further 
those needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the outset, I believe that this is a positive step 
forward.  With that being said, the Progressive Conservative 
Party will support this legislation and will continue to work 
toward improvements to our Criminal Code which will entrench the 
rights of victims during the prosecution of offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to commend the minister for accepting that these 
recommendations are necessary and timely.  However, supporting 
the protection of victims and supporting legislation that perhaps 
sometimes raises expectations beyond their real means is a very 
dangerous thing to do. 
It is a shame that the Liberal government has once again failed 
to recognize that these amendments to the Criminal Code are going 
to cost a great deal of money to implement.  While Bill C-79 is 
comparable to the youth justice bill in that regard, the 
government has enacted legislation that is essentially going to 
leave the provinces holding the bag in many instances with 
respect to the cost of implementation.  In the House of Commons 
we have unfortunately come to expect this to a degree.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to false hopes and expectations, we have seen that 
type of legislation before in two bills, ironically both labelled 
Bill C-68.  However, for the victims of crime who want their 
ideas to be heard, and for their safety and protection, the 
actual implementation of this bill is very timely and very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest disappointment, as I said, pertains to resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also mentioned by previous speakers and certainly at the 
time of the round table that was held in the summer and during 
the implementation and discussions of this bill that there was 
hope there would be a national office to address the needs of 
victims.  It was hoped that there would be one central point 
where victims could go to receive information, a place where 
victims could receive answers to their very serious questions, 
having gone through a justice system that often seems very 
sterile and cold.  That was the hope of the Progressive 
Conservative Party as well as other members of the opposition who 
were involved in the drafting of the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victims office would be modelled after what is called the 
correctional investigator's office.  For the benefit of those 
present who are not aware, there was a correctional 
investigator's office set up to address the needs of those who 
are serving time in federal institutions, those who are paying 
their debt to society.  The office has a budget of close to $2 
million and is staffed significantly to address those needs.  I 
am not saying that is necessarily a bad thing, but to not have a 
similar office with a similar budget, at the very least, for 
victims of crime, I find completely perverse and offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Correctional services currently has an investigator who deals 
with concerns and complaints of prisoners.  To suggest that 
victims should not have similar treatment is certainly paying 
short shrift to the suffering which victims have endured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since elected to parliament, it has been increasingly clear to 
me that victims in our justice system are in need of such an 
office.  As a critic for my party I have had the opportunity to 
speak to victims of crime.  Previous to that I spoke with victims 
and dealt with victims quite regularly.  These individuals are 
not looking necessarily to change the outcome of a trial or to 
have the judge or the prosecutor act upon their every demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that this piece of legislation and the report that led 
to the enactment of these changes is quite aptly named “Victims' 
Rights—A Voice, Not a Veto”.  I think that encompasses the 
spirit of what victims are looking for in our justice system. 
They are looking for the recognition that they should be heard 
and that their input should, at the very least, have some impact 
on the court decisions that have to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims are also spouses, children, parents, siblings; many of 
whom have lost loved ones as a result of criminal activity.  All 
of those individuals often are extremely affected by this.  The 
previous narrow definition of victims is also something that had 
to be changed.  We certainly welcome the fact that we see that 
encompassed in the bill today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party also understands the need which Canadians and victims 
of crime have to get support from their elected officials.  I 
think that a very important signal is being sent today in the 
non-partisan and, for the most part, very positive comments that 
we have heard emanating from all members who have spoken to this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly feel that the office which I mentioned has been an 
oversight.  It has to some degree been overlooked by the 
minister.  There is still hope that burns eternal that in future 
months and future opportunities that will arise in this place 
that will change.  I know that hope exists also amongst the 
stakeholders in the community who have worked so tirelessly to 
bring legislation forward to this point and who have worked with 
the minister and her departmental officials to encourage them to 
open or to move toward an office such as this.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for not doing so appears to be jurisdictional.  We 
have heard a number of comments made by my colleague in the Bloc 
about the fear that exists—and perhaps it is a legitimate fear 
on some occasions—about jurisdictional matters treading into the 
matters of the provinces.  However, not only are victims rights a 
non-partisan matter, but when it comes to positive change I would 
suggest that this is not an issue that would offend anybody with 
respect to treading into jurisdictional matters.  This is a 
purely good news initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have an office that would work in conjunction with 
existing offices in the provinces.  I know that Ontario and, to a 
large degree, Quebec have been leaders in this particular area. 
I am sure that a schedule or scheme could be worked out where 
victims could be given information and there could be a better 
co-ordinated effort to provide this type of information through 
one central office that should, in terms of its national scope, 
be coming from the federal government and not the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister herself was quick to admit that it is the provinces 
which administer justice at the street level and she quite 
correctly points out that fact.  However, the federal government 
is ultimately the drafter of much of the legislation and is 
ultimately the one to pay the piper.  It should take the 
leadership role in setting up a national victims office and 
naming the person who would act as an ombudsman and an ongoing 
source for the information which victims need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only in the first instance when victims become 
victimized—and we all know that begins the moment it happens— 
it is also the follow up and ongoing contact that the victims 
seem to be most offended by in our criminal justice system.  That 
is where that type of office would be extremely important, in 
addressing those very real needs of victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other positive amendments that I will speak to 
briefly.  I welcome and to a large degree commend the minister 
for recognizing the need.  One of those positive issues includes 
the sections that pertain to the publication ban of a victim's 
name or a witness's name.  That protection of identity will make 
it easier for victims to take part in court proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also amendments that will permit a victim impact 
statement to be heard at a parole eligibility hearing to 
ascertain whether a person should be released at the time of 
serving a certain portion of their debt to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initiatives that will permit the oral presentation of a 
victim impact statement are extremely important.  The knowledge 
element of informing a victim that a person convicted of a life 
sentence will in fact be eligible for parole at some point is 
once more a bitter-sweet bit of knowledge.  I am hopeful that at 
some point in the future we will see the removal of section 745 
from the Criminal Code so that this terrible piece of information 
will not have to be made known to a victim that parole 
eligibility exists for a first degree murder conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Improvements have also been made concerning the conditions upon 
the release of an accused with respect to the participation of 
the accused in programming and the participation of the accused 
in their own rehabilitative efforts.  Amendments were also made 
to improve the criteria of a victim impact statement.  One of 
those mentioned includes the protection of both victims and 
witnesses in their participation in the system.  The impact is 
often the only way victims can express their concerns and 
feelings resulting from incidents of criminal behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to leave anyone in the Chamber with the impression 
that this is entirely a good piece of legislation.  I believe 
there were some missed opportunities which existed for the 
minister to perhaps go further with respect to matters such as 
the enactment of a victims' office and an ombudsman. 
Certainly there is a further need, and it is not a legislative 
need, but a need for the recognition that there is going to be a 
cost associated with this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very encouraged to hear the comments from the previous 
speaker, the hon. member for Sydney—Victoria.  He pointed out 
quite aptly that there is going to be a greater emphasis on crown 
prosecutors, and I would go further and say on judges as well, 
that emanates from this bill.  It has been my experience that 
most crown attorneys have been doing much of what is now enacted 
in this legislation when it comes to information sharing.  This 
bill will certainly be the impetus for crown attorneys to do so 
in a more systemic way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately victims have had no one to turn to for assistance 
at the federal level when those individuals were faced with lack 
of information. Oftentimes that fell to the discretion of crown 
prosecutors when it came to the drafting of things such as victim 
impact statements.  So clarification does come from this bill, 
which is certainly a welcome and necessary change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my home province of Nova Scotia there is a victim services 
division within the Department of Justice.  There are very 
dedicated individuals like Judy Whitman and Coreen Popowich who 
work in the New Glasgow office who daily make great contributions 
to the cause and needs of victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec le Bureau d'aide aux victimes d'actes criminels, 
BAVAC, provides information and assistance to victims of crime. 
We have seen Progressive Conservative governments in provinces 
like Alberta, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island and Ontario which 
have also increased the level of services available to victims at 
this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again we see that the provinces have had to act upon a problem 
and have used their political expediency because of the fact that 
the federal government has not been moving quickly in this 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from previous speakers the fact that much of the 
initiative for this legislation was announced publicly. Huge 
press conferences were held and ministers toured the country. It 
has been very slow to see the change that was initiated and which 
has come forward today.  That is not something the federal 
government can be proud of. The federal government is getting on 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initiatives were taken in the previous parliament by members of 
the Reform Party as has been mentioned.  Once more the victims 
themselves and their advocates and members of that community who 
have lobbied so strongly for these needed changes are truly the 
ones who should feel a sense of redemption and should be reaping 
the credit and the reward that is due today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under normal circumstances one would think that this would be a 
day for celebration.  Certainly a great deal more can be done to 
ensure that victims are going to be participating in a system 
that affects them greatly, that has affected them and will 
continue to do so for a long period of time, if not until the end 
of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that legislation such as this is slow to come about 
must leave victims with somewhat of a sour taste in their mouth. 
In my opinion, our justice system has been moving in the wrong 
direction for a long time.  There is almost a feeling of 
begrudged giving in on the part of the government when it comes 
to acknowledging the role of victims in our system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this bill was treated like that of the Young Offenders Act in 
that the provinces themselves were so active in lobbying for 
change, then I would have hoped that this bill would have come 
about in a much more timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly a federal agency would go a long way to assisting 
individuals like Carolyn Solomon of Garson, Ontario.  I want to 
cite this example because it is one which I think epitomizes some 
of the problems not only in the correctional system but 
throughout the entire process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 Mrs. Solomon lost her son Kevin who was murdered by 
Michael Hector. Hector was a federal parolee who was not properly 
supervised. Moreover, Hector's parole supervisor was not provided 
with sufficient information about this individual to make 
informed decisions about his release. This was no doubt due to 
lack of funding, lack of resources and also I suggest in some 
small part, due to the fact that Correctional Service Canada was 
already initiating the early phases of its 50/50 prison release 
quota. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Michael Hector breached conditions of his parole and should not 
have been out on the street in the first place.  Consequently he 
was free to kill.  Three young individuals lost their lives as a 
result, including Carolyn Solomon's son Kevin.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mrs. Solomon wanted to know, and rightly, why Michael Hector was 
permitted to breach these conditions of parole and not held 
accountable at that time.  She wanted to know why Correctional 
Service Canada did not provide Michael Hector's full criminal 
record and psychological record to his parole supervisor.  She 
also wanted to know why the parole supervisor took everything 
that Michael Hector told him at face value, a sense of 
self-reporting, and why there was no in-depth investigation of 
the information statements that were provided by the parolee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To their credit, Correctional Service Canada and the National 
Parole Board have a mechanism in place to promptly undertake a 
review when cases like this are botched. Mrs. Solomon was a 
victim, as was her son, of Michael Hector's crime which resulted 
from mistakes by Correctional Service Canada and the National 
Parole Board and they are charged with investigating themselves 
in the wake of this tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise this point because of the fact that there was an 
opportunity to also incorporate some of these entrenched rights 
of victims within the changes we are currently looking at in the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act review.  As was 
previously mentioned, there was an opportunity to encompass these 
recommendations from the entire justice panel and they were 
simply ignored.  Once again, if we could put aside the 
partisanship and move toward positive change in our justice 
system, surely it would be much the better for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently there are other sad examples of this which I do 
not have the time to cite at this moment.  Anyone who has been 
involved and who has been a victim of crime will know that this 
is a focus which we in this place must have if we are to improve 
our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill itself I admit is a positive step.  We have arrived at 
this point through a great deal of effort by all and I commend 
those individuals.  I look forward to continuing to work with 
those same individuals in this place and at the justice committee 
to make improvements. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciated 
the member's comments and his involvement in the development of 
this bill.  I have a specific question to help me think through a 
solution to a problem which arose this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many years ago a young woman in my constituency was abused 
repeatedly over a period of time.  The abuser was arrested, 
charged, convicted and served time.  Subsequently he finished 
serving his time and was released back into the community in 
another province.  Many years later he applied for a pardon and 
was pardoned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifteen years later he has re-emerged in the community and has 
contacted the victim.  In attempting to get a restraining order 
or a peace bond to keep him away, she has found it extremely 
difficult because of the pardoning process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has that situation arisen before?  Was there some discussion of 
that in the preparation of this bill?  Will the passage of this 
legislation give her some avenues to protect herself? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly understand the frustration and difficulty that his 
constituent would feel and that perhaps the hon. member himself 
must feel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also another piece of legislation coming forward in 
this place very soon, Bill C-79.  I think the issue of pardons, 
which makes this a rather unique situation where information such 
as that cannot be shared and cannot be considered by a court in 
the granting of a peace bond, which this particular victim is 
seeking, will be addressed better in that legislation than in the 
bill currently before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A peace bond is certainly a discretionary instrument that a 
judge has at his or her disposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue itself of this person's security and her feeling of 
frustration in not having the information available to her and 
more importantly the court not having that information available 
to it in deciding whether or not she has a legitimate case, and 
obviously she does, to have a peace bond granted, I believe, will 
be addressed better by Bill C-79.

for clarification, was that Bill C-79 or Bill C-69 the member was 
referring to? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it was Bill C-69.  Bill 
C-79 is the bill before the House.  I may have misspoken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to single anybody out but I will take the 
opportunity to say that efforts have been made by members of the 
committee to suggest that, in the context of the new legislation, 
Bill C-69, certain offences be absolutely excluded from the 
granting of the pardon, or at least the protection that a pardon 
provides to prevent the public at large from obtaining knowledge 
of a previous conviction against the person whether it be a 
sexual assault or a violent offence.  I believe that type of 
information is pertinent and the public have a right to know to 
be protected in their communities. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in the House in support of 
Bill C-79, an act which amends the Criminal Code to enhance the 
protection and participation of victims and witnesses in the 
criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Justice stated last week when she tabled the 
bill, these amendments will strengthen the voice of victims of 
crime in the criminal justice system and increase resources for 
provincial and territorial governments to provide services 
directly to the victims of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that these amendments to the 
Criminal Code respond to the unanimous recommendations of the 
all-party report of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights.  I take this opportunity to commend the members of the 
standing committee for their work and their recommendations. The 
report is entitled “Victims' Rights—A Voice, Not a Veto”. 
The title of the standing committee report is important as it 
embodies the spirit and intent of these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victim of a crime has the right to be informed and to be 
heard.  These amendments provide the victim with a stronger 
voice, but there is nothing in the legislation that limits the 
rights of the accused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victim advocacy groups have been encouraging the government to 
ensure that the views and concerns of victims are considered 
especially on decisions that will impact on their safety, 
security and privacy.  The government's commitment to respond to 
the concerns of victims of crimes is embodied in this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble to Bill C-79 is unequivocally clear on this 
commitment.  The preamble is very comprehensive.  It addresses 
why this legislation is necessary, how the government is 
improving the criminal justice system and encourages greater 
participation of victims and witnesses in the criminal justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw attention to two specific paragraphs of the preamble 
which embody the government's commitment to the victims of crimes 
and their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph 4 of the preamble states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Parliament of Canada supports the principle that 
victims of and witnesses to offences should be treated with 
courtesy, compassion and respect by the criminal justice system, 
and should suffer the least amount of inconvenience necessary as 
a result of their involvement in the criminal justice system. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph 5 of the preamble goes on to state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Parliament of Canada, while recognizing that the 
Crown is responsible for the prosecution of offences, is of the 
opinion that the views and concerns of the victims should be 
considered in accordance with prevailing criminal law and 
procedure, particularly with respect to the decisions that may 
have an impact on their safety, security or privacy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go on, Mr. Speaker, I forgot to state that I will be 
sharing my time with the member for Scarborough East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear from the preamble that the amendments proposed to 
the Criminal Code need to reconcile the rights of victims and 
witnesses with the rights of the accused but at the same time 
ensure that victims and witnesses are treated with courtesy, 
compassion and respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there are a number of amendments included in Bill C-79 to 
enhance the protection and participation of victims and witnesses 
in the criminal justice system, I would specifically like to 
highlight two provisions.  First, I will talk about the victim 
surcharge on offenders. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1145"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT22"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT22"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1145
<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments include changes to the victim surcharge imposed 
on offenders.  A victim surcharge is an additional penalty 
imposed on offenders at the time of sentencing.  It is collected 
by the provincial and territorial governments and used to provide 
programs, services and assistance to the victims of crimes within 
their jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments in Bill C-79 would: would make the 
victim surcharge automatic to ensure that it is applied 
consistently to all offenders; and change the amendments to the 
surcharge to provide mandatory minimum amounts. Under Bill C-79, 
the surcharge amounts will be:  15% of any fine imposed on the 
offender; if no fine is imposed, $50 in the case of an offence 
punishable by summary conviction and $100 in the case of an 
offence punishable by indictment; or, an increased surcharge at 
the discretion of the judge in the appropriate circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The victim surcharge revenue will continue to remain in the 
jurisdiction within which it is collected.  These amendments 
would significantly increase the revenue available for victim 
programs and services in all provinces and territories.  It would 
be administered by the provinces and territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constituents in my riding, led by a wonderful organization 
known as Parkdale Community Watch, have always urged me to 
support the passing of legislation that requires moneys to be 
reinvested into those communities and individuals affected by 
crime.  This legislation is certainly an important step toward 
addressing their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment I will address is the victim impact 
statements.  I highlight this because it is very important. 
Victim impact statements have an incredible role to play.  A 
victim impact statement is a written statement prepared by the 
victim and considered by the court at the time of the sentencing 
of an offender.  It allows victims to participate in the 
proceedings by describing the impact of the crime on them and on 
their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proposed amendments under the legislation would ensure that the 
victim is permitted to read an impact statement at the time of 
sentencing if he or she wishes to do so.  Under the present 
legislation, a judge is required to consider the written 
statement but allowing the victim to read it remains 
discretionary.  Under the amendments, the judge will be required 
to ask before imposing the sentence whether the victim has been 
informed of the opportunity to prepare such a victim impact 
statement.  The proposed amendments would authorize adjournment 
to permit a victim to prepare a statement or submit other 
evidence to the court about the impact of the crime on himself or 
herself and his or her family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments would further require that victim impact 
statements be considered by courts and review boards following a 
verdict of not criminally responsible on account of mental 
disorder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, the amendments clarify that at proceedings to determine 
whether an offender sentenced to life in prison should have his 
or her parole eligibility reduced, the information provided by 
the victim may be oral or written.  At present, the Criminal Code 
provides that any information provided by the victim will be 
considered.  However, in practice some victims have actually been 
discouraged from making an oral statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-79 is just one of the proposals which is part of an 
overall government strategy to respond to the victims of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last month the Minister of Justice tabled the youth criminal 
justice act which also recognized in its principles the important 
role of victims in the youth justice system and their need for 
information.  In addition, the youth criminal justice act 
acknowledged the important role played by communities toward 
combating crime in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of a policy centre for victims of crime announced 
in December by the Minister of Justice is a key element of the 
strategy to respond to the needs of victims of crime.  The policy 
centre will ensure that all federal policies and legislation take 
into consideration the views of these victims of crime.  The new 
victims policy centre will manage, co-ordinate and enhance all 
federal initiatives relating to victims and become a centre of 
expertise on emerging national and international trends in victim 
advocacy, legislation and services.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week when the minister tabled Bill C-79, she stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures are important steps forward to reform the way the 
criminal justice system treats victims.  But our work is not 
over.  Through our new victims policy centre, we will ensure that 
the victim's perspective will always be considered in the 
development of any future legislation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I certainly applaud the minister on the amendments to the 
Criminal Code embodied in Bill C-79, I must also comment on her 
statement that our work is not over and use this as an 
opportunity to present my constituents' concerns again, as voiced 
by Parkdale Community Watch, as to what we should examine in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents feel that in future we must continue to involve 
our communities to a greater degree, along with individual 
victims of crime.  While Bill C-79 is the first step to ensuring 
that an individual victim is permitted to read an impact 
statement at the time of sentencing, I also believe that we 
should examine the possibility of giving communities the 
opportunity to read a community impact statement at the time of 
sentencing.  The value of community impact statements must be 
acknowledged, particularly in cases of alleged victimless crimes 
such as drugs and prostitution where the impact on the community 
is significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to confirm my support for Bill C-79. It is truly an 
important step in reforming the way the criminal justice system 
treats its victims, but most important, it shows that the 
government has not only listened to the victims and their 
advocacy groups but it has also proceeded to address their 
concerns. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
had the privilege of sitting on the justice committee which 
produced the report “Victims' Rights—A Voice, Not a Veto”, 
which is behind the legislation that we are currently dealing 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have only been in the House for two years, but I have never 
heard such compelling testimony as the testimony I heard from 
those who came before the committee.  While sitting there, many 
of us would take off our glasses, stop reading the reports and 
literally put down our pens.  For those of us who had been 
involved in the legal system in this country, we would hang our 
heads in shame listening to the horrific crimes that these people 
had been subjected to and the awful way in which our criminal 
justice system had treated many of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you and I share a profession outside of the House 
which has, how shall I say, a problematic reputation at best, 
probably second only to that of politicians.  Frankly, this was 
and is a shot across the bow of the justice system, a justice 
system that this country is supposed to serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a warning to judges, crowns, defence attorneys and the 
police that parliament and the public are watching.  Parliament 
and the public will hold the custodians of our justice system 
accountable for how they implement legislation and how they treat 
many of the most vulnerable victims in society.  Victims cannot 
be taken for granted.  Victims want a voice, not a veto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some respects the title of our report captures the essence of 
what we had heard.  Victims want to be able to say, “This is 
what happened to me.  This is how the criminal act impacted on me 
and my family”.  They want to be heard and to be taken 
seriously.  They want the justice system to sit up and take 
notice when they speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1998 the justice committee produced the report 
“Victims' Rights—A Voice, Not a Veto”.  The chair of that 
committee at the time, the late Shaughnessy Cohen, worked 
tirelessly in producing the report.  I would also note the 
contributions of the member for Surrey North and the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough who were both were very active in 
the production of the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I, along with many other committee members, held town hall 
meetings to ask members of our constituencies what they thought. 
We held the meeting in June 1998 and produced our own report. We 
had contributions from Barbara Hall, the former mayor of Toronto 
and now the national chair of the crime prevention initiative; 
Tim Danson, a noted civil rights lawyer; Priscilla de Villiers, 
the chair of CAVEAT; Carol Sparling from the National Parole 
Board; and, Terry Spencer from the Toronto Police Victim 
Services. 
We had an excellent meeting.  My constituents were fully engaged 
in the discussion.  These people were truly very articulate and 
those who came away from the meeting were very impressed by the 
extent of their knowledge and ability to articulate the problem.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That report, along with other members' reports, became part of 
the report that made 17 recommendations to the government in 
October 1998 to which the government, to its great credit, 
responded in a very detailed fashion in December 1998 and 
dedicated its response to the late chair.  In its response it 
quoted extensively from the report and promised to make every 
effort to fulfill the spirit of the recommendations in a timely 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tabling of the bill in April 1999 is a substantive response 
to the committee's recommendations.  It is both timely and 
substantive and, I would argue, a good response in less than six 
months of the committee's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not go into a lot of detail right now, but I do want to 
pick up on a couple of points that may be of interest to members. 
The creation of a policy centre for the victims of crime is a 
good idea.  All legislation should be looked at through the lens 
of the victim.  The only fear I have is that it will raise false 
expectations among the victims' communities that have become 
something of an ombudsman's office.  I think we need to be very 
clear about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second area is with respect to victim impact statements. In 
the proposed amendments, it would ensure that the victim is 
permitted to read an impact statement at the time of sentencing 
if he or she wishes to do so.  At present, the judge is required 
to consider the written statement, but allowing the victim to 
read it is discretionary.  It removes the judge's discretion in 
this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also requires the judge to ask before imposing sentence 
whether the victim has been informed of the opportunity to 
prepare a statement.  It further authorizes adjournments to 
permit a victim to prepare a statement or to submit other 
evidence about the impact of the crime.  After reading that, I 
wondered why someone had not thought of it before. In some 
respects that encapsulates why the public is in part so upset 
with the system of justice that we have in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It requires that victim impact statements be considered by 
courts and review boards following a verdict of not criminally 
responsible on account of mental disorder.  It also clarifies 
that at proceedings to determine whether an offender who is 
sentenced to life in prison should have his or her parole 
eligibility reduced, the information provided by the victim may 
be oral or written.  At present the Criminal Code provides that 
any information provided by the victim will be considered. 
However, in practice some victims have been discouraged from 
making statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good piece of legislation and I compliment the 
government.  This time I think it got it right.  The bill 
deserves the support of all members.  I hope it will receive the 
support of all members and arrive in committee in a timely 
fashion so that the committee can determine whether it is in fact 
an adequate response to the testimony that the committee has 
already heard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the hon. member for his very 
insightful and in-depth remarks.  It certainly signifies his 
awareness and his contribution as well to the process and to the 
justice committee in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the latter part of his remarks, he raised a very important 
issue with respect to a false impression or perhaps an unfair 
expectation on the part of victims upon hearing that there will 
be this policy office, which I think he characterizes correctly 
as being a lens on a lot of other federal legislation in terms of 
efforts to improve victims' participation in our justice system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to follow up on the issue of an office of an 
ombudsman filling the need of many victims for information 
sharing.  I am sure the member conducted town hall meetings.  I 
know I conducted one in Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
Repeatedly the number one complaint of victims was that they did 
not receive the information quickly.  Sometimes they even 
received contradictory information from various sources in the 
justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One person in particular who has a very strong feeling in this 
regard is Lynne Charron who lost her father Ferdinand to a 
terrible murder.  She was very much in favour of an office where 
information could be obtained, a 1-800 number, and a system that 
would provide timely and important information to victims on 
matters pertaining to their cases which might be pending before 
the criminal justice system.  Equally important, in the aftermath 
when a person is incarcerated and parole is pending or 
rehabilitative programs are being attempted, victims have an 
ongoing unwilling attachment to a person who has intruded upon 
their lives.  Members such as the member for Surrey North can 
certainly attest to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member opposite feel that this is an important 
step his government could take?  The next step would be a 
national victims office with an ombudsman, similar to the 
correctional investigators office, to provide these needs to 
victims in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am not quite sure I know 
how to respond to the good question of the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initial response of the government is to create an office 
which creates a lens on legislation.  To move it to the stage of 
an ombudsman, a quasi-ombudsman or 1-800 number, we on this side 
of the House are tempted to hide behind the old 
federal-provincial saw, that all we do here is create laws and 
the provinces administer them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until and unless the provinces were on side in this manner I 
could express a wish as a private member that we would move in 
that direction.  I agree with the member's analysis of the 
testimony that time after time we heard people just want 
information.  They wanted to know about their situation in the 
system, whether it was at first hearing, at second hearing, at 
sentencing or at parole.  That is all people want to know.  That 
is perfectly legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless the provinces could be signed up to a 1-800 system, a 
website system or whatever, I could express all the wishes I 
would like from this side of the table as a government member, 
but I do not know how I would implement them.  When it goes back 
before the committee possibly we could go over it.  Maybe we 
should call in some provincial AGs and ask why we cannot set up 
this system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of wish, I would agree with the hon. member.  In terms 
of the ability to fulfil it, we are only talking about one-half 
of the problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak to Bill C-79. I will 
take some time to give the House and those watching an idea of 
the history of victims rights in the House of Commons, where they 
came from and why they got here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To some extent the government is misleading people in Canada.  I 
hear time and time again the government's initiative on victims 
rights, that it has done such a wonderful thing.  It is a bit of 
a sad tale to tell because it is really not true.  It was never 
initiated by the Liberal government.  In fact it was done in 
spite of the Liberal government, quite frankly, and I will show 
that today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to dwell too long on that.  We can thank the 
victims and those who were involved with them for all their hard 
work to get it to this point.  Much more needs to be done yet, 
and we have to talk about that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 when I first became a member of parliament I talked with 
many victims of crime. 
I remember being in the living room of Chris and Sue Simmonds, 
talking to two people who were very heart broken at their 
daughter's murder and wondering how they were ever going to get 
through such a legal industry and such a morass of difficulties 
on top of one thing after another. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was more after the death of their daughter that they were so 
coldly treated by the system. I began to wonder even then in 
1993, early in my stages of involvement in it, just why that was, 
why victims were so poorly treated in our society when it seemed 
the criminal had so many rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I began a fairly long and arduous exercise to find out more 
about the system.  I attended many court trials.  I spoke with 
victims across the country.  I spent a great deal of time looking 
at prisoners rights and trying to compare prisoners rights to 
victims rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 I initially wrote the national victims bill of rights 
and presented it as a private member's bill.  We looked at it and 
asked what we really wanted and how to get from there.  All along 
victims rights groups were growing and growing and speaking out 
and speaking out.  Yet nothing seemed to get done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We brought the issue to the House of Commons many times during 
1995 and 1996.  It was difficult to have a debate on it because 
the Liberal government actually did not have an understanding of 
what we were looking for as politicians and what victims were 
really looking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to show what I mean by that.  I recall asking the justice 
minister of the day many questions about victims rights.  The 
answers he gave us were perplexing.  In fact one of the comments 
of the justice minister was that the Reform Party was exploiting 
the very tragedies it pretended to decry.  It hurt a great deal 
when he said that to me, in particular, because that was not what 
it was about.  There was no exploitation at all.  We were merely 
carrying a message forward.  We see today that there is victims 
rights legislation, so those kinds of rhetorical, hard crusted 
comments by the government were needless and were quite unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister made another comment on March 11, 1997.  He said 
that the importance he placed on their experience, the importance 
he placed on respecting victims, was reflected in the many pieces 
of legislation they had brought forward in the House to protect 
and safeguard the position of victims in the criminal justice 
system.   They were talking about gun bills, the Young Offenders 
Act and all kinds of other bills, but they were not addressing 
the issue.  The issue is victims rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After we developed a national victims bill of rights, I can 
recall that in my town of Abbotsford, B.C., we had a rally in 
1995. One of the speakers at that rally was my colleague from 
Surrey North.   He was not elected then.  There were about 2,200 
people there.  The message became clearer and clearer to Ottawa 
that there was a growing problem, a growing need for more rights 
for victims, always comparing it to the rights of criminals. That 
was the largest rally of its time.  It told us a lot about that 
growing movement, much of it due to the hard work and dedication 
of the victims themselves and victims rights groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We continued to raise questions in the House of Commons about it 
in 1995 and 1996.  There was still not an understanding by the 
government. 
Late in 1995 I took a motion to the Reform Party assembly and it 
was overwhelmingly endorsed.  It is now a part of our principles 
and policies that victims rights should be front and centre and 
should have certain principles involved in them.  We moved it on 
from there.  We had more questions in the House of Commons, but 
there still was not quite an understanding of what needed to be 
done.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 29, 1996, we tabled a motion in the House to get the 
work started on a national victims bill of rights.  The justice 
minister and I had a great debate on that day.  To my surprise he 
actually admitted at that point that we needed to do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From there it went to committee.  I can recall being with 
victims in the justice committee who presented what had to be 
done.  We were basically all on side at that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a difficult job convincing members on opposite side. When 
they stand to say we should look at what they have done for us, 
they should first thank us for teaching them, thank the victims 
who showed us as well, and look at what we are helping them do. 
That would be a much better approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk briefly about what was originally in the victims 
bill of rights.  There are some who say that some of this is 
provincial so we should not deal with it.  Personally I think 
that is hogwash, particularly since I had commitments in the 
House, and I can produce them, that the government was prepared 
to talk to the provinces about those other issues which were 
administratively their responsibility and to get them at least 
committed to the point where we were consistent across the 
country.  That is one of the greatest problems in the country. 
From Newfoundland, to Nova Scotia, to British Columbia there are 
different processes.  That does not help victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the first things we wanted to do was to define what a 
victim was.  I understand that the committee is looking at 
talking about about that later.  I am not interested in talking 
about it later.  We should be talking about it now.  Originally 
we defined a victim as any one who suffered as a result of an 
offence physical or mental injury or economic loss; or any 
spouse, sibling, child or parent of the individual against whom 
the offence was perpetrated; or anyone who had an equivalent 
relationship, not necessarily a blood relative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to relook at the definition of a victim in the Criminal 
Code and all our documents.  That job cannot be set aside today 
or tomorrow for expediency.  They cannot tell us to look at what 
they have done, that the victims legislation is done and that the 
rest of it can be forgotten until some other day.  We have to 
look at it now and be proactive on these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another right victims should have had was written into the 
original national victims bill of rights, that they should be 
informed of their rights at every stage of the process including 
those rights involving compensation from the offender.  They must 
also be made aware of any available victim services.  I hear 
again that is a provincial jurisdiction.  That may be so but it 
does not exclude the House of Commons from saying that it will 
attempt to do its very best to work with provincial organizations 
to try to make it consistent across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another one of those rights was to be informed of the offender's 
status throughout the process including but not restricted to 
notification of any arrests, upcoming court dates, sentencing 
dates, plans to release the offender from custody, conditions of 
release, parole dates, et cetera.  All information was to be made 
available upon request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some say that is provincial jurisdiction. Some say that it is 
the CRA, the Conditional Release Act.  I suggest the House take 
seriously the issues which victims are concerned about and make a 
commitment in the legislation that something will be done.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we do that?  We can make an appendix to any legislation 
we wish.  We can make a commitment in the House of Commons.  We 
can put it in a throne speech, which will likely be coming up 
next fall.  All kinds of commitments can be made.  Judging from 
my six years of experience in the House of Commons, without these 
commitments it will not get done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it necessary to go through a couple of the things we 
were looking for in a national victims bill of rights which are 
not in this legislation and which this government really has to 
pursue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first would be the right to be informed on a timely basis of 
the details of the crown's intention to offer a plea bargain 
before it is presented to the defence.  I cannot tell the House 
how many times I have spoken with people who have been absolutely 
flabbergasted by the fact that plea bargains or deals were made 
when they had no idea they were being made.  Some would say, the 
technocrats I suppose, that it is provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is, we can do more with the provinces. 
The justice minister meets with the attorneys general of every 
province every year.  Commitments can be obtained.  To say that 
we cannot do it because it is within someone else's jurisdiction 
is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another right is the right to know why charges were not laid, if 
that is the decision of the crown or the police.  Some say again 
that it is within provincial jurisdiction, but if we talk to 
victims they will say “Will someone please make up their mind? 
Could we please get help?”  Is it not our duty in the House of 
Commons to at least try to convince provinces on a wholesale 
basis to undertake these commitments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need protection from anyone who intimidates, harasses or 
interferes with the rights of the victim.  We must have the 
police follow through on domestic violence charges.  Once a 
victim files a complaint the police should have the authority to 
follow it through to the end.  Do not tell me that this is a 
police problem and that we are not responsible in the House of 
Commons.  If we adopt a head in the sand approach in the House of 
Commons in trying to get consistency across this nation, then 
more victims will suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last issue we had written in the national victims bill of 
rights way back in 1994 was to know if the person convicted of a 
sexual offence has a sexually transmittable disease.  That seems 
reasonable to me.  I have dealt with two individuals who have had 
that problem.  One young lady was raped by an individual who 
finally was deported.  He would not give consent to be medically 
tested, so he never was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the kinds of rights we need in this country.  I will 
not be satisfied in saying that we have done all we can, the rest 
is up to the provinces, or the rest will come in another bill.  I 
do not think that is practical.  I think we have to do all we 
can, whenever we can, whatever the jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Way back in 1994 and 1995 when I was involved in this there were 
a lot of people who went the extra mile to fight for victims 
rights.  It is necessary to thank people like Ron and Corrine 
Schaefer.  Corrine's sister Angela was murdered.  Corrine is now 
a member of CAVEAT and has done a lot of good, hard work. Both of 
them have been and still are avid supporters of CAVEAT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chris and Sue Simmonds initially helped tremendously in drafting 
and reviewing the national victims bill of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gary and Sharon Rosenfeldt are people I have met along the way, 
sincere people who are doing the very best they can to improve 
the rights of victims in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also mention Bula, who has had a very tough time as a 
victim.  She was sexually molested by an individual who was 
allowed out of a prison on a day pass.  That individual had 63 
prior convictions. 
These are courageous people.

Heather and Dean are the aunt and uncle of Tanya Smith who was 
murdered in my town of Abbotsford.  They have now joined the 
ranks of victims, which is sad to say, but they are also turning 
a negative into a positive in doing the very best they can to 
improve things in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to thank Rosalie Turcotte from Mission, British 
Columbia.  I want to thank Rosie from Windsor, Ontario, whom I 
spent a great deal of time with when preparing a private member's 
bill which dealt with prisoners changing their names. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these people and many more deserve much more than just 
some things in victims legislation.  I very much encourage this 
House to do more.  We should not stop here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about a rally that is going to occur which will 
shake this nation out of its complacency.  The rally will consist 
of grassroots people from all over this country who will bring 
the issue of drugs to the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 27 we intend to hold a very large rally in my riding. 
The theme of the rally will be “Drugs:  Are You Ready to 
Fight?”  I would encourage members of the House on both sides to 
consider this very serious issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have gone through the national drug strategy of the Liberal 
government.  I have been on the streets in many difficult 
situations where drugs are everywhere.  When we talk to the 
people on the streets who are trying to help, they look at the 
national drug strategy that the government has produced—and I am 
not belittling the government—and they say it is not helping on 
the street, that this is rhetorical stuff, that these dollars do 
not reach the street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order.  I am hesitant to interrupt the member, but I think he 
is carrying what would be constituted as a prop, which is 
contrary to the rules of the House.  I am talking about what is 
on the back of his speaking notes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Surely the hon.

not seen what is on the back of his notes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will not belittle the 
issue of drugs by commenting on the remark of the member.  If I 
had another ten minutes the member would wear that comment. 
However, I will say that the issue of drugs is not a matter of a 
point of order.  The issue of drugs in this country is serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Watch who you are talking to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have just been told to 
watch who I am talking to.  I have a feeling that we are going to 
be dragging the government through a knothole on the drug issue 
just like we did on victims rights.  That is why I brought this 
issue up in my last two minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will take on the issue of drugs in this country.  Members 
opposite can be sure that we will be as vociferous as we were on 
victims rights.  Victims rights came to this House because of 
this party.  Government members can be sure that they will not 
duck under the rocks they come from on that issue either.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and

colleague's comments about drugs.  I wonder if the member wishes 
to comment on the DARE program, drug awareness resistance 
education.  I am sure the member is aware of it.  I wonder how it 
is working in British Columbia and whether the member thinks it 
is something we should be helping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would tell the member that I learned recently that 37,000 
Alberta boys and girls in grade 6 took the course last year. It

program.  There are many educational programs involving drugs 
today.  What I see, however, is a lack of co-ordination 
nationally on all of these programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I go into one needle exchange in one city, in one small 
office, and find out that there are 2.5 million needles per annum 
issued out of that office, I say that not only is this a national 
priority, but what is happening with the DARE program and all of 
the other programs?  What are we missing that is not going from 
education into the addiction aspect of it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in Sydney, Nova Scotia and Cape Breton last week and I was 
surprised to see a needle exchange there.  Typically, needle 
exchanges are in areas where there are really very serious 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this issue has crept up on us and is to the point now 
where it is not just education, it is that we have to stop 
treating drug addicts and people who commit crimes because of 
their addiction as criminals and look at them as a serious health 
issue.  We have to look at those who are non-addicted and selling 
drugs as serious criminals and do something very serious with 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the hon. member's question.  I hope that when we get 
into this seriously, and we will, like it or not, we will get 
into this together.  We have to look at all of the educational 
programs, all of the rehabilitation programs and all of the 
criminal aspects of legislation and make them work right across 
the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I took note of the fact that the hon. member was in my 
home town recently.  I share with him the concern.  I know he was 
surprised to see a needle exchange program in my community.  I 
can share with him the reflections of many of the community 
groups that I have met with on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back to the hon. member's comments on the issue 
before the House today, which is the legislation providing for 
the role of victims in the criminal justice system.  In my 
comments I talked about what I thought each of the parties 
brought to the table, as well as the participants.  One of the 
things I talked about was rights and the competing balance 
between the rights of the accused and the rights of the victim. 
We have to find that balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask this in all seriousness because I am curious.  The member 
refers to a bill of rights for victims.  As I see it, there is a 
charter of rights for all Canadians.  I know his party has long 
said that Canadians are equal in every aspect.  If we all have 
rights under the charter, would the member then propose special 
rights for victims in a bill of rights and then perhaps special 
rights for those accused and special rights for other groups?  Or 
is he proposing that we do away with the charter of rights for 
all Canadians and have particular rights for different groups? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask this because I see competing rights and I see rights as 
something that we all share and we all have to preserve.  It is 
perhaps a philosophical question, but I ask it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Madam Speaker, actually it is a very 
good question.  The charter of rights and freedoms has created 
some problems.  What I did initially before I wrote the national 
victims bill of rights was to look at the prison system and 
compare the rights of criminals to the rights of victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I looked at all of the charter fights, most of them, if not 
all of them, were for criminals.  They ended up with the right to 
vote.  They ended up with the right to refuse work.  They ended 
up with Canada pension plan benefits.  They ended up with 
virtually all of the rights and even more in prisons than they 
had when they were outside.  They had the rights, but they did 
not have the privileges.  I think we have mixed up the rights and 
the privileges.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today and in the past victims have felt like third class 
citizens.  They have felt like some party that is outside of the 
exercise when it has come to going to court or any other instance 
they were involved in.  Many a lawyer has said publicly and to me 
that victims have no place in the courtroom.  The crime was 
against the crown and the lawyers have ended up outside a 
criminal justice system and inside a legal industry where the 
best buck gets the best lawyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims were basically being told to go away, to keep quiet, to 
say nothing, “We will deal for you, we will do all of the plea 
bargaining, we will do everything.  Don't worry, we will look 
after you”. The fact is they were not being looked after.  They 
were treated like third class citizens.  That is why it has all 
come about. It is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should all have the same rights and freedoms, with the 
exception of some of the rights and freedoms given to criminals 
in prisons.  I do not agree with all that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Since we have the originator of the original victims bill 
of rights here talking about it, could I seek unanimous consent 
that we extend questions and comments by 10 minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
work a lot with the hon. member and I thank him for his comments. 
I worked a lot with him before I became a member of this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he care to elaborate on some of the more common 
complaints?  What were the major complaints he was hearing from 
victims on their part in the process?  Does he have any idea as 
to why it took so long to finally get to this day?  Where was the 
resistance coming from if indeed there was any? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the member 
for Surrey North asking for the extra 10 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that touched me greatly was talking to 
victims.  The member for Surrey North will probably not remember 
when I first met him.  We were talking to some young kids in New 
Westminster.  He was speaking to them and it touched me greatly. 
Here was a person who was trying to get a system changed from the 
outside and not in the House of Commons, who knew what he needed 
and what the problems were, yet it just was not coming together. 
Who was listening? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the frustrating things that happened and why it took so 
long to get victims rights in legislation in this country is that 
there was not the comprehension on the other side. The thought on 
the other side was that we were helping victims by bringing in 
Bill C-68, the gun law.  It was the victim out there who said 
“Somebody in my family was murdered with a gun, but I am treated 
like dirt in a courtroom”.  Those were the kinds of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall sitting at a sentencing hearing. One of the victims in 
the room was listening to a written victim impact statement she 
had prepared.  She leaned over to me and said “I don't think 
that is mine”.  We found out that the thing had been purged so 
badly.  We asked about it and the defence lawyer said “We had to 
take certain things out of the victim impact statement because it 
would harm the credibility of my client” who had murdered her 
sister.  She was asking what rights she had as that guy was 
protected. Those are the kinds of things victims were asking 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another story.  I recall sitting in a room with a lady 
whose house had been torched by her ex-husband.  She asked the 
system to tell her when her ex-husband would be getting out of 
prison, where he would be located, how long he would be there, 
and of any reports on how well he was doing. She was afraid of 
this fellow. 
They never told her a thing.  And then he showed up with the 
gasoline and a car and drove through the carport and set the 
place on fire.  She asks “Who cares about me?”  That is what 
victims rights are all about:  “who cares about me?”

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have already asked a 
question, but I would like to salute the member and his colleague 
from Surrey for the work they have done on victims rights.  It is 
a very important matter in their ridings, my riding and every 
riding across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to drugs, I believe the figure is 240 residents of 
Vancouver died of heroin overdoses in the first six months of 
last year.  That is more than one a day.  Sharing his concern 
about drugs enormously, I wonder if he would say anything more 
about why he thinks those 240 fellow human beings might have died 
the way they did last year and why people continue to die in 
Vancouver and elsewhere in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if it were just 240 
residents, but it is much higher than that as we speak. I was in 
Vancouver's downtown east side a week and a half ago. I was in 
one building and watched a person who had overdosed be carried 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The drug market is extremely profitable.  I have talked to 
people who have sold drugs.  I talked to a 14 year old who was 
doing community time for selling cocaine.  I sat down with this 
young fellow and said, “Why do I not help get your grades 10, 11 
and 12 and then we can help you through post-secondary school”. 
I had previous connections with school districts.  This 14 year 
old looked at me and said “Listen fellow, I make 18 to 20 grand 
a month which is non-taxable profit.  I have a lawyer on retainer 
and I have a” whatever car it was.  He was not even old enough 
to have a driver's licence.  Profit is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile there are people who are so hooked on drugs that their 
job is to get kids out of the schools, young girls in particular. 
They come from Vancouver and go to the Fraser Valley and get 
kids on this stuff.  They give it away to start with.  They get 
them hooked and then it is on with the home invasions, the break 
and enters, and so on and so forth.  I cannot impress upon the 
House how important this issue is.  I think my colleague knows 
that.  The co-operation we get could make the difference in this 
nation as to how we deal with all these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, the speakers we have for the May 27 rally are very 
serious people.  There is a young lady who has been a drug addict 
and lived on the streets on Vancouver's east side for four years. 
She has been off it for a year but of course, addicts are never 
ever off it.  There is the Washington state drug enforcement 
administration and the Vancouver narcotics squad.  There is a 
mother whose daughter is actually on the streets in Vancouver.  I 
am happy to announce that George Chuvalo will be attending as 
well.  George has lost three of his kids to heroin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This rally is not a show.  It is not a partisan political body. 
I invite all members to show their support. There will be local 
and provincial politicians there.  We should all go and listen 
and say we can do more about this problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
want to add my congratulations to the members of the Reform Party 
justice team, particularly the member for Langley—Abbotsford and 
the member for Surrey North who worked so hard on this issue.  I 
know the member for Langley—Abbotsford has promoted the victims 
bill of rights for a long time.  It is nice to see that it has 
come but it is unfortunate it has taken so long for the 
government to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has talked at length about the victims who have come 
in contact with him.  One issue is the definition of a victim. 
It is there in this bill and it is defined.  I would like the 
member's comments and thoughts on what the definition of victim 
should be. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Madam Speaker, the definition of a 
victim has to be changed.  It has to acknowledge anyone who 
suffers as a result of an offence, physical or mental injury, 
economic loss, or any spouse, sibling, child or parent of the 
individual on whom the offence was perpetrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can recall one case, and I know my colleague from Surrey North 
knows the individuals as well.  I will not mention the names. 
Assistance was attempted for the individual's wife and the system 
said she was not a victim.  Her daughter had been murdered and 
the system said she was not a victim.  How appalling.  How could 
we be so callous, so careless about that?  Can we not make a 
better definition of what a victim is? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure my colleague could speak a lot better than I on this 
subject.  It is not necessarily the individual who was murdered 
but those left behind who are victims. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, before I got into politics I was somewhat cynical about 
the whole process of politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Langley—Abbotsford lives in a community 
neighbouring mine.  I saw a number of articles in the newspapers 
having to do with issues he was raising.  It made a lot of sense, 
particularly in the area of victims rights.  I know there were a 
number of incidents in my own community where victims were 
created by acts of criminal negligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a young gal whose sister was killed by a drunk driver 
just a few blocks from my home.  I know the member was involved 
in that situation.  His involvement in the lives of those victims 
is ongoing, as well as others he mentioned in his speech.  I want 
to thank him for taking a stand on that.  That is one of the 
reasons I got involved in this process, to make some positive 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be difficult in a short period of time, but I would like 
my colleague to give a few personal reflections of his 
involvement in this issue and how it has impacted on him and 
motivated him to seek these changes in such a positive way as he 
has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague.  We 
do share the same surrounding areas and in fact our colleague 
from Surrey North is not that far away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have a unique market on compassion in this party.  It 
is all through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen a lot of crime in our day.  We have seen a lot of 
victims.  As we have seen today, victims in fact are elected to 
the House of Commons.  This is no small issue.  This is serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only reflect this about all the people I have met, their 
desire and willingness to make a difference and change.  I have 
to plead with the government since it is a majority government to 
go further with victims rights.  Do not stop here.  Much more has 
to be done.  I think the government has the message now.  It is 
on the first step of the ladder.  Let us not stop.  It has our 
support certainly for progression on victims rights. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
express my gratitude to my colleague from Langley—Abbotsford 
mainly for his seriousness about his work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament by 1996 he was able to introduce in the 
House a victims bill of rights which was strongly supported. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT34"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT34"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1245

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the reason the member worked so hard on that bill.  I was 
there on a number of occasions with him when we had spent hours 
visiting with people who were victims of crime, listening to 
their stories, listening to how things were developing in their 
lives, and listening to some of the tragedies that were taking 
place.  It just was not answering the call. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I watched the member put together this package and present it 
with great pride, as he should.  He had full support of victims 
across the land from CAVEAT, CRY and FACT.  A number of 
organizations commended him.  When it left the House and was sent 
to the committee that was the last we heard of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me that presents a serious problem.  In 1996 a valuable 
document was presented in the House.  Why is it now, three years 
later, that we will finally talk about this extremely important 
issue?  My friend and colleague from Edmonton mentioned drugs and 
what we needed to do because the situation was so serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely serious.  I am now visiting reserves with the 
department of Indian affairs.  I am saddened to find that in many 
of our reserves in the last little while there have been a number 
of suicide victims.  Those family members are telling me that it 
is mainly because of drugs.  It is becoming so common that they 
do not even make the newspaper any more.  In my own province of 
Alberta I know of at least six suicides in the last few weeks 
which have not even made the newspapers because they are so 
commonplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking in the House briefly today about what we will do 
to prevent having future victims.  That is one issue.  We cannot 
have a three year delay.  Three years can be terribly disastrous 
to a number of individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat in a home on one reserve with a mother who had lost three 
children to suicide because of drugs.  Her plea was for help 
because she did not want to lose any more of her kids.  I talked 
to a fellow, Mike Calder, who works on the streets of Winnipeg 
with young aboriginal people who come from the reserves and are 
being roped into gangs that are promoting drugs, prostitution and 
all the evil things we could think about. Kids under 12 years of 
age are being scooped up and used by those who are profiting from 
these kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My whole point in raising this point is that we cannot 
continually sit in the House and wait for three years to do 
something about a problem that is progressing so horribly.  We 
have many people dying on the streets in Vancouver, as the member 
just said.  How bad does it have to get before we would consider 
it to be an emergency and maybe decide to do something about it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking about a person who was convicted in 1998 of a 
drunken driving charge.  He had killed four people as a result of 
a stupid decision to drive while drinking.  His victims lived in 
Saskatchewan and were killed on an Alberta highway. 
At the scene the individual was very upset that it had happened. 
He admitted his guilt.  It was proven that he was terribly 
intoxicated.  Yet it took 18 court cases to deal with what seemed 
so obvious.  He immediately pleaded guilty.  He was immediately 
remorseful.  All the things were in the right place to deal with 
it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The families of the people who were killed on the highway drove 
back and forth to Calgary 18 times in over two years to finally 
hear the verdict for the individual who had taken the lives of 
these people.  It took 18 court cases on a cut and dry drunk 
driving case.  He was obviously guilty and had pleaded guilty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot begin to describe the trauma and the major effect it 
had on the lives of the victims.  I have become well aware of 
them over a period of time.  There was the trauma of not knowing 
what the justice system would do for them.  Eighteen courts cases 
is very profitable for the legal system but it does nothing for a 
justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The military used to have a code, and I hope it still has, that 
some things need to be in place to have good justice.  It has to 
be fast.  It needs to be firm.  It needs to be fair.  It needs to 
be final.  It used to be called the four <I>f</I>s.  It would not 
take long to make decisions on cases like that one.  If it had to 
be investigated it would take a lot of time and energy.  Four 
families were involved.  They lost their children in a car wreck 
caused by a drunk driver.  For over two years they drove back and 
forth from Saskatchewan waiting for this cut and dry case to be 
dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally the House has a victims bill before it three years 
later.  The victims have been calling for it for ages.  It was 
introduced and passed in 1996 but something happened.  It died 
somewhere.  Is it because we have become so political that an 
idea from my Reform colleague is not acceptable by a Liberal 
government?  Does it have to die at the committee level and then 
be reproduced later by a Liberal minister so it looks better?  If 
that is the motive we need to examine how we operate in this 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A five year old girl in Calgary went missing.  By evening they 
found her in a dumpster.  She had been murdered.  It was very 
sad.  They found the person responsible for her death.  It was a 
next door neighbour who lived across the alley behind them.  He 
had taken the little girl out of her yard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His cry to the police was that the little girl had been coming 
on to him.  He was 47 years old.  They spent time and energy on 
him.  The 47 year old individual received psychological guidance. 
He even went to the hospital to be checked over.  I cannot 
imagine it but he received legal aid.  All kinds of assistance 
were overflowing from our system to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mother was a single parent and had two other children.  She 
suffered a great loss when this little five year old girl was 
taken.  The only counselling they got was from friends.  The only 
professional medical help they could get was through psychology, 
psychiatry or whatever for which she paid herself.  There was no 
program offered to help them overcome the grief they were going 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the 47 year old man who claimed to have been led astray 
by this little girl was to go to a place where thousands of 
dollars would be spent to provide some kind of rehabilitation 
program for him.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For months and months it went on.  Organized victim groups went 
to the home of this mother to hold her hand and give her a 
shoulder to lean on.  There was absolutely no help from the 
system whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize the serious problems faced by victims in the land. 
In 1996 it was passed in the House, sent to committee and lost. 
1999 rolls along and we finally get to doing something about it. 
What kind of a procedure is that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the 10 year review of the Young Offenders Act failed 
dismally.  The government announced that something had to be done 
with that act.  Now it is 1999 and, lo and behold, we are to have 
a new act.  Nothing has changed in the meantime.  There are still 
all kinds of problems.  We concentrate so heavily on the rights 
of the criminals that we have completely forgotten the victims 
involved and how protecting them is so essential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my friend from Edmonton, we cannot delay fighting 
drugs any longer.  We have to get at it.  We have to consider it 
to be extremely serious and deal with it.  It is time to put 
partisan politics completely aside when young people all across 
the country are dying on our streets from drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe there is anyone in this place who would not 
co-operate with another person to help alleviate that problem.  I 
do not believe that for a moment.  Let us not do anything that 
would cause the kinds of differences that would make that happen. 
Let us just agree that there is a problem and, for heaven's sake, 
let us work jointly together to solve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of it has to do with poverty.  In 1993 when I came here 
there were one million children living in poverty.  Now I hear 
talk about 1.5 million.  That is not solving the problem.  It 
seems to me like it is going in the wrong direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start thinking about where we are spending our money and 
where it can have the best effect.  I agree that it was extremely 
nice of our heritage minister to spend $25 million to see to it 
that everybody got a flag, but there are children's aid societies 
all across the land that could really have used that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can we not make victims of crime our priority?  Young people 
are a big part of the problem of being victims.  They are victims 
of poverty.  They are victims of all the things that could be 
fixed if we decided to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When something good comes forward like my hon. colleague's bill 
of rights, something that was acceptable to every hon. member of 
the House as far as I know, it is time to get rolling and get it 
done.  I know a few members may not have liked it but they were a 
very few.  It went to committee and it died. Why?  I do not know. 
We could only speculate from that point on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Partisan politics interfere far too much in this place when we 
need to deal with serious problems.  We need to visit more 
individuals out there who are paying our wages to be here.  We 
need to learn of the problems they are facing and learn of the 
situations that can be overcome if we get our priorities straight 
in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members can object to the spending of money as I just 
mentioned I did.  I can see the headlines tomorrow:  the hon. 
member for Wild Rose is anti-Canada; he did not want the heritage 
minister to give away flags. 
That is not the point at all.  That is a very good thing to do. 
It is too bad we do not have an extra $25 million lying around to 
do that with.  However, how can we justify spending money in some 
areas, like committees for seniors for sexuality, when we have 
people committing suicide.  In Vancouver alone over 300 young 
people have died this year because of drugs.  Victims are growing 
by the numbers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and 
Africa), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague from Wild Rose 
mentioned a family from Saskatchewan who was obliged to come 18 
times to court in Alberta on a guilty plea involving a terrible 
tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member knows, I spent 10 years in court as a defence or 
crown counsel.  Could he tell us, if he has the case at his 
fingertips, whether the fault for that was because of a probation 
officer, the judge, the crown or the defence counsel?  Can he 
tell us the reason for this 18 time requirement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is difficult for me 
to do that.  I only know of the one time that it was delayed. I 
will have to work in reverse because there was so much going on 
in between.  I was caught off guard that it had lasted so long. I 
thought it would have been over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time we all thought we were going to court was on the 
day of sentencing.  The families drove in from Saskatchewan. 
While we were sitting in the courtroom, the judged looked at the 
guidelines for sentencing only after the conviction had already 
been made.  As he was going down the guidelines he noticed there 
was one little sentence that had been added in, not by this House 
but by order in council I presume or however some things get 
added in to the Criminal Code, “that before sentencing we must 
consider whether the person is aboriginal or not”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judge looked at it and said he was not sure what it meant so 
he was adjourning court for the day.  He scheduled it for five 
days later so he could investigate what that particular sentence 
was supposed to mean.  Those are the kinds of things that get 
implemented into the Criminal Code that do not really make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a drunk driver who killed four people.  Pray tell, what 
difference would the person's nationality make?  The 
circumstances in that person's life were all brought out through 
the 18 months in court.  Neither his race nor his nationality 
were discussed until the last day when it was to be suspended.  I 
think the judge was honestly surprised that it was even in there 
and he had to find out what it meant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The family drove back to Saskatchewan.  Five days later they had 
to come back again for the final sentencing which, I might add, 
was a big disappointment to the victims.  They thought it should 
have been a lot more severe than it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the only incident that I can definitely say happened. I 
do not really know about the other times.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member mentioned the terrible impact of drugs on young people and 
the local communities.  He even mentioned the downtown area of my 
own riding of Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pursue this a bit further.  There is no question 
that the impact of illegal drugs is overpowering in terms of 
death and destruction, not just on individual lives but on whole 
communities.  As he has pointed out, this does have a 
relationship to crime.  It marginalizes people and involves them 
in taking on a criminal lifestyle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member's party agree that in order to deal with the 
issue of reducing the harm of obtaining drugs illegally on the 
street that we have to provide a social and medical response? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have, for example, a motion coming up that will look at 
providing a heroin maintenance program.  This will enable us to 
put chronic addicts into the medical system.  They should not be 
out on the street leading very desperate lives and causing harm 
not only to themselves but to the whole community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard two members speak about the impact of drugs and 
the drug trade.  Does the Reform Party recognize that there are 
victims and to continue with a criminalized approach does not 
really solve anything? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also mentioned growing poverty which, I agree, has 
been a tragedy in the country.  I saw a letter the other day from 
a Reform member suggesting that housing and homelessness were not 
a national responsibility but a responsibility that should be 
left to the provinces.  I am curious as to the Reform Party's 
position as articulated by the member today.  Growing poverty 
also impacts on victims of crime and on the people involved in 
crime.  The provision of housing as a basic human need is 
something that is very critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to know whether the Reform Party supports the 
provision of housing?  Does it feel there is a role for the 
federal government to play in ensuring that there is no 
homelessness in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, unlike a lot of policies 
and parties I have seen, I think they are lacking a little 
ability to determine priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should know where best to use the money that will 
benefit Canadians the most.  Education, protection and health are 
always priorities.  Our policy strongly suggests that there has 
to be an amount of money available for those who are severely in 
need.  I am talking about people who are living on welfare and 
cannot do anything about it.  I am talking about the handicapped 
who are unable to earn money because they cannot get a job. I am 
talking about a genuine need.  That is where we would expect the 
dollars to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also expect the dollars to go into native affairs.  For 
example, money should be used to eliminate the poverty and 
squalor that some of these people are living in on the reserves. 
I have seen it with my own eyes.  It is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we need to look at people who are addicted and 
caught up in the activity of drugs as being anything more than 
victims.  We need a system that is going to help as best it can. 
I am certainly no expert on what type of program we could have 
that would help people avoid drugs.  We live in a country where 
drugs are rampant and available in our penitentiaries.  This is 
where it could be corrected, but we have failed to even attempt 
that.  That certainly has a bearing on what happens out in the 
rest of the world.  People are supposed to be sent to 
penitentiaries for drug rehabilitation yet drugs are more 
available in the penitentiary than anywhere else.  It hardly 
makes sense to me.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people come into Canada from foreign lands just for the 
purpose of distributing drugs and profiting highly.  When we 
catch these individuals committing a crime, why do we want them 
to stay in Canada and impose their evil deeds on our young 
people?  Let us deport them.  Who needs them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is thoroughly disgusting to go into cities and see 12 and 13 
year olds working as prostitutes.  These are children who are 
victims.   When they find the 20 or 30 year old individual who is 
called their pimp, he gets a small slap on the wrist and is back 
out finding a new victim.  Why do we want to treat those people 
so kindly?  If I suggest there are better solutions to dealing 
with criminals of that nature, then immediately the words would 
come out “Oh, the extremist”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it okay that a pimp can manage 11 and 12 year old kids on our 
streets, get a six month sentence and then be released back into 
our community?  No, it is not okay.  We have to take these 
criminals a little more seriously.  They are going to try to suck 
all our young people into these programs and we have to stop 
them.  We have to make up our minds to do it and get away from 
the political rhetoric of “Oh, what an evil thought” or “Oh, 
what an extreme man”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak on Bill C-79, 
an act respecting victims of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite amusing that we should be debating a bill that was 
supposed to be a priority not only to the present Minister of 
Justice but to the previous Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the former Minister of Justice promised that specific 
victim legislation would be presented by the fall.  Here we are, 
three years later and two justice ministers later, debating a 
bill that, according to the present justice minister in June 
1997, listed victims rights as one of her top three priorities. 
It is two years later and we are debating this top priority of 
the Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one area in which the Reform Party has played a very 
important role.  Three years ago, a supply day motion was 
presented by the Reform Party, and supported by the House, which 
put a victims rights bill into the system and before a committee. 
The justice committee was instructed to come up with legislation 
that would be reported back to the House. I guess three years 
late is better than not at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have several concerns with the legislation.  Nowhere is the 
definition of a victim clearly spelled out.  As many of us in the 
House know from visitations from constituents, a victim is not 
necessarily the person who received the abuse, the attempted 
murder, the rape or whatever.  A victim can be family members; 
sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, siblings.  In many cases 
there can be lots of victims when these kinds of criminal actions 
take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have thought the government would have been a little 
clearer in the parameters of who it considered to be victims and 
who it considered should fall under the Criminal Code in 
reference to the rights given to victims.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other concern I have is that the committee, in recommending 
that the legislation be presented to the House, also recommended 
that there be amendments to the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act which would support what this victims rights bill is 
attempting to do.  It is difficult to deal with one and not deal 
with the other at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are faced with dealing with part of an answer to a problem, 
rather than the entire answer which was recommended by the 
committee, which was to make amendments to the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act and to install victims rights 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until we deal with the Corrections and Conditional Release Act 
we will not know whether we have resolved some of the issues 
because we will be dealing with them in isolation.  This should 
be going hand in glove to make sure that what the government is 
attempting to do is in fact what the committee suggested the 
government do in order to deal with the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern I have, and I would be the first to recognize 
the difficulty with this given my responsibility, is that the 
federal government is responsible for the Criminal Code.  The 
federal government is responsible for the legislation which sets 
the parameters of criminal activity, what the penalties will be, 
how they will be treated and the like.  However, the provincial 
governments are responsible for the administration of the 
Criminal Code through their judicial processes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little concerned that there needs to be a closer working 
relationship between the provinces and the federal government to 
make sure that the changes in the Criminal Code are changes that 
the provincial governments can accept and enact.  I believe that 
the committee which will be established might help with this, 
that it will attempt to work with the provinces in the enacting 
or the ability of the provinces to implement the legislation, but 
I really feel from my experience that there needs to be far more 
open communication between the provincial jurisdiction and the 
federal jurisdiction before things are set in stone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to believe that the committee which will be 
established will have the ability to work with the provinces, and 
to get the provinces to work together, but I would have liked to 
have seen a little more indication that the federal government 
had already gone through that process in a much more meaningful 
way before it produced legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation has been introduced into the House of Commons. 
The process will allow the government to once again hear from 
victims and from provinces as to whether they feel this 
particular drafting of the legislation really deals with the 
issue.  I hope the government, through the committee, will be 
open to hearing what the victims and their families, support 
groups and community groups have to say.  I hope they will listen 
to what the provincial governments have to say with respect to 
the administration of the legislation and that if there are 
problems, if there are ways of amending the legislation so that 
it will work better, then I hope the government will be open to 
bringing those kinds of amendments and changes to the legislation 
so that we end up with a statute that has meaningful application 
in today's world.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the difficulties that I have with this 
legislation, but I would like to give credit where credit is due. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee which dealt with this issue did a good job, I 
believe, in making recommendations to the government.  The 
committee went out of its way to listen to victims rights groups 
and other advocates to try to bring together in its 
recommendations meaningful changes and meaningful recommendations 
for legislation that the government could use to address the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the committee has recommended and what the government has 
included in Bill C-79 is that the victims are to be informed of 
their right to prepare a victim impact statement at the time of 
sentencing.  One would think that is pretty common and that it is 
already done.  Surprisingly, it is not already done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, a victim impact statement can be presented in writing, but 
there has never been an opportunity for the victim or the 
victim's family to relate to a court the impact of the criminal 
activity on themselves.  To me it seems almost ridiculous that it 
has taken so long in the development of our criminal system, our 
court system and our judicial system for victims to be given this 
right to express the result of the action.  It is far past the 
time that this recognition be granted.  The government is to be 
commended that it has finally seen the opportunity to make this 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has given victims a choice.  They can read the 
victim impact statement in court.  As I said, this was never a 
choice which they had before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has also given victims of sexual assault or violent crime up 
to the age of 18 years the right to be protected.  They can be 
protected from cross-examination by the offender.  In other 
words, an offender who is representing himself would not have the 
right to attack and victimize, if you will, the victim for a 
second time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might feel that does not happen very often, but I think we 
might be surprised at how often it does happen.  I was absolutely 
appalled when there was a chance that Clifford Olson, whom we all 
know about, might have an opportunity to cross-examine family 
members on a section 745 hearing.  It was mind-boggling that 
somebody like that would even have the right to have personal 
contact to cross-examine a victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we would be surprised at how often a victim is forced to 
present themselves in our judicial system before their attacker 
and be faced with feeling very intimidated and very vulnerable 
for a second time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that this legislation brings up the issue of 
police officers and judges considering the victim's safety in 
bail decisions.  How can it possibly be that this was not a 
consideration before?  How can it possibly be that the safety of 
the victim was never a consideration?  Once again I have to 
commend the government for at least acknowledging that something 
which seems so common sense finally sees the light of day in 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue it presents is that judges are required to inform 
the public of the possibility of a section 745 application for 
early parole for those people who have received life sentences. 
For those viewers who may not know what a section 745 application 
is, it is when a convicted first degree murderer who has been 
given a life sentence without eligibility for parole for 25 years 
can apply for an early parole release after 15 years. It is 
interesting that finally there is something in legislation which 
says it has to be made public when somebody is making that 
application.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to the issue of why it should be made public.  In 
many cases a victim wants to make a statement during these 
hearings.  We have these people whose crimes were considered to 
be violent, a crime of intent or a murder of intent.  That is 
what a first degree murder charge or conviction is.  They want to 
be let out after 15 years instead of facing at least 25 years. 
It seems to me that one would assume that in a first degree 
murder charge the families of the murdered individual would have 
an opportunity to express to the court, in making the decision of 
whether this individual should have early release, the hardship 
which that criminal activity caused them.  They have never had 
that opportunity.  Finally the victims will have an opportunity 
to present victim impact statements at section 745 hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is important to an individual who has been confronted with 
this kind of situation, who feels they can never leave behind the 
criminal activity which destroyed their lives because somebody is 
constantly appearing before a parole board looking for relief. 
They were never given an opportunity to express their concern or 
how their life changed because of the criminal act or murder. 
Finally these individuals will be given that opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the protection of victims by the banning of the 
publication of court transcriptions.  That is a given.  If a 
victim has survived and wants to put it behind them, the last 
thing they want is for the whole world to know what they suffered 
and to have to relive it over and over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some very valid and very good things that the 
government has brought to this bill and has addressed through 
this bill.  However, it is sad that it did not go the full nine 
yards by taking all of the recommendations of the committee, that 
it did not provide a better definition of victim and that it did 
not bring in amendments to the Corrections and Conditional 
Release Act at the same time so we could deal with it in its 
entirety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share with the House an individual's story.  It is 
from the local newspaper and is entitled “The Life Destroyed”. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A women is scooped off the street, shovelled into the cab of a 
pickup truck, raped repeatedly by the passenger while the driver 
taunts her to “make it good for my friend”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty minutes later, the vehicle stops.  The woman is pushed 
out, then tossed like a sack of potatoes onto the tailgate, where 
the driver rapes her.  The passenger plunges the knife into her 
back, twists it, then pulls it out.  Then he kicks her body down 
a bank.  At the bottom the body rolls into the cold water of the 
river. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could there be anything more horrible, more appalling? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“There is”, said the woman, “the Canadian justice system”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a sorry statement that we should even have to address in 
the House, but that is what this victim, who suffered what no one 
of us could possibly imagine living through, who did not think 
she would live through, had to address. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As appalling, odious and painful the crime, there was worse to 
come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“I was on the witness stand for seven hours.  That was longer 
than the rapes themselves.  The court experience was the worst 
experience I have ever had to go through in my life”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a young woman whose life was destroyed.  She was 18 at 
the time.  She had a child.  The child later went with the father 
because mentally and physically she could not deal with the 
situation.  She is now a bi-polar depressant person.  She has to 
be on medication.  She needs counselling.  This is six, seven or 
eight years later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She goes on to say about one of the rapists: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am angry because he is getting full parole.  He gets to choose 
what he gets and I have had to suffer for the past eight years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>She does not understand why Lee has had the chance to get out of 
jail. “I felt that he would be there for the full 12 years. I 
hate Lee and Bennett”, the two individuals who raped her. 
“They destroyed my life.  I became a terrible mother and I was a 
good mother before”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an individual whose total life has been destroyed.  One 
of the individuals got 12 years and I believe the other got 18 
years.  Both of them are out on parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For every parole hearing she has to prepare herself mentally and 
physically to once again address the issue and make statements, 
to make sure these individuals have to remain accountable for 
their actions.  She is going through this time and time again. 
While these two individuals get counselling and all the 
necessities of life in prison, not necessarily the worst of the 
lot, this individual is struggling to put her life back together 
with little assistance from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her medication bills are $165 a month.  She cannot afford to go 
to counselling anymore because it is $80 an hour.  Even though 
this is making a terrible state of her life she has had to drop 
the counselling.  She says that on $10 an hour she just cannot 
afford it anymore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another insult the justice system has hurled at her is that it 
requires her, the victim of a crime, to undergo a criminal record 
check before she is allowed in the room where Lee's hearing is to 
take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One really has to wonder when it is the victim who is always 
victimized again and again by our justice system.  It is time to 
let victims have closure, to move on and to restore the lives 
that have been destroyed.

troubling.  A number of years ago a man murdered his wife, or 
killed his wife.  We cannot call him a murderer because he was 
accused of manslaughter.  He served part of his time.  He got 
five years.  He was trying to have his kids visit him.  These 
kids are victims.  They are his kids and he killed their mother. 
He was trying to force them into having visits with him.  Now the 
word is that upon his release he is going to try to get custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure she is aware of the case I am talking about. I wonder 
if she has any comments on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Surrey North for bringing up that issue.  It is not one that is 
easy to forget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An individual murdered his wife and it was not a clean murder. 
He tried to hide it.  He tried to clean her up, put her back into 
bed and pretend she died in the night even though she was 
battered and bruised. He was convicted of manslaughter.  As so 
often happens we had plea bargaining.  It was the easiest way to 
get a conviction and so he got manslaughter with five years and 
was out after putting in his required number of years.  He 
requested visitations with his children when he was still on 
parole.  The children had to go through tremendous difficulties, 
counselling and the whole bit. The youngest child was still 
nursing when the mother was killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the family that has taken over the care of these children 
since he was charged and incarcerated is fighting in the courts 
at great expense to keep custody of these children knowing the 
psychological damage that has already happened to these children 
and which would continue if they were to go back to their father. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an ongoing case where the victims have to go into the 
court system over and over again to try to make sure justice is 
served.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for many reasons to participate in 
the debate on Bill C-79.  The single most important reason is 
because we would not be here today if it was not for the Reform 
Party, for its vision and its pursuit and acknowledgement of 
victims of crime in our criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically the House owes thanks to the member for Surrey 
North and the member for Langley—Abbotsford for their dogged 
determination in forcing the government to acknowledge victims. 
There is no doubt this government would have procrastinated in 
the area of victims rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative goes back a long way, in fact back to 1996.  In 
the last parliament the member for Langley—Abbotsford introduced 
a victims bill of rights, an enlightened document.  Its genesis 
was that victims have rights and they should be acknowledged as a 
fundamental right in our society.  For too long, victims were the 
forgotten element in an impersonal justice system. The member for 
Langley—Abbotsford is to be commended for his tenacity and his 
vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following that initiative by the member for Langley—Abbotsford, 
a Reform Party supply day motion was introduced, debated and 
passed in 1996.  It finally got a lethargic government motivated 
to review and finally introduce the legislation we have before us 
today.  That took another three years.  If it was not for the 
continued pressure by Reform to get this issue before the 
standing committee, who knows how long the government would have 
delayed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1998 the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights tabled its report, “Victims' Rights - A Voice, Not A 
Veto”.  At this juncture was again the member for Surrey North 
who was responsible for many of the recommendations in the report 
and now for what we have before us today in Bill C-79. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fall of 1996 the former Minister of Justice promised to 
move on the issue of victims rights.  His promise never 
materialized.  Another broken covenant by this lethargic 
government. The 35th Parliament came and went and no victims 
rights legislation.  On April 29, 1996 the former Minister of 
Justice admitted something should be done to acknowledge victims 
of crime.  Talk is one thing; action is another.  That justice 
minister is now in health making more promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1997 when the current Minister of Justice was sworn in 
she too promised action.  In fact she said that victims rights 
were one of her top three priorities.  Almost two years later we 
see what kind of attention her promises and her priorities get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us face it.  Reform's fingerprints are all over Bill C-79. 
Too bad the government did not see fit to complete the job and 
include all of their commitments. Recommendations in this bill, 
Reform's recommendations and the committee's recommendations, 
will probably take at least another two or three years for this 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I just said, Bill C-79 is not complete.  The justice 
committee in its report called for changes to the Criminal Code 
as well as the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.  The 
latter was ignored in Bill C-79.  Sadly, victims of crime will 
have to wait for legislative initiatives in the area of 
corrections.  They will continue to have no right to participate 
in release hearings, to be advised of escapes, temporary absences 
or anything to do with corrections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is regrettable that the government can never complete the 
job.  It is as if it has a problem with acknowledging the total 
picture or is just too small to give others credit for their 
initiatives.  The only ones who lose because of the stubbornness 
of the government are the victims, as usual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we get in Bill C-79 after four years of hard work on 
behalf of the Reform Party and the standing committee made up of 
members from all parties? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims will now be informed of their right to prepare a victim 
impact statement at the time of sentencing.  This is a 
straightforward necessity which gives acknowledgement of the 
feelings of victims, a pure Reform Party initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims will have the choice to read the victim impact statement 
in court, another Reform initiative.  This is further 
acknowledgement of the victim in this criminal justice system 
that until now has abandoned them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-79 will protect victims of sexual assault or violent 
crime up to the age of 18 from personal cross-examination by 
self-represented accused persons, a most logical and sensitive 
way to treat the victim.  After all, who is accused here?

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-79 will compel police officers and judges to consider the 
victim's safety in all bail decisions.  That would seem to me to 
be something that should have been done a long time ago.  The 
victim's safety should be considered in all bail decisions. Until 
now the victim's safety was a passing thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incredible how such obvious acknowledgements took so long 
for the government to consider and change.  These things would 
not be changing today without the hard work of my colleagues in 
the area of victims rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judges will now be required to inform the public of the 
possibility of section 745 applications for early parole for 
those who receive life sentences.  This is welcome, but we all 
know what the ultimate position should be in the area of this 
scandalous and pathetic section 745. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, Bill C-79 will allow victims the right to present 
victim impact statements at section 745 hearings.  Again this is 
a move forward, but if it were not for this nonsensical and 
insensitive section 745 to begin with, we would not need this in 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-79 will allow victims and witnesses with a mental or 
physical disability the right to have a support person present 
while giving testimony.  Going to court is intimidating at the 
best of times no matter what side of the law one is on. At least 
this gives some acknowledgement to this ordeal, particularly for 
the victim.  It is a good move.  Again, it is in this bill 
because of pressure from my colleagues in the Reform Party over 
the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims and witnesses will now have protection through the 
banning of publication of their identity where it is necessary 
for the proper administration of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said in the last few examples, there are some positive 
initiatives in this bill and thankfully, acknowledgement of the 
recommendations of the Reform Party in this four year ordeal to 
get the government to move.  It is unfortunate that it has taken 
four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have one concern.  We plan to pursue the broadening of the 
definition of victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister touts the policy centre for the victims of crime as 
instrumental in a new strategy in acknowledging victims.  She 
contends that all federal policies and legislation will take into 
consideration the views of victims of crime.  We will hold her to 
that.  And we will.  If it becomes another federal sinkhole of 
rumination rather than action, we will not tolerate this 
indignity on victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members are aware, a victim surcharge is an additional 
penalty imposed upon offenders at the time of sentencing.  It is 
collected by provincial and territorial governments and used to 
provide programs, services and assistance to victims of crime 
within their jurisdiction.  Bill C-79 will make some changes to 
the application of this surcharge.  It will now be automatic to 
ensure it is applied consistently to all offenders.  That is 
fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new legislation will provide for mandatory minimum amounts. 
The new charge will be 15% of any fine imposed on the offender. 
If no fine is imposed, it will be $50 in the case of an offence 
punishable by summary conviction and $100 in the case of an 
offence punishable by indictment.  Over and above that, an 
increased surcharge at the discretion of the judge can now be 
imposed in appropriate circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have come a long way since 1996, but as I have said, not all 
the way with regard to victims rights.  It is regrettable the 
government could not bring itself to complete all elements of the 
all-party committee report.  This is not the first time. This is 
one of many bills that have come from the justice committee. 
Another is the Young Offenders Act for 10 year olds and 11 year 
olds. All parties in the committee requested it.  They did not 
get it. The committee had many meetings and hearings across 
Canada.  We did not get what the committee asked for.  This is a 
government run by bureaucrats, not by elected officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems a shame that we could not be here today having just 
once completed something in this House that a committee of all 
parties recommended.  The Reform Party will accept the work to 
date and will continue to work with the government to complete 
the task.  We will work hard to complete the task. 
Victims deserve closure and Bill C-79 brings them at least a few 
steps closer to that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party and specifically two diligent and determined 
members of my caucus can take solace today that their work 
culminates in Bill C-79.  I say congratulations to them for the 
great work they have done, not only for our party but for this 
parliament and for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to finish up by talking about an example.  I was home 
this past weekend and there was a story in the <I>North Shore 
News</I> about a drug dealer who in February was sentenced to 
three and a half years in jail.  The person was described by the 
crown prosecutor as a controlling mind who used six others to 
take the heat from him while selling cocaine to an undercover 
North Vancouver Mountie over 10 months.  All together in this 
case there were 13 cocaine transactions involving as much as two 
kilograms of cocaine costing $80,000 in this crime perpetrated by 
this Mr. Darmadi. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was arrested in September 1997.  He was released on bail on 
February 9 and a B.C. Supreme Court justice sentenced Darmadi to 
jail.  On April 21, less than three months after his 
incarceration in a federal jail, Darmadi will return to North 
Vancouver to visit his parents on an eight hour escorted leave. 
What about the victims of this gentleman, the people whom he got 
involved in crime with him? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a very short few months after receiving a three and a half 
year sentence he is home visiting with his parents.  Children and 
young people visiting with their parents is a very nice and happy 
thing but not for this type of individual.  It galls me when I 
see people like him, one of the most serious criminals in our 
country, getting treated in this manner and yet victims of crime 
do not have those same rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked earlier about some of the things that are not done in 
the bill.  Some of them are under provincial jurisdiction, for 
instance plea bargaining.  My hon. colleague used the case just a 
while ago of somebody sentenced to manslaughter instead of murder 
because of a plea bargain.  I know that is a provincial matter, 
but maybe we should be showing some leadership to the provinces 
in the House by saying that plea bargains should only take place 
where victims are concerned and victims should participate.  They 
would probably agree if they were able to sit down and go through 
what happened, but we ignore victims and that is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of corrections we moved to see changes with regard 
to release hearings and being advised of escapees.  We heard from 
the minister that it was maybe the solicitor general's department 
and he would bring in some legislation in those areas. They could 
have been included in the bill.  It seems strange to me that 
after all the work we have gone through there is still nothing 
which insists victims of crime be informed if somebody escapes 
from jail, especially in cases where there has been violence or 
threats have been made.  There is nothing in the legislation 
which allows that to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the committee has travelled across Canada and made 
recommendations in all these areas, we in parliament should not 
have to wait for another government bill somewhere down the line. 
Most of all, victims should not have to wait for somewhere down 
the line.  When a violent offender escapes from jail his victims 
should be notified right away by law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people involved in rape, murder and physical threats are 
going to release hearings, the victims of those people should be 
notified.  That is not in the bill, and that is not helping 
victims.  What would be worse than the victim waking up and 
reading in the paper that some vicious murderer or rapist just 
got released on bail after serving a short period of time?  The 
victim should have known about it.  There is nothing in the law 
which says that has to happen.  That is not right and that makes 
the bill not good enough.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will vote for the bill because there are some positive 
changes, but it does not encompass all the changes the committee 
recommended and that is the weakness of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure all Canadians that Her Majesty's official opposition 
and all its justice critics will keep on this issue to make sure 
the government moves it forward as fast as it can. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it has been 
interesting to listen to the debate today.  We are discussing the 
impact crime has on people who are the victims of criminals and 
criminal acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While my colleague was speaking I realized that pretty well 
every speaker had said something about sentencing as well as the 
rights of victims.  Although the bill does not address the 
question of sentencing, which is an entirely different matter, it 
seems it is one of the areas in which victims often feel greatly 
victimized because they lose so much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A rape victim, the family of someone who is murdered, the family 
of the person killed or severely injured by a drunken driver, all 
these people are victims.  It seems as if the person who 
perpetrates the crime gets away with a substantially inadequate 
sentence.  In a way that gets into the realm of the rights of 
victims to see that justice is done, to see that there is a 
penalty commensurate with the act which has taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague, the critic of the justice department for our 
party, have any insights into how it impacts on the rights of 
victims when they are victimized by criminals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think my colleague's 
question is one of the most important ones.  Part of the process 
involved in the youth criminal justice act was getting people in 
the room together, the victims and the people who committed the 
crime, to talk about what they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members who have been in politics for any period of time and 
have dealt with constituents will notice that whenever we get 
involved in issues of crime and hurt we wonder how they get 
closure and get on with their lives.  Under the system we have 
right now it is not easy for people to do that.  They do not feel 
they are part of what is going on.  They do not feel they have 
had their say or their chance to put forth what they think should 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes if we involve people, as we are to do with the youth 
criminal justice act, it works very well.  It has been shown over 
the ages that the more we can involve victims in the process, the 
better they can come to some form of closure and get on with 
their lives.  It is very difficult, especially when someone in 
the family is lost, when somebody is murdered or hit by a drunken 
driver.  How do they get over that?  It is not easy, but at least 
the victims could be part of the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not very difficult to make that happen.  All of society 
would be better.  They could get on with their lives feeling a 
little better.  They will never feel whole again because of what 
they have lost, but the fact that they can be part of the process 
will make them feel they did the best they could for the person 
who is gone instead of sitting on the outside and not being part 
of the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not do things in terms of parole hearings and 
releases.  My colleague has also raised sentencing.  These are 
issues the committee looked at.  The majority of members would 
agree these things should be in legislation.  I talked earlier 
about plea bargaining.  I know a number of these things are 
within provincial jurisdiction, but our country is not that big 
with a little over 30 million.  The Parliament of Canada could 
make recommendations to the provincial governments that the 
victims be notified of plea bargaining, sentencing, releases and 
parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is a member in the House who would not 
agree, if somebody has escaped from jail, a murder, rapist or any 
violent offender, that his victim should be notified.  We would 
all agree with that.  It is not here and it is unfortunate 
because it should be here. 
It shows the arrogance of a government that does not listen to 
its committees in the House of Commons.

that the committees in the House are not working properly and 
that members should be able to go to committee knowing they are 
doing what is best for Canada from their point of view from 
whatever region they live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with that member that parliament is becoming more 
irrelevant because of the dictatorial means of the government of

control of what goes on in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should be allowed to debate freely and openly and get 
their points of view across.  They should be able to go to a 
committee, which they did, and talk about doing something with 
the bill in the areas of sentencing, escapes and plea bargaining. 
All those things were discussed in committee.  Members from all 
parties agreed.  Yet there is not one mention of those items in 
the bill.  That is unfortunate.  That has to change before 
parliament changes for the better.

national organ registry of potential recipients, link this 
registry up with hospitals across the country and have a registry

patient's chart so a person can be asked to be a donor and have 
their wishes express to their family; third, have an organ

saying often repeated during the second world war: “Loose lips 
sink ships”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of the House need to be cognizant of the fact that 
what we discuss here can have an effect on the safety of our

</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of National Defence.  The

financial cost to the allies is enormous.  The Americans are

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

will seek, but the cost to this point in time in terms of the 
Canadian forces is approximately $32 million in incremental costs 
going back to the first deployment of the CF-18s.  However, there 
will be additional costs and there are efforts being put together 
now to get those numbers ready for members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to indicate that I appreciate the comments of the 
hon. member with respect to the well-being of our troops. 
Interestingly enough, I received some additional comments from 
citizens, for example, of Calgary.  This is addressed to the hon. 
member for Compton—Stanstead, the Conservative defence critic. 
He addresses the member by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your comments regarding soldiers in Kosovo are very dangerous and 
damaging to any ground troops that are undercover in that war.

<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the government has repeatedly assured us that there will be 
enough money for the Canadian forces to carry out their mission 
in Yugoslavia; however, it often does not provide enough details 
for any assurance and the estimates do not predict war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the Minister of National Defence tell the House how much 
the mission is expected to cost Canada and how much more new 
money is being set aside for our troops? 
<P><A NAME="LINK95"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are provisions for funds for 
special missions whether they be the kind of mission we are in 
now or other peacekeeping missions.  However, when we run out of 
those funds then we have to seek additional funds for that 
purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I think I indicated in answer to the previous question, the 
costs are not of an unreasonable nature at this point in 
time—those are the incremental costs—but certainly if 
additional funds are needed then these matters will be discussed 
in cabinet. 
<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
with 18 CF-18 fighters now in Aviano there will be an increased 
strain on both ground crews and particularly our pilots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation in the Canadian forces is that there is a shortage 
of fighter pilots.  With half of the combat-ready pilots now 
situated in Aviano, what measures is the defence minister taking 
to ensure that our borders at home are protected?  After all, one

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are endeavouring to add to our pool of qualified pilots, both 
jet fighter pilots and pilots of other aircraft that we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are bearing in mind that they need to be kept for other

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue,

the auditor general in regard to his report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, when the auditor general talks about the underground 
economy he is talking about both federal and provincial revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a voluntary compliance system.  We have one of the 
highest rates of voluntary compliance.  Ninety-five per cent of 
Canadians pay their fair share of taxes.  We also have an 
enforcement program which has resulted in $5 billion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the auditor general said that the government has an approach 
which simply is not working and that the federal treasury is 
losing $12 billion a year.  Again the government's solution is to 
hire more tax cops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the facts.  The auditor general said that in 1994 
a poll showed that 58% of Canadians would accept an offer to 
evade taxes when buying goods or services.  In a poll taken last 
year that figure had grown to 73%.  Fully three out of four 
Canadians said they would be prepared to evade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of hiring more tax cops to intimidate Canadian 
taxpayers, why does the government not find the real solution to 
the problem and provide Canadians with tax relief?

out of both sides of their mouths.  Members opposite stand in 
this House to say that we collect too many taxes, that we have 
too much revenue, and now they are saying we are not collecting 
enough taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is a balanced approach to ensure that we provide 
better service to Canadians and that we provide access to 
Canadians to improve voluntary compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government that reduced taxes by $16.5 billion.  We do 
not just speak about it, we do it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>NATO meets on Friday in Washington to discuss strategy on 
Kosovo.  Military options will be considered, but diplomatic 
avenues must be pursued as well.  Canada must use this

will Canada put on the table at the NATO summit? 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Canada has been promoting a diplomatic solution from 
the very beginning of the crisis in Kosovo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, we finally came to the situation where the 
Milosevic regime refused any adherence to the fundamental rule of 
law or any kind of agreement whatsoever.  Therefore, we had to 
opt for the enforcement of that rule of law and the protection of 
the innocent lives of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we will be supporting at Washington is the continuation of

committed on them by the Milosevic government.  That is why we 
are over there.  We are over there to help those people, to

taking refuge behind the “government to government” referred to 
in the Gautrin resolution.  There was government to government 
negotiation, which failed, I regret to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would like to see is for all of us to put the welfare of 
Quebec students first, the people who are entitled to loans and

refuse to negotiate an arrangement”.  The problem is not in 
Quebec City,  it is here in Ottawa, with the Minister of

it.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO COMMITTEE REPORT 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
question of privilege in regard to the leaked government response 
to the committee report on nuclear disarmament and 
non-proliferation of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade tabled in this House yesterday after 
question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you are aware, reports destined to be tabled in this House 
are confidential until tabled.  Yesterday before question period 
I was asked to respond to the government's response by three 
different journalists, one of whom had the report at noon, a full 
three hours before it was tabled in this House. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1505"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT62"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT62"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1505

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I had not seen the response, I waited until it was tabled 
in the House.  After it was tabled I had to wait over an hour and 
a half to receive a copy.  Journalists had copies of this report 
as early as noon yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I have done a number of items of research which I 
can make available if you require them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is common knowledge that leaked committee reports are in 
contempt of parliament. I would argue that leaked responses to 
committee reports are also in contempt of the House.  Since the 
government was responding to a request of the Standing Committee 
on Foreign Affairs and International Trade pursuant to the 
provisions of Standing Order 109, it was not at liberty to leak 
the information before it was tabled in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This action by the government demonstrates its total lack of 
respect for parliamentary systems. This leak represents a new low 
for this government, I believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not that long ago that the Minister for International 
Trade announced the creation of a Canada-China parliamentary 
association before the House had created such an association. We 
have other examples as well which I could list.  The Speaker 
ruled on some of these that it was a mockery of the parliamentary 
system.  Once again the government is making a mockery of 
parliament by tabling a report in the media that had been 
requested by the parliamentary committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the government by leaking the response to the foreign 
affairs committee deliberately diminished the respect due to 
parliament and parliamentarians.  It is no wonder there is a 
growing dissension among the ranks of the Liberal caucus who also 
indicated disgust in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government, if it is to survive, must respect parliament and 
parliamentarians.  It must respect its authority and grant its 
members dignity. Mr. Speaker, the government has offended both 
the authority and dignity of the House and the authority and 
dignity of members of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I ask that you rule this matter be a prima facie 
question of privilege. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on the same point of privilege.  You indicated that you 
were going to hear a point of order and that point of order would 
have been from me.  It was basically about the same matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there are really two questions here.  There is the 
question of the leaking of the government's response prior to the 
tabling of it in the House of Commons, which I think is 
reprehensible, shows contempt for parliament, and flies in the 
face of what I hoped was a growing consensus that there would not 
be the leaking of documents either in the form of committee 
reports or in this case in the form of government responses to 
committee reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My initial intention was to rise on a point of order having to 
do with the fact that the government, the minister's staff and 
others, whoever, were distributing copies of the government's 
response to journalists.  They had them available outside, I am 
told, and we in the House could not get a copy until an hour 
after it was tabled.  What kind of system is this where members 
of parliament are deliberately in a premeditated way kept from 
having copies of a report that is being made available to the 
media by the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government had not made it available and we all had to 
wait an hour, that is fair ball.  We all could have commented in 
the dark.  But the fact is that the government itself was 
distributing copies of the government's response to the committee 
report and did not have the decency to put some in the opposition 
lobby so that opposition members could see it. We asked our 
people to try to get a copy of the report, but oh no, we would 
have to wait to get it from the House; we would not get it from 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is at the same time as we have to listen to this sort of 
pious rhetoric day after day about how government members want to 
take parliament into their confidence, they want to have another 
take note debate, they want to show respect for parliament and on 
and on.  We just have to give them a little opening and their 
real attitude toward parliament shows up like a blinding light. 
That is the fact that they hold this place in contempt and have 
actually brought shame on themselves, not on parliament, by the 
way they conducted themselves yesterday. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have heard the very forceful 
representations from the House leader of the New Democratic Party 
as well as from the hon. member of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it did occur that way, I will endeavour to rectify any damage 
that was done. 
My understanding is that when the document was tabled in the 
House of Commons, yes, a few extra copies were left in the 
government lobby.  Perhaps they could have been split evenly to 
ensure there were some in the opposition lobby as well.  If that 
occurred, I will verify to ensure that it does not reoccur.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the additional proposition someone has raised to the 
effect that some were actually distributed to members of the 
media before the tabling of it, which is a different issue 
altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose the former is a matter of courtesy and that should be 
addressed as well.  The latter accusation, if I can refer to it 
that way, made in the House of Commons is to the effect that what 
is a cabinet document was leaked before it was tabled in the 
House.  That is far more serious.  If that occurred, I will 
verify that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the intention, I am sure, of the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, as he indicated to me a little while ago, to do anything 
to cause a slight.  I hope it did not happen and that this is not 
the case.  In any event, I will report to the House personally on 
this matter because I consider it serious as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have done my best around here and I think all hon. members and 
all my colleagues in cabinet will know as well have done things 
in a manner that encourages the co-operation of all hon. members 
in the House.  Hopefully my efforts in that regard will continue 
to be noted as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will report to the hon. member as well as to the House on this 
matter. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I think it is now eight or nine times I have been up in the House 
on leaked documents and the government proceeding to notify the 
public and members of the House do not even know what they are 
talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear comments from the government House leader like 
“endeavour to rectify” and “ensure that it does not reoccur”. 
That is what we hear time and time again.  We have sent the 
matter of leaked reports to the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs and the leak report has been leaked.  I can 
assure you, Mr. Speaker, it was not this person who leaked it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When politicians are leaking these things and taking 
irresponsible action as far as notifying the press before we get 
them, what has to happen is that the Speaker himself has to make 
some rulings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that two things occur here. First, we should 
make it somehow in the House so that it takes two-thirds of the 
members of a committee to vote to go in camera.  I think that 
would help the situation after looking at it seriously for some 
time now. I also think that some action should be taken in 
situations such as described here today.  There has to be some 
concrete action, not a referral to a committee but something more 
tangible, if we can get down to whether or not in fact the press 
had copies of that document ahead of the members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might remind the Speaker that on June 13, 1991 when the 
current Minister of Foreign Affairs was in opposition he 
sponsored a supply motion in the House which read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House affirm that ministers are individually and 
collectively responsible to the House of Commons for the 
activities of government including the management and conduct of 
the public service— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on and on and on.  The intent of the motion was to say 
that the ministers are responsible, even if their employees make 
a mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am at the point now where the topic of leaked reports quite 
frankly is not even of interest to bring it up in the House of 
Commons because nothing is getting done.  I for one am not the 
least bit concerned about sharing documents from committees with 
the public.  It seems like there is a rush for public knowledge 
and what happens is the first person to the media gets the hit. 
That is unfortunately what we have degraded to in the House.  It 
is very unfortunate indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope sincerely, Mr. Speaker, if we cannot deal with it as 
members of the House of Commons, that you will deal with it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I do not mean to belabour this point.  I think that 
the previous two opposition members, the House leader for the New 
Democratic Party, as well as the Reform Party, quite succinctly 
put forward the case.  However, I want to add the concerns of my 
party's members that we seem to be spinning our wheels on the 
issue of disclosure of documents, even prior to other members of 
the House of Commons having an opportunity to review them in any 
depth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader has given his assurance, as he has 
in the past, that he wants to deal with this in a straightforward 
way and that he will do his best, but that does not seem to be 
working.  It does not seem to be enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore upon you, in your capacity as Speaker of the House, to 
put forward some substantive action that will deter this type of 
behaviour because it really does degrade this parliament and 
individual members of the House when we see this happening time 
and time again with very little reprisal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am afraid that is what it is going to take.  There is going to 
have to be some serious intervention on the part of the Speaker, 
or on the part of a committee, where there is some sanction that 
is handed down and a message that is given and received before 
this type of behaviour is going to be stopped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would hope that members of parliament, members of the House 
of Commons, would respect that, but it does not seem to be enough 
to date, so I simply add those humble remarks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I believe this is the ninth time I am 
responding to the hon. opposition House leader who has intervened 
on the topic of leaked documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two points to be considered.  In fact, there are more 
than two points and I will deal with them as they occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Red Deer in his intervention did not mention 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  I was listening and he did not 
do so.  However, the government House leader mentioned 
specifically the name of the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  The 
name of the Minister of Foreign Affairs was mentioned again by 
the House leader for the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are at least two points that I want to deal with.  The 
first perhaps is a matter of courtesy.  The hon. member for Red 
Deer did not have a copy in the House when it was presented to 
the House.  Perhaps these things happen.  However, I would hope 
that matters of courtesy would be extended to all hon. members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. government House leader said, there may have been 
copies here.  If government members received copies, then there 
were copies here and the question is straightforward.  It is 
courtesy, but it is a bit of professionalism also that they 
should have been in the opposition lobbies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again we come back and say this should be done. 
This will be done.  This will be done, and we have gone far 
enough.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing is more important, which is that what was 
alleged here today is that there is a cabinet document which was 
released before it was supposed to have been released or tabled 
in the House.  That is my understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the hon. government House leader saying that he is going 
to come back with a report on this.  Either he will or the 
Minister of External Affairs will, but I would like to have this 
report brought to the House tomorrow and I want to deal with it 
at that time.  We cannot keep going around in circles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that the committee on procedure is going to table 
its report.  We gave it this problem and the report is supposed 
to be tabled either late this week or perhaps next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, we have to deal with what we have on our plate 
here.  I look forward with great interest to what the government 
House leader or the Minister of Foreign Affairs has to say about 
the alleged giving out of papers to the media outside the House 
when our own members did not have them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With your agreement, I am going to hold off on a decision, but I 
will take it up again tomorrow.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to join my hon. colleague's in debate on Bill C-79, 
which deals with victims of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an outstanding constituency assistant in my Duncan office 
by the name of Inge Clausen.  In 1981 Inge and her husband Sven 
had something happen to them that no one in this country should 
ever have to go through.  Their 18 year old daughter was 
murdered.  Today, if she had lived, she would be 33 years of age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inge and Sven have gone through the emotional anguish of being 
victims; victims who have very little real way to express their 
frustration, their anger and their hurt.  They are victims who 
have experienced the gamut of emotions, wondering what could have 
been if this terrible event had never occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, their daughter's murderer was eventually sentenced to life 
imprisonment with no chance of parole for 15 years.  Even though 
he has not applied for parole, because of section 745 of the 
Criminal Code Inge and Sven go through the everyday anguish of 
wondering if this madman will suddenly get out of prison and 
possibly reoffend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inge Clausen is an activist.  She cares passionately about 
issues that affect this country.  She did not sit in her grief 
and do nothing.  In 1981 she started an organization called 
Citizens United for Safety and Justice.  For many years she 
campaigned for the kind of legislation that has been introduced 
in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party, of which she was a member, had forcefully 
placed the issue on the national agenda.  However, by 1997 there 
was little government action.  Inge grew tired of the fight that 
her government would really do something about victims rights and 
she resigned from her position in the organization that she had 
created.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She had sixteen long years of remembering, of anguish, of lack 
of support from the various governments of the day.  That is what 
victims of crime have had to go through in this country for far 
too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a crime is committed, all law-abiding, peace-loving 
citizens are victims.  It is just that some of us are more 
victims than others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from members of my own riding of Nanaimo—Cowichan 
for far too long on this very issue.  Canadians have felt that 
their judicial system has looked solely at the criminal.  Too 
little time and energy has been spent in speaking with and 
listening to the victims of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims of crime are often double victims.  They are the victims 
of the initial crime and, as the wheels of justice move ever so 
slowly, they often feel that they have become victims of the 
system.  They become victims of the system when they feel that 
their rights are ignored while the accused has his or her rights 
upheld.  The victims feel that they have no right to speak out, 
no protection under the law, no protection from the injustices 
which have been placed upon them.  They become victims in the 
courtrooms and on witness stands all across the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is long in coming.  My hon. colleagues have 
worked long and hard to bring this issue before the government. 
It has taken far too long to bring the government's attention to 
this matter.  I thank all hon. members for the work they have 
done on this most important piece of legislation.  I congratulate 
the Minister of Justice for finally bringing this legislation to 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is important for us to recognize that although this 
is a government bill, it has come about due to the relentless 
pressure which the Reform Party has placed upon the government on 
this matter.  It is unfortunate, indeed, that it has taken this 
long to produce the legislation.  However, the legislation has 
made some strides.  I believe it could have and should have gone 
a lot further in a number of areas.  It is a start, but there is 
much more that needs to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall the hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford coming to a 
rally in Nanaimo during the previous parliament.  I do not recall 
the exact number of people who were in attendance, but that large 
auditorium was packed to standing room only.  What was the topic? 
The victims bill of rights.  My hon. colleague spoke 
passionately, just as he did earlier today.  Time after time the 
overflow crowd clapped and cheered with their agreement.  The 
constituents of Nanaimo—Cowichan are certainly very concerned 
about this issue and will welcome this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank the hon. member for Surrey North for 
the work he has done.  His story is the story of a victim and he 
has spoken clearly and eloquently on this matter.  My thanks go 
to him.  He is a man of courage and he is a man of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a long time victims have felt alienated by our justice 
system.  They have every right to feel this way.  Until now the 
system has aimed all of its resources toward the accused.  In the 
meantime, we have to remember that the victim was innocent of any 
alleged crime.  The victim did not ask to be raped, murdered, 
injured, robbed or violated, yet in many cases the penalty placed 
upon them is greater than the sentence passed on the accused by 
the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no feeling like the violation a victim feels.  For 
those who have had their homes broken into, the feeling is one of 
personal violation. 
They feel they have been dirtied by a criminal act.  How much 
more violated does the person feel who has been personally 
attacked?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's society in Canada is filled with victims.  Right now in 
the city of Victoria, British Columbia, family members of Reena 
Virk are living through their own personal hell as they listen to 
witnesses in the prosecution of the murder of their daughter. No 
matter how efficient the justice system is nothing will ever 
bring back their daughter.  My sympathies go out to them.  I have 
not walked in their shoes but I think I know how they feel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently in Nanaimo a young man was returning home from a 
hockey game.  As he drove under an underpass a 40 pound rock 
crashed through the windshield of his car.  Kevin Holmes, only 21 
years of age, was left with a fractured skull, five missing teeth 
and a broken collar bone.  He had to undergo facial 
reconstruction and doctors had to open up his skull to look for 
damage and bruising.  That was a senseless act of violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kevin Holmes did not even know the perpetrator and yet Kevin 
Holmes has become a victim of crime.  Reena Virk's parents and 
her family are victims of a senseless crime.  These people 
deserve justice also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been previously stated, the bill was far too long in 
coming.  The need is not a new one.  This need was brought to the 
attention of members of the House of Commons during past 
parliaments.  The previous justice minister for instance stated 
in 1996: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although steps have been made toward progress in recent years, 
they have been imperfect.  There remains a great deal to be done. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed there still remains a great deal to be done.  When the 
current justice minister was sworn in, in 1997, victims rights 
were listed as one of her top three priorities.  It has taken two 
years for this response.  I repeat that I am grateful for this, 
but in the words of her predecessor there remains a great deal to 
be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a lawyer.  I have never been a police officer, but I 
have been a pastor and counsellor for over 30 years.  During my 
time as a pastor and counsellor I met with countless people. Some 
of those people had been victims of various different crimes. 
Listening and working with these people were never easy. Their 
faces and their lives were literally filled with pain. Every day 
of their lives they remembered what had gone on in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What these people are looking for is peace, peace within their 
souls.  It is not easy to find peace in this world of ours.  We 
need to bring all our resources as Canadians, emotional, physical 
and spiritual, to help victims of crime finally come to terms 
with what has happened to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some things we need in the House that must come only 
by taking the partisanship out of it.  Sometimes we need to go 
well beyond party politics.  There is no doubt in my mind that 
society is not perfect.  Far from it.  Nor is the House perfect. 
However I would like to think there are some matters we can 
jointly come together on and resolve for the betterment of all 
Canadians, not just for scoring political points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that this is one of those important matters.  I plead 
with the House that as the bill goes beyond this point and into 
committee it will not disappear from the political agenda.

stronger and better.  Let us assure that victims of all crimes 
can look to their parliament, to their government and to this 
legislation to know that their concerns and their needs are heard 
loudly and clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I appeal to all members of the House to work 
toward making the bill stronger and workable.  I appeal to all 
members to ensure that it is dealt with as soon as possible.  Let 
us not let another 16 years pass so that people like Inge and 
Sven Clausen continue in their concerns and anguish because 
victims rights have not been taken care of.  It is too late for 
many victims of the past.  However it is not too late for the 
victims of today and tomorrow.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there has been a lot of debate today in the House on 
this topic.  There has been a lot of debate on a particular 
question, as well as many others, which has been made raised a 
number of times.  I am referring to the definition of victim as 
set out in Bill C-79. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague indicate whether or not he agrees with the 
definition spelled out in Bill C-79?  Or, does he think it is too 
restrictive and does not include enough people in the category of 
victim? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said in my speech, when 
a crime is committed every Canadian becomes somewhat a victim. 
When our standards of behaviour and morality and our laws are 
violated by anyone we all become victims in some sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately there are people who become more of a victim than 
others: the people against whom these crimes have been committed 
directly.  I am concerned about the definition of a victim in the 
legislation being somewhat restrictive.  As it continues in 
committee stage and we bring together some witnesses and other 
Canadians have a chance to participate in this dialogue from a 
democratic standpoint, I hope we will see that definition 
broadened.  I agree with the hon. member that it is too 
restrictive at this point. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to join in the debate on 
Bill C-79, the victims rights bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset I would like to do something I am not very 
accustomed to doing, and that is to give some accolades to the 
government on this legislation.  I see some shocked looks on the 
other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Periodically when I travel throughout the huge, wonderful and 
beautiful riding of Prince George—Peace River there is a 
perception that opposition parties always oppose.  Some of my 
constituents are quite surprised to learn that the Reform Party 
is the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look back at the legislation the government has introduced 
over the past five and a half year since Reform has been in the 
Chamber in any numbers, the Reform Party has supported the 
legislation about half the time.  It is somewhat surprising for 
Canadians to learn of that because their attention is always 
drawn to those times when we are in direct opposition to the 
government and speak out quite clearly, loudly and volubly in our 
opposition, stating our case as to why we feel the government is 
on the wrong track or perhaps does not go far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit of a unique situation for me to stand in my place 
today and say well done.  It is an important first step.  I am 
pleased that the government has responded.  It was certainly not 
in a timely manner, but it has finally brought forward the 
legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, I would like to take this opportunity to applaud 
the victims and the victims rights groups which have sprung up 
from coast to coast to coast in Canada over the past number of 
years because citizens themselves have seen the need for this 
type of legislation.  They have seen the need for legislation and 
laws that go well beyond what Bill C-79 does. They have seen the 
need to make some of the changes we see today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate as well some of the comments made earlier in the 
debate when Liberals rose in their places and actually recognized 
Reform and the work we had done in promoting the issue of victims 
rights.  A number of Liberal members that spoke during the debate 
referred to my colleagues from Langley—Abbotsford and from 
Surrey North and the work they have done over the last number of 
years in pushing forward the issue of victims rights and the need 
to make some very substantive changes to the way in which the 
courts handle the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will touch briefly on the bill and then I will use some of my 
remaining time looking at a couple of areas where I feel the 
government could go a lot further in recognizing victims and the 
importance of bringing forward legislation and programs to 
address their needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the bill do that we are debating today?  As outlined 
by a number of speakers from both sides of the House earlier, 
victims are now to be informed of their right to prepare a victim 
impact statement at the time of sentencing.  That is an important 
step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims will have the choice to read a victim impact statement 
in court.  They will have the right to present victim impact 
statements at section 745 hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims and witnesses will have protection through the banning 
of publication of their identities where it is necessary or where 
the courts feel it is necessary for the proper administration of 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judges will be required to inform the public of the possibility 
of section 745 application toward early parole for those who 
receive life sentences.  This is another very important step that 
has been missing from the present day legislation.  At the moment 
there is not a requirement on the part of judges to alert the 
public that certain convicted murderers may be getting out under 
section 745; in other words under the faint hope clause, early 
parole.  Police officers and judges will consider victims safety 
in all bail decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This change in Bill C-79 makes so much sense that one might 
remark on why it would not have been there previously.  That 
would be an excellent question and certainly, I am sure, a 
question that many Canadians would ask.  Why was the 
consideration of victim safety not written into the law 
previously in the case of individuals getting out on bail? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the outset, as far as it goes Bill C-79 is an 
important step forward and one that I am pleased to see is 
supported by all parties in the House.  I hope that it will 
receive speedy passage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to touch on a couple of other issues of importance 
to me personally, and indeed important to a lot of Canadians from 
coast to coast.  The first I would like to talk briefly about is 
conditional sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On many occasions in the past number of years Reform members 
have risen in their places and spoken to the issue of conditional 
sentencing.  It was contained in the old Bill C-41 in the last 
parliament.  Reform and other critics, and indeed a lot of people 
out in the real world, raised many concerns about Bill C-41.  One 
concern was that conditional sentencing may be used in cases 
where it would be inappropriate, in cases of violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time Bill C-41 was being debated we raised those 
concerns, as did others, and basically government members 
pooh-poohed them.  They said not to worry, that even though some 
of those crimes were not specifically exempted from conditional 
sentencing we would never see the day when that would happen. 
Conditional sentencing is meant for very minor crimes, such as a 
first time offender who puts some graffiti on an overpass, or a 
first time shoplifter.  We all know that young people, in their 
exuberance, might sometimes be led astray and do something 
foolish or stupid.  I am sure many people in the Chamber, if they 
reflect back far enough, will remember doing some silly things 
when they were young. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is certainly a place for conditional sentencing where, 
instead of people going to jail for specific crimes and being 
incarcerated, they would be let out under certain conditions. 
However, it was never intended that it be used in cases of 
violence.  Certainly that is something that Reform has brought to 
the attention of the government time and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditional sentencing under Bill C-41 became law in September 
1996 and was to be used as a tool by the judges.  Unfortunately, 
the very concerns that we and others have expressed during debate 
came to fruition when judges started using conditional sentencing 
in cases of violence.  The list runs into the hundreds and indeed 
thousands of cases where, I believe, the vast majority of 
Canadians feel very strongly, as Reform does, that it is being 
used inappropriately by judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently commissioned a national poll to see what people were 
thinking on the issue of conditional sentencing.  As the deputy 
justice critic, one of the roles I have with the Reform Party, I 
have been handed the task of trying to continue to raise the 
issue of conditional sentencing with the government. As part of 
that role, I wanted to see what the thinking of Canadian people 
themselves were in a national poll. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked three questions.  The first was:  “As you may know, 
judges are currently allowed to grant a form of conditional 
sentence where those convicted are given the opportunity to serve 
part of their sentence at home instead of in jail.  Do you favour 
or oppose this practice?”  This is pretty straightforward. The 
poll found that 23% of Canadians favoured the practice of 
conditional sentencing, 59% opposed it and 18% were uncertain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question in the poll was:  “Do  you think that those 
convicted of violent offences, such as manslaughter, kidnapping, 
drug trafficking, assault or rape, should be eligible for a 
conditional sentence?”  The people who felt that would be 
appropriate in some cases were:  yes, 13%; no, 84%; uncertain, 
3%.   Canadians very clearly had their minds made up on this 
second question.  They can distinguish between right and wrong. 
They can distinguish between where the punishment should match 
the crime.  They do believe that in those cases of violence and 
drug trafficking that the individual should do jail time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third question was:  “Would you support or oppose changes 
to the conditional sentencing rules that would make those 
convicted of violent crimes ineligible for a conditional 
sentence?”  Seventy-one per cent of Canadians supported 
ineligible, 21% were opposed and 8% were uncertain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the vast majority of Canadians, some 71%, feel it is 
right for the government to initiate changes, belatedly I would 
add, to this legislation and basically plug the loophole it 
created with Bill C-41. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As deputy justice critic, I am obviously going to continue to 
push this issue and mount a concerted campaign to get the 
government to see the error of its ways and initiate this change 
that is obviously supported by the majority of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Reform Party is always accused of dredging up the 
most horrific examples when we talk about justice issues, but in 
order for Canadians to understand the issue a bit better, I will 
cite a couple of the thousands of cases since September 1996, two 
and a half years ago, where conditional sentencing has, in my 
opinion, been used very inappropriately.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first case I will talk about very briefly is the Paul 
Gervais case in Orleans, not far from here.  He received a 
certain amount of local media attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I, along with one of my colleagues from Calgary, personally met 
with six of the young men who were involved with this.  Mr. 
Gervais plead guilty to sexual assault charges involving nine 
young men.  When I met with the victims, they told me they felt 
they had not only been victimized by Mr. Gervais, but that they 
had been revictimized by a system that let them down.  I had a 
tough couple of hours meeting with those young victims. They 
really questioned the benefit in them coming forward and 
ultimately having their so-called day in court only to find that 
Mr. Gervais received a conditional sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know one of my hon. colleagues just prior to my speaking 
remarked about that.  Victims feel that they are victimized 
twice:  first, by the criminal and the crime; and second, by the 
so-called justice system, or as some have taken to calling it, 
the injustice system in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the conditions of Mr. Gervais' sentence 
were ridiculous.  He did not have to serve a day in jail.  He is 
under the supervision of his wife and yet this is the very person 
who was aware that he had a previous conviction over 20 years ago 
for molestation of boys.  She knowingly allowed him to have young 
boys working with him in his shop.  Yet this is the person to 
whom the judge, in his infinite wisdom, turned Mr. Gervais over 
to, saying “Okay, instead of sending you to jail, we will send 
you home with certain conditions.  One is that your family must 
be responsible for you”.  They obviously failed in that 
responsibility before or these young boys would not have preyed 
upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An 11 o'clock curfew for Mr. Gervais was put in place.  He must 
be home by 11 o'clock at night.  When one looks at the case, all 
his offences against these young boys occurred during business 
hours at his shop.  What possible good will an 11 o'clock curfew 
do?  That particular case is being appealed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when I was asked by these young victims and by 
reporters about the case, my position was that it should not be 
up to the victims to try to lobby and pressure the crown counsel 
to appeal something that should never be in place to begin with. 
Why should the victims have to lobby the prosecutor to appeal the 
judge's decision in the sentence and to try to get an appropriate 
sentence so the individual can be sent to jail where he belongs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised a second case in the House as early as October 1996. It 
was one of the first cases brought to my attention of the 
inappropriate use of conditional sentencing.  It involved a young 
mother in my riding.  I cannot identify her because she still 
lives in fear for her safety and her life.  She was sexually 
assaulted in her own home by a former spouse.  The fellow drove 
in a drunken state to the town where she resides, broke into her 
home and raped her on the kitchen floor with the children home at 
the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To begin with, she thought that because the individual was a 
former spouse there was not even any point in her bringing this 
to the attention of the RCMP.  That is how much faith she had in 
the justice system and, as I relate the details, the House will 
find out why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally she charged her former spouse with common assault 
causing bodily damage.  It was only later that she decided to 
actually charge him with sexual assault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the judge's ruling, he said:  “In this case, I do not 
believe the evidence of the accused, nor am I left in any doubt 
by it”.  He found the accused guilty.  Obviously there was ample 
evidence to support the woman's story that she was indeed 
sexually assaulted and raped in her own home.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judge went on to say, in making his judgment: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that while society might have an interest in sending 
(Mr. X) to jail, it seems to me that the victim and her children 
might be better served by (Mr. X) serving his sentence in the community 
and continuing to pay child support. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine that.  Imagine the sense the victim had.  And we are 
here today to discuss victims rights.  Imagine what was going 
through her mind when she learned of the judge's ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next case does not deal with conditional sentencing but with 
another issue I feel very strongly about and on which something 
has to be done.  This was a very tough issue for me to deal with. 
It involved spousal abuse to the point where the young woman in 
question was beaten senseless and left in a vegetative state, 
which she is still in today.  I have had some conversations with 
her mother.  As a parent, I can only imagine the private hell 
this family endures every day as they try to care for Mary-Lynne 
Miller of Dawson Creek. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her common-law husband, Brad Neuman, despite a previous history 
of fraud, forgery, assault, impaired driving and of previously 
assaulting Ms. Miller with a knife, for which he served six 
months in jail, he assaulted her again and left her in a 
vegetative state.  However, because he threw himself on the mercy 
of the court and cried some crocodile tears, he was only 
sentenced to four years with parole eligibility after two.  He 
received four years for effectively murdering this young woman. 
For all intents and purposes, although she is still technically 
alive, she is in a vegetative state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will briefly refer to a couple of things I believe the 
government can do to correct some of these problems.  I put 
forward Motion No. 577 which stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in the opinion of this House, the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights be instructed, in accordance with 
Standing Order 68(4)(b), to prepare and bring in a bill to 
prevent the use of conditional sentencing in cases where someone 
is convicted of a dangerous crime including:  murder, 
manslaughter, armed robbery, kidnapping, drug trafficking, sexual 
assault, and all other classifications of assault including child 
and spousal abuse. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a vitally important first step.  Within the next couple 
of weeks I should be introducing a private member's bill in the 
House which will follow up on that motion and show how exempting 
those crimes from the use of conditional sentencing can be 
accomplished in legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing I did as recently as yesterday was introduce 
private member's Bill C-494 in the House which would bring a 
current program that does not have official status under the 
witness protection program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on at great length about the need for more reform on 
victim rights, but I see I have run out of time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very 
interested in what the hon. member is telling us today because it 
is so germane to the subject at hand.  I would like to hear what 
he wanted to say before his time ran out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from 
Elk Island for giving me the opportunity to perhaps try to finish 
my presentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a few quick statistics about the issue of spousal 
assault and domestic violence. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Statistics Canada, tragically there were about 75 
spousal homicides in 1997. Eight out of 10 victims of spousal 
homicide were women who were killed by a current or ex-husband. 
Over 60 women died in 1997 at the hands of their past or current 
spouse. That is what those hard statistics mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spousal killings are often preceded by a history of violence. 
Between 1991 and 1996 police officers were aware of previous 
domestic violence between the victim and the suspect in over half 
of all spousal homicides, 56%.  Homicides involving family 
members totalled 4,193. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an existing program to try and help those people where 
their lives are most in jeopardy, especially women.  There is an 
ad hoc program by the Department of Human Resources Development 
and Revenue Canada which I support.  But it does not have a 
legislative mandate and it does not have funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from an article that was in the Vancouver 
<I>Province</I> on Sunday, January 31, 1999. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, two federal government employees started New Identities 
for humanitarian reasons, said Liliane Binette, a spokeswoman for 
Human Resources Development Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“It's a very special process within HRDC and Revenue Canada to 
assist victims in real life-threatening situations wishing to 
establish new identities,” she said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it's not an official program, a handful of staff in 
provincial government vital statistics branches, police 
departments, and women's shelters know who to contact when they 
come across an extreme case of family violence...It's kept 
secret to protect the women and the staff who handle the cases, 
and to prevent against the possible abuse of the process by 
people trying to escape creditors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because it isn't publicized or official, there is no formal 
application process, explained Binette. They take only those 
women who are referred to them by police and shelters; women 
whose situations have landed them in hospitals, shelters and 
police interview rooms many, many times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada ensures their income tax history and child tax 
benefits follow them into their new lives without linking them to 
their past names; and HRDC provides them with a new social 
insurance number and transfers their pension benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who work on New Identities hope it will soon get 
official program status and some money. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the purpose of my private member's Bill C-494.  Its 
purpose is to try to give that very important program, which I 
certainly applaud and the initiative of the two employees, some 
official status and start to firmly address the issue of spousal 
abuse in the more horrendous cases at least. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
certainly share some of the views that were raised by the hon. 
member from the Reform Party.  We certainly know his ongoing 
concern for conditional sentencing. I have two questions for the 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the member not be looking at the fact that the Minister 
of Justice has asked the justice committee to study this issue? 
Should he not be helping the members of his party who sit on the 
justice committee to ensure that the justice committee does not 
have 100 private members' motions before it so that the committee 
does not have to deal with the private members' motions before it 
deals with conditional sentencing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the hon. member to help the committee expedite the 
work in terms of arriving at conditional sentencing and making 
some recommendations to the minister in terms of conditional 
sentencing and to bring amendments forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question I have for the hon. member has to do with 
family violence.  It was rather interesting that the member 
talked about statistics.  Does the member know how many of those 
women were killed by guns used by their spouses?  His party did 
not support the gun control legislation. When the member does 
bring those statistics forward, he should be talking about the 
type of violence that women face in society. The member should be 
supporting the government on initiatives such as gun control.

<A NAME="LINK206">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-79, an 
act to amend the Criminal Code (victims of crime) and another act 
in consequence, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
across the way for her two comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First was her comment to let the justice committee to which the 
justice minister has referred this matter do its work.  I refer 
her to the case of her colleague from Mississauga East who had 
private members' legislation referred to the justice committee 
only to have it completely trashed and torn apart by her 
colleagues and treated with total disdain.  I do not have a lot 
of faith, nor do Canadians, in the committee operation of the 
government.  That might deal with the issue of letting the 
committee handle it rather than trying to handle it in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the second issue she referred to, I would like 
to touch on what the courts said about conditional sentencing. In 
August 1997 the B.C. Court of Appeal stated “If parliament had 
intended to exclude certain offences from consideration under 
section 742.1, it could have done so in clear language”.  Even 
the courts are saying that the government should get off its duff 
and change the law to exclude those types of crimes from 
conditional sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last issue she raised was that because of the incidents of 
domestic violence and the amount of women who are killed by 
former spouses, we should support gun control.  The reality is 
that her government's gun control legislation, the registering of 
guns, will do absolutely nothing.  I cannot use unparliamentary 
language and I get pretty worked up about gun control, but it 
will do nothing to prevent those types of deaths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are things her government can do to help prevent those 
types of deaths.  I have outlined one and that is to give these 
women the protection they need under the Witness Protection 
Program Act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
honoured to represent the people of Elk Island in today's debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very solemn debate.  We are talking about issues of life 
and death.  We are talking about families that are grieved 
because they have been victims of crime.  Their children and 
loved ones have been hurt or murdered.  We also need to think of 
those who are family members of the persons who perpetrate the 
crimes.  I do not know whether many people have thought of it 
this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not mention specific cases but there have been a number 
of really difficult criminal acts committed in Canada over the 
last number of years, even since I was first elected in 1993. One 
of the most grievous ones was the young man, whose name I do not 
want to put into my mouth, who used the young girls he captured 
as sex toys and then found his ultimate pleasure by watching them 
die and videotaping it.  Many of us know him as Paul.  It was 
dastardly, unbelievable and totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have come to our parliamentary committee and have made 
presentations to say that they want some greater involvement. 
They want their rights protected when the law deals with the 
perpetrators of these crimes. 
I know there is a balance to be reached here.  Some of these 
families struggled for years in their search for closure.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of a young family in Winnipeg whose daughter was 
murdered in winter.  They did not find her for a number of weeks. 
When they did, she was in an abandoned shed.  She had been 
strangled and left there in the cold.  The murderer has never 
been found.  How that family has dealt with that is actually the 
subject of the book <I>Have you seen Candace?</I> I remember being 
grieved about that murder because my brother-in-law knew the 
family and spoke about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of other situations where people do unspeakable things, 
some so heinous that we do not want to even speak about them. 
There are other things as well that people do which are illegal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a day of celebration in the House for an accomplishment. 
There has been a little bit of a debate about whether or not 
this issue would be on the table here today were it not for the 
fact that the official opposition, and in our position as third 
party in the previous parliament, has been relentless in bringing 
this issue forward.  All governments prior to this one had never 
thought it an issue important enough to bring to this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very fact that it appears we now have near unanimity among 
all parliamentarians from all of the different parties to support 
this bill should give us cause to celebrate.  It is an advance we 
are making on behalf of all of the hurting innocent victims of 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party to which I belong is now 10 years old.  One of 
the things that attracted me to the Reform Party was its 
statement of principles.  One of them in justice which grabbed my 
attention was the fact that in principle, the expedition of the 
judicial system should be that of giving priority to the 
protection of the lives, the property and the well-being of 
law-abiding citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may be permitted to quote, and I know one of my colleagues 
was called on using a prop earlier today, so I am going to be 
very careful to hold this book so the camera cannot pick it up. 
No one can see the cover of the blue book from which I am 
reading: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports a judicial system which places the 
punishment of crime and the protection of law-abiding citizens 
and their property ahead of all other objectives. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is real novel, but it is what happened when our party in 
its formation listened to what we so affectionately call the 
grassroots.  Ordinary Canadians told us the administration of 
justice in this system is skewed in that the victims are dead 
last in terms of what concern is expressed by the justice system 
and the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues earlier today have reiterated the cases where the 
perpetrator of the crime has all kinds of counselling and help 
available while the victims of the crime have to pay for it 
themselves.  In many cases they cannot afford it and have to go 
without.  Those are the kinds of things we need to correct if we 
want to call ourselves a civilized law-abiding country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy this is happening here today. It is a step in 
the right direction.  It is one which is long overdue, 10, 20, 30 
years overdue. 
I am very proud to be a part of the process which has made this 
happen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Item C in our blue book, which again I will hold very carefully 
as I read from it, states that the Reform Party supports granting 
victims of crime official standing in court and parole hearings, 
and requiring courts and parole boards to review victim impact 
statements before sentencing.  To the greatest extent possible 
victims should be compensated by offenders for financial loss 
resulting from criminal acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the items in that part of our blue book will be adopted 
if the bill is passed, and we anticipate that it will be, and 
that is the use of victim impact statements.  I am very grateful 
that I have never had the experience of being the victim of a 
severe crime.  I have been the victim of minor crimes, but no 
major crimes.  I cannot imagine the feelings and the emotions 
that families go through when they deal with serious crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt in my mind that the action we are taking today 
of providing for impact statements and allowing victims to make 
the decision themselves as to whether someone will read it into 
the record of the court or whether they will present it 
themselves is a tremendous step forward.  Many people who are 
victims of crime will testify to the fact that they feel left 
out.  Their son or daughter is gone, has been murdered, abused or 
injured, and during the court proceedings they are relegated to 
strictly spectator status.  With this bill they will finally be 
heard.  Their story can be told.  It can be entered into the 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there are some judicial purists, maybe even some in the 
House—and I will be careful in which direction I direct my gaze 
when I say this—who would say “We ought not to be making 
judicial decisions based upon emotions; they should be based on 
facts”.  That is certainly true.  I do not believe that people 
should be convicted of crimes of which they are innocent simply 
because the crowd in the town thinks they have the right 
perpetrator and because of the high emotions of the time they say 
that the accused is guilty and they have their revenge.  Of 
course we do not want that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what this talks about.  The actual determination of 
the guilt or innocence of the person who is accused takes place 
before the victim impact statements are entered into the record. 
It is proposed that this be done at the time of sentencing so 
that the judge can take into account what the actual impact has 
been on the victims of this criminal act.  I think it is a very 
great step forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the second point, we also think that victims 
should be compensated by offenders.  This is one area in which I 
think we should do a great deal.  As far as I know, it is not in 
Bill C-79.  I may be wrong, since I am not an expert on this, but 
from the notes that I have gathered the question of compensation 
for non-violent crimes is not included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share a little knowledge that I have in dealing with 
young offenders, people who perform what we call petty crimes, 
but which to the victims are pretty serious.  I am talking about 
things like breaking and entering, robberies, sometimes 
vandalism.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should place into law the principle of restitution.  There is 
nothing more effective for a young person or any other person who 
has committed a crime to come to grips with and accept 
responsibility for what he or she has done than to have them sit 
down across the table from the person they have victimized, look 
them in the eye and say “Yes, I did it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked to people who have worked in the so-called 
restitution area with young offenders.  When young people realize 
how they have offended someone else, who at the time was a 
faceless non-entity but is now a real person, it can very often 
turn their lives around.  They realize that what they did was 
wrong.  They accept responsibility for it and they make some kind 
of a deal so they can provide restitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if this is the time for me to make a public 
confession of my criminal life.  I suppose I should tell the 
House about the one thing I did.  Maybe there were two, but I can 
only remember one.  It was definitely questionable, but it was an 
important turning point in my life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a youngster of probably 10 or 11 years old.  We lived out 
in the country in Saskatchewan.  We had some people living on our 
yard whom my family had sponsored to come over from the old 
country.  They were called displaced persons at that time.  Some 
thought that was a derogatory term.  I always thought it was a 
badge of honour, since they were survivors of some very difficult 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were about three or four of us young fellows.  I think I 
was the youngest of the group.  We went for a little bicycle ride 
out in the country and we came across an abandoned farmyard.  I 
do not know who started it.  I do not think it was me.  However, 
there was an empty farmhouse and there was gravel on the road. 
Gravel contains little rocks and little boys like to throw little 
rocks.  Much to my regret, when we left the yard there was not a 
single window left intact in that house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father is a very wise man.  He found out about it.  Even 
though this happened decades ago, it is as vivid as if it 
happened yesterday.  My dad said to me “We shall have to go and 
talk to Mr. Sawatsky about this”.  He was the man who owned the 
property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dad and I went.  I do not know what the other guys who were 
involved did, but I was involved.  I will not say that my father 
made me, but he told me “When we go there this is what you will 
do”.  We practised it.  When we got into the yard I had to look 
Mr. Sawatsky square in the eye and say to him “I am the one who 
broke your windows.  I am sorry and I want you to forgive me.  We 
will replace the windows and I will pay for them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That lesson I value highly.  I thank my father for doing that 
for me when I needed it.  Who knows, maybe he steered me away on 
that day from a life of crime.  If one starts there, who knows 
what will come next.  Forcing me to go face to face with the 
person whom I had wronged to ask forgiveness, admitting that I 
had done wrong and offering restitution, was exactly the right 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish we had more dads who would do that with their boys, and 
maybe their daughters.  We understand that there are now more and 
more young girls who are getting involved in some of these 
crimes.  I wish there were more dads who would do that with their 
boys; steer them in the right direction, teach them what is right 
and what is wrong, and show them how to solve it when they do 
something like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish that Bill C-79 would also include the principle of 
restitution as a way of dealing with crime. 
In this bill we are dealing mostly with victims of severe crime, 
and there is no way to restore a person's life.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the guys in Edmonton who a punched the eyes out of 
one of their victims.  There is no way that young man's vision 
can be restored.  He is blind for life.  His eyes are gone. There 
is no restitution available.  There has to be punishment for 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, for the smaller crimes, especially those committed by 
young fellows who are bored, we need to have those individuals 
face up to their responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I have a slightly novel approach to this.  As many 
people have said, we need to look at the prevention of crime.  I 
believe that starts when a youngster is approximately two days 
old and continues through their lifetime, through adolescence 
right up to adulthood. I believe that we should build morality 
into our young people.  Sometimes I hear, especially from the 
Liberals and the NDP, that poverty causes crime.  I do not buy 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was young we were very poor.  We did not think of robbing 
other people and getting into crime because we were poor.  I know 
that we need to do everything we can to alleviate poverty.  There 
is no doubt about it.  I am not arguing that.  However, I will 
not concede to a person that being less well off than someone 
else gives them the justification for crime, any more than it 
does for me and my children because we have neighbours who are a 
lot richer than we are.  That just does not wash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to get down to some really solid principles.  I am glad 
for the principles of justice which are contained in the Reform 
Party document.  There is a whole list of them.  I read only two. 
I would encourage all members of the House to get hold of the 
blue book policies of the Reform Party and read them.  They make 
eminently great sense.  That is one of the things that drew me to 
this party and that is why I am so very happy to be part of this 
process today because we are making progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate all members for what I expect will be unanimous 
support.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and 
Africa), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Elk Island 
has worked in education with young people for 35 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will know, I am sure, that the young people who commit 
serious crimes in or outside Sherwood Park are very small in 
number.  In Millwoods, the member will perhaps be interested to 
know, there were apparently 17 persons, a year or so ago, who 
committed most of the serious crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he give us the benefit of his advice as to what he would 
do with that tiny minority in Millwoods?  They are almost all 
young men.  What would he do to the young men in his constituency 
who commit so much of the serious crime in Sherwood Park?  As 
well, does he think that drugs are the cause of much of the 
crime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a very broad question 
which allows me to go off in almost any direction.  I would 
reiterate that, first, we need to make sure our young people are 
taught a system of morality which holds up and is consistent.  We 
have a moral void with all of this moral relativism in our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also worked for many years on a board which ran a camp for 
young people, children and families.  It was a great experience 
to get outdoors and go camping with these young people.  When I 
worked there I was young myself.  I am now getting on, by a few 
more years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that those are very important issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have many volunteers in my riding who work with young people 
in sports programs, camping programs and all of those things.  I 
think that prevention is absolutely mandatory.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to kick that into high gear.  We have flagged on it. Our 
families are struggling.  Many of them are in conflict because of 
high taxation.  Both parents have to work even though they would 
choose not to if they did not have to.  As a result our families 
are not as strong as they ought to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to those who actually commit the crime, what do we 
do with them after?  As I have said, we ought to hold them 
personally responsible, certainly if they are involved in things 
like trafficking in drugs which often happens.  This is one of 
the motivators of crime.  Many of our young people get hooked on 
different kinds of drugs.  Because the people from whom they get 
the drugs are not about to donate them, they go about financing 
it by break and enters and all sorts of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is perhaps a novel way of handling them, but I would get 
them out into the woods.  I would take them out to a camp; I 
really would.  I am not talking necessarily of a strict boot camp 
but there would be some discipline.  These young people would 
have to learn that there is an authority structure to which they 
have to submit themselves.  Otherwise we have chaos in the 
country.  We are all subject to authority.  They too are subject 
to authority.  The faster they learn that, the better off they 
will be and the better off we will all be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would provide work experience.  I know of a person who does 
this in his work with Manitoba justice.  They actually bring 
young offenders to a place where they are under their care and 
keeping 24 hours a day.  They provide work for these young men. 
They are chopping firewood.  They get to do things that are 
useful.  It gives them a sense of accomplishment.  They actually 
work for their food.  It is a great way of steering them away 
from the crime they have entered into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all cases there is not a perfect success rate, but they have 
at least as high a success rate as the ones who simply go to 
prison and learn from the pros. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would do well in the justice systems in the different 
provinces if we expand the use of smaller groups such as that. It 
probably would not cost as much as running our prisons and we 
would have a much higher degree of success.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member for Elk Island made reference in his comments to a young 
girl who went missing a number of years ago.  It turned out that 
she had been murdered in Winnipeg.  The young girl's name was 
Candace and a book was written about her.  I would like to 
acknowledge the mother who actually wrote that book, Wilma 
Derksen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wilma has been very active in the last number of years dealing 
with victims of crime and in the whole restorative justice 
process.  Coincidentally, and I know we are not supposed to use 
props, I received in the mail today the publication by her 
organization dealing with victims and reconciliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member's comments and thoughts on restorative 
justice and victim-offender reconciliation, especially in cases 
of less serious crimes where the offenders come face to face with 
their victims and get to understand who their victims are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think this works best at a 
younger age.  At the beginning of my speech I said that the 
training of a young person to be a law-abiding citizen begins at 
age two days.  Maybe we waited too long, but I think it is a 
lifelong thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember seeing a poster many years ago of a tree with one 
branch that was really crooked.  The tree was beautiful except 
for that one branch and the caption read “As the twig is bent, 
so grows the child”.  When we talk about restorative justice, I 
think the example I used from my own life illustrated that.  I 
believe we have to captivate young people as early as possible. 
If we train them throughout life, both by word and by example in 
the family, in the school and in the church, to be moral, to put 
the needs of others ahead of their own and to be unselfish they 
will not grow up to be criminals.  If they do make their own 
decisions later, the earlier the better to catch them and provide 
the opportunity for restorative justice, for restitution, for 
facing their victims and for giving them some solid role models 
to follow at that stage.  I am absolutely convinced that is the 
way to reduce it, but I do not think we will ever get away from 
it entirely with human nature having a bit of a bad streak in it.

more and more serious crime.  When an individual is found to be 
incorrigible we have an obligation, as stated in the principles 
of the Reform Party, to protect law-abiding citizens.  If there 
is one who just will not obey the rules and who is doing worse 
and worse things to other people, to their person and to their 
property, we have to use that part of the law which restrains the 
evil doer.

that the government will listen to the many eloquent suggestions 
they have been putting forth for a long time and that it will

Many years ago the Liberals, not the current group but the 
previous group, decided to make a change in the way they dealt 
with justice.  Their view was that no longer would the justice 
system be primarily responsible for or have as its primary goal 
the protection of innocent civilians.  According to the Liberal 
government of late seventies-early eighties the primary role of 
the justice system was the rehabilitation of criminals.  We want 
to change that around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Reform Party believe the primary role of the justice 
system is to protect innocent Canadians from being victimized. 
That is not to say we want to ignore those who commit crimes. Far 
from it.  The member for Elk Island eloquently mentioned the need 
for early prevention from the time a person is born. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest we need to work before that for some very 
pragmatic reasons.  How do we do this?  We are dealing with Bill 
C-79 and the issue of victims rights.  Victims have rights and 
for too long those rights have been pushed down by a system that 
supports the rights of the condemned over the rights of the 
victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are good parts in Bill C-79.  There are parts about the 
right of the victim to put forward a victim impact statement and 
very importantly for the victim to have choice of whether or not 
to say it or to introduce it as a piece of paper.  We applaud 
that as it is something the Reform Party has been pushing for, 
for a very long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want to see a way in which victims can know things about 
when the person who violated them is getting out of jail, where 
the person is going, and what conditions are being placed on the 
person.  To my knowledge that simply is not happening right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine rape victims finding out by chance or down the line that 
the person who violated them has been let out of jail.  They do 
not know where the person is or where that person is going.  They 
look over their shoulders hoping and praying the person is not 
after them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the reality of the lives of many people who have been 
victimized and the government needs to change it.  It needed to 
change it yesterday but having failed to do that it needs to 
change it now.  Many times my colleagues, as well as members of 
the Liberal government and members of the other political 
parties, have presented constructive solutions to change this 
gross inequality in our justice system.

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also believe in the concept of restitution, that those who 
have committed a crime should do restitution to those who are 
victims.  That would send a very clear message to the criminal 
that he or she we will have to pay the victim and society many 
times over the cost of the crime.  The concept of restorative 
justice is a good one and one that we will support the government 
in pursuing when and if it chooses to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of protection of victims too is important.  Right 
now we have a justice system that sentences people to a certain 
amount of time.  Do the people serve that time?  No, they do not. 
Not even for first degree murder do they serve the full sentence 
they are given.  For everything but first degree murder people 
can be eligible for parole after serving one-sixth of their 
sentence.  They are condemned, convicted of a serious offence 
such as attempted murder or rape, sentenced to 12 years, serve 2 
years and released on parole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of message does that send to the criminal element?  It 
says if they commit a crime they can get away with a minimal 
penalty.  If we look at the two years that can be served in jail, 
the person who has been victimized will be paying the penalty of 
that and suffering long after two years are over.  They will pay 
the price of their victimization long after the person who 
committed the crime is out on the street.  What can we do?  My 
colleagues have mentioned many constructive suggestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk for a moment about the offender because therein lies 
a number of failures but also a number of opportunities to engage 
in some proactive issues.  When I worked in jails I found that 
many of the people there had unfortunately not had treatment. The 
resources were not there to treat the underlying problems of why 
they were in jail in the first place.  Their drug abuse and 
psychiatric and psychological problems were not being treated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result we see a door that goes around and around with 
people being convicted, let out and convicted again.  We do not 
break the cycle of crime, punishment and incarceration that 
condemns many people to a life that we would not want.  I would 
argue that they do not want it either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are things we can do.  I draw the attention of the 
minister to the fact that the people who are doing the 
psychiatric treatment and educational training are not getting 
the support they require. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore there is not an obligation on the part of criminals 
to engage in the activities that will prevent them from 
reoffending.  They are essential but they are optional.  We need 
to make it absolutely mandatory that if criminals ignore the 
required treatment for them to break the cycle of crime, 
punishment and incarceration, five-sixths of their sentences is 
not automatically removed on the basis of good behaviour to which 
they have not been committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a system where people will have their sentences reduced 
for good behaviour if they engage in good behaviour and not 
because it is automatic.  They have to engage in the treatment 
required, the educational options to be employable when released, 
and the drug training and drug treatment programs that are 
necessary for them to break the cycle that contributed to their 
being in jail in the first place.  Then they can have time 
knocked off for good behaviour, say a third of the sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For heaven's sake, five-sixths of their sentence should not be 
knocked off just to have a revolving door and turf people out of 
jail because there is not enough room.  If there is not enough 
room and a person is a danger to society, I guess we will have to 
build more prisons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to divide the prison population up into two groups: 
violent and non-violent.  There is no way non-violent 
individuals, those who are not career criminals, should be stuck 
in with the violent criminals.  Those who are not career 
criminals who made a mistake should have other options for 
serving their time.  As I mentioned before, restitution is one of 
them.  Treatment is another option that they have to engage in. 
Hopefully when they get out they will have kicked the drug habit, 
had the psychiatric help they required and be employable and 
functional members of society. 
Only then can we save our system a lot of money and also save 
other people from being victimized in the future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to look at the police.  We saw recently a report 
from the exiting chief commissioner of police in Vancouver who 
lamented very clearly the fact that we have created a revolving 
door in our justice system.  He despaired not only for himself, 
but more important for the men and women in uniform who serve and 
protect our communities.  The police are being demoralized in 
part because they do not have the support of the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice system is not giving the penalty that is appropriate 
for the offence. As a result, the police wonder why they are 
putting all their work and effort into getting a conviction when 
the justice system is not giving the penalty.  Many career 
criminals think it is a joke for obvious reasons.  That has to 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to support the police as they support us and that 
includes that the justice system attach the penalty that fits the 
crime.  If you commit a violent offence, if you are a repeat 
offender, then you are going to meet the full force of the law. 
For others, there are different options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP do not have the resources to do the job.  They had to 
close down their training facility.  They do not have the money 
for overtime to engage in the prosecution.  They do not have the 
helicopters they require.  They cannot even fix their patrol cars 
because there is not enough money.  How can we have a justice 
system when we cannot support it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice does not come unless we have a police force to support 
it.  If we do not have a police force, then we approach anarchy. 
Nobody in the House, no law-abiding citizen in the country wants 
anarchy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hands of the police are tied on how to deal with organized 
crime.  Organized crime is massive in this country.  The police 
lament that the government has not given them the legislative 
tools to deal with organized crime, which has a huge penalty for 
our entire country. We need to do that.  We need to give police 
those tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what has happened historically in the amount of 
time that is required to achieve a conviction.  The amount of 
work police officers have to put in is far greater than what they 
had to do 10 years ago because of the hoops and the loops the 
government has put in their way. We do not want sloppy police 
work, but we want to give the police the ability to do their job. 
Why put in numerous unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the Minister of Justice to look at the justice 
system, look at the hoops the police have to go through.  Remove 
the unnecessary hoops and keep those that are necessary for the 
rule of law to be upheld. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Elk Island articulated the issue of prevention 
very clearly.  A few weeks ago I was working as a physician and I 
came across a patient I had seen in the past. She was one of 
three girls I had treated in the past.  She was the last one that 
I had seen recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She was 13 years old when she was put on the street by her 
mother to prostitute to get the money to pay for her mother's 
drug abuse habit.  I was quite surprised that she was alive.  I 
did not expect her to be alive because I had seen her a few years 
ago. She came into where I was working with track marks up both 
arms, some were infected and some were not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The life she has been living is remarkable.  It is a life that 
nobody in the House would want for anybody.  She has been 
engaging in a great deal prostitution in part to support her 
mother's drug habit, but also to support her own.  Like many 
other drug abusers she is spending between $200 and $500 a day on 
drugs. 
I asked how she was getting the money when she was unemployed. 
Prostitution and other criminal activities such as break and 
enter is the price society pays.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation did not materialize for this little girl as a 13 
year old.  She came from a tragic environment.  I had met her two 
other friends a few years ago.  I saw treated them in jail. They 
were 14 and 15 years old at the time.  They had already been on 
the streets prostituting for a while.  They were IV drug abusers. 
After examining them both I told them they would not see their 
19th birthday.  They laughed and giggled and said they did not 
really care because they were having fun. I was wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was reading the newspaper a couple of years after and one of 
the girls had been found dead on the side of a lonely road, 
murdered while engaging in another trick. A year after that I 
found her friend.  I was walking through a pediatric ward and I 
saw her there.  She had had a massive stroke in her teenage years 
from shooting up with IV cocaine. This is not uncommon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we examine the history of these girls and many of the people 
in jails, both adults and juveniles, we see a history oftentimes 
marred by improper nutrition, violent sexual abuse, and the 
witnessing of violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In up to 50% of the cases in adult jails, many of the people 
suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome or fetal alcohol effects.  It 
is the leading cause of preventable brain damage in our country 
today. It is a silent epidemic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average IQ of these people is 68.  They have a great deal of 
difficulty with cognitive functions and basic processing in their 
brain.  When they attend school they cannot function properly 
because their brain is irreversibly damaged.  There is no going 
back.  They become isolated within school and act up. They engage 
in behaviour that puts them at the periphery of society. As they 
get older they often but not always engage in illegal activities. 
Then they end up in front of our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if we could prevent that?  What if we could prevent that 
person from having brain damage?  We can and need to do it.  We 
must do it.  No longer can the epidemic of fetal alcohol syndrome 
be buried under the carpet and considered as something that 
affects people out there. It involves whole communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember flying in a chopper last year to an aboriginal 
reserve to do a clinic.  I would venture to say that perhaps 25% 
of the people I saw were suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome or 
fetal alcohol effects.  One-quarter of the people on the reserve 
had it.  That is a guess but that is approximately the number of 
people I saw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people can never engage in being cognitive, interactive 
people in society.  It is very difficult for them to do that. 
How do we prevent it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Labour and her husband started the Moncton 
Headstart Program in 1972.  It was a leader in its field. 
Essentially they wondered how they could prevent children from 
running afoul of the law.  How could they make them the best 
citizens possible? How could they change the course of their 
lives from what their parents had, which perhaps had been a life 
of crime, a life of poverty?  How could they put them on a level 
playing field with others? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially they worked with prevention.  The parents and the 
children were brought together to strengthen the bond.  Bad 
parents were taught how to be good parents.  They were taught 
simple things such as disciplining a child.  They were taught 
proper nutrition and the fact that a can of coke and a bag of 
potato chips is not good nutrition.  The parents were taught how 
to engage in proper discipline, how to set boundaries, how to be 
a good parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recently saw reports in the newspapers about studies that had 
been done.  These studies looked at 1,600 random samplings of 
parents.  Nearly 70% of those parents did not know the basics of 
good parenting.  Seventy per cent across a wide spectrum of 
socioeconomic groups did not know how to be good parents. This 
may seem subtle but the impact on the future of our society can 
be dramatic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Moncton Headstart Program has been profoundly effective at 
reducing teenage crime rates, teen pregnancies and keeping kids 
in school longer with less dependence on welfare.  There is a $6 
to $7 saving for every dollar invested.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same held true in the Perry Preschool program in Ypsilanti, 
Michigan and the Hawaii headstart program. The Hawaii headstart 
program used trained volunteers to work with families and saw a 
99% drop in child abuse rates. The findings in Moncton were shown 
again in the Michigan program which has a 30 year track record of 
early intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been trying to get the human resources development 
subcommittee to deal with this issue.  It is studying children at 
risk right now.  Let us look at implementing a national headstart 
program using existing resources.  Have the feds take the 
leadership role by working with the provinces to prevent these 
things from occurring.  There is a track record of prevention. 
There are pragmatic doable solutions which we can employ now. 
What a great thing if the House could do that for the children of 
this country.  We can and must do it for all the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked that the House pass a motion calling for a national 
headstart program last year.  I implore the minister to work with 
her provincial counterparts to deal with this.  I implore the 
subcommittee chairman to deal with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together we will be able to build a program, not just for the 
poor at risk, but for all parents.  This cuts across 
socioeconomic grounds.  Even children from affluent 
neighbourhoods and affluent households who are latchkey kids and 
who do not have appropriate parenting need the love, care and 
security that all children require.  As we all know money and 
material things are no substitute for love, care and security and 
a secure home. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and 
Africa), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I salute the member on his 
intervention.  There was not a word that he said that I disagreed 
with.  In fact I enthusiastically support everything he said as I 
am sure many members around the House do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not so long ago a doctor in Edmonton told me he feels that about 
15% of the babies born in one of our Edmonton hospitals will be 
essentially unemployable because of fetal alcohol syndrome. Would 
a national headstart program deal with that or would the member 
see separate ways of trying to deal with the scourge of fetal 
alcohol syndrome? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, although the secretary of 
state is responsible for Africa and Latin America, he has written 
many extremely articulate and informative articles and has been a 
leader in the House on the issue of early prevention.  He 
deserves a great deal of credit.  I have tried to use many of his 
ideas because they are just plain good.  They are great ideas.  I 
thank him for his long term involvement in this issue.  He has 
been a true national leader on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secretary of state's intervention is good.  The solutions 
that have been employed in Alberta can be lessons to be learned 
and employed across the country.  Much of that has been used in 
other headstart programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping that this will be a national program.  I envision 
that three sections can be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is to use the medical community at time zero.  All 
women go to their doctors during the course of their pregnancy. 
This would be an ideal opportunity to address prevention for FAS, 
nutritional aspects and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is to use the trained volunteer model which is used 
so successfully in Hawaii.  It usually involves women who are 
good parents and who can act as mentors to families at risk and 
other families.  They can teach people how to be good parents. 
We have seen the need for that in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last, we could use the schools from kindergarten to grade two 
like the example used by the Minister of Labour in her Moncton 
Headstart Program.  We can bring parents and children into the 
schools to learn the basics of parenting and the importance 
child-parent interaction.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is to the member who spoke eloquently and made some 
good points.  There is one area in which I need some 
clarification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke compellingly about the head start program.  We know 
that in the head start program there is discretion.  He said that 
there is no financial cut-off.  For example, one cannot turn away 
children from affluent communities because oftentimes they need 
guidance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member spoke compellingly about his role as a 
physician, about three girls who came to see him, about his 
treatment of patients, which requires discretion, and certainly 
the discretion of a good physician to be able to examine his or 
her patients and come to a conclusion about what is the best 
treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he would feel, as would most practitioners, that it 
would be wrong to legislate what a physician has to do.  For 
example, when prescribing drugs, that they must or must not 
prescribe certain drugs, depending upon how they see the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about parole eligibility.  I know that he 
wanted to be clear on this.  He said that an individual who is 
sentenced to 12 years only serves two.  I think what he meant was 
that they have eligibility for parole at the end of one-sixth of 
their sentence, which is different from saying that they would be 
released.  They are eligible to apply to a board which would 
exercise its discretion in determining whether that offender has 
changed or met certain requirements; the same discretion that he 
would exercise as a physician or the same discretion that those 
who run the head start program would exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely he agrees that the parole board should have that same 
discretion to make those judgment calls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, indeed, the parole board 
must have that discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a person commits a crime and is sentenced, being eligible for 
parole after serving only one-sixth of their sentence is, in my 
view, far too little.  That contributes to the lack of confidence 
that our police forces have in the ability of the justice system 
to support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that we should toss people in jail and throw 
away the key.  As I mentioned in my speech there are two groups, 
violent and non-violent.  Perhaps I should say violent, career 
criminals and non-violent, non-career criminals.  I think they 
should be treated very differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying is that a sentence should be reduced on the 
basis of a person's ability to meet requirements such as the 
treatment of drug addiction, obtaining psychiatric help or 
demonstrating appropriate behaviour within the context of the 
institution in which they are incarcerated.  If they fulfill 
those requirements, then the parole board would be able to 
exercise its good judgment in determining whether that person 
should or should not be released. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I very much 
support the comments of my hon. friend opposite in terms of 
prevention.  Of course, prevention costs money and I hope he 
garners the support of his colleagues to undertake a major 
program across this country.  I think we would save money in the 
end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the issue of prevention, as we were debating 
this bill in the House today I noticed that at Columbine High 
School in Denver, Colorado, 20 students had been shot and the 
people doing the shooting still have not been apprehended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other examples in the United States, and of 
course the tragic example we have in Canada of what happened at 
the École Polytechnique in 1989. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Keeping in mind the emphasis on prevention that the member was 
talking about, surely he would want to support, as CAVEAT has 
asked us to do, as well as victims' groups, gun control 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the hon. member's comments on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will briefly answer 
three questions. 
The first question concerns prevention.  We can use existing 
resources to engage in prevention.  There is a smattering of 
organizations across the country which are engaging in 
prevention.  If the minister would ask her provincial 
counterparts to come to the table, tell her what is working and 
what is not, toss out what is not working and keep what is, that 
would force the provinces to rationalize their programs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member mentioned, it costs $95,000 a year for a youth to 
be incarcerated and $60,000 for an adult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of gun control, the Reform Party is firmly in 
favour of good gun control laws.  We are in favour of the 
firearms acquisition certificate.  We are in favour of having 
checks on people.  We are in favour of having a delay period.  We 
are in favour of a course, which gun lobby groups are in favour 
of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are not in favour of is gun control legislation that 
will cost money and not have an effect.  On that point, it is the 
gun registry that will do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be very careful that if we are going to put money 
into a program we ensure that the money we are putting in, with 
the limited resources we have, will have more effect than where 
we are taking it from.  It is called economic cost.  If we are 
going to put money into gun registration, we had better be 
certain that the registry is going to make our streets safer, 
save people's lives and save money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that gun registries do not work.  The government is 
now finding this out.  The Reform Party has said for a long time 
that the millions of dollars that are being put into the gun 
registry could be better spent on something else.  I had this 
conversation with members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 20 years the number of people who have been killed 
with legal handguns is five per year.  Should we spend $50 
million, $100 million or $200 million to save five lives, when if 
we move it out of the justice system to somewhere else it could 
cost a hundred or two hundred lives because of rapists who are 
allowed to walk and murderers who are not arrested? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reason we oppose it.  It is not because we are 
against the registry, it is not because we are in the back pocket 
of the gun lobbyists, but because we want, like the government, 
to have the safest country possible.  That is why we are opposed 
to it.  However, we are in favour of the good gun control rules 
that we have in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak today on behalf of my riding of Edmonton East 
to victims rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to compliment the minister on the comments she made in 
the press conference which clearly gave recognition to the Reform 
Party for its efforts in pursuing changes to address victims 
rights.  I extend congratulations to my colleagues from Surrey 
North and Langley—Abbotsford.  I also want to thank the minister 
for her very frank statement that this is not the end of victims 
rights reform but just the beginning, as we all explore better 
ways to address the issues and concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with this in mind that I wish to speak about serious 
concerns of victims and potential victims of a recent heinous 
phenomenon, home invasions.  Does this bill address the concerns 
of these victims?  Not nearly enough.  It contains only very 
minor rejigging of procedure.  While the bill is desirable, it 
falls short of real reform to address the concerns of these 
victims, let alone being a serious deterrent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad commentary on our society when police must advise us 
never to open our doors unless we can see who is knocking and 
unless we know who that person is.  As the police reported in one 
Canadian home invasion, the victim made that one mistake.  He 
opened the door because he could not see who it was through the 
peephole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone at any time can be the victim of a home invasion.  The 
elderly are described as the victims of choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been at least seven home invasions in Edmonton so far 
in 1999, resulting in serious injuries.  There were only 10 in 
all of last year.  They terrorize the occupants and expose them 
to the traumatic experience of forced entry with the intent to 
hold the occupants hostage.  People are the target of home 
invasions. Victims are tortured into giving up property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee the Reform Party, with the support of other 
opposition parties, asked the federal government to study this 
growing problem as it affects citizens in what should be their 
safest place, their home. 
The hon. member for Winnipeg South said that the idea was silly 
and not worthy of government concern.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would fully support any study that would help to ensure the 
safety of Canadians in their own homes.  I would also remind the 
hon. member for Winnipeg South that one recent home invasion I 
read about took place in his own riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police say that we can combat home invasions by knowing our 
neighbours.  Since most home invaders are caught due to phone 
tips, much more is needed now and not later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code needs to be amended to provide tougher 
sentences for people involved in home invasions, and even better, 
to create an entirely new offence of home invasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present most home invaders are charged with breaking and 
entering.  Convicted offenders often do not go to jail.  Multiple 
charges associated with home invasion are plea bargained away or 
have sentences concurrently served with other charges.  In short, 
no additional punishment is given for home invasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Exceptional crimes require exceptional measures.  We must raise 
the price of home invasion to properly reflect the heinous nature 
of the crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A while ago in Edmonton three young offenders broke into the home 
of victim Barb Danelesko and knifed her to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the seven home invasions this year have yet to result in 
any deaths, I consider that luck more than anything.  Home 
invasions are typically brutal and intrusive like no other crime, 
with hostage taking lasting for hours at a time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been at least seven home invasions in Edmonton so far 
in 1999.  In January a 55 year old victim was hospitalized with a 
gash to his head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January, on an Edmonton Sunday afternoon, masked gunmen 
charged through an unlocked back door of a home looking for 
drugs.  They took money.  The police called it home robbery 
rather than home invasion, although I cannot see the difference, 
and neither do many of the police officers who say that home 
invasion should be a separate offence under the Criminal Code in 
order to track the magnitude of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February of this year an Edmonton family was victimized and 
terrorized, tied up, and their home was ransacked by two gunmen. 
In February another Edmonton family was held hostage in their 
home for 16 hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March an Edmonton victim was cut on the hand and head when he 
struggled with armed robbers committing a home invasion.  In that 
case police are looking for three suspects in their late teens to 
early twenties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March, in Camrose, police arrested two youths, aged 16 and 
17, in connection with the home invasion of a 69 year old victim 
the previous December.  In her own home the woman was knocked to 
the ground, her face bruised by a masked intruder who broke in 
and stole various items.  Robbers do not wear masks if they 
expect nobody to be home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Vancouver police believe that since 1995 two or three people 
have been responsible for the invasion of 31 homes occupied by 
the elderly, with 13 or almost half of these home invasions 
occurring in the last four months.  During one of these home 
invasions a 79 year old victim was murdered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Melfort, Saskatchewan an 80 year old victim died subsequent 
to a home invasion on Christmas Eve, 1998.  The man was beaten 
and tied after answering his front door and lay on his living 
room floor for 18 hours before being discovered.  Because he died 
two months after the home invasion, police decided that the 
beating did not contribute to his death.  The home invader, 29 
years old, remains charged only with robbery and unlawful 
confinement.  That is so even though it is accepted that trauma 
from any assault, particularly if experienced by an elderly 
victim, has long lasting affects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Merritt, B.C. an 80 year old victim was murdered in 1998 
during the course of a home invasion by an 18 year old who is now 
charged with first degree murder.  The victim had his hands and 
feet bound and was forced to lie on his bed.  He was covered by a 
chest of drawers and his walker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Near Lac La Biche a mother and daughter found themselves fleeing 
into the freezing cold after two strangers kicked in the door of 
their farmhouse at 2.30 in the morning.  The daughter suffered 
from frostbite on her feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Winnipeg this March a 17 year old victim was working at home 
on his computer.  In the early afternoon a stranger knocked and 
three youths appeared shortly afterwards through the unlocked 
rear door, cut the telephone cord, tied the youth up, put a knife 
to his throat and fled with a small amount of money and 
jewellery.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The B.C. government has offered a reward for information leading 
to the arrest and conviction of home invaders in Vancouver.  The 
reward has recently been increased to $100,000.  The Vancouver 
police department has formed a specialized home invasion police 
task force which has been given a blank cheque for whatever 
equipment and resources it requires.  In March the attorney 
general of British Columbia appointed a specialized prosecutor 
just to deal with home invasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week there was an unbelievably horrendous home invasion, 
brutal beating and robbery of a 79 year old decorated World War 
II veteran, Robert Delaney, and his 78 year old wife Betty.  Mr. 
Delaney is currently hospitalized in Halifax in critical 
condition as a result of the attack.  The victims were attacked 
in their home, allegedly by 20 year olds and one 14 year old who 
have been arrested and charged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts must take a hard line on home invasions.  Mr. Delaney 
is a veteran of the famed Black Watch of Montreal and was 
decorated by the government at war's end for outstanding acts of 
bravery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Halifax home invasion came during the same week that 
Canada's World War I valour at Vimy Ridge was being commemorated 
in the House of Commons.  Veterans who have fought and died for 
our freedom are now confronted with violent and lawless youth, 
the products of years of disrespect for history and country, as 
their aggressors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's education system has done an abysmal job of educating 
youth about the contributions of our war veterans.  Canada's 
veterans ought not be targets of crime but rather be highly 
regarded and respected.  This proud World War II veteran survived 
the wrath of Nazi Germany but he might not survive the cowardly 
attack by Canada's young criminals hiding behind antiquated 
laws and a void of victims rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend Alberta Justice Minister Jon Havelock who has been an 
advocate of reforming the process used to pick our supreme court 
judges.  He is right in saying that they should not be picked 
based on their relationship with the Prime Minister.  I will 
focus on Mr. Havelock's comments on home invasions.  He could not 
have said it better:  “Breaking and entering a residential home 
is not just a property offence”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He addressed the heinous nature of this crime within the Alberta 
legislature and has noted that his counterparts in Manitoba and 
Ontario have done the same.  All of them are calling for action 
from the justice minister.  So too am I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can only speculate as to why home invasions are becoming more 
commonplace, but for the criminals there are some comparable 
advantages.  As opposed to an act of assault and robbery in a 
shopping mall, the criminal has hours instead of minutes to 
commit the crime.  The criminal is concealed from others behind 
closed doors.  The crime's punishment under the present justice 
system is no different whether it is in the home or in the mall. 
Commonly sentences are served concurrently, not consecutively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Home invasions are a particularly loathsome act of cowardliness 
generally targeting the very young, very old and the weak in a 
diabolically sinister fashion.  Perpetrators first determine if 
the people are at home, plan an assault to gain entry and take 
hostage of the victims.  Generally physical abuse and torment of 
the victims are involved along with a robbery and wanton 
destruction of the home's contents.  All of this takes place 
behind the closed door of somebody's home, their sanctity from the 
evils of the street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institution of victims rights goes hand in hand with 
criminal justice system reforms.  While victims rights are an 
after the fact privilege long overdue, fully implemented they 
would impact crime and the prevention of crime.  Much more is 
needed in terms of both victims rights and reform of the justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we speak news is tragically unfolding in Denver, Colorado, as 
the United States is facing its legacy of ineffective laws that 
fail to control violence among others.  A school invasion is 
taking place by armed youths.  An armed assault is being made and 
students are being held hostage.  Many deaths have occurred. 
Hundreds of direct and indirect victims have just been created 
and the event is still not under control.

problem but a global problem.  Canada could do well by leading 
the way.  This is the challenge of the future.  The bill is the 
beginning of victims rights and deserves to be supported for 
that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to speak to the bill today.  I too would like to 
give credit to the two Reform members, the hon. member for 
Langley—Abbotsford and the hon. member for Surrey North, for all 
the work they have done in leading up to the legislation being 
presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As others have already said, the legislation will not go nearly 
as far as it should in terms of providing victims their rights. 
To demonstrate that, I want to read one of the most touching 
letters I have ever received from a constituent.  This person was 
the victim of a heinous crime.  I will read as much of this 
letter as I can and use it to demonstrate that there are still 
some huge gaps in legislation that must be filled to deal with 
situations such as this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This letter is from Linda Ryan of Lloydminister, Alberta, and I 
received it about a year ago.  She wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am writing this letter in regard to the parole hearing of Jack 
Edgar.  I am aware that Jack will receive a copy of this letter. 
I am asking that the parole board members take my letter and the 
enclosed documents into consideration in making a decision 
regarding Jack's application for parole. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will just interject by saying that this woman desperately 
wanted to make a verbal petition to the parole board not to allow 
Jack Edgar to be released on parole.  She went on to write: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 18, 1985 Jack Edgar murdered my mother and my aunt and 
that act changed my life forever.  That act began my life 
sentence of fear, grief and betrayal.  This man was my 
stepfather.  A man who portrayed a caring, loving father, 
grandfather, uncle and son-in-law.  Although in hindsight, I can 
see the cracks in his facade. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She goes on to talk about the impact of this murder committed by 
her stepfather against her mother and the impact on her daughter. 
In part she wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a very long time before my little girl began to heal. 
She, too, carries a life sentence of grief and fear and betrayal. 
My children have missed so much.  They had a right to all the 
love these two special people had to give them.  My heart aches 
for the part of my children's lives they are missing.  They also 
had a right to a mom who was not incapacitated by grief and to a 
family that was whole.  It has taken a great deal of courage to 
survive this and make a life for my family.  I have struggled to 
regain my optimism in life, to trust people and my ability to 
judge character; to maintain a sense of humour.  I have done this 
for my children, for my mom and for my aunt.  They would want 
this, as these are qualities they instilled in me. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter was written to the head of the parole board who was 
to hear the parole hearing which may have released Jack Edgar, 
the person who murdered her mother and aunt.  She continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I can't predict what Jack will do, no one can, perhaps not 
even Jack himself.  I do know I cannot live my life and raise my 
children with “what if's”.  I cannot imagine being able to stay 
here in my home, near my family if Jack is released.  I have not 
slept through an entire night since Nellie Taylor called to tell 
me he is applying for parole.  The thought of him being released 
terrifies me.  I live each and every day with what he did to 
them, their terror, their helplessness.  That is enough.  I 
should not have to live in fear of what he may do next.  Releasing 
Jack is a violation of my right to safety. 
My fears are real and grounded and shared by many.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She goes on to list people who are also terrified at the thought 
of this person being paroled and who would see it as extremely 
important to have a say at the parole hearing.  She wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money, power and position were always crucial to Jack, for his 
sense of self-worth.  If Jack is released, there will be no 
money, no power, no position.  The “important” people will no 
longer be there for him.  He is a convicted double murderer.  I 
fear he is a man with little to lose. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the sake of time I will omit parts of what she had to say. I 
want to read a bit more about what she feels about this person 
that she desperately wants to remain in jail, this person who 
killed her mother and her aunt.  She continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is, however, another side to Jack Edgar which no one can 
predict. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the paragraph before she talked about Jack and the impression 
he had left on people in the prison.  She indicated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know from reading letters from the prison that Jack is highly 
regarded and is viewed to have many good qualities.  This does 
not surprise me as Jack is a highly polished con artist and he 
has a way of gaining people's trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is however another side to Jack Edgar which no one can 
predict.  It enabled him to slaughter my Mom and my Aunt while 
they sobbed on their hands and knees.  He did this with no regard 
for their lives, no regard for the agony he would cause for their 
families.  His needs came first and he did not care who he 
destroyed to get what he wanted.  This side of Jack is still 
there.  He was 57 years old when he committed the murders and his 
character was cemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years, in my conversations with the National Parole 
Board, I know that Jack has never taken any responsibility nor 
has he shown any remorse for the brutal murders of my Mom and my 
Aunt.  I believe that Jack's recent admittance of “some” 
responsibility for the murders is directly related to his desire 
to obtain his freedom.  I think Jack is a man with little 
conscience and his only remorse is for himself and his situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that nothing will ever bring my Mom and my Aunt back, 
but a mere 6.5 years each of the loss of Jack's freedom is an 
insult to their memory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking that you deny parole for Jack, for the safety of 
myself, my family— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then she named some other people.  She continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask that if an error is to be made let it be made on the side 
of caution. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some excerpts from a letter which unfortunately is in 
a file of about a dozen victims of extremely serious crime from 
whom I have heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is whether the bill we are debating today will in 
any way do anything to provide what this woman, a victim of a 
heinous crime, wants.  She wants to be able to go to a parole 
hearing and to say what is in her heart, what she feels and what 
she lives with every day, so that she can put some kind of 
closure to the whole situation.  She wants to feel safe in 
knowing that this person will probably never be released.  That 
is what she wants.  She wants to be able to read that impact 
statement herself at a parole hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the legislation does not provide for that.  It 
does nothing to provide for that.  There is some word that 
legislation will be coming to deal with corrections and 
conditional release.  That of course would deal with this issue, 
but it would make sense that it should be in place before this 
legislation is debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make sure this is only considered by the government to be 
the first step.  Let us carry forth and do a lot more to help 
victims of crime.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-403, an act to amend the Canadian Environmental Protection Act 
(lead sinkers and lead jigs), be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is indeed my pleasure to rise today to 
address my private member's bill on the prohibition of lead 
sinkers and jigs for use in Canadian waters, namely Bill C-403. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I offer my sincere thanks to the Minister of the Environment. 
Over the past number of weeks, she has made her staff and her 
department available for numerous consultations on how best to 
address this issue.  For that I say, thanks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also make mention that although the government has made 
significant strides toward the elimination of lead sinkers, the 
minister has assured me that her efforts will be increased in 
order to address this serious environmental concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also offer my sincere appreciation to a few other individuals, 
namely Mr. John Phillips and Mr. Rob Anderson.  These two 
individuals have dedicated enormous amounts of time in trying to 
raise the profile of this issue to many Canadians.  If it were 
not for their efforts this issue would simply not be before the 
House today.  I believe Canadians owe Mr. Phillips and Mr. 
Anderson a debt of gratitude for this.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank the people who took the time to 
assist me and advise me on the most effective ways to achieve the 
desired outcome, that being the eventual elimination of lead in 
our Canadian waters. Specifically I cite some names. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Craig Ritchie from the publication <I>Real Fishing</I> 
offered many positive suggestions regarding my efforts toward 
ensuring a successful outcome. Although he was critical of the 
original language that still stands today within the bill, he did 
offer many sound ideas for consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that those who chose to offer positive criticisms 
as well as advice will be very pleased to see the direction this 
Liberal government will take in dealing with this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is certainly not the first time it has been 
recommended that the minister take the necessary steps to 
eliminate lead sinkers from Canadian waters.  In May 1997 the 
standing committee on the environment recommended that the 
minister initiate a regulatory action to prohibit the import, the 
sale, the manufacture and the use of lead sinkers and jigs that 
are equal to or less than 2.5 centimetres in dimension.  My bill 
falls in line with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time I would like to share some startling facts as well 
as some potential and actual impacts regarding the use of lead 
sinkers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an estimated annual 500 tonnes of lead fishing sinkers 
and jigs lost in Canadian waters every year.  This represents 
millions upon millions of individual sinkers and jigs that are 
lying at the bottom of Canadian lakes and rivers.  This can no 
longer go unchecked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The potential impacts are as severe as they are broad.  The fact 
is that lead sinkers are deemed to be a highly toxic substance. 
This is irrefutable.  The fact is lead sinkers are killing our 
waterfowl.  This fact is also irrefutable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also many other areas where lead sinkers may be having 
serious implications.  Sadly there has not been enough science 
based research done in these areas to fully prove the negative 
impacts at this time.  Some of these areas that require much more 
research and focus are the impact on various fish species after 
ingestion has occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also suggest that there are very few fishers in Canada 
that have not lost a lead weight or a lead lure to a fish that is 
determined not to be caught. Common sense must tell us that if a 
fish is ingesting lead sinkers and further that lead sinkers are 
a toxic substance, then there must be negative consequences to 
the fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that if we present a science based case to the 
anglers in this country as to the negative impacts on the fish 
population as well as other areas, they will be more than happy 
to source out and use alternatives that are presently available. 
Make no mistake, there are alternatives available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not overlook the fact that some of the greatest 
environmentalists we have in this country are sports anglers. 
They have proven time and time again their unwavering commitment 
to our natural resources through fishery stocking programs, to 
river bed clean-ups to building fish ladders.  Their commitment 
has been unequalled. It is for this reason I am confident that if 
science demonstrates a negative impact on fish populations as it 
has demonstrated on waterfowl, our anglers will not simply 
follow our direction, our anglers will lead the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me address some of the many areas where lead has been and in 
fact continues to be removed from human contact.  An example is 
lead based paints.  For years there was no question as to the use 
of lead based paint. It was applied to almost every home and 
office wall in the country.  However, once we identified lead as 
a toxic substance we quickly moved to have lead based paints 
banned from sale in order to protect ourselves from the obvious 
health threats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again we as concerned parents also support the removal of lead 
pipes from many of our older institutions, including many of our 
school buildings.  These actions demonstrate our concern for 
ourselves and much more important, our children, who may be 
ingesting water travelling through lead pipes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have very fond memories of fishing with my father, with my 
friends and my sons over the past number of years.  I think back 
to the days of fishing out in Georgian Bay.  Many boats, many 
anglers gathered around for the excellent fishing available in 
Georgian Bay.  We would watch the fishermen and the anglers and 
almost without exception when rejigging the lines they would put 
the line in the split shot and bite down on it.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very same day as we watched the people handle those lead 
split shots and the bell sinkers, as they rejigged the line and 
threw it back over the boat, what did they do?  They reached into 
their lunch box, grabbed their sandwich and ate it. Sometimes it 
merely takes the issue of receiving a higher profile for us to 
recognize the consequences of our actions.  If this bill does 
nothing more than that, I will consider it a success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the time I spent drafting the private member's bill, I 
intentionally kept the bill as simple and straightforward as 
possible.  The goal is very simple:  the elimination of lead 
sinkers and jigs in Canadian waters.  However, knowing the 
profile the issue would receive, I knew that there would be many 
opportunities available for worthwhile amendments and alternative 
suggestions on how to best combat this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end this initiative has been very successful.  There 
have been some very good suggestions and amendments brought 
forward to me by other members of parliament as well as by 
constituents from across the country.  People are starting to buy 
into the theory that lead is bad and they should no longer be 
using it for fishing when there are viable alternatives 
available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the first presentation of my bill it became blatantly 
obvious that the only way to truly impact the use of lead sinkers 
was through community buy-in based on sound research and factual 
education.  It is to this end I have had the assurance of the 
minister that a strategy such as this will be embarked upon 
immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been other positive suggestions that have come 
forward.  Considering we live in a time where we label products 
such as cleaners, varnishes, chemicals and even cigarettes, would 
it not make sense to consider labelling lead sinkers that are 
sitting on the shelves or that are going on the shelves today as 
to the potential impacts of the handling of those things?  Once 
again this is the type of strategy that falls in line with 
education and communication rather than a strict enforcement 
policy brought forward immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to clearly state that the intent of this bill is not to 
create division but rather to create an environment of 
co-operation.  It is in this light that the Minister of the 
Environment and the Liberal government should commend themselves 
for attempting to secure that type of co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other possible ideas to consider when looking at the 
elimination of lead sinkers.  For instance, consideration should 
be given to investigate a possible gradual implementation which 
in turn would not create undue hardship on retailers, as well as 
the cottage industry, that presently derive benefits from the 
said product.  We should also investigate a buy back program, as 
well as possible tax incentives in order to create a more 
competitive environment when considering alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, make no mistake, there are viable alternatives out 
there.  As a Liberal government, some of the positive steps that 
we can take when striving for positive solutions to a negative 
situation are things that should be dealt with immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a minute to speak about some of the 
research that has been completed on this particular issue with 
regard to the impact of lead sinkers and jigs in Canadian waters. 
There are those who will challenge any and all research 
completed on any particular issue if it does not conform to their 
way of thinking.   This is not a bad thing.  Any fact based 
position must be able to stand the test of challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, whether one agrees completely with the findings of 
research or suggests that it may require more investigation and 
provide greater detail, common sense must dictate that there is 
some measure of substance to the findings with regard to the 
definite impact on waterfowl.  If we accept that in principle 
there is a devastating impact or that there is an impact to 
waterfowl then I think what we will find is unanimous support in 
the House to move forward and attempt to deal with this very 
serious situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we accept the fact that many of our various species of 
waterfowl are not on the endangered species list, we must not 
detract from our focus of eliminating a hazardous substance that 
clearly represents a dangerous impact not only on waterfowl but 
on the fish population and yes, on people as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the House to work with the Minister of the Environment and 
our government to implement a research based education program. 
This will ensure communities fact based information which I 
believe in turn will result in the partnering and the elimination 
of hundreds of tonnes of lead being deposited into what we 
recognize as one of the cleanest and most pristine water systems 
in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again want to offer my thanks to my seconder as well as the 
Minister of the Environment and many of the colleagues on both 
sides of the House that have taken the time to contact me and 
offer their suggestions, their ideas and in some cases their 
criticisms on how we should be moving forward with this. Once 
again I will make mention that I consider it a success that we 
have raised that kind of interest in the House and all across 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are depositing hundreds of millions of lead sinkers and jigs 
in our Canadian waterways every year.  If we accept the fact that 
lead is a toxic substance, that it is having an impact on 
waterfowl, once science based research is done I am sure it will 
demonstrate it is having an impact on fish populations, and we 
have certainly demonstrated that it has a very negative impact on 
humankind.  I am sure we will be able to draw a consensus that we 
have to stop this and stop it as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that note I thank my hon. colleagues who are staying around 
to offer comments on this issue that is very close to my heart. 
I am more than happy to listen to their addresses.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to speak to Private Member's Bill C-403, an act 
that would amend the Canadian Environmental Protection Act to 
prohibit the manufacture, importation, sale and offering for sale 
and in certain circumstances the possession of lead sinkers and 
jigs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Simcoe—Grey is to be commended for bringing such 
an important environmental issue to the forefront.  The issue of 
lead poisoning in our environment is an important concern and 
something for all Canadians and all levels of government to be 
aware of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lead poisoning in our environment has become a widespread 
problem due to historically extensive and varied use of lead. Its 
low melting point, its malleability, ease of processing and low 
cost have resulted in its use in a wide range of applications. 
It has been used in solder, plumbing pipes, paints, pottery 
glazes, crystal ware, gasoline, hunting shot and fishing sinkers 
and jigs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, through the years as our science improved, more has 
been discovered about lead's intrinsically high toxicity and the 
adverse effects it can have on our environment.  Although science 
has known about the toxicity of lead and the potential it has for 
poisoning wildlife since the turn of the century, it has been a 
long process from scientific discovery to government regulatory 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the late 1960s and early 1970s the Canadian Wildlife Service 
expressed significant concern over the lead poisoning of 
waterfowl from lead shot ingestion.  This initial concern did not 
translate into extensive research and study until the late 1980s 
when the United States announced its intention to completely ban 
the use of lead shot in waterfowl hunting by 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The announcement of this ban initiated a series of studies by 
the Canadian Wildlife Service that determined that there was 
insufficient evidence to justify a national ban.  However, since 
that time, extensive research has been conducted by the Canadian 
Wildlife Service and others on several fronts which has led to a 
reassessment of this earlier decision and has instigated federal 
government regulatory action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lead sinkers and jigs are used primarily by fresh water sports 
fishermen.  These products are quite popular due to their ease of 
use, widespread availability and inexpensive cost.  The most 
common sinker used is the split shot sinker which the member 
explained, which in the United States accounts for almost half of 
the total sinker production. I dread to think of how many of 
those I have bitten down on in my life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across Canada it is estimated that over five million Canadians 
take part in recreational fishing activities, buying nearly 560 
tonnes of lead in the form of lead sinkers.  Virtually all of 
this lead is destined for the bottom of Canada's lakes and 
rivers.  When a lead sinker is lost, it settles on the bottom of 
the body of water where it can be ingested by waterfowl. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many ducks and other birds get their food by digging in the mud 
at the bottom of a lake or river.  The birds ingest small stones 
called grit to grind up their food and cannot differentiate 
between a sinker of 50 grams or less and a small pebble.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fish eating water bird such as the common loon may also be 
attracted to bait on a fishing hook.  Often times loons will 
swallow the hook and sinker when it is still attached to the 
line. The birds may also eat fish that have swallowed a sinker. 
Once a bird swallows a lead sinker it will become very sick and 
often will die.  Because lead sinkers are relatively large, 
larger than lead hunting shot, it often takes only one sinker to 
kill a bird. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Wildlife Service has determined that lead sinker 
ingestion is probably the most frequent cause of lead poisoning 
in species such as the common loon, poisoning up to 30,000 loons 
annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of these loons will quickly die and their lead contaminated 
carcasses are eaten by predators, leading to further secondary 
poisoning.  In response to this growing problem governments have 
slowly but surely begun to take action.  In Great Britain the use 
of lead sinkers was prohibited in 1987 as a response to the 
deaths of thousands of mute swans.  In the U.S. lead sinkers have 
been banned in some national parks and the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency is pursuing further regulatory action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its 1995 report entitled “It's About Our Health! Towards 
Pollution Prevention”, the Standing Committee on the Environment 
and Sustainable Development recommended that the federal 
government take action under the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act to regulate lead sinkers and jigs by prohibiting 
the import, sale, manufacture and use of lead sinkers and jigs by 
May 31, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Environment Canada did use the Migratory Birds 
Convention Act to control the use of lead shot in certain areas 
of the country, it did not adopt the recommendations of the 
committee and prohibit the nation-wide use of lead sinkers and 
jigs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent action taken by the federal government was on 
September 17, 1997 when the wildlife area regulations pursuant to 
the Canada Wildlife Act were amended to prohibit the possession 
of any lead sinker or jig weighing less than 50 grams in national 
wildlife areas where sport fishing is authorized through permit 
or notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment was similar to the amendment made to the national 
parks fishing regulations made under the authority of the 
National Parks Act.  These regulations also ban the use or 
possession of any lead sinker or jig containing more than 1% lead 
by content in any national park in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has also implemented regulations that will prohibit the 
use of lead shot when hunting for migratory birds pursuant to the 
authority granted under the Migratory Birds Convention Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears to me that the federal government has been cautious 
about regulating the lead content of hunting shot and fishing 
tackle because of its concern about jurisdictional authority, and 
rightfully so.  To date the government has only used legislation 
that is explicitly federal in nature.  The National Parks Act, 
the Canada Wildlife Act and the Migratory Birds Convention Act 
are all pieces of legislation that clearly authorize federal 
government intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the bill has been deemed non-votable, I urge the hon. 
member for Simcoe—Grey to be cautious in his approach in the 
future.  The Constitution Act, 1867, and the subsequent amendment 
made in 1982 do not clearly define all areas of provincial and 
federal jurisdiction over the environment and its conservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Constitution does not clearly define all areas of 
jurisdiction, any regulatory action based on an unclear area of 
jurisdiction will likely be met with stiff opposition from the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Supreme Court of Canada has constitutionally upheld 
the Canadian Environmental Protection Act as an exercise of 
parliament's power over criminal law, the federal government 
would be wise to move with caution on this issue, lest it intrude 
on areas of provincial domain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the hon. member brings forward a very important issue 
and makes a compelling case for federal government regulation, my 
party and I cannot support him in this quest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is committed to decentralization of federal 
authority and supports the restraint of the legislative powers of 
the federal executive and the Prime Minister's cabinet. 
Legislative authority should rest with the level of government 
that is able to govern most effectively in each area, with a bias 
toward decentralization in cases of uncertainty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the principles and policies of the Reform Party contained in 
the 1999 blue book it is stated that the Reform Party supports 
the principle that the provinces have exclusive jurisdiction 
over, among other things, sport fishing.  Since it is clear that 
the target of the bill is Canada's sport fishing community, I 
cannot support it as it stands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to congratulate my hon. colleague from Simcoe—Grey for 
his admirable initiative.  Canada's environment is best served 
when individual Canadians make personal commitments to 
conservation and protection, and I urge him to continue his 
vigilance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-403, An Act to amend the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act (lead sinkers and lead 
jigs). 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1905"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT102"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT102"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1905

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must remind this House that Bill C-32 on environmental 
protection is at report stage.  The process at committee stage 
was quite long and hard in order to not add further amendments 
to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois voted against Bill C-32, which contains many 
gaps in the recognition of provincial jurisdiction, in the poor 
translation of the bill's clauses from English into French and 
by the lack of consistency in the amendments brought in 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To get back to Bill C-403, I think the intent of the member for 
Simcoe—Grey is legitimate and laudable, because one of the main 
problems involving lead sinkers and jigs is the poisoning of the 
loons, black ducks, brent geese, snow geese and other waterfowl 
that swallow them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the lead sinkers and jigs will end up one day or another 
in the fishing areas, along shore lines, rocky areas and docks 
on lakes, ponds or streams.  These fishing areas are often used 
for reproduction and feeding by the waterfowl. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An estimated 500 tonnes of this fishing tackle accumulates 
annually in Canadian waters.  According to various studies, 
between 17% and 56% of loons die from the effects of lead 
fishing tackle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lead sinkers and jigs are often lost when fishing lines become 
tangled and break.  These objects sink and when birds swallow 
them they often become very sick and sometimes die.  Swallowing 
just one of these objects is enough to kill an aquatic bird. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is as follows.  When a bird ingests lead sinkers and 
jigs, they can remain stuck in its gizzard, a muscular stomach 
which enables it to break down food.  In doing so, the gizzard 
also breaks down fishing tackle, decomposing it into tiny 
particles.  The acid present in the gizzard dissolves these 
particles and the lead then passes into the bird's bloodstream. 
The dissolved lead is then carried throughout the organism and 
ends up in bones and vital organs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it decomposes in the environment, lead can contaminate soil 
and water.  For example, on certain skeet shooting ranges, the 
soil contains enough lead to be considered dangerous waste. 
Decades may pass before the lead shot and weights decompose in 
the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A speedy remedy is therefore necessary against this practice 
that is harmful to aquatic fauna. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it helpful to recall that approximately 50 to 60 million 
birds are potential targets for this kind of contamination? 
Lead sinkers and jigs are used exclusively by anglers.  These 
are the users that must be targeted if this hazard is to be 
eliminated.  A well-orchestrated public awareness campaign could 
be effective in resolving part of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Possible solutions could include persuading fishers to switch to 
other materials, such as tin, bismuth, steel, or a special 
mastic. These materials are not toxic to birds.  In addition, 
lead poisoning of loons and other aquatic fowl must be reduced 
by cutting back on the volume of lead tackle sold and used.  One 
solution would be to introduce regulations that would 
simultaneously increase the availability, sale and use of 
non-toxic substitutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial, territorial or federal legislation is becoming 
essential in order to gradually eliminate small lead sinkers and 
jigs of 500 grams or less for sports fishing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The introduction of public education programs could be 
considered to publicize non-toxic substitutes and suggest methods 
of recovering, eliminating or recycling lead products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the substitutes now available cost more, but 
they would increase total average annual fishing costs by 1% to 
2% at most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very tough and effective regulations are needed to eliminate 
this problem of lead contaminating our waterways. 
Since 1997, federal regulations have been in force in national 
reserves and parks.  If these regulations are to be extended to 
other sectors, provincial governments have a responsibility to 
try to limit the presence of lead in waterways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must respect provincial jurisdictions so 
as not to again interfere in matters that do not concern it.  We 
are obviously not questioning the legitimacy of the bill 
introduced by the member for Simcoe—Grey, but we are not 
convinced that including it in the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act is the best approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois think that there are various solutions 
to this threat to fauna that has gone on for too long. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to the bill on behalf of my caucus and 
specifically on behalf of our environmental spokesperson, my hon. 
colleague from Churchill River in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for Simcoe—Grey for bringing the hazards of 
lead sinker and jig use to the attention of the House.  He is 
quite correct that giving it focus at this level should create 
greater concern and moves to deter and ban the use of such 
products.  I acknowledge that the bill has not been deemed 
votable and therefore will not see the results that it so 
desired.  I was somewhat disappointed that he was willing to let 
the government bureaucracy run its course without a much greater 
fight.  When it goes through the government bureaucracy that in 
many cases means no action and ultimately no concrete results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than getting into a number of the facts we have listened 
to this evening, I do not think there is any question from what 
we have heard that there is a problem with the use of lead in a 
number of products when they continue through the food chain, 
going through fish and birds and then on to humans, something 
that has not been mentioned this evening unless I missed it. 
There are consequences for animals and fish but they also travel 
through the food chain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us get on with encouraging anglers to use other products and 
let us be clear there are other products.  Bismuth and high 
density plastic products are available so it is not as if there 
is not something there.  I recognize that anglers may see a 
minimal increase in cost and that some anglers prefer to make 
their own sinkers and jigs.  In the whole context the hazards 
outweigh the benefits and we should be going to the other 
products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need a lengthy study to convince me of the hazards.  I 
do not think we have to go through that whole process again with 
fish.  When we see that a substance causes cancer in rats, do we 
try the product on humans or on other animals to see if it will 
cause cancer as well?  I do not think so.  Countless studies 
prove lead is a deadly toxic substance.  As indicated previously, 
it has been removed from paint and other products including 
gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the form of gasoline that I personally saw adults, 
young children and infants affected.  Gas sniffing was a serious 
problem in some northern Manitoba communities.  When lead was a 
gas additive the consequences were very apparent.  A good number 
of members may not have seen four year old children die as a 
result of gas sniffing, all as a result of the lead in the gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to be convinced.  I would encourage the committee 
to continue its review of this matter and encourage the 
environment minister to proceed with a ban of lead products.  I 
am not willing to get caught up in the federal-provincial issue. 
I would find it hard to believe that provincial governments would 
not accept this as an environmental hazard and see it in the same 
light.  I hope we pursue a ban at the federal level.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to have the opportunity to participate in this evening's 
debate on Bill C-403, sponsored by the member for Simcoe—Grey 
and seconded by the member for York North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the debate which he has brought forward is indeed very 
constructive and I would like to state that I support the intent 
of his bill, although if this were a votable motion we would 
likely not support it and I would like to expand on our reasons 
for doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion brought forward is indeed very constructive.  The 
hon. member points out that this issue falls under the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act, legislation which we initiated back 
in 1988, which is enduring a very long review in committee. We 
have been doing a clause by clause examination of it since late 
October.  The reason we would not support this bill is because 
there are other venues available to address the issue which he 
has brought forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member has pointed out, and I believe my colleagues 
have mentioned, an estimated 500 tonnes of lead fishing sinkers 
and jigs or tackle are lost in the waters of Canadian rivers, 
lakes and ponds each year.  That 500 tonnes ends up in the food 
chain of numerous species, namely waterfowl and fish, and can 
ultimately be absorbed by human beings.  Therefore, this issue is 
indeed hazardous to human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scientists have estimated that between 17% and 56% of the deaths 
of all waterfowl, particularly loons, are related to lead tackle, 
jigs and sinkers which are deposited within our lakes and rivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that a single lead sinker or jig 
can poison a loon.  It will ultimately get into its digestive 
system and in short order the bird is incapable of flying and 
experiences a loss of balance.  Ultimately a species could be 
extirpated from a given area, endangered or become a species at 
risk because of sports fishermen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that sports fishermen are likely the 
most environmentally conscious citizens who exist in this 
country.  I know that in my riding of Fundy—Royal, the Sussex 
Fish and Game Association and the Hammond River Angling 
Association has done enormous things in terms of restoring fish 
habitat along the Kennebecasis River and along the Hammond River. 
This has been done on a volunteer basis and, indeed, they should 
be applauded for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now seeing trout species returning to our area.  We are 
now seeing Atlantic salmon returning to these rivers.  The sports 
fishermen want to do the right thing from an environmental 
perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 1 I wrote to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans 
outlining my understanding that under section 43(e) of the 
Fisheries Act his department has the power to make regulations 
respecting the use of fishing gear and equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government already has the power to resolve this 
preventable situation, I urged the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans to consider banning this harmful tool in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is indeed very constructive.  The member for 
Simcoe—Grey is really doing a positive thing here in terms of 
advancing this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is sadly sidelined at the 
moment due to an accident.  I know he will be returning to the 
House in a number of weeks.  Perhaps he is looking over some 
things to read.  I would suggest that the hon. member send the 
fisheries minister a fax or a note saying that when he does 
return to the House of Commons, and we welcome his return, this 
is something he could do under section 43(e) of the Fisheries 
Act, as opposed to doing it under the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act.  It is a regulation that actually could be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not unprecedented.  In 1987 the United Kingdom banned 
lead tackle due to the fact that they had lost a number of mute 
swans.  This was the corrective action which they took.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has banned lead fishing tackle on federal 
lands, which is a positive thing.  However, fish do not 
necessarily know whether they are in federal or provincial 
waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me of what the environment department is discussing 
with respect to the Canada Endangered Species Protection Act.  It 
is willing to protect an animal if it is on federal lands, but if 
the animal steps off federal lands it will not necessarily 
protect core habitat.  If it is the right thing to do within our 
international parks, it is the right thing to do throughout the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an environmental initiative on which I believe we should 
move forward.  It is long overdue.  We should take our time.  We 
should ensure that we phase in this legislation from a regulatory 
perspective because there are a number of fishermen who own lead 
sinkers and there are retailers who have already made an 
investment in them.  We have to ensure that we do this in a very 
prudent way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from the Reform Party has pointed out, who I 
consider to be a friend of mine, more often than not regulations 
made in Ottawa actually infringe upon provincial rights.  The 
more often we can get the delivery of a government service closer 
to the people, the better.  Therefore, I concur with doing things 
on a provincial basis rather than a federal basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, in terms of the protection of the environment, I 
believe that the federal government has a role to play and that 
banning it under section 43(e) of the Fisheries Act would be a 
step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am encouraging the government to make an amendment to the 
regulations to make it an environmental initiative.  It should do 
that because it is now in the sixth year of its mandate and it 
has yet to pass one piece of environmental legislation, except 
for the MMT bill, which cost Canadian taxpayers $16.5 million 
because it did not ban that substance under the CEPA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is environmental legislation which it could implement, 
which would have a positive effect on fish, waterfowl and 
ultimately human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compliment the member for Simcoe—Grey for bringing this 
debate forward.  I encourage him to write that letter to the 
fisheries minister to ensure that it will be done under section 
43.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to stand in the House to address members who are here 
on the issue of second reading of Bill C-403, which seeks to 
eliminate the use of lead sinkers and jigs in fishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-403 proposes that the Canada Environmental Protection 
Act, known as the CEPA, be amended to prohibit the import, 
manufacture, sale and use of lead fishing sinkers and jigs 
weighing 50 grams or less because species have died from lead 
poisoning through ingestion of these sinkers and jigs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the intent of this initiative and I am pleased that 
attention is being drawn to the impact which lead sinkers and 
jigs have on our wildlife.  Parliamentarians and the Canadian 
public have reason to be concerned.  All of us need to pay 
attention to the effect our activities as anglers or hunters, 
hikers or bird watchers have on our cherished wildlife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lead, as many people have mentioned, has long been acknowledged 
as an environmental and health problem for humans and wildlife 
and is listed as a toxic substance under the current CEPA.  The 
federal government, along with other levels of government, has 
been successful in reducing lead from our environment through 
initiatives like those which remove lead from gasoline and 
household products such as paint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-403 focuses our attention on the fact that the 
recreational use of lead has become one of the leading sources of 
lead in the environment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill raises the profile of the problem of lead fishing 
sinkers and jigs and their impact on wildlife, particularly, as 
members have mentioned, the loon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have heard from a very detailed discussion by several 
members, the problem occurs when water birds ingest fishing 
sinkers and jigs during feeding, either when they mistake them 
for food or grit or when they consume lost bait fish with lines 
still attached.  The ingestion of a single lead sinker or a 
lead-headed jig is sufficient to expose a loon or other bird to a 
lethal dose of lead.  Ingestion of lead sinkers and jigs has been 
found to cause mortality in common loons, swans and other 
waterfowl. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current CEPA has the authority to make a regulation that 
would accomplish the objective which Bill C-403 sets out. 
Success in achieving the results advocated in Bill C-403 depends 
first on obtaining the support of those Canadians on whom the 
proposed legislation would have the greatest impact.  As such, 
consultations are needed to build consensus on the appropriate 
ways to prevent the death of birds caused by these sinkers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ensure that Canadians have an appreciation for the 
scope of the problem and an idea of the possible solutions.  It 
is important that people understand what science is telling us 
and agree on the appropriate course of action.  Let me be clear: 
this approach has never failed this government.  Consulting 
Canadians, building consensus and taking action, developing the 
support of anglers who use lead sinkers and jigs, of 
manufacturers, distributors and retailers who make lead sinkers 
and jigs available, and of the provinces and territories who 
manage recreational fishing are essential to the effective 
implementation of the action.  Non-toxic types of fishing sinkers 
and jigs must become the norm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Action is needed.  To that end, the Minister of the Environment 
is planning to write to her provincial colleagues and will raise 
this issue with them at the next Wildlife Ministers' Council of 
Canada.  The meeting is scheduled for this fall.  Her objective 
is to work with our partners to establish a voluntary 
co-operative program founded on education and building public 
awareness on the needless destruction caused by these products. 
By including education and awareness activities in partnership 
with the provinces and territories, angling organizations, 
manufacturers and retailers, we truly will have a positive effect 
over the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lead shot used in hunting has also been shown to be hazardous to 
wildlife, particularly waterfowl.  That is why the federal 
government phased in a ban on lead shot used for hunting. 
Beginning in 1991 Canada banned the use of lead shot in hot spots 
across the country, places where lead shot poisoning of waterfowl 
was known to be a problem.  These areas were mostly in eastern 
Canada.  In addition, a province-wide ban was introduced in 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the intervening years the Minister of the Environment banned 
the use of lead shot for hunting in national wildlife areas and 
for hunting most migratory birds in and around wetlands.  A full 
national ban comes into effect this fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This phased-in approach is working well and is a solid model for 
the reduction of lead fishing sinkers and jigs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should emphasize an earlier point.  It is the government's 
position that these phased-in regulatory approaches have been 
most effective when coupled with education and awareness 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, all members will be pleased to know that we have 
already made some headway in reducing the use of lead fishing 
sinkers and jigs.  In 1997, under the Canada Wildlife Act, the 
current Minister of the Environment banned possession of lead 
fishing sinkers and jigs weighing less than 50 grams in national 
wildlife areas.  In the same year, under the National Parks Act, 
Heritage Canada prohibited the use or possession of lead sinkers 
and jigs weighing less than 50 grams while fishing in national 
parks.  Together these restrictions are estimated to have reduced 
lead sinkers and jigs deposited by 4 tonnes to 5 tonnes annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environment Canada has also actively supported independent 
collection programs for lead sinkers and jigs that have been 
instituted by several organizations in Ontario, including the 
Ontario Ministry of the Environment, the Bay of Quinte Remedial 
Action Plan and the Hamilton Regional Conservation Authority.  To 
date these programs have netted more than 770 kilograms of lead 
sinkers and jigs from anglers participating in exchanges around 
the Great Lakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These volunteer organizations and individuals have been highly 
successful and are deserving of our praise and thanks.  The 
success of their programs can be attributed to the dedicated 
volunteers and the inclusion of anglers themselves in the design 
and implementation of the plan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the efforts of Environment Canada, Parks Canada 
has initiated education programs and collection sites at many of 
Canada's national parks.  Collection program co-ordinators report 
that the education exchange approach is an effective model to 
raising public awareness of the issue and is very well received 
by the angling community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The success of this type of initiative has allowed the 
government to move ahead on reducing lead in the environment. The 
government intends to continue to be active in addressing the 
harm done by these lead sinkers and jigs.  As always, we are 
using scientific research as the basis for our actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that an estimated 388 to 559 tonnes of lead in the form 
of lead sinkers and jigs may be lost in Canadian waters annually 
by the approximately 5.5 million anglers who participate in 
recreational fishing each year.  This represents about 12% of all 
lead releases to the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to Canada's loon population, it has been estimated 
that between 250,000 and 500,000 common loons are breeding in 
Canada and that overall the loon population is not in decline.  A 
variety of environmental contaminants including acid rain, 
mercury and lead have had an impact on the common loon.  However, 
the relative influence of these and other stressors such as 
disease, predation and severe weather on the health of loon 
populations is still unclear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do know that lead poisoning has an impact on wildlife, 
particularly water birds like loons.  We do know that in 
locations where recreational angling occurs, lead sinker or jig 
ingestion causes adult loon mortality and is one of the leading 
causes of death for loons in these areas.  In fact, 59 of the 217 
dead birds examined over the past 10 years died from lead 
poisoning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individual Canadians have helped Environment Canada in 
developing the science in this field.  Data currently available 
depended largely on the volunteer co-operation of cottagers, 
anglers and boaters who came across a carcass and notified the 
appropriate provincial and federal wildlife agency.  We will 
continue to rely on their help in gathering evidence that will 
help us refine our understanding of the various threats to our 
water birds.  Canadians play an important role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Help from the Canadian public, and anglers and industry 
specifically, is also needed if we are to eliminate the use of 
lead sinkers and jigs. Education and awareness building programs 
backed up by good science will ensure Canadians support our 
actions in preserving the environment for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the government's intention to consult with manufacturers 
and retailers of fishing sinkers and jigs to help ensure that 
alternative products are available which are comparable in price 
and performance to those made of lead.  We will consult with the 
anglers on the effectiveness of non-lead sinkers and jigs for 
fishing.  We always have the possibility of regulation when it is 
appropriate.  The government believes this course of action will 
in the end achieve the objective of Bill C-403 by building 
support for key stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the member for Simcoe—Grey has brought the 
attention of all members of the House to the lead fishing sinker 
and jig problem.  His interest and continued action in the 
environment are most commendable.  I am sure his constituents 
must be very proud of his accomplishments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
certainly want to offer my appreciation to my colleagues who have 
taken the time out this evening to speak to something that I feel 
is a critical and significant issue for the federal government to 
deal with.  To the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the 
Environment I offer my sincere appreciation not just for tonight 
but for the information that she has shared back and forth with 
me over the past number of weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made some notes as I was listening to the presenters from the 
various parties this evening.  The fact of the matter is that we 
all want the same desired result.  It is just that the means 
appear to be somewhat different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was some talk of constitutionality and whether it would be 
upheld.  When I started out on this process with my private 
member's bill, one of the first things I did was forward it to 
the House legal advisers for their opinion.  They gave it a 
thumbs up from a constitutionality standpoint if in fact there 
were any challenges.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to a couple of my colleagues passing responsibility 
down to provincial ministries or regional governments, I would 
not and could not support that.  I believe the environment is a 
federal responsibility.  Whether it be through regulatory process 
or through education and buy-in programs, the environment is a 
responsibility for all Canadians and not simply one sector within 
the country.  To detract from that we would in turn be doing a 
disservice to the various regions in the country that did not 
identify this as a necessary priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I found as I was chatting with constituents in 
my riding, as well as from the phone calls I received, was that 
it was difficult for people to appreciate the size and scope of 
the problem because they are so small.  As they hold a half a 
dozen split-shots or bell sinkers in their hand they ask what is 
the big deal.  As many of my well informed colleagues have 
identified this evening, we are talking about 500 tonnes per 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was doing some quick math and thinking to myself how best to 
describe it other than stating that we would have to line up 
2,000 half ton trucks in a row, loaded to capacity, in order to 
accommodate the amount of lead sinkers and jigs that are dumped 
into Canadian waters and rivers every year.  That is the best 
example to typify the problem we are dealing with and the type of 
buy-in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been concern from my Conservative colleague as to 
which particular section or ministry should be enforcing this 
endeavour.  Once again I bow to the Minister of Environment and 
suggest that this is within her purview and not necessarily that 
of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of what enforcement regime we put in place, the 
eventual elimination of lead sinkers and jigs in Canadian waters 
can only be successful if we have Canadians buying into it.  All 
the regulations, all the authorities, everything we put in place 
can only be successful if we embark on a good education program, 
if we have good fact based research in place and we concentrate 
our efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope that tonight's debate and the sharing of 
information, as well as the work that has been done over the past 
several months, will only heighten the level of awareness on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to have the opportunity as the member of parliament 
for Simcoe—Grey to bring forward an initiative that two people 
within in my riding started four or five years ago.  It gives me 
an overwhelming sense of pride to be able to share a message with 
all Canadians that one or two people can make a difference.  If 
people have concerns regarding the environment or any other 
matter, they should bring them forward because there is an 
opportunity to make change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that through the commitment of the Ministry of 
Environment, the Minister of Environment, the parliamentary 
secretary and all other parties that have spoken this evening 
that there is a common desire and goal.  I have no doubt in my 
mind that whether it is in the short or the long term lead 
sinkers and jigs will be eliminated from Canadian waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The time provided 
for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired and the order is dropped from the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 7.39 p.m. the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
2 p.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
